      "book_title":"Snowfall (The Snowfall Trilogy, Book 1)",
      "description":"Snowfall features another sharp-tongued, uncompromising heroine, Catania Olsen. She is the doctor for and spiritual guardian of a band of hunters who live at the edge of a great Wall of ice in what was once Colorado. In the country of the Trappers, books are hand-copied so that knowledge may be preserved, but the technology described in their precious pages is mostly lost to their fur-clad readers, despite Catania's attempts at scientific treatment and the Trappers' careful husbanding of ancient metal tools. As a resurgent population moves west and north from the more settled places that had once been the Eastern Seaboard and Gulf Coast of the United States, they drive tribesmen-Cree, Arapaho, and more-before them. On the run and desperate to find new homes, the tribes slaughter entire populations to claim their lands. The Trappers are innocent of this until Jack Monroe, banished years before for murdering a fellow Trapper, arrives, urging them to flee their ancestral home, the Trappers do not listen until nearly too late, until the first enemy arrows have found their marks. The southern flight of the surviving Trappers is a journey through time as well as space. From a frozen northland where summer lasts two chilly weeks through a burgeoning forest where the Trappers taste their first beef to a gulf coast where warm breezes carry exotic scents and sounds; from a primitive life of hunting and trapping to the luxurious Gardens, where people can still weave and make paper, to a bustling trade mart where man-beasts created by unnatural science tread the dirt streets, Catania is shocked to recognize that the proud Trappers have spent generations clinging to civilization with their fingernails. The journey into the warm lands will change Doctor Catania Olsen, mind, heart, and soul. She will gain and lose a love, see great wisdom and greater folly, witness amazing miracles and terrifying science, and, most surprising to herself, become a mother. Finally, she will have to choose between her people and her freedom. At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",

      "reviews.text":["I have mixed feelings about this novel. On one hand, it has a pretty neat premise: The impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy with Jupiter in 1994 perturbed that planet's orbit imperceptibly, yet just enough to cause gradual climatic change on Earth, and hundreds of years later we are in the grip of a new Ice Age. Cool idea! Yet I'm troubled by the fact that such climate change would necessarily result in the catastrophic setback of science and culture depicted in this book. If the climate change had been accompanied by, for instance, a few good meteor impacts, the tribal existence of the book's protagonists would have been far more plausible. Too many questions are left unanswered here, and \"Snowfall\" is left begging for a sequel.That having been said, I still found this novel quite entertaining. I've always been a sucker for post-apocalyptic sci-fi, although there is precious little sci-fi here. Instead Mitchell Smith has painted a rich picture of a tribal community that calls itself the Trappers, living a tooth-and-nail existence just below the Wall Of Ice that engulfed Canada and the northern half of the United States. Having been forced off their land by tribes that have in turn been forced off THEIR land, the remnants of the Trappers must move south to warmer climes and strange human cultures. There are some memorable, well-drawn characters in this tale, most notably Catania, the tribe's doctor and preserver of ancient medical knowledge. Tribal warfare, sickness and death are portrayed unflinchingly here. The book is divided into short, easily digested chapters, each beginning with an excerpt from Catania's journal. Definitely worth a look if you like books of this genre.","Thanks to Amazon.com I found yet another author that I never heard of but writes a novel that sounded very interesting to me. If you like novels in the grand tradition of William Sarabande's FIRST AMERICANS series, or like post-holocaust adventure stories - then this one's for you!Mitchell Smith's SNOWFALL is a well told tale of an Earth that has gone through another ice age and has taken civilization away, leaving cities such as Chicago, with snowdrifts as high as the tallest skyscrapers. It is never told what exactly happened to the earth, but it is told and hinted to a long, long, time ago as the story is taking place.The story opens with a band known as the Trappers, a small collection of families that united and hunt the frozen tundra of what once was Colorado,I think. Their only link to the past is old journals and books that have been re-copied over and over thru time and they call copybooks.The first chapter starts right off with the hunters of the band getting food for their camp when they are attacked by Cree. The Cree are the modern-day equivalent of indians, but most of their bloodline are white, they have just taken to the old indian ways of survival. As the story goes on, the trappers are being forced out of their hunting grounds and being pushed south, along with all the other tribes from the north, like a dominoe effect. Fighting to keep their land, the trapper's, along with an outcast that comes back named Jack, a losing fight ensues and most of the trappers are decimated and Jack finds himself a leader of a band on the run. The band's head doctor of the tribe is a clorful woman named Catania. Catania is much more than a doctor as the reader finds out as the story unfolds. I thought that this book would not have much action and adventure that I'm partial too, but it had it plenty enough along with lots of interesting characters to keep you glued to each page.The adventures and tragedies that befall the running band of trappers as they flee ever southward is an enjoyable read as the reader see's the changes in the land and it's peoples as the trappers go deeper south. The ending is not what I expected, but it was good nonetheless. It read like an epic movie. I recommend this book to anyone.","Set in the future after the next ice age has destroyed most of civilization, this is a story about Dr. Catania Olsen a member of the Trappers tribe, a group by people living in the North at the edge of the glacial wall. Enough time has passed so that most knowledge has been lost. Civilization is still on the fall. It is a brutal time and life is very hard. Catania's tribe is attacked and forced to move.The tribe meets the Garden people, which live in the forest. There Catania meets the rather extreme one-eyed doctor. Catania must tread carefully with the half-mad woman.I enjoyed this story. It is creative and well thought out. We are not presented a world where humanity bravely steps up to and overcomes a challenge, but where it descends back into darkness and merely strives for survival.An interesting story.","In 1998, humanity learned a cold hard lesson about the interrelationship of the solar system. Comets and fragments hammered Jupiter causing a minute, seemingly statistically insignificant shift in the giant planet's orbit. Insignificant to Jupiter turns out to be colossal to Earth as that almost undetectable shift over two hundred years later has caused a monstrous new ice age on the earth.This wall of ice is so big that almost all of Chicago is buried under it and so wide the North America continent is divided in two. Clans barter, fight, and compete for supremacy in a harsh land. For instance, the Trappers are hunters with some knowledge of the past eke a living in the frozen Colorado Mountains. When barbaric invaders from the north attack, the Trappers flee led by Jack Monroe and Dr. Catania Olsen to the south. They seek peace and domestic tranquilly, but only find a vast wasteland of savageness. Still they keep searching for a better life.SNOWFALL is a great apocalypse tale that uses a real solar event to cause an incredible catastrophe on earth that leads to a deep tale of future survival. The story line is very exciting, as the action never slows down yet readers care about the Trappers, especially the lead duo, whose struggles seem so real. Fans of future dark global calamities will want to revise their short term reading plan by placing Mitchell Smith's tremendous thriller at the top of the to read immediately food chain.Harriet Klausner","A wonderful concept, discussing the possible world after a new Ice Age, is ruined by poor characters.The only character I DIDN'T find myself hating ends up...well, spoilers and all that so never mind.In any case, the vision is quite intriguing, but I found the execution severely lacking and it made for an un-enjoyable read.","When the price for the Kindle Edition is more than 3 times the cost of mass paperback, the publishers need to rethink their strategy. I don't expect the publishers and/or authors not to make a profit, however, the profit should be \"reasonable\".","Life after the fall of western civilization would be rough for sure. You can see that in all gritty realism in this book.I got it two years ago and read a bit of it and then quit reading it for a while. It sort of grossed me out to tell the truth. The author made no bones about describing bodily functions and the like. I liked the general premise of the book, though and I only have about a page left to read. I'm not sure I will continue with the series, because I read an awful lot and the competition for my attention is pretty fierce.If you like Sci-Fi, this may not be for you. The action and entire story takes place after the fall of western civilization and there are very few references to any Sci-Fi subject manner. This reads more like a western novel, I imagine.","Having just now finished reading the book and having scanned reviews ranging from one star to five stars, I feel like I have to weigh in emphatically on the side of those who love this book. If you take what this book is and don't try to compare it to the hordes of nuclear war/EMP/comet crashing post apocalyptic books, this stands on its own as a unique and highly engaging far future story in a world where cities and cars and modern civilization is a distant memory handed down through hand-copied versions of books from the distant past.Whether the Jupiter reference on the opening quote page is actually the cause of the new ice age that is the backdrop for this book is of no relevance, and reviewers who are looking for hard sci-fi may not like it, but its just not meant to be a fact-based future but a \"might-be\" future of hard living in a sparsely populated future where summer is measured in weeks and a mile high glacier stretches right across what was the US lifetimes ago.What Mitchell has done so well is create a whole vernacular and way of life that relates to things we take for granted in almost a religious and mystical way. Phrases and idioms that we use every day are, to them, all learned from the hard earned \"copy-books\" that they trade for and value dearly.I won't recount the story (we all hate spoilers), but having read many fantasy books as well as all the standard post apocalyptic literature from On the Beach to Alas, Babylon to Swan's Song to The Stand, this book was refreshing in that it doesn't rehash the same themes of struggle just after the attack or just after the comet hits or just after the virus strikes. This is the far future, survival in a world that, in its own way, is just being born. What is fascinating here is that their way of life only resembles our way of life in a superficial way, and it feels authentic within the world that the author has created. The lives they live are not like our in many ways at all, and the social fabric, social norms and lifestyle of Snowfall's characters will at turns shock you and then ultimately intrigue you.It is true that there is abundant violence and sexual language, however I think it fits within the books world view. This is a true post apocalyptic book that will give you not only a great read but will also make you laugh at the way these future inhabitants try to understand how we lived our lives without any frame of reference. It is well worth reading.","I was surprised by this book. I really thought it was a kind of pulp post apocalyptic thing, but I usually like that so I got it. It was far deeper and intricate than I anticipated. The characters were not cookie cutter carbons but had interesting fragilities. One moment in the book, where the women of the tribe, spend their last minutes shooting arrows into the enemy as their toddlers stood beside them nearly made me cry. Anyway, for pulp Sci-Fi, it was good. Peace to you.","This is an underwhelming story that leads into a very underwhelming trilogy of stories.In this one we're introduced to characters and themes that only serve to move the story from point A to point B without much more than a cursory examination.The more interesting themes in this book are either mentioned in passing, such as the city of Chicago buried in ice, or disregarded after flirtations, a town of tree-dwellers who want to preserve some knowledge and old time manufacturing.It seems as if half way into writing this novel the author totally got lost or bored of the entire Post-Apocalyptic setting and wanted to come to an easy conclusion just to set up another book where everything is different from this one.In a nutshell, a group of people see their whole tribe slaughtered, flee south, kill some of their own, flee again, get slaughtered some more, until there are so few left the only thing to do is split them up with no resolution and start setting up for the next book.Lazy and uninspired storytelling leads to a lame and uninteresting story using only the themes setup on the dust jacket. I also found the second novel in this series to be worse than this one as a whole, I will not even task myself with attempting the third in the trilogy.","Reminds me more of Fantasy than Post-apocalytic. Lots of GRAPHIC violence in the battle descriptions, not for youngsters or those with \"iffy\" stomachs.","Book 1 of the Snowfall Trilogy brings you to a PA world that avoids many of the usual cliches - no nuclear attack, no mysterious virus that wipes out most of mankind, no zombies (not that I object to any of those, but they HAVE been over-used). Mitchell Smith's frozen world 600 years in the future is engaging, the characters complex and the plot never fails to keep you turning the page (or clicking next page).The next two books only get better, so keep reading!","I tried to like this book. I really did. I normally love post-apocalypse-type stories, and this one looked like a winner. Now, to be fair, the writing was not too bad, and the characters seemed well-drawn.Let me tell you why I got 150 pages in and then threw it down in disgust: The insane overabundance of ellipses. You know, when you see three periods strung together... Once in a while, such a device can add tension, etc. etc. But when you use them (and I'm not joking here) every third or fourth sentence, it quite rudely interrupts the flow of the story. But wait! It gets worse! There were several dozen instances where the author and/or editor apparently felt that just one ellipses wouldn't do. So instead there are two or three strung together, both on the end AND beginning of sentences. ......Kind of like this......Annoying, and ultimately unreadable.","The next Ice Age is upon us: imagine the mile-high cliff of ice at your back, with the Rocky Mountains another impenetrable wall of ice to the west, & people from the east, who once occasionally hunted peaceably on the periphery of your territory, are now intent on taking over your traplines & your caves. Where do you go? Into the great, green forest to the South where the snow ends & monsters dwell?Mitchell Smith has created a whole new future, with particular attention to the anthropological aspects of how we might have made it, what things & thoughts might have survived from the Warm Time.I particularly enjoyed the fully realized heroines & heroes, those who die & those who survive. They have keen insights & eyesights that we, today in our citified lethargy, have long since discarded. Each person could have walked in today's world & felt a glimmer of recognition for us modern folks & our modern nation, except...SNOWFALL is a marvelous, richly-textured adventure that allows us a glimpse of what really might happen when our descendants have to grapple with the inevitable change in the Earth's climate. What will happen to Chicago, for instance, when thousands of feet of snow bury the city? What will happen to our store of knowledge, once electricity is no more? What will happen to our society? Who then will be the readers of what books? What will the doctors know? Who will be our leaders? What kinds of relationships will we have?If you read only one science-fiction/anthropology book this year, read SNOWFALL! Mitchell Smith has written a superb survivalist saga, that lingers in your mind everafter, wondering. It certainly deserves a sequel, for I would dearly love to know how Catania makes it to the Sierras & the snow-bound warrior/hunters who live there.","I love post-apocalyptic books but this one fell short of being the least entertaining. It doesn't even deserve to share the same book shelf as \"The Swan Song\" and \"The Stand\" which are two of my all time favorite end-of-the-world books. It did, however, rank a notch above \"Lucifer's Hammer\" as I at least finished reading it. Needless to say, I won't be purchasing the two sequels to this book."],

      "description":"In 1958, after the death of Pius XII and the unforeseen election of Guiseppe Roncalli as his successor, a revolutionary change began to rock the Catholic Church. Young seminarians who were studying for the priesthood during that time were profoundly affected by the radical changes initiated by Pope John XXIII and also by the often- virulent opposition from other members of the hierarchy. Confessions of a Serial Celibate is the account of one such seminarian whose life was profoundly transformed during those turbulent days. With poignant wit and honesty, the author describes his sometimes painful journey of faith, from the security of rules and dogma, to the ambiguities of social concern, and eventually to the freedom of laughter and detachment. Central to this journey is the author's gradual recognition of what he calls the \"Catholic Operating System,\" that underlying behavioral program which has determined the thoughts and actions of Catholics for the last seventeen hundred years. Anyone who has begun to perceive a discrepancy between organized religion and his or her own spiritual values will find Confessions of a Serial Celibate a stimulating and enjoyable read.",

      "reviews.text":["The depth of the characters and their adventures kept me glued throughout the story.However, it's not really a science fiction story. That is, science does not drive the story--the characters do. And although I was a little surprised with how Book One ended, I still want to see what's next for these characters.","I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from The Coyoteman Chronicles. I knew it was a post-apocalyptic fantasy, but I feared it might be built around some type of shamanism or New Age philosophy that would take precedence over the actual story. I needn't have worried because Las Vegas Rite is truly an enjoyable novel - and a meaningful one. In many ways, it's a coming of age story, its lessons magnified by the fact that the central character's coming of age coincides with his introduction to actual human society (in its post-apocalyptic form). The protagonist's journey outside his very insular world is truly a rite of passage in every sense of the word, and his spirit guide, the Coyoteman, is a source of ancient and mysterious wisdom.It's not entirely clear what happened to human society, but \"The Change\" of eighteen years ago saw virtually all social institutions burst apart at the seams (not surprisingly, the trouble all started in California). Phil, Diana, and their infant son Taine escaped the growing insanity and violence of Pasadena and its nearby environs by heading for the hills; along the way they met a man named Hardin, and it was he who basically established the family unit in a remote location with the means to survive on their own. After Hardin died, the Coyoteman began appearing to young Taine, seemingly as an imaginary friend full of guidance and wisdom. Now eighteen, Taine has decided that the time has come for him to leave the only home he has ever known and see what is out there to be found in the world his parents left behind. The population has been greatly reduced by the sufferings of the past, but the end of civilization had not brought about the end of mankind (although a kind man might now be hard to find). Following the sometimes cryptic advice and warnings of the Coyoteman, Taine works his way to a deserted town ripe for exploring, whereupon he gets his first furtive look at his fellowman. Eventually, he finds his way to Las Vegas, a dangerous place run as a personal fiefdom under the self-appointed King Peter. It is a whole new world for Taine, and he engages himself quite fully in the experience (especially when it comes to Peter's beautiful young charge Veronica, as well as a young revolutionary named Joanne). Still, there is much about this new life that goes against Taine's principals, and Coyoteman still appears from time to time to point his young charge back toward the path of his destiny.Las Vegas Rite is an insightful and almost profound novel punctuated by enigmatic truths that actually energize the events and experiences of Taine's journey. Each chapter in Taine's life serves as an instructive vignette on various themes of an enlightening sort. Through it all, Taine grows into an increasingly noble young man. The taste of sin lingers in his mouth but grows increasingly acrid to him, as his thoughts never stray very far from home.The author's pen name, Canis Latrans, is the scientific term for coyote, and he does seem to stand somewhat apart from mankind. Taking on the spiritual mantle of the coyote (combining Native American spirituality with Zen philosophy), he seeks to offer a unique interpretation of mankind and this thing we call life. The quotes at the beginning of each chapter, the words of the Coyoteman, and a couple of illustrative intermissions all represent the voice of the coyote, if I understand things correctly. This literary device, if I may call it that, really sets this novel apart, making Las Vegas Rite as instructive as it is exciting. You've got to love a novel that succeeds so beautifully on two entirely different levels.","It has been about two decades since Phil and Diana fled the Pasadena area with their infant son Taine as the catastrophe apparently eradicated civilization. They were fortunate to meet up with Harbin when punks killed the man's wife. He took them to his mountain sanctuary where survival became the norm.Encouraged by the Coyoteman, who visits only him, Taine needs to leave to find his mate in what apparently remains of Las Vegas. His father is worried about what his son will find out there while his mother encourages him to do what he must do though she will sorely miss him. The trek for his companion begins with him meeting the first human Ray in Independence besides his parents and the deceased Harbin since he was an infant. However, he also spots some vicious souls who he does not trust. After befriending Ray, Taine heeding Coyoteman continues on, but soon encounters dangerous foes like King Peter and Mendikek, who want to enslave him or kill him. His chances of reaching Vegas seem remote even with Coyoteman to guide him.Mindful of Hiero's Journey, the first Coyoteman tale is a fabulous post-apocalyptic tale. The description above barely touches the action of this action packed science fiction thriller. Taine is a strong protagonist who keeps the tale coherent as he travels a ruined United States; his escapades like opening a can of what he assumes is food provides the perspective of a powerful saga that will have the audience reading this work in one delightful sitting and anticipating further adventures.Harriet Klausner","This is an intelligent, multi-textured book. It's involving, with all the elements of a good story; at the same time causing one to pause occasionally and consider deeper concepts. The author respects his readers' intelligence and avoids overexplaining the many subtle insights and messages tucked away like little treasures within a dramatic tale. The format is fun, and somehow helps prevent us from taking it all too seriously. Coyote slips in and out, speaks in riddles, and is as elusive as some of the ideas he hints at. I especially liked the quote or saying at the beginning of each chapter, which then goes on to somehow comment or elaborate on it. The author has a real talent with words. He \"plays\" them like an expressive musician, and he can describe something mundane in such a way as to truly create the actual experience and sensations of it. He also creates believable and clever dialog. His wry sense of humor adds yet another dimension, and all in all I found this book to be both delightful and thought provoking. I'm very much looking forward to the next book of the series.","Anyone who is interested in excellent science fiction will enjoy this book.. It's well-written and fun to read. I look forward to Book 2 and hope it will appear soon!","A coyote-ish fictional escapade that ranges from realism to fantasy to soft-porn. All the characters, from the hero Taine to the brutish, 'Big Mikey', seem astonishingly real. And unlike a lot of tedious apocalypse stories, this one is more of a voyage of discovery. If I were to criticize anything of this book, it would be that it's too short. I want to know what happens next. But based on the title, I expect I won't have too long to wait."],

      "reviews.text":["This has a real movie feel about it (but from reading other reviews apparently the resulting movie was a bit of a dog).Spoilers warning.It's a relatively short book that does the movie thing of introducing its larger than life action hero, then giving him a quest/adventure building to an obvious climax. In this case our tough as teak bikie is taken out of maximum security, because of his preternatural driving skills, to deliver vital medicine across to the other side of post-apocalyptic US - LA to Boston. Along the way he has to battle mutant animals, fatigue, betrayal, mega-storms, and, in a classic filmic climax, bikie gangs.The mood is able, as is the setting, although the latter isn't really detailed (post apocalyptic has been travelled so frequently these days: we're in the land of Mad Max). Maybe it received some more critical acclaim at the time because it was still original to have an `antihero' - `Hell' Tanner is a brutally unsubtle device in opposition to clean cut good guys. But these days (and then?) he is deep in the land of stereotype that Bruce Willis or Nicholas Cage or Van Damme or any of a number of `wrong-side-of-the-tracks' sullen heroes could be cut from. Zelazny goes way too far with this, contradicting himself totally in his absurd romanticism of the lone bikie justified by his own code and his raw toughness. He casually throws in that he's a rapist and a murderer of innocents to set up the anti-hero, but throughout the book `Hell' only ever does honourable things, getting downright homey and sentimental with a salt of the earth farm family and their kid, and stepping in as the knight to rescue a bikie damsel in distress. He only ever fights in self-defence or to protect others: the anti-hero thing is pure gloss.","Damnation Alley is a book of epic proportions, set in the future. Travel between settlements have become nearly impossible and that is where the true story lies. You are taken on a trip through a typical voyage accross america in a post World War III land. From strange plants, to odd weather shifts makes for a great adventure. This definitly is a must read.","How can you not love a book about the last Hells' Angel forced into making a mission of mercy by making an extended road trip across a scarred and irradiated post-nuclear America?It's brutal and a little dated at times, but if you're a sucker for the post-apocalyptic fiction genre you won't put it down.","Great title, would have been less gripping if it had been called \"Fluffy Kitten Alley\" or \"Slightly Inconvenient Alley\" .. anyway, you know the plot. My copy was ruined by a crappy cover illustration of what appeared to be a fridge on wheels. We all know that the author must have got his inspiration for the vehicle from Captain Scarlets Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle (SPV), the descriptions are almost identical, even the driving positions and steering via TV screen. Obviously, any post apocalyptic novel must either contain the adventures of some sort of alternate religious cult or mutants/bikers. Roger sticks to the latter, safer territory. Lots of mutants. Some bikers. No mutant bikers though. I always thought that it was annoying that the 2 parts of the US MOST likely to be destroyed in a war (the North East and LA/San Francisco) were the 2 ends of \"The Alley\". It might have been more believable to make it Washington State to Florida or something like that. The ending is pretty cool though, and one of the best written parts of the book. All in all, its a pulpy badly aged bit of not terribly intelligent PA sci-fi, but its good fun and would have made a good film in its own right. Possibly with Kurt Russell.","A post-apocalyptic action story. A criminal is given the standard two choices, really bad things now, or very very possible really bad things later, and, of course, takes the later.The later in this case is a trip across the country to deliver vital medical supplies. He has a few more problems than the standard cracked by snow and ice cheapish US highways though. In this world, they don't call it Damnation Alley for nothing.","This is expanded from a longish short story, and of course was made into that AWFUL movie, but it is a very fun read and really has that early Zelazny sense of a very strange world.","Being a fan of the movie, the novel was eagerly read- Good storyline,but a little anticlimatic and muddled twoards the end. Still, I recommended it as a good read.","This is weaker Zelazny, which makes it better than most novels. If you are looking for a book that has action with out sacrificing literary skill this book is for you.","An apocaliptic book by one of ameriacas best SF and Fantasy writers.

I cant say enough how much I enjoyed this book.","This would have been a decent book if the reading level hadn't have been for 4th graders or if the color scheme used by Zelazny was suitable for 5 year old's. Even the general plot is fairly juvenile, obviously targeted towards teen-aged males. And what better way to sell cigarettes to teenagers than to advertise smoking in a sci-fi novel targeted towards teenaged boys? This book must have been paid for by the tobacco industry, as there is a sheer ridiculous amount of chain smoking involved (nearly on every page).Zelazny didn't put much thought into the post-apocalyptic plot, besides the lame midwestern monsters. There seems to be ample cigarettes in an America in economic collapse, as is there plenty of coffee and other items difficult to obtain (eggs, meat, etc). In my opinion, this book was just one big tobacco advertisement with little or no imagination.","I read this book after watching the movie as a kid, and reading all the bad reviews. I have to say I quite liked it, the character is much different than george peppard in the movie and I like the spiffy new cover.","Hell Tanner has never got anything. He gives a rat's what others want. The fumes of the exhaust pipes of his Harley Davidson is all anybody will get from him. He's the last Hell's Angel. In this post-nuke wastelands of US he got an offer. A complete pardon of all his past and future crimes if he would be willing to ride across the country in a gauntlet, armored 8 wheel vehicle, from Los Angeles to Boston. To bring a plague antidote for the surviving people. The convoy, motored group of 3, is sent across by land; to battle huge mutant insects, packs of survivors turned violent and feral, and brutal electrical storms that savage the already barren plains, to ravel through the desolate post-nuke wastelands.Damnation Alley takes place in a post-apocalyptic nuclear war where most of the earth has been destroyed. Only a few pockets of humanity exist in Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and Boston. Tanner's experience as a smuggler makes him the best driver available. Tanner believes in impression but somewhere deep down he has something good. The reader is supposed to believe that Tanner changes during the trip just by psychoanalyzing his own thoughts. The narrative is mostly done through Tanner's eyes how he fights giant gila monster, bats, snakes. In a stop or two he meets a crazy biologist, warm surviving family who offer him a little rest in the long journey and Cornelia, a girl from a motorbike gang he had to slaughter. If Tanner is not talking to himself, he has his co-driver Greg, a Native American who's brains he trashed against the cockpit (at halfway of the book), or Cornelia (at the end of book), who gets killed just before they arrive to Boston. At the end City declares Tanner a hero and a statue is erected for him. Tanner isn't around to see these; he has split in the desert.One (1) star. Written in 1969 the year of theEasy Riderroad movie. The story resembles remarkably the movie; iced only with plague antidote delivery. The ramblings of bearded Tanner, who smokes in chain and kills without a second thought, takes a woman, present straight male-macho ideals put on words. The road ride is predictable and descriptions of the surroundings occupy most of the book. With the initial setting, in this radioactive hellhole, there could have been lots of possibilities but unfortunately all the terrain is abridged to monsters and the Road. The few encounters with the isolated people on the way are probably used for break effect in this otherwise monotonous trip diary. Indifferent read.","Well, this one was a fun, quick read, but kind of dissapointing, really. I mean, I expected a bit more. Instead I got drive a little fight a giant mutant bug, drive some more and fight more mutant critters, drive some more and... you get the picture, but it was still fun.","Well this book was a quick read. Punctuated with Zelanzy's usual lean prose.THe plot is quite simple and basic, A con is given the chance to save half of a Post Apocalyptic Nuclear Torn USA.Basic setup for a bad dude to redeem himself.Well this book is quite short, and in all honesty not to bad. It was fun, but its quite forgetable.In the end I would definetly recomend reading something more worthwhile, even Zelanzy has done better than this.","\"The savage classic that inspired the apocalyptic hit science fiction film!\" says the ad blurb.Well, the ad blurb at least got the first part right, eh?However, if it wasn't for the dank 1977 movie and its groovy armored RV, this early Zelazny novel might be languishing out of print. Fourteen years before _The Road Warrior_, another ballsy loner in leather zooms the wastelands of a post-apocalyptic world, one that has gone insane with lurid pulp nasties like giant gila monsters, big snakes, super bats, storms that dump debris from the sky, and roving motorcycle gangs (gotta have those). Our hero, Hell Tanner, carries a shipment of life-saving serum to beleaguered Boston, and the hard-bitten man transforms through his struggles to genuinely care about the survival of the cursed world. The slow transformation never becomes clich&eacute; or silly, especially since Zelazny constantly throws a smorgasbord of action at Tanner's armored fortress-car.A few avant-garde sequences throw the book off kilter, but otherwise the hard-boiled fury of this adventure carries you quickly to the finale.","This is an interesting book-- different in some ways from other Zelazny novels. The narrative was less polished than most of his other work. I read this novel on a Greyhound going through some of the area that the story takes place in. I can see why this was made into a film. It has a sort of visual quality, but I never really felt the character was in much danger, or even really challenged, until the encounter with the bikers at the end. Still, the post-apocalyptic road trip across America was intriguing if not gripping. Sort of an On the Road/Art of Motorcycle Maintenance for SF fans. The first thought I had when encountering Hell Tanner was that this must have been the direct inspiration for Snake Pliskin, and that this book (or the 1977 movie) must have been an inspiration for the movie Escape from New York. There are many similarities-- too many for coincidence. It is entertaining, and Hell Tanner is a solid character, far nicer than he believes himself to be. Like all Zelazny novels, my major complaint is that this one is too short. One question I'd like to throw out is that at the end, the &quot;three days&quot; was mentioned, as well as the islands maybe having survived them. Does that mean this is somehow connected to This Immortal?","After a nuclear war most of North America has become a wasteland known as 'Dammnation Alley'. Hell Tanner, the last surviving Hells Angel and due to die for rape, murder, extortion, etc. is given the choice of delivering a vital vaccine to a plague ridden city or being executed.Zelazny writes a imaginitive and hard edged thriller filled with vivid imagery. I suspect that Hell Tanner was the inspiration for 'Escape From New York' Snake Plisken and its a pity that Jack Smight's film was just a dilute interpretation of the original. I am surprised it hasn't been re-published.","This novel is an absolute classic portrayal of near future but post apocalypse Earth. It is set in a US in which what remains of the population is confined largely to the coasts and separated by a wild and dangerous interior. When the population on the East coast is threatened by a deadly disease, the only hope is for a medical supplies to be transported overland. The book follows one man, unreformed biker Hell Tanner who sets out to cross the badlands.As a setting for a novel this is not very promising. However, the author brings a huge amount of invention and narrative skill to bear and the result is a page turner. Of course, you know from the start that Hell Tanner will reluctantly accept the assignment and that he will face almost certain defeat on the way.Despite that knowledge, you want to keep reading this book because the story is just so well put together. For me, one of the marks of a really good book is the vividness of the images that it creates in my head. By that test, this book was very good indeed.If you like SF adventure stories, then track down a copy of this book and you will not be disappointed.","Sometime after a nuclear apocalypse, there are two nations left in the former U.S. (perhaps in the world); the nations of California and Boston. All the rest is a wasteland of radioactivity, mutant beasts, super storms and violent gangs, known as Damnation Alley.Word comes that a plague has struck Boston. California sends a group of their best drivers across Damnation Alley to deliver vaccine. To lead this group, they shanghai Hell Tanner: criminal, the last Hell's Angel and the best damned driver they have.This was my first Roger Zelazny novel and it wasn't what I expected. The writing was quirky and more literary than I was expecting, given the pulpy storyline and the workman-like writing in so much old sci-fi. The post-apocalyptic setting, lack of details about the causes of the war and unspecified year of the story kept the book from feeling particularly dated (except for thelate-sixties fascination with the Hell's Angels).So I liked the writing (enough that I will pick up other books by Zelazny), but overall I thought the book was only so-so. For the bulk of the book, though we hear what a terrible place Damnation Alley is, it just doesn't seem so dangerous.Once Hell reaches the Eastern Seaboard he is constantly being harassed by raiders (and this section was very well done), but the previous days' driving across the country seemed almost mellow in comparison. I think maybe the book would have benefited a little from a couple of extra chapters and a few more travails.Still, even though I think the book is flawed, it is worth a read. It helped spark a whole sub-genre of post-apocalyptic fiction, as I'm pretty sure Walter Jon WilliamsHardwired, movies likeDoomsdayand theMad Maxseries and game worlds likeGamma WorldandDark Futurewere all at least partly inspired by this book.","Hell Tanner, the last of the Hells Angels, gets a pardon from the Nation of California - if he takes plague vaccine from Los Angeles to Boston. To make it, though, he has to go through Damnation Alley -- what's left of America after a nuclear war. It's a land of giant critters, volcanoes, biker gangs, and storms that drop boulders out of the sky. Along the way, murdering, pimping, thieving Tanner decides he may just like to have a go at being a hero ...This is a fast-paced, very enjoyable adventure story told in prose colorful in every sense of the word. Zelazny himself preferred the shorter novella version. He was right. The added bits about life in plague-ridden Boston don't add much and a poetic, impressionistic section on the source and circulation of the winds that plague the world breaks up the pacing and tone. And, needless to say, there's little in the way of plausible science. Still, those are minor blemishes, and the story is worth reading in either version.","When I read this I was struck by the similarities between the deal offered to Hell Tanner to run the serum thru Damnation Alley to a plague stricken Boston in order to recieve a full pardon for every criminal act he's committed in the Nation of California...hmmm. That sounds alot like the deal offered to Snake Plissken, who seems to share alot of other similarities with Hell Tanner, who admittedly came first in 1969. I have no way of knowing whether or not John Carpenter or Nick Castle read the Zelazny book by the time they wrote Escape from New York but it wouldn't surprise me at all. Being a big fan of Plissken's exploits I can't help but like this pulpy sci fi novel. With a few very slight changes someone could easily adapt this into the 3rd Snake Plissken movie!!!! (Why am I not a Hollywood hot shot with clout, power, influence? Oh yeah, my ambition is handicapped by laziness.)There is nothing on earth that could make the awful 1977 film adaptation worthwile. It has about zero to do with the book, which is filled with great twisted post-apocalyptic imagery: giant bats and scorpions and other fantastic beasties and tornado winds whipping great hunks of concrete and other unhealthy materials thru the malestrom that is \"the Alley.\" And the Land-Master that Tanner drives is super-cool in a James Bond/Speed Racer way; it has flame throwers and grenade launchers and all sorts of buzz saw hub cap weapons.Very cool.","In 1969, Roger Zelazny took a short story he had written two years earlier and expanded it into a full novel.Written ten years before the release of the first Mad max film, lovers of the post-apocalyptic road trip genre will find themselves in familiar territory that most believe first started when Mel Gibson first took to the screen.But before there was Mad Max, there was first Hell Tanner and they are certainly twin brothers of different mothers.In a United States devastated by a nuclear war, Hell Tanner is given an offer he can't refuse: to drive the ultimate survivalist car from Los Angels to Boston to deliver a desperately needed vaccine. Along the way, he encounters rogue motorcycle gangs, monster-sized Gila Monsters, monster-sized bats, killer dust devils and a host of other challenges.Not Zelazny's best, yet for pulp readers who enjoy tales of the end of the world as we know it, the read is entertaining though it will not stand up to hard questioning, for instance, where is everybody getting their gasoline?","I adore Zelazny, and this is one of his easiest reads, imho. It is also a story that was made into a horrible, horrible film. I know the author was disappointed in the movie as well. Read the book! Great, flawed hero! Monsters! Lives at stake! Chase scenes! Redemption!","I read this as a kid. I remember really liking it but not much else.This Is a reread. I couldn't remember details so I reread it to reaffirm my 4 star rating. The rating stands. I enjoy Post-apocalyptic stories and the different paths they can follow. This is post nuclear and leans toward some of the scifi effects of radiation: lingering hot-pockets, mutations, altered weather, etc.The US is split into different nations with most of the population on either coasts. The middle is essentially a dead no-mans land called Damnation Alley. Planes can't fly, the land roams with mutant animals and deadly weather, and the is no radio communication."],

      "reviews.text":["Aptly subtitled &quot;After the fall of humanity&quot;, this tale is predictably dark. Humanoid aliens have invaded Earth, travelling in vast, intimidating arachnoid vehicles, causing the remnant population of Earth to take refuge in underground shelters. The protagonist is Esther, who breaks the unwritten law and braves the surface world. The result is a good, if rather depressing, story. Fans of Lee and of dark, post-apocalyptic fiction will want to check it out.","In this stand-alone novel, Lee explores an earth which has been decimated by invading aliens. The surviving humans are forced underground to live their lives the best that they can.Generations after they went to earth, a young girl named Esther defies what seem to her like useless laws forbidding them to go to the surface. When her tell-tale tan gives her away, she is taken to the leader of their community and her real adventure begins...The apocalypse is a convenient vehicle for one of the favorite Lee themes-- the value of the strong and contrary individual will. Esther is able to overcome all obstacles simply by believing in herself and refusing to accept false goals as an end state. While Esther herself is a very well-drawn character, the plotting suffers from its nearly exclusive focus on her stubborness. The aliens are sketchily plotted, nearly to the point of total invisibility. The ending is very poor and reads as though Lee ran out of steam.The book will probably appeal to the teenage reader (particularly the teenage girl?). However, parents should note that there are several reasonably graphic sex scenes, including some non-consensual sex. It should be fine for the older teenager, but should not be confused with a book suitable for a YA audience. If you have not read Lee before, I would recommend beginning with the Flat Earth series in place of this novel.","&quot;Days of Grass&quot; is a shorter novel, but it packs a real punch. The storyline is dark, with enough twists and turns to keep your eyes glued to the page. The first half of the book is excellent. I found Esther a very headstrong and original character, and I think Tanith does a perfect job of making her characters as different and strange as possible. Her writing style is fantastic.The second half of the book is a bit slower through the turns, as it is the darker half of the book. While the ending was most definetly shocking, I found it a bit of a dissapointment, because I felt more should have happened... yet I would most definetly recommend this book to any reader of Tanith Lee or other readers that prefer darker fantasies or sci-fi.","The novel was engrossing and it caught and held my attention. But the book lacked a good heroine since Esther didn't actually do anything amazing. She was just a little adventurous and appealing to all Invaders.","No spiritual experience like the Flat Earth, but I was won over by Esther's determination &amp; vulnerability. A reminder of our humanity."],

      "reviews.text":["In an age where misinformation has spread to epidemic proportions, where the issues of peak oil and environmental collapse are addressed by the creation of hybrid SUVs, and where technology has quietly invaded and altered every aspect of human life, books like Extinction Journals are more important than ever. Despite all of today's problems (a looming conflict with Iran, celebrity antics, etc.), it's still possible to find hope for a solution. And yeah, constructing a cockroach suit to survive nuclear fallout isn't exactly a solution, but it does shed some light on the utter absurdity of our current dilemmas. As Dean, the novella's protagonist, says, \"One day you go to bed happy. The next day your dad dies. In a stupid, stupid way.\"Later, after Dean encounters a woman who also owes her life to insects, we eventually come to learn that as devastating as the planet's destruction might be, it doesn't have to be all misery and loneliness. Even when just about every living thing has been annihilated, there still exists a potential for new life. In this case, that new life might turn out to be far stranger than any Darwinist can conceive.A few have pointed out that Extinction Journals isn't perfect, and upon first reading, it did feel too rushed toward the end. After reading it again, this was far less of an issue. As is the case with many short novels, characters aren't always fully fleshed out, but the re-read demonstrated that this isn't necessarily detrimental to the book either.If you're looking for a fresh, freakishly funny read, look no further than Extinction Journals. Your inner insect won't regret it.","\"Extinction Journals\" is a hair raising journey through a post-apocalyptic United States.The narrator survives a nuclear holocaust with the help of an intricate cockroach suit he builds. Early on, he meets the president of the United States, an idiot who caused the war, and he kills him. He also meets another survivor who managed to survive with the help of an ant colony and who is now the queen of that colony.The writing is gripping and the characters are unique. I was hooked and wished the book was longer (it's a little over 80 pages long). Johnson's imagination is vivid and inventive.","\"Extinction Journals\" is a novella that mutated from a short story, according to its author, Jeremy Robert Johnson. This insect-sized gem of bizarro fiction features Dean, who survives a nuclear war thanks to his suit of living cockroaches, and a little supernatural assistance from a manmade god named Yahmuhwesu.The story takes place in the blasted and scarred remains of the U.S., which is the ironic setting for Dean's enlightenment. His father's death put his life on hold. The challenge of surviving nuclear devastation forces him to live again.Brought to us from Swallowdown Press, the book itself is like a wonderful bug: charming on the outside, with its petite size and fabulous cover art; icky on the inside, with its strange typesetting, particularly of dashes. The extra pages at the end have been put to good use, hawking other bizarro books, including Johnson's \"Angel Dust Apocalypse.\" That one's going on my to-be-read list, now that I've had a taste of Johnson's peculiar and witty word stylings.\"Extinction Journals\" is a fast read and a good introduction to the bizzaro genre for those who care to delve into it and can endure the inevitable thoughts of crunching cockroach carapaces that will echo in their minds after the last page has been turned.","Jeremy Robert Johnson, whose work I was first introduced to via the excellent short story collection \"Angel Dust Apocalypse\", has once again created exciting new fiction which, quite literally, shows no boundaries. With \"Extinction Journals\" Johnson has taken the concept which first appeared as a short story in ADA and turned it into an original, very satisfying short novel of just over 100 pages. The plot is extraordinarily fresh and innovative, and the images range from clever, to funny, to frightening. Really, you couldn't ask for anything more in a book which you will read in one sitting. It is entertaining, yet still maintains the ever present iceberg theory that more lies underneath the surface.Johnson's work continues to amaze me, and it also gives me hope for the new world of literature that is on the horizon. I hope to see JRJ standing over the trembling body of the old literary guard with his Liston knife in hand, and, with a flash of the blade, signal the dawning of a new era in the written word.","One reviewer felt that the author got bored with the story and rushed the ending. If there is one thing that you can learn by reading bizarro (and related genres) it is to be prepared for the unexpected. Things don't always end like you'd expect them to. What seems rushed may just be an unpredictable way for the author to conclude the story. Is that a cop out? Maybe sometimes.. but in this case, no. Any writer will tell you that many times the path that they had expected the story to go.. often changes. The story often writes itself.. the characters do things that are unexpected..even to the author.Well, now to EXTINCTION JOURNALS. This is the follow-up to the short story that was in the collection ANGEL DUST APOCALYPSE. It concerns the end of civilization thanks to an idiot president (remember, folks. this is fiction! hmph). Nuclear war comes and there are minimal survivors. One is a man who fashioned a suit covered in cockroaches. Awesome idea.The novella moves from post-apocalyptic nightmare to bizarro insect-related action. Oh and if you like insectian themes.. look no further.So, if you like weird fiction about the post-apocalyptic world... check this out.","Right from the beginning, I was drawn in. It was an original story, and so creative. I loved the idea of the cockroach and twinkie suits. The two things that would survive the apocalypse. Maybe the president should have used stale twinkies? I loved it! His internal thoughts, and even the sparse dialogue with the other few survivors, were seamless and I really just fell into the story. The ending was pretty quick to come, but I think I sort of realized about fifty pages in, that the book was more of a short story. There was no real climax that I noticed (aside from the attack of the army ants..), and I believe it could have been so much more if more of Dean's past had been explored, figure out more about the father he so obviously missed. I wanted to know more about why he made the suit, why other people did. I got a vague idea that the world knew the nuclear holocaust was imminent, but still. It was a very interesting idea. It probably wouldn't have felt the same if Dean was too informed, too lucid, but I do miss the details. The only drawback was when he met Mave. I was so disappointed in how the book ended. I wanted to love it, I tried to, but the last ten pages just didn't do anything for me. The ant debacle turned a great book, into a silly one. Though I believe the author is very talented. I felt serious similarities between his voice and Chuck Palahniuk, which is always a plus for me. Just bought his other two books, and can't wait to get started.","Cockroaches and Ants and Nukes! Oh, my! This is definitely not a read for Twinkies. Nor is it for folks who are easily bugged (though the certifiably buggy will have a field day). It may encroach on your sensibilities and antagonize your digestion.If this is the way the world tries to off itself, I might as well cut and leave right now. This is a quick read and not a bit sluggish or boring. I really liked it and my friend Katy did, too.Time flies and my wife is telling me I must quit. OK Honey .... (psst - read this, you'll get a real buzz!)","This is a strange, strange book. Strange like Bosch, de Cosimo and Dadd. Strange in a good way.The book opens at the Washington Monument, where the cockroach-covered suit that saved Dean (our hero) from the nuclear holocaust is eating the president. Who is wearing a Twinkie-covered suit. After finally prying his suit away from the president's body, Dean begins his frankly bizarre trip across what's left of the United States. On the way, he meets something very like a god, but more confused, a man wearing someone else's skin and, finally, Mave, who is the queen of an ant colony.The books at a headlong pace, crashing through its short, weirdly sweet narrative with the force of an \"Indiana Jones\"-style boulder. Dean's trek across the nuclear wasteland of America is lonely and brutal, but even though he is becoming closer to his cockroach suit, he refuses to allow himself to sink too far. In these respects, the book is good -- extreme and \"out there,\" yes, but not to the extent that it becomes unpleasant. And it's funny.But there are a few problems. Despite the fact that the bulk of the novel is spent with Dean and Dean alone, the reader leaves the book feeling that he is still largely unknown, or not quite present. His acceptance of the new state of the world is so easy, he seems to be almost in a state of shock. And while he does have a few exhcanges with other characters, these also feel somehow sterile -- as if everyone's still a bit off and their personalities haven't had a chance to kick in yet.But overall, it's a very good book, and one of the better representatives of the Bizarro genre that I've encountered. I'd recommend it to those wishing to read more in this fascinating genre.And to anyone who ever thought Gregor Samsa didn't have it so bad, after all.","I couldn't ask for a better introduction to the bizarro genre. It's a hundred page book heavy with actional-packed nuclear fun, sentient insect squads and a shimmering god summoned by the prayers of the now-dead. So inspiring, I wrote a song based off of it for my band.","Jeremy Robert Johnson's Extinction Journals begins with a true bizarro scenario: a man in a suit made of cockroaches accidentally devours the president, who is dressed in a suit made of twinkies. But by the end of the book, being dressed in a suit of cockroaches almost seems normal.As the protagonist wanders through the bizarre, surreal landscape of post-apocalyptic America, he encounters other \"survivors,\" other people who saw what was coming and prepared: a woman in steel-toed boots and an iron apron, a man encased in cement, a man wearing his neighbor's skin. The images in the book are sometimes serene, and other times haunting and nightmarish.Its only fallback: the end of the book seems very rushed. It feels like a lot more should have been discussed, that there was a longer life to the story than is written. But despite the odd pacing, Johnson's prose is graceful and clear and the book, up to the sweet, hopeful ending, is a brilliant read and well worth your time.","Basically its a handful of creative little sequences thrown together. Would recommend it highly if it wasfleshed out into an actual novel. If you can find it cheap, go for it.","really interesting concept, a man in a suit made of cockroaches roaming about after what appears to be a nuclear houlocast, but it was too short for my taste. i wish it had more of a tale and that the conflict wasnt resolved in (seriously) 4 pages. had alot of potential left untap, but since this was a continuation to a short story in \"angel dust apocalypse\" i dont suppose it was meant to be more than another short story with the same character.","this bizzaro book will keep you reading and you can finish it easyily within an hour or so. coat of cockroaches eating the president and talking to the rapture about what to do next now that no one is left. cool read, better get a couple of more because this one wont last long","So this book was not quite what I imagined. A very short little novel, about the end of the world, and surviving by wearing a suit made from roaches. I like strange, but even to me this was out there. Just not for me, I could have easily skipped it.","I've read Jeremy Robert Johnson's earlier work and, though while I've found many of his stories very entertaining, his writing remains bland at best. His style has no real spark to it and reads like a million other things out there. I was hoping that he could improve a little on this with his latest work, Extinction Journals. While his ideas remain fresh as ever, his writing remains unchanged. Also, while the story begins out strong with many possible directions it could go, halfway through it seems like he grew bored with the current story and rushed toward the ending. That's why I only give this three stars and I recommend reading Extinction Journals because I still haven't lost all my faith in JRJ quite yet. Hopefully future works will show much more promise.","Absolute rubbish. I can't understand the positive reviews and multiple stars. This book had no story line and no ending. I feel sorry for the tree that was cut down to make this waste of time. What's worse, I actually ordered this book from a store and am unable to return it. It will definitely be sold at my next garage sale.The main character has no depth whatsoever and the plot goes no where painfully slowly. The idea of creating a suit to withstand the end of the world actually had potential, but tragically this novel does not work.","This is hilarious. The satire in this novelette is biting & caustic as it should be. You don't have to be an ikthyologist to enjoy the level of \"racism\" displayed by the bugs as they connect to the humans. Are we really so small minded, the readers are forced to ask themselves. The answer should be obvious.","Like Jeremy Robert Johnson, I seem to have a fascination with the apocalypse. Thus Extinction Journals slots into the bookshelf alongside J.G. Ballard's Hello America, Denis Johnson's Fiskadoro, Jonathan Lethem's Amnesia Moon. Phiip K. Dick's Dr Bloodmoney and Cormac McCarthy's The Road. As a stylist he's not up there with Ballard or McCarthy but Journals is a rip-roaring read infused with both dread and humor. If I have a complaint it is simply that it is too damn short.","...is the life of a man wearing twinkies meets a man wearing a suit of cockroaches. It warmed my heart to read who got eaten. (You must buy the book to find out.) JRJ has become THE author to watch on my 'authors-to-watch' list. This was my first contact with his work, and I've read it at least four or five times since. I've loaned it out to friends (it's on loan as I write this review, as a matter of fact,) and I've told nearly everyone I know who would be interested in this book. So, I'm telling you, too. Buy it!PS-The fact that he is closely associated with The Mars Volta is synchronicity at its best for me as well.","A truly original story, from a fresh voice in fiction. A must-read for any readers looking for something new.","\"Extinction Journals\" picks up where the \"The Sharp Dressed Man At the End of the Line\" leaves off. For those of you unfamiliar with that story, it can be found in Mr. Johnson's short story collection, \"Angel Dust Apocalypse.\" Without giving too much away, we meet Dean in the last days before World War III, a young man who believes that he can survive the aftermath of a nuclear war if he's wearing a suit made of cockroaches. As the story ends, Dean is proved correct.\"Extinction Journals\" follows Dean around as he makes his way through the nuclear bomb ravaged wasteland of what was once the USA. He struggles to find food and water, all the while wondering if his \"suit\" will, out of desperation and hunger, turn on him. Along the way, he meets a new god, borne out of mankind's collective unconscious. Neither Dean nor the reader is sure whether or not he's hallucinating, but considering he just survived a nuclear war we have to give him some leeway.Ultimately, Dean meets other entomologically enlightened individuals who are struggling to put some sense to this brave new world. At that point, they must decide how life will exist, post-humanity, or if it will exist at all.JRJ has a knack for characterization, even if those characters are a bit twisted. Dean is a nice enough guy, but one has to really be out there to conceive of fashioning a suit out of cockroaches in order to survive a nuclear war. And JRJ's descriptions of the nuclear wasteland are convincingly real, making you shudder (and question Dean's desire to live to see it).The story was way too short. While readers don't need to be familiar with the short story that preceded this novella, it definitely helps. Adding it as a preface, while driving up the publishing costs, would have enhanced the reading experience for new readers of JRJ's work.I also had a feeling of repetition between Dean's encounters. It was as if he were stumbling upon the same old irradiated buildings he wandered into earlier.Lastly, I was hoping for more of an exploration of the relationship between Dean and his suit. I really couldn't get the sense that the symbiosis between man and roach was evolving until the very end. Maybe evolution itself works like that. Rather than gradual changes, we get abrupt \"do or die\" situations.While I enjoyed this book, I feel that, for the reasons stated above, it falls a little short of JRJ's previous works. Newcomers should pick up his earlier works first before coming here. Fans of JRJ's work will still want to add this to their collections.","This was the first book by Jeremy Robert Johnson I ever read, and it made me a fan.There's been a nuclear holocaust and Dean believes he is the lone survivor. Of course there's a lot of radiation around, so Dean needs to protect himself from the environment by wearing a suit of living cockroaches. This makes for a pretty surreal existence, but author Johnson grounds the story with Dean's ruminations on lonliness, and his quest for connection in this burned out world.He eventually finds a companion- a woman who has survived with the help of her suit of living ants. They also meet an alien god thing, and someone who doesn't wish them well at all. For all its weirdness, it's a very humane story about a cataclysmic ending and a strange new birth. It's savage and crazy and also touching and emotional.I recommend this book to adventurous fans of science fiction that want to take a journey outside the box.","This book was written as a follow up to a short story published inAngel Dust Apocalypse. I purchased it a few months ago and kept putting it aside, I found it in my bookcase last week and am so glad with my choice. Another off-beat page turner by Johnson. A little more sci-fi than I was expecting, but I give extra props to his sense of humor with the book's post-apocolyptic setting. Overall a fun short read for someone looking for something different!","Take the old adage, \"Only cockroaches will survive a nuclear war\", and build a unique, hilarious, disturbing, and surreal apocalypse story around it. That is what Jeremey Robert Johnson has done. Interesting from beginning to end, Johnson's 'Extinction Journals' takes you on a strange but thought provoking ride through a nuclear wasteland and though I enjoyed the book very much, I feel, as many other reviewers have stated, that this story had so much more potential for a fully engrossing sci-fi drama but fell a little short. That aside, I can still appreciate the work and always wish for more. Highly Recommended!!","If you're looking for a quick tasty treat, go for this. I figured that armageddon would be sad, but I forgot how funny it would be. Plus, politicians get what they deserve.","It's one thing to be weird. Anyone can do it. Except maybe Will Smith or Ben Affleck. They are both just too damn white. However, it is a whole other thing to be weird and make it entertaining, enthralling even. Few people can take a suit of cockroaches, God (maybe), and an ant queen (kind of), throw them into a post apocalyptic setting and have it form a consistently entertaining AND coherent whole. Johnson does just that. Bravo, sir, bravo.","Extinction Journals is probably the most creative tale to come out of this recent explosion of post-apocaylptic literature. Did you like the heart in The Road by Cormac Mccarthy? Well this story has plenty of heart and a survival suit constructed of cockroaches that has plenty of sci-fi authors scratching their heads and wondering why they didn't think of it first.In this tale Dean and his suit of cockroaches make a weary trek across a post-apocaalytic American wasteland. Dean struggles to find food for himself as well as for his suit and encounters exsitential lonliness all along the way. He also encounters people who had similiar ideas for suits including, the president in a Twinkie suit, someone wearing a suit of cinder blocks, and black guy wearing other people's skin, to name a few. None of these suits really worked so well. He eventually meets a woman with a similiar suit made of insects. The ending is a surreal and hopeful one for not only the audience, but the protagonist as well, considering the hopelessness he faced along his journey.Jeremy Robert Johnson is a great writer and a figurehead in the Bizarro scene. I'm personally looking forward to reading more from him.","Visceral. Weird. Cerebral. Unique. Bizarre. No, you can't pick just one because this book is all of them and more. Do you want to read great science fiction? This book is for you. Are you an academic looking for an entertaining deconstruction/critique of society's relationship with deities and with itself? Buy this right now. Is bizarro the genre that toots your horn? Extinction Journals has to be in your collection or you can't say you like the genre. Are you tired of the bland, talentless writers flooding the market nowadays? Don't fret: Jeremy Robert Johnson is here to rescue you with a short blast of top-notch literature.Extinction Journals tells the story of Dean, a man who survived the nuclear holocaust thanks to a customized business suit he coated in cockroaches. With everyone else dead, Dean is forced to deal with his loneliness, fear, beings coming down from the sky and the physical effects of a radiated atmosphere. As if all that wasn't enough, the cockroach suit, which Dean has to take care of when it comes to water and food, starts developing a collective mind of its own.JRJ's prose is brutally poetic, technically impressive, and wildly entertaining. The only flaw you'll find in this tome is its length. You'll want much more of Johnson's work when you're done with this, so go ahead and buy We Live Inside You as well. You won't regret it.","Extinction Journals by Jeremy Robert Johnson is a very cool post-apocalyptic piece of bizarro fiction. It's about this guy named Dean who makes himself a suit of cockroaches. This enables Dean to be one of the few who survive the nuclear holocaust that follows.Dean meets some other strange people in his ruined world. He meets (and his suit eats) the President, who survived by wearing a suit made out of Twinkies. Then he meets Yahmuhwesuh, who is an avatar of the collective unconsciousness that has been incarnated as a result of the nuclear destruction. Somehow, Yahmuhwehsus gives Dean the ability to communicate with his roaches, and Dean sets out on a journey for survival.I really enjoyed this one. It's a great, exciting read. And it's funny, which is always a plus with me. While I really loved it, I will point out that it is contained in The Bizarro Starter Kit (Orange), which is actually cheaper than the individual volume, so it would probably be better to get that instead.","In a much cooler high school than one I've gone to, Jeremy Robert Johnson's,Extinction Journalswould be required reading in Biology 101.Who is Dean? He is one of very few survivors in the post apocalyptic D.C. area, and he relies solely on his suit of cockroaches to keep him alive and unaffected by the radiation that threatens him. A little self-deprecating and surprisingly very level-headed despite his ever- constant nagging conscious, Dean should consider himself a hell of a lot better off than he thinks he is.As Dean begins to gain confidence, encountering along the way compassion, love, and a uniquely powerful foe, JRJ's writing alternates between strange, yet witty and humorous, and tender, due oddly to some highly evolved insects. He dissects the basic view of the human condition and inserts the primitive, rather other-worldly nature of a different species, fusing a vision that is at first frightening and then harmonious.At first I stumbled a bit over JRJ's usage of words separated/by/a/forward/slash that dotted the prose, yet I came to understand it as an important and distinctive concept for the journal. Not having read anything else by JRJ, I don't know if this is a usual trait or used only in the Journals. Either way, it seems to say that one word would not do, and to find that it is thrown in sparingly made me anticipate it happening again.Somewhat strange and riddled with over-powering elements of doom,Extinction Journalsis a random thought-provoking, highly intelligent read.","A man traveling through an apocalyptic landscape by way of his custom, living cockroach suit, after said suit has devoured the President? Sold! Armed with that information, you probably already know whether or not this is something you want to read. A great intro to Bizarro fiction.","You like it surreal ? Dark ? Post-apocalyptic ? Creative ? And funny on top ? You will love Extinction Journals. I read the entire book in like 3 days and I took my time. A very entertaining read. A wild, wild story of survival. Read it !","JRJ was my initial foray into what is known as the Bizarro genre. And I was immediately, irrevocably hooked.\"Extinction Journals\" is the continuation of a short story from his collection, \"Angel Dust Apocalypse\" (which is also a fantastic read, fwiw) entitled 'The Sharp Dressed Man at the End of the Line.'A man, Dean, encased in a suit made of cockroaches, finds his way in a just-after-nuclear-war world. While the man himself doesn't exactly \"grow,\" in the traditional protagonist fashion, his suit does, becoming gradually self-aware. And then they meet a woman covered in ants...I have long been a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction, and Johnson delivers something different in a scintillating package. \"Extinction Journals\" covers most of the traditional tropes, but in a new, surreal, and utterly enjoyable way; much like Palahniuk. There is something of Pat Frank's paranoia, Palahniuk's execution, and Matheson's slanted view here.It may not be to everybody's tastes, as the variety of reviews here show, but you can't deny his writing prowess. He is clearly a unique and powerful voice. So, come on in, and let a little insect sex into your life.","Jeremy Robert Johnson's novella Extinction Journals opens with a man in a suit made of cockroaches eating the President--who is in a suit made out of Twinkies. And if that's not a great scene for the first sentence to describe, I don't know what is.Extinction Journals is an awesome survivalist story that at times seems to have been written under the influence of something illicit, but manages to find a common ground between genre conventions and the call of surrealism. The best thing about this book is the juxtaposition of relatively normal survivalist scenes and the surreal conversations that turn up with the people and creatures our protagonist comes across.And boy are those some great scenes! I'm not going to give spoilers, but when the collective unconsciousness of the human race comes up, pissed that the people he represents are dead, I was happy. Things were good in my life right then. It's like a perfect fusion of man and insect. Maybe it does get a little rushed towards the end with the creation of a villain late in the story, but the ride to get there isn't hurt in any way.","Interesting post-apocalyptic novella about a man who survives a nuclear holocaust by wearing a suit of cockroaches. Sometimes humorous, sometimes bleak and totally bizarre. This book has one of the best first sentences that I've read and I look forward to reading more from this author.","Read this book in under 2 Hours...stopping here & there for whateva reason...GREAT BOOK! cant wait to read the authors other books....

      "reviews.text":["It's fascinating to see how some sf novels stand the test of time and others don't. I still have my old Mayflower pb of \"The Long Tomorrow\" which I purchased as a teenager c1963, and reread it from time to time. Doing so produces most curious feelings, like going through a timewarp of some kind.TLT is a \"Golden Oldie\". Published in 1955, it is one of the huge number of \"post nuclear war\" stories that came out in that nervous era, but is head and shoulders above the bulk of them. It's theme, unique in sf as far as I know, is a future world in which the Amish (or at least a sect more or less \"cloned\" from them) have taken over America.The idea that, in the aftermath of holocaust, the people might turn against science and technology, has of course been used by others, notably Walter M Miller in \"A Canticle For Leibowitz\". But TLT takes a subtly different angle. The New Mennonites are not opposed to education, their children are literate, and they seem to live at an early 19th century level, just pre-railroad. It isn't a Dark Age in the usual sense. But there are strict limits. No electricity, industry or anything high tech. Riverboats are allowed to have simple engines, but land transport stops at the horse and buggy. Above all, the US Constitution has been amended to forbid the existence of any city or town above 2000 people.The central characters are two teenage boys in a New Mennonite community in Ohio. Len Colter (14) and his slightly older cousin, Esau. They discover a radio set, belonging to a passing trader, and realise that he comes from \"Bartorstown\", a secret society out west conspiring to bring back the bad old days, association - real or alleged - with which can result in whipping at best, instant lynching at worst. Fascinated by it (and, in Len's case, by their grandmother's wistful recollections of before the war) they seek to know more. This leads to their having to flee from home, and set out on a quest to get to Bartorstown. This quest covers several years and forms the middle third or so of the book.On arrival, they are in for a mighty shock. These people are the custodians of the last surviving nuclear reactor, and are seeking a way to neutralise atomic bombs, so the power of the atom can be safely used without another catastrophe. This forces the sensitive Len (by now more or less adult) into a crisis of conscience. Is this a wise path to take, or were his elders right all along? The last part of the book is about him coming to terms with this question.Perhaps my strongest reaction, on going back to it, is surprise at finding the Amish (on whom the New Mennonites are explicitly modelled) cast as the Bad Guys. This, I suspect, would be out of the question today. If their treatment by Hollywood (\"Witness\", \"Harvest of Fire\" etc) is anything to go by, they are about the most popular ethnic minority in America. To chide them for holding up \"progress\" would be almost unthinkable.The book shows its age in other ways too, notably its simple 1950s faith in technology. It's now some 80 years since World War III, yet the group at Bartorstown are perfectly happy living next to a prewar nuclear reactor. Even those who for various reasons aren't happy with it don't seem to fear any physical danger, save of course from the neighbours if they ever find out. These days, I suspect few would be keen to live even near an eight year old one. Yet Bartorstown has lasted three generations without even a Three Mile Island, let alone a Chernobyl. Remarkable workmanship.Even the nuclear war itself seems to have left remarkably little damage in its wake, with no deformed babies, no cancer, etc, while Len's grandmother, who experienced the war as a child, has lived to a ripe old age. The only lasting harm seems to have been psychological. Nor does anyone see a problem about restoring civilisation in a world where the oilfields are probably mostly drained. It is just assumed that such things can be got round. This is the outlook of a different era from today.Ditto for the people. There are some who'd rather not be living there, but after eight decades in a country hostile to all it stands for, Bartorstown still hasn't been betrayed or detected. Could anyone really keep the lid on for so long? Quibble, quibble, Mike.In short, TLT is a remarkable glimpse into \"The way the future was\" as of 50 years ago. If it were written today, I suspect the Mennonites would be definitely the guys in white hats, and the young heroes would not merely get out of Bartorstown, but do their best not to travel downwind of it any more than they absolutely had to. This said, however, it is beautifully written, and one of the best books of its kind. Read it as an sf \"period piece\" and you won't be sorry.","Leigh Brackett wrote this interesting sci fi thriller after moving to Ohio, and in Ohio it begins, two generations after the Destruction, a global annhilation by nuclear holocaust. Fear predominates the culture and identity of every individual and it is the fight against the fear of knowledge, that most dreaded, that Len Coulter wages along with his cousin, Esau. A believable piece of fiction for a book written over 60 years ago which is thoroughly relevant to the present-day culture of fear.","This is simply amazing. If you are like me and enjoy well-written post-apocalyptic yarns then this is going to be quick favorite. There has been a backlash and the United States has turned its back to technology and all of its citizens live a rural Amish type lifestyle. Or have they? Solid writing and great concept. To bad this winner is out of print.","Despite its acclaim as an early vision of America after a nuclear war, The Long Tomorrow doesn't have the same impact as the best examples of post-apocalyptic fiction. Leigh Brackett's 1955 novel nonetheless deserves its status as a science fiction \"classic,\" albeit more for the message it delivers than for the quality of the story it tells.After the war, cities are widely regarded as a source of wickedness, although Len Colter's grandmother remembers them with fondness, as places with electricity and indoor plumbing, supermarkets and movie theaters. The people best equipped to survive the annihilation aren't city dwellers but those who are accustomed to living a simple rural life. The Mennonites have multiplied, a trend that is enhanced by a constitutional amendment prohibiting cities of more than one thousand residents. The religious values that inform the Mennonite leaders also (not so coincidentally) work to their economic advantage. The Mennonites, however, have little use for members of another fast-growing religion, the fire-and-brimstone fundamentalists who preach hatred and urge that sinners (including those who advocate urban growth) be subjected to the usual range of biblical torments, including death by stoning.Len has a rebellious instinct that no amount of whipping will extinguish. His desire for knowledge, his will to know what exists in the world beyond the village limits, might be sinful -- the sin of pride, his father tells him -- but Len is willing to accept damnation for the sake of learning the truth. After his grandmother explains that, before the war, the government built a town in the west called Bartorstown, populated with scientists dedicated to a secret project, Len resolves to find it, hoping it will be the source of enlightenment he craves. Thus Len and his cousin Esau begin a journey across a post-apocalyptic landscape. The truth about Bartorstown comes as a surprise and the story takes an interesting turn as it nears the end.Like many dystopian tales, The Long Tomorrow has a cautionary message. This one is about the evils of intolerance and thought-control, the value of independent thinking. The fear of cities expressed in Brackett's novel is really a fear of progressive thinking, a belief that life was better (in modern terms, that \"family values\" were stronger) in the good old days. Knowledge is condemned because it was misused; a retreat from knowledge is seen as the path to salvation. Still, as Len comes to realize, even if we can be cleansed of sin (as his people believe), we can never be cleansed of knowledge -- \"there is no mystical escape from it.\" Deliberate ignorance is not the antidote to dangerous knowledge; wisdom is. Perhaps themes that were compelling in 1955 now seem dated, but the argument that there should be limits to knowledge, particularly when knowledge contradicts biblical teachings, retains a twenty-first century following. The argument that cities were destroyed in a nuclear war because they were \"sinful\" finds echoes in similar remarks made about New Orleans after Katrina.I've never been as appreciative of Brackett's prose as some sf fans. She was a perfectly capable writer, but (at least to me) her style is no more \"literary\" than that of many other well-recognized sf writers of her era. Still, her writing becomes more resonant as the story progresses. On occasion the novel has the flavor of a western; at other times there's a hint of Huckleberry Finn, although Huck's trip down the Mississippi is vastly more eventful than Len's underwhelming voyage along the Ohio River. Other \"message\" novels manage more subtlety than this one. Although The Long Tomorrow doesn't make it into my personal canon of cherished sf novels from the 1950s, it endures as an enjoyable read.","This novel showed the late author's capability of telling a story that relates what could have been. Luckily for us, the atomic war didn't happen. Let's hope it never does.","In the 1950s, a nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union seemed almost inevitable. This is one of several excellent post-apocalyptic novels from that time period, including &#34;On the Beach,&#34; &#34;Alas, Babylon,&#34; and &#34;Day of the Triffids.&#34; This one is less science-fiction and more a tale of survival and of survivors seeking that which was lost in the great conflagration. In other words, it's a great drama set in a post-apocalyptic world reflecting a Cold War outlook on what the end of the world might be like. Incredibly interesting, especially for those interested in studying this fascinating period in human history.","A lot of food for thought. Ms Brackett doesn't seem to have felt things would change much. I recommend this.","Leigh Brackett (1915 - 1978) was a productive writer of SF and fantasy novels, short stories, and screenplays. For all but the final 10 - 15 years of her life she was one of the relatively few woman continuously active in the field of SF. Brackett never labeled herself a `feminist' writer, and most of her works focus on male protagonists. In this respect her contributions and skills as a writer have been marginalized by the SF community, particularly in comparison to consciously `Feminist' authors like Alice Sheldon and Joanna Russ, who (in my opinion) are inferior writers, but nonetheless garnered outsized attention in the late 60s - early 70s simply for being regarded as Feminist authors.`The Long Tomorrow' (1955) is one of Brackett's best novels and displays her skills at setting, characterization, and dialogue. The story takes place some decades after a nuclear war has devastated the US in the early 1950s. Civilization has reverted to an agrarian society akin to that of the mid-nineteenth century. Various politico-religious sects, such as the New Mennonites, are determined to stifle any technological progress in order to avert a repeat of the cataclysm. The main character is Len Colter, son of a New Mennonite farmer, whose curiosity about the Olden Times and their forbidden sciences brings him into conflict with his staid and pious family.Len rebels against the strictures of his rural life and embarks on a journey to find Bartorstown, the rumored last bastion of pre-devastation technology. His search for Bartorstown brings him into a variety of conflicts smoldering around the former US, sparked by dissension between advocates for progress, and those opposed to its dangers. In the latter portion of the novel Len finds himself forced to make a fateful decision between his childhood aspirations, and the unsettling reality of genies re-loosed from their bottles.Brackett never provides the reader with a pat declaration for one side or the other in these conflicts; instead, the narrative often shows some ambivalence about technology and its liabilities when wielded by humans clouded by their fears, beliefs, and yearnings.The narrative is fast-moving and engaging. While she wrote with an economy and skill that are the hallmarks of an experienced author, Bracket was also able to portray her characters with depth and imbue them with distinctive and memorable personalities. The world of the post-apocalyptic USA of `The Long Tomorrow' is entirely believable, and one of the best presentations of such a scenario in what is a very heavily-mined area of the genre.`The Long Tomorrow' is a classic of SF, and a great read for both young people and adults.","What if there was a global nuclear war in the 1950s and the USA \"won\"? What would the USA look like after two generations of the survivors rebuilt ? Ms. Brackett takes a detailed look at life in post apocalyptic America. It is not pretty.The book starts off with the following: \"\"No city, no town, no community of more than one thousand people or two hundred buildings to the square mile shall be built or permitted to exist anywhere in the United States of America.\" --30th Amendment of the US Constitution\"As you can imagine, no cities means everyone lives an agrarian life. Or do they?I did not like the ending and down-rated the book for that. Most others might like it.","This is actually a reprint of a novel long out of print. It is considered a classic, although it is hard for me to understand why. The novel was originally published in 1955, and it has aged rather badly. It deals with yet another post-apocalyptic world (the apocalypse in this case, as in so many other 1950s novels, was a nuclear war). The writing is good, quite above many of the pulpy science fiction writing of those times, but Ms Brackett gets the science all wrong. First of all, she imagines a U.S. with a relatively peaceful (even if religiously intolerant), and relatively prosperous, post-apocalyptic society, only a couple of generations after a devastating nuclear war. Which makes no sense whatsoever. There are much better fifties sf novels about the same subject. For example: A Canticle for Leibowitz, where a new civilization emerges slowly and only thousands of years after the nuclear debacle, only to fall again into the same disaster as the previous one. Or Earth Abides, where there is no new civilization and humans slowly evolve (or rather devolve) towards superstition and ignorance. Or The Long Loud Silence, which depicts a very violent and desperate and disintegrating post-apocalyptic world."],

      "reviews.text":["I read this book over 10 years ago and the memory of its beauty still haunts me. The prose was so elegant and so precise that I could taste, smell and feel the sensations being described on paper. The world of a post-nuclear holocaust oppressed by a rigid social and political structure should have been ugly and unpleasant, but quite the opposite--it was enchanting and thrilling.Three scenes from the book I remember particularly: the richly clad prince wandering among blossoms of ylang-ylang (altho' it's been so long since I read this it may have been jasmine); an erotic encounter between the bandit Derweet (a beautiful woman disguised as a handsome man) and his/her computer-generated servant, the lovely child, Cho ( I felt as tho' I, too, were being ravished); the slipping, sliding journey that Cho takes in search of her brother down the mountains of southeast China that have been melted into glass by nuclear blasts. Nor can I forget the creature that lends her name to the book as its title, \"Divine Endurance,\" the small, brown, wise, tough-talking little cat that accompanies Cho in her travels.Gwyneth Jones has a subtle imagination and a deep understanding of human nature. You experience this beautiful book rather than merely reading it.","By the time that Chosen Among the Beautiful (Cho) makes her way from the broken palace to the great lake, we are clear about a few things. Neither she or her cat, Divine Endurance, are what they seem and this is not your typical science fiction/fantasy novel.This is my second book by Gwyneth Jones. I decided to pick up Divine Endurance after being extremely impressed with Bold As Love. Sadly little known in the US, Jones is an award-winning British science fiction and fantasy author. She is justly famed for her inventiveness and the quality of her prose. Divine Endurance was her first novel.This post-apocalyptic Indonesia is an amazing and real place-- full of myths and shattered shards of society. Cho, her brother Worthy to Be Beloved, and the mysterious Divine Endurance are relics from the disasterous past-- angel dolls which act as a catalyst for change in the struggling world.If Divine Endurance has a flaw as a novel, it is largely that the world and the characters are better developed than the plot. It reminded me in many ways of The Etched City, by K.J. Bishop, although I think that the Jones book is ultimately more successful.If you are looking for something unusual and are a fan of dystopic or post-apocalypse science fiction (China Mieville, Sean McMullen) then I suggest that you give Divine Endurance a try. Certainly if you are a fan of any kind of intelligent science fiction or fantasy, then you should become familiar with Gwyneth Jones.","Divine Endurance, by Gwyneth Jones (first published 1987)Bottom line: A painful, sad meditation on what it would mean for humanity to be given what it needs--not what it thinks it needs--to be entirely at peace.Trigger warnings: Rape implied (in the past, not of a main character), shaming of barrenness, forced castration, prostitution out of need and social ostracism, child slavery, drug abuse, death of main characters, loss of a significant other, racism with resulting persecution and genocide, kidnapping, sex with a partner who appears to be a minor (looks 15 years old but is actually much older)How does it treat women/same-sex relationships? In the novel's post-apocalyptic society, women are the governing heads of society, ruling in seclusion. Men have no power in government and carry out day-to-day tasks, look pretty, and practice the arts. Castrated men, called boys, take care of menial tasks. Neither boys nor men are treated poorly, but it's clear they're lower on the social totem pole than women. F/m sex is controlled by the governing women. Young women have sex with assigned partners when they come of age. If they bear children, they're accepted into the governing body of women; if not, they're considered failed women and ostracized. Tensions between the genders are still very strong and in many ways identical to those of the present day, except in reverse. Same-sex love seems to be accepted and not frowned on, whereas different-sex (sexual romantic) love seems to be taboo, beyond the sexual encounters prescribed by the government.Does it have explicit sex scenes?: It has non-explicit sex scenes, in which f/f couples initiate sex and then fade to black.Would I read it again? Yes. It's fragile, sad, and horribly bleak, but it also has a thread of hope in it.Would I publish it? Yes. I'd ask for Jones to clarify a few passages where I wasn't certain which characters were doing what.This is an enormously sad book. In the post-apocalyptic future, only a small portion of humanity clings to life and civilization (the novel is set in a far-future version of the mainland and island countries bordering on the South China Sea). Divine Endurance, a bio-engineered cat android, and Cho (short for Chosen Among the Beautiful), the last of a line of androids/gynoids designed specifically to make people happy (no matter what the cost), leave the dead factory in which Divine Endurance raised Cho and travel out into the dying world of human beings, searching for Cho's brother, Wo (Worthy to Be Beloved). Divine Endurance and Cho discover that the last of humanity is on the edge of war with itself--and how can you make so many hurting, despairing, yet desperate to survive people happy? Cho imprints on Darveet, the last survivor of a royal household that once rebelled against the matriarchal government, taking Darveet as 'her person,' the one particular person she will try hardest to make happy. As a barren, 'failed' woman, someone who simultaneously yearns to be part of the women's secretive government and who sees fatal flaws in it, and as a mixed-race woman, half of the genetically-mutated hill outcasts and half of the genetically-managed royal blood, Darveet's desires are more than complicated and less than definitive. Together, she and Cho meet other women (and men) who strive hard to hope and work for their world's survival.For me, as someone who lives with depression, this book captured the hopelessness that comes with depression, but on a civilization-wide scale--that sense of what does it all come down to? Why not just give up and let it be over? Why does it all hurt so much, for so little? It's a rough read, but a poetic one, with an ending that doesn't shy away from the book's themes but which didn't crush me with its bleakness, either. If you're sad and need catharsis and a sense that someone understands how deep and bad it can be to feel as though everything you could ever do is futile, this is a good book for that; if you're sad and need something to take your mind off of the fact, this isn't a good book for *that.*It's worth reading. I've never read a novel about the slow end of the world that might follow the fast end of the world of a global apocalypse--the end of the world that would still take hundreds of years to sputter out, with human beings trying until the last minutes of the species to keep going.","When I bought the oriiginal Arbor House edition of this wonderful book, it started a lifelong relationship between Gwyneth's work and me as her devoted reader.Drawn to the cover (I'm a devout cat person) and intrigued about the locale (I've been drawn to that part of the world ever since it was used by Poul Anderson to create his off-world setting for Earthman Go Home) the deal was sealed by her great prose style and the sense of wonder she creates.In no way predictable, but in every way plausible, this is a book to treasure and re-read (as I have done, with a reading copy.)Somehow I've bought but have not yet to any Ann Halam books, but anything by \"Gwyneth\" goes right on top of the on-deck list as I've loved her rock and roll quintet, The Spirit of Bois Dumont, and her great books of criticism.","Too bad the author forgot to write a story. :(It's really too bad. The premise is wonderful and the writing is great. However the characters are so sterile that I simply don't care about them in the least. This book reminds me of fine crystal. Sharp, beautiful but cold and, in the end without meaning."],

After the “Accident,” all males on Earth become sterile. Society ages and falls apart bit by bit. First, toy companies go under. Then record companies. Then cities cease to function. Now Earth’s population lives in spread‐out, isolated villages, with its youngest members in their fifties. When the people of Sparcot begin to make claims of gnomes and man‐eating rodents lurking around their village, Greybeard and his wife set out for the coast with the hope of finding something better.",

It is still one of the best (I can count those I would consider 'the best' on one hand). The atmosphere that Aldiss creates for us begins on the first page, in the first paragraph, in the first sentence. This book will stay with me for the rest of my life. (Several years ago, I managed to find a first edition. Now, if I could just get it signed...)","Brian Aldiss seems to have a limited following with the wider science fiction community only recognizingNon-Stop(excellent!),Long Afternoon Of Earth(great!), andHelliconia Spring(haven't read it yet) as his landmark novels. I've read five of his novels and each one has been a 4- or 5-star rating, among themStarswarm,Cryptozoic, andEarthworks. Each one of these books highlights Brian Aldiss's masterful gift for creating a setting which is detailed and absorbing. Greybeard is no different - it opens your eyes and keeps them glued to the pages.Rear cover synopsis:\"After the Accident, the Dark Ages return to Earth. By the year 2029 A.D. few survivors remain. Those who are left huddle in isolated villages, prisoners of fear, superstition, and old age. The rare man who still wants to shape his own destiny must strike out into the unknown. Greybeard is the story of such a man and his wife - of their perilous journey through a landscape weirdly familiar, eerily changed. And of their quest for something they dare not name...\"Algy Timberlane and his wife Martha met during childhood, in the the early years after the Accident in 1981. Both aged seven years old and both recovering from radiation-related illnesses, they will discover that their lives will be intermeshed through the world war in 2001, through the cholera outbreak in 2018, and through the reclusive years after the sequential disasters in 2029. The Big Accident having wiped out most large mammals and rendering nearly all of humanity sterile, only weasels, reindeer, beavers, otters, and coypu are left to either eat or provide some sort of utility to the remaining humans dotting the English countryside... while \"the mammal with the big brain eked out his dotage in small communities.\" (71) With an average age of seventy and where 50 years of age is considered to be young, the hope for the future is dim: \"Mortal flesh now wore only the Gothic shapes of age. Death stood impatiently over the land, waiting to count his last few pilgrims.\" (39)Algy Timberlane (aka Greybeard), now aged 54 in the year 2029, started to work for DOUCH(E) during the war in 2001. DOUCH(E) stands for Documentation of Universal Contemporary History (England) and Algy's job is to simply place himself where history is being made and make recordings of history unfolding: \"...someone should leave behind a summary of earth's decline, if only for visiting archeologists from other possible worlds.\" (83) His wife Martha is at his side when they decide to escape their community as it experiences a surge of unrest. Fleeing the hermetic village with the couple is the chaplain, Charley, five years Algy's senior, who provides optimistic countenance to Algy's own spiral of negativity. Also, the trapper and somewhat dim-witted Jeff Pitt is along for the perilous journey, who has been Algy's peripheral sidekick since the days of training with DOUCH when Jeff was ordered to assassinate Algy.The seven chapters of Greybeard alternate between the escape from the village and downstream journey to the shore in the years 2029-2031 with that of historical background of the (1) year 1982 when the year after the \"fatal bombs in space\") and we reader witnesses a key event in Algy's life: his chance encounter with the hairless girl next door and the suicide of his father. (2) In the years 2000-2001 Algy receives training with DOUCH and experiences a unfortunate event which solidifies the bond between the Algy and his fianc&eacute;. (3) In the year 2018, cholera began to take it toll and escape from the dictatorial urban center was the only choice in order to survive.Like all the other Aldiss novels I've read, the author pens a richly detailed novel interspersed with cavernous emotion, inspiring allegories, and romantic prose: \"Year by year, as the living died, the empty rooms about him would multiply, like the cells of a giant hive that no bees visited, until they filled the world. The time would come when he would be a monster, alone in the rooms, in the tracks of his search, in the labyrinth of his hollow footsteps.\" (129) The reader will certainly get a feel for the desolation of the bucolic English countryside in contrast to the effervescent hope which bubbles from unknown emotional depths. Aldiss peppers Greybeard with fun little words like \"sedgey\" and \"cavil\" and \"pundit\" with some interesting formal words like \"metoposcopy\" and \"katabatic winds\" and \"catenary\" and then there's always the rare long words you come across once a year like \"peregrination\" and \"tatterdemalion\".Greybeard may not be the best place to start when tackling the Aldiss bibliography, but it's certainly a prized mantelpiece for post-apocalyptic fiction, once which infuses barrenness with hope, self-destruction with mollification, and fatalism with transcendence.","There are times when the world ends, and there are times when your world ends. This book is more or less about the difference between the two.There's a whole genre of books out there where civilization doesn't end in a blazing hail of fire, but with a more sobering whimper as society gently crumbles around itself and everyone who is left in the pieces have to figure out how best to use the time remaining to them, because putting things back to how they were won't be an option. Aldiss, being British, can't help but sprinkle his work with a certain melancholy that skirts just shy of full blown \"On the Beach\" style depression. It's something about the country that infuses their science-fiction with an elegant weariness, like falling asleep after walking for miles in the snow. Sure, it will kill you, but after all that effort sometimes it's just a relief to stop.\"Greybeard\" takes us into a fairly unique scenario . . . the whole adult population of earth gets sterilized. There's an accident up in the atmosphere and suddenly nobody is getting pregnant anymore. Not a problem, the human race figures. Whatever this is will probably wear off and we'll get back to making babies and filling every corner of the planet in no time.Fast forward a few decades and clearly that hasn't happened. The Earth has basically become one big nursing home, as the youngest people on the planet are now in their fifties, and not getting younger. Suddenly everyone in the world is an AARP member and having to face the inevitable . . . once they're gone, that's it.This could have been played for laughs, and early scenes do toy with the utter absurdity of old people fighting each other and a population trying to scrape out a living in the ruins of civilization while also worrying about hearing loss and whether they have enough fiber in their diet. Greybeard is young enough to not have these problems yet, but he's also been around long enough to know this is the way the world is going, and when he reaches the age of these people, who is going to be around to take care of him? So, feeling the threat of stagnation breathing around his neck, he and his wife go exploring, to try to find a life that might be different. That might not be ossifying into a slow fade out.But Aldiss does an interesting thing here, which is show us where these people have wound up and then take us back to depict how they started to get here in the first place, the gradual breaking down of the world that results when no one new comes to take the place of the people who are turning gray. It's in the little touches, the minor breakdowns that warn us about the end and wind up being catastrophic. The ones we never really see coming. It's the toy companies that are the canaries in the coal mine . . . when no one young in existence, there's no one around to buy toys. Not every disaster comes with a mushroom cloud. And more and more as we sink our way into a history that is striving toward a point where history will no longer exist, we realize the story is about absence, decay turning into renewal and what it leaves behind. Society adapting to what is no longer there, everyone coming up against impossible situations, staring the wall in the face and deciding to make camp there in order to make the best of it. People make little adjustments at first, as the population shrinks, as everyone gets older. A tweak here, a change there and it's not until years pass that anyone can take stock and see how much has changed. That's how society works in the novel, the greatest changes don't come sweeping, but creep up on us until one day it's just how things always are. Like the first day you find a gray hair, and realize there's really no turning back now.I wish I could say the book is about how Greybeard and his wife begin to rebuild civilization, how mankind starts to scratch its way back up to dominance. But it's not about that and that's fine There's a calm elegance in seeing England going back to its wild roots, trees and forests taking over towns, Richard Jefferies \"Wild England\" finally coming true. No one is happy about this, but everyone accepts it because what else can you do? Mankind is done and it's all over but the aging, so instead we watch Greybeard play observer to a history that won't matter anymore because no one will be around to remember it. It's not a story about winning or succeeding, but persisting and accepting, about finally realizing that you can find a place for yourself in the midst of the collapse. The clock of nature turns back while the age of everyone constantly turns forward and there's a haunting quality as we leapfrog from the days when everyone could remember what young was, to steps toward the final graying, where old-timers shuffle through the disintegrating ruins of the majesties they once created, the towers growing more vine-covered and fading with each new day. But what good is making your mark upon the world, if there's no one left to be impressed?Maybe the only answer really is a sigh, but there's some dignity in that, too, and in the quiet lives of these characters, and in this world, growing younger even as the years plod on.","Written in 1964 and set in 2029, Greybeard posits a nuclear accident occuring in the 1980's that renders the human race sterile. By the time the book opens, the youngest people are in their 50's and the technological civilization of the the 20th century is a moldering ruin, overtaken and covered over by a resurgent nature. What's left of the aging population lives in small rural communities, seeking to stave off despair even as their numbers inevitably dwindle. Algernon Timberlane, nicknamed Greybeard, in his early 50's one of the youngest men alive, decides to abandon the disintegrating English village that he lives in and voyage down the Thames river to the sea, to see if anywhere there is any hope left. He traves with his wife Martha and a few like-minded friends, and along the way they encounter brigands and charlatans, hermits and eccentrics. There are petty dictators, apocalyptic religious communities, and a quarrelsome band of scholars still living in the ruins of Oxford. And there are rumors of strange creatures living in the flourishing forests - gnomes...or can they possibly be human children? Greybeard is a beautiful, autumnal, meditative book that made a deep impression on me. As Greybeard and his friends reflect back on an unsettled past and journey into an uncertain future, they manage to keep faith with each other and with a world that is still beautiful, still filled with promise. There aren't many books that are genuinely wise - Greybeard is one of them.","The story follows the lives of a small group of human survivors of a nuclear accident. The &quot;Accident&quot;, as it is referred to, has made male humans infertile. As the surviving population slowly dies off, the remaining groups of elderly people struggle to find hope in a bleak environment. One group, led by a man called Greybeard, have lived for many years in a small, isolated town along the river. They decide to venture down the river, to seek out the truth of rumors spread by travelers that children and fertile humans still survive in isolated pockets of the land. This is mostly a dark novel, with a few moving moments, and some beautifully descriptive writing. It is short on action.","This is an absolutely horrid book. I had to read it for a science fiction literature class. After 20 pages, whenever I'd finish a page, I'd tear it out of the book. Absolutley horrible book. One book was worse in the course...the blatherings of an old indian druggie who a city twirp thought was nirvana's wisdom personified....Journey to Ixltan...the worst science fiction book.","Elegantly written for a book of this type, Brian Aldiss creates a near future world in which nuclear testing has gone awry, temporarily allowing some hard radiation from the sun to saturate the earth, destroying the ability of larger mammals including humans to reproduce themselves.

And more and more as we sink our way into a history that is striving toward a point where history will no longer exist, we realize the story is about absence, decay turning into renewal and what it leaves behind. Society adapting to what is no longer there, everyone coming up against impossible situations, staring the wall in the face and deciding to make camp there in order to make the best of it. People make little adjustments at first, as the population shrinks, as everyone gets older. A tweak here, a change there and it's not until years pass that anyone can take stock and see how much has changed. That's how society works in the novel, the greatest changes don't come sweeping, but creep up on us until one day it's just how things always are. Like the first day you find a gray hair, and realize there's really no turning back now.I wish I could say the book is about how Greybeard and his wife begin to rebuild civilization, how mankind starts to scratch its way back up to dominance. But it's not about that and that's fine There's a calm elegance in seeing England going back to its wild roots, trees and forests taking over towns, Richard Jefferies \"Wild England\" finally coming true. No one is happy about this, but everyone accepts it because what else can you do? Mankind is done and it's all over but the aging, so instead we watch Greybeard play observer to a history that won't matter anymore because no one will be around to remember it. It's not a story about winning or succeeding, but persisting and accepting, about finally realizing that you can find a place for yourself in the midst of the collapse. The clock of nature turns back while the age of everyone constantly turns forward and there's a haunting quality as we leapfrog from the days when everyone could remember what young was, to steps toward the final graying, where old-timers shuffle through the disintegrating ruins of the majesties they once created, the towers growing more vine-covered and fading with each new day. But what good is making your mark upon the world, if there's no one left to be impressed?Maybe the only answer really is a sigh, but there's some dignity in that, too, and in the quiet lives of these characters, and in this world, growing younger even as the years plod on.","Written in 1964 and set in 2029, Greybeard posits a nuclear accident occuring in the 1980's that renders the human race sterile. By the time the book opens, the youngest people are in their 50's and the technological civilization of the the 20th century is a moldering ruin, overtaken and covered over by a resurgent nature. What's left of the aging population lives in small rural communities, seeking to stave off despair even as their numbers inevitably dwindle. Algernon Timberlane, nicknamed Greybeard, in his early 50's one of the youngest men alive, decides to abandon the disintegrating English village that he lives in and voyage down the Thames river to the sea, to see if anywhere there is any hope left. He traves with his wife Martha and a few like-minded friends, and along the way they encounter brigands and charlatans, hermits and eccentrics. There are petty dictators, apocalyptic religious communities, and a quarrelsome band of scholars still living in the ruins of Oxford. And there are rumors of strange creatures living in the flourishing forests - gnomes...or can they possibly be human children? Greybeard is a beautiful, autumnal, meditative book that made a deep impression on me. As Greybeard and his friends reflect back on an unsettled past and journey into an uncertain future, they manage to keep faith with each other and with a world that is still beautiful, still filled with promise. There aren't many books that are genuinely wise - Greybeard is one of them.","The story follows the lives of a small group of human survivors of a nuclear accident. The &quot;Accident&quot;, as it is referred to, has made male humans infertile. As the surviving population slowly dies off, the remaining groups of elderly people struggle to find hope in a bleak environment. One group, led by a man called Greybeard, have lived for many years in a small, isolated town along the river. They decide to venture down the river, to seek out the truth of rumors spread by travelers that children and fertile humans still survive in isolated pockets of the land. This is mostly a dark novel, with a few moving moments, and some beautifully descriptive writing. It is short on action.","This is an absolutely horrid book. I had to read it for a science fiction literature class. After 20 pages, whenever I'd finish a page, I'd tear it out of the book. Absolutley horrible book. One book was worse in the course...the blatherings of an old indian druggie who a city twirp thought was nirvana's wisdom personified....Journey to Ixltan...the worst science fiction book."],

      "reviews.text":["These &quot;Memoirs&quot; postulate a near future when society's framework and infrastructure are breaking down. Young people are forming gangs and moving out of the city, the trappings of civilization are no longer relevant, cannibalism is rumored. Priorities are back to food, shelter, and clothing. Personal safety and a bath cannot be taken for granted. The narrator is an older woman who lives on the ground floor of a large apartment building. A 12-year-old girl, Emily, is brought to her and she is told the girl is her responsibility. The woman does her best to protect Emily, who is growing up quickly, but the girl has a better grip on reality than her protector. Watching the action on the street from the windows, they see first the nomadic groups of young people moving through their area, then gangs forming from their own neighborhood and moving out. Emily falls in love with a young gang chieftain and joins his group, where she finds her responsibilities almost more than she can bear. Her abilities in the new order are great, but she often retreats to the older woman's apartment. As more people move out, life in the city changes. Gangs occupy and protect their territories, raise gardens and animals for food. And then a new kind of gang emerges - younger children who have no idea of organization, loyalty, or even much language. These feral children are vicious and cunning. The quandary is that they are &quot;only children.&quot; Emily's chieftain tries to help them and comes to grief. There are many puzzling threads to the story which are never explained. Does the wall really open into another reality? Is the dog really a dog, or something more? I enjoyed that quality of ambiguity as an added dimension to the story. I recommend it highly.","There are several levels to this book, and many obscure threads which are woven together to make a very satisfying, yet provocative and obtuse novel of survival in times of chaos as society falls apart. Some of the mysteries which are present in the story ( who really is Emily, who and/or what is the dog, what is the alternate reality behind the wall, and what are all the charactors doing at the end when the iron egg crumbles) are woven into other novels by Lessing, such as the &quot;Four Gated City.&quot; &quot;Memoirs of a Survivor&quot; is reported to be partly autobiographical.A movie was made in England of &quot;Memoirs&quot; staring Julie Christi around 1985 which was shown briefly in Venice, California. I have not seen it referred to anywhere since.","Despite the author's accomplished prose style and vivid imagination, this is, in the end, a very boring book about a setting and a theme which should be fascinating: surviving the--or at least an--apocalypse. The problem is that the author remains at such an abstract and intellectual level throughout most of the book. As a result, you don't fully enter into the narrator's world, and you don't really get to know the characters. There is a scene about 30 pages from the end, when some peddlers come selling water in buckets, and there's a fight over the water, when I found myself saying, &quot;Yes--this is exactly the kind of engaging detail that has been missing from most of this story!&quot; The ambiguities of the cat-dog character and the wall-as-conduit-to-alternate-reality do not make up for this fundamental shortcoming.","The writing is good but this is just a short novella.As I post this review, I have read six of Lessing's novels from different time periods in her career all the way from her first novel in the 1950s to a recent 2003 novel. This present novel is from the middle of her career, written in 1974. As with all of her works, it contains some of the feminine perspectives, dialogues, analysis, and commentary that we associate with Lessing. The present novel is short and the social commentary is toned down drastically from other novels. It is about a person who cares for a young girl who is approximately age 12 to 15, along with the girl's dog. They live through a period of social breakdown.Doris Lessing (1919 - ) is the 2007 Nobel Prize winner in literature. She has a score of novels and many other works. Her complex novel The Golden Notebook (1957), her first novel The Grass is Singing (1950), and The Summer Before The Dark (1973) are considered to be her representative works. I read those three plus a few more. I have set up a Listmania list on her books.The present novel is good. It is not complicated in the fashion of The Golden Notebook. It is closer to being a short story. It has a good set of characters and an interesting plot. Without giving away the plot, Lessing describes the personality of the female protagonist living in an urban area that has been subject to a complete social breakdown. She is the narrator in the story. Lessing never tells us the cause of the problem, but the government is essentially gone, there is no electricity or water, and gangs roam the streets. People keep animals to eat and grow their own crops. The story is about the young girl, Emily, who has been left with the older woman. Emily matures and takes up with a local leader. Some might not like the book because it lacks emotion.I liked the book and would recommend it. It is a short quick read that takes an evenings to read. It does not contain the feminine arguments found in some of her longer works, but the present work is far easier read than The Golden Notebok (far, far easier) and it is a well written novel. If I had to pick one book that is easy to read and contains her arguments, I would recommend The Grass is Singing. It is a more innovative work and also easy to read.","What struck me most in the marvelous Lessing short book, Memoirs of a Survivor, is how matter-of-factly we accept horrific changes as long as they happen bit by bit. The absence of emotionality in the story, noted by others, is, I believe, intentional. As conditions worsen, the main character (and her ward) find ways to adapt, but never consider what actions they might take to reverse the societal decline.This is a story about our inherent passivity, our overweaning trust that someone else will surely take care of things when they go bad. It is also a testament to our ability to adapt to changing circumstances, but in general I feel it is a condemnation of our blindness to perceive and then resist those changes that dismantle and ultimately destroy vibrant societies.","My suggestion is to take this book at face value - a tale of a woman and her child trying to survive in an increasingly hard world. I didn't love it but there were aspects that still linger in my memory where other books have faded completely. If you are desperate for a PA fix, this will do in a crunch.","It may not be fair for me to rate this book as I was not able to finish it. I even thought of just deleting it from my book list - that's how I don't like it. Tried to read it at different times of the day but I can't help but fall asleep over it, every time! Much as I hate to leave a book unfinished, this isn't just worth my time and effort. I won't mind if people will think of me as shallow, but in my opinion, deep subjects such as the one tackled in this book can be presented in a more interesting and engaging manner. Doesn't matter if she's a Nobel Prize winner, if this is her style, I don't think we'll ever click.","I like the writing so Lessing deserves 5 stars but this is a short novella, not a novel.As I post this review, I have read six of Lessing's novels from different time periods in her career all the way from her first novel in the 1950s to a recent 2003 novel.

Also I'll give a quick plot outline since no plot is given in Amazon's book description.Mountain states, mid 80's, sneak attack on the USA by USSR. Not much nuclear. Mainly used to take out USA leadership. Soviet troops fly over the North Pole, seize and garrison a leaderless nation. As the other review said sorta like Red Dawn. Though not much action. Very character-driven until then end. I didn't miss the action; I was too amazed at the characters and their drives.What is not like Red Dawn is our heroes are flawed, very flawed. VERY FLAWED. Yes, I am shouting. Don't get this book if you want black haired Greek gods as heroes.Our Heroes:Failed painter, anti-social outcast, a drunk, who's possibly a lousy father, and directionless.His son, slightly retarded, taken from Pops and placed in a foster care home. Then used as slave labor by Foster-Father. No, he doesn't drink.A self-made, old-time SOB drunken cowboy-type, possibly untrustworthy, defiantly Republican Congressman material.A pair of sniveling \"boys\", who drink, while competing for attention.The inhabitants of the local drunk tank.The Spanish and Indians do come across as honorable. Heavy drinkers but honorable.No, the book is not comedy. This book is very dark, very rich, and very good. Forgiving my above belittling, the characters are well written with human flaws. No broad-shoulder, narrow hipped gunslinger types. Just real people, with a real ending.I believe the author was writing a story about the people and the post-apocalyptic setting is just a tool. The story could have been a highway running through our painter's front yard and his attempts to stop it.Good stuff about the majority of Americans doing what they are told by the authorities. New overseer, old overseer, American overseer, Russian overseer. Gotta have a boss. Living free went out with the Stone Age. Sorry...More survivalists should read this book and not pray for the end of days. It ends badly at the end of every ones' days.Highly recommend!","This story is on a similar vein as The Movie Red Dawn but was written earlier. It's well crafted and interesting. I liked it because it wasn't predictable. Well crafted story.","This is clearly a period piece, the references used almost stink of the 1970s, yippes, malaise, decadence.

The part about the concentration camp was disturbingly familiar to me. Although I do have 2 small quibbles, somehow I think that in the event of an invasion that there would be more than a half a dozen guys who wouldn't put up with it and the author described MIG 21s as having swept wings. They have delta wings with a tailplane, I know, I have been in one.","I have never issued a 5 star rating before. This book gets it. A good story, well told. Even though it was written more than 40 years ago, the scenario is right up to date and believable. Not many this good.","This intense book tells the story of post-conquered America and the brave few who defied the conquerors.

      "reviews.text":["When I first read \"Vault of the Ages\" it was an exciting book; in reviewing it as an adult close to 40 years later as an adult I find it still an enjoyable read. Looking back on the stories I read in my youth this had to be the first in the series of this genre of post doomsday chronicles that I continued to enjoy...This book emphasizes messages about human responsibility and the importance of using science only for good almost as though accentuated with a bright yellow Hi-Lighter Pen.The story is set in the Alleghenies roughly 500 years after a nuclear holocaust, Vault of the Ages tells the story peaceful farming tribes vs. fierce warriors. Carl, our lead hero and son of the village Chief is responsible for trading with the people from the ruined city to obtain metal and other needed materials form the remains of skyscrapers etc...Carl and his companions discover a \"time vault,\" basically a large time capsule remaining from the pre-holocaust civilization, containing numerous tools, books, models of apparatus and more depicting the sciences that have since been lost.

I can imagine a facility such as this being the 'VAULT' spoken of in this story. I wonder what the world will be like in 500 years and what part the material preserved by the museum here will play in it....Ed Sharpe, Archivist for SMECC[...]","With a slight word of warning from Joachim on the juvenility of Vault of the Ages, I forged ahead on my sixteenth Poul Anderson book knowing the above objective truth with my own subjective truth: Poul Anderson has his hits (Tau Zero[1970] andThree Worlds to Conquer[1964]) more often than he has his misses (The Day of Their Return[1974] andOrbit Unlimited[1961]). Sadly, the familiar theme of The High Crusade, minus the aliens, comes across as shallow entertainment with a flowery epimyth or a conclusion. It's not a dud, but doesn't hearken to Poul's own science fiction traditions of wonderment and/or zany originality.Rear cover synopsis:\"20th Century, Mystery Century!Once upon a time (which hasn't happened yet) the fierce Lann army thundered down from the North to conquer the peace-loving Dalesmen. The `Doom' had destroyed nearly all concepts of civilization 500 years earlier. Defying charges of witchcraft, Carl of Dalesmen entered the forbidden city and the vault which held secrets of the long-ago twentieth century.\"------------With the winters being colder and longer than in recent memory, the northern clan of Lann has dispatched an army to the south in order to find new land to settle and cultivate, but not before killing and pillaging. Their reputation as a ruthless clan has reached further inland has become known as the fiercest, largest army. Lann's King Raymon's own son Lenard is the captain of the thousand-man platoon; both the leaders and the led are driven by the need to make a settlement further to south to ensure their clan's survival. In their way is peaceful town of Dalesmen.Democratically governed by Chief Ralph, the village has survived through the decades with the assistance of the town's \"Doctor,\" Donn. As with every village, the Doctor bears holy symbols, beats drums, and chants spells against witchcraft (130). One law of the Dalesmen tribe, and many tribes like them, is to not enter the City, where the scaffold remains of an ancient city still stand amid the rubble of concrete, steel, and glass. Though inhabited by a industrious yet cowardly band of so-called witches, the town is off-limits, especially so for the Time Vault within the city proper.Chief Ralph's son Carl treks through the forest and happens upon a country home where two boys, Tom and Owl, decide to tag along to enter the city, their mission to find reinforcement against the Lann horde. Their horses packed, they travel towards the City only to be chased by the Lann band, but they find solace in the City where they are greeted by the City's own Chief Ronwy. Permission is eventually granted for them to enter the Time Vault, where books and machines abound. To prove to his own clan that the City holds power enough for them to defeat the Lann clan, Carl takes a hand-crank flashlight to impress everyone.Denounced by Doctor Donn, the trio are ever eager to prove themselves potent in the eyes of the village and, most importantly, in the prying eyes of the Lann. Though the magic white light emanating from the contraption may have scared the army once, further technology must be attained so that they may conquer the horde of heathens at their threshold. Captured by the Lann eventually, the trio of Carl, Tom, and Owl defuse their situation craftily and return once again to their village where another challenge is thrown at them: the death penalty for trespassing on the ground of the City and overstepping the boundary of the Time Vault and the demons which lurk within.Yet another timely escape brandished by the young whippersnappers of Dalesmen sees them charge back into the City once and for all to gain control of the technology within the Time Vault, whether the City inhabitants or the Lann can stop them.------------Joachim is right when he states the juvenility of this novel. The gallivanting between their village, through the enemy's encampment, to the derelict perches of the City's skyscrapers is repetitive. The Vault holds such wonder to the trio of boys, but it also holds wonder in the reader. However, don't expect to be immersed in the ancient wonders of the Vault's bounty because only a handful of pages pertain to the Vault's treasures.You should familiarize yourself with some of the science lingo before dipping your toes into this science fiction novel:Smiting sabers, lancing pikes, gleaming shields, fringed buckskin breeches, sledging hammers, silver-studded boots... stop me when this begins to sound more like science fiction than fantasy or historical fiction... thudding hooves, drawn bows, quivers of arrows, moccasined feet, fur-lined tunics, saddle blankets, catapults... I could go on... hamstringing swords, creaking wagons, fur-trimmed boots, etc.It's not really that bad but it does drag on.I wasn't sympathetic with anyone in this novel, be they a person or a tribe: the morally high-grounded post-apocalyptic tribe (before post-apocalyptic was \"cool\") of Dalesmen pitted against the advancing threat of an impoverished clan from the Lann. Perhaps the Lann came at the encroachment the wrong way, with force, rather than diplomatically, but I didn't feel sorry for the villages left in their wake or those who had yet to feel the brunt of the great Lann warrior clan.The greedy territorial advance of the Lann army is synonymous to the technological lust of the Dalesmen youth. Where the Lann simply wanted land to live and thrive on, the Dalesmen youth look to the non-solution of technology to solve their problem of invasion. In the Time Vault itself, there were more than mere inventions of gunpowder and electricity, but there must have also been the inventions of the mind, something which they felt they could easily bypass. This reliance on knowing of technology rather than the knowledge of technology casts a dim view on the young bandits, be it for the greater cause or less. Even when they discuss to share the treasures within, they mention the material good rather than the good of knowledge.Even Doctor Donn says, \"There is no evil in the vault. There is only evil in the hearts of men. Knowledge, all knowledge, is good\" (187). If this were true in the context of the story, then why would the Dalesmen tribe offer to share the Vault's technology with competing clans when the exchange of ethics, morality, or religion could better change the \"hearts of men\" than a schooner could? Presuming the Vault is full of not only the world's most important technologies, but also full of the virtues of the world's most gifted thinkers, I would think the first thing to share would be the goodness of words, not the goodness of the material wealth.This will be one of the few Anderson novels that will be taken back to the second-hand bookstore. It's a pity that even the cover isn't noteworthy. I'll remind myself in the future to steer clear of Poul Anderson's historically themed novels if they don't include absurdity like The High Crusade. Now I'm only left with The Psycho-Technic League (1981) on my shelves... an ominous sign that I either need for Anderson, or none at all. Considering his wealth of material, there must be tastier morsels out there.","Poul Anderson's \"Vault of the Ages\" is a good tale of life going on after all is lost. Set 500 years after a nuclear disaster, a tribe in what is now the Alleghanies tries desparately to keep an invader from taking over. The son of a chiefian seeks shelter in a place that the others in his tribe are afraid of, and finds a very large time capsule in which the technology of our day is preserved in record. The rest deals with the invading horde which desparately needs fertile land or it'll strave and the fears of the tribe. Anderson showed his good writing from the beginning","This contains very succinct writing that conveys a very imaginative glimpse of a fictional post-apocalyptic future where civilization is about to be re-kindled. Very well written. The author doesn't get extravagant or excessive. This book is much more enjoyable when you maintain the perspective of what our culture was like when this book was written. It's also helpful to keep in mind that science fiction was comparatively rare when this book was written.","I love to read anything by Anderson, and decided on this because it is short and looked like a quick read. I knew going in that it was published in 1952, and tried mightily not to let that cloud my judgement. I have read many books in the genre from that time period, and most of them suffer at least a little from the changed times.Anderson's books are always polished and concise, and this one is no exception. The writing is clear and to the point, without being boring. It is a fine adventure story, and would likely have appealed to a young audience of the time, who undoubtedly would have found it exciting. Perhaps that would still be the case today, but the odds are that the overwhelming supply of these types of post-apocalyptic adventures written since this book appeared would provide a lot of competition. The story here is really all about the adventure and struggle that the young protagonist embarks upon, and the time vault is the vehicle for the adventure. The vault itself is only vaguely described, as far as its contents are concerned, and that is okay because it clearly is not the point of the book. The vault serves to provide a possible source of unity among otherwise warring tribes, who differ in their views about the possible harm or potential benefit the vault could provide humanity. Much of the book describes tribal warfare, but there are some memorable scenes that occur at the site of the time vault.If you are a fan of early science fiction, meaning perhaps the golden age or just a bit later (such as this book), you won't be disappointed with this. If you are a fan of Anderson, you'll enjoy it. If a young reader wishes to read this, the effect will likely not be the same as it was for young readers of the time. Unfortunately, in my view, excitement today is derived from a lot more dazzle and glitter than the days of this book. To be fair, there are many fine books of this type out there, and my rating takes that into account. I'm unable to view this, as it turns out, in a vacuum consisting of 1950's science fiction. This is a fine book for what it is, and I enjoyed reading it.","Vault of the Ages (1952), one of Poul Anderson's earliest novels, should not be missed. Although Vault of the Ages is at its core a simplistic juvenile (50s sci-fi for younger readers), Anderson's budding storytelling skills make it engaging and a joy to read. If only I had read it when I was younger! Suggested for any fans of 50s sci-fi, early post-apocalyptical sci-fi, and Poul Anderson completests.Brief Plot SummarySometime in the future the \"Doom\" (caused by atomic weapons) wipes out civilization -- all that remains are intensely superstitious loosely confederated tribes who live in wooden houses and tend livestock. Five hundred years after the Doom somewhere in the Alleghenies a boy named Carl, the son of the chief of the Dalesmen, dares to defy taboos and seek out the City (the ruins of a pre-Doom settlement).The plot concerns an invasion of fierce northern peoples called the Lann. Driven by a cooling climate and attacks from other unnamed peoples, the Lann desire to occupy the lands of the Dalesmen. Unlike other authors who are content to leave the \"barbarian\" enemy a nameless force of evil, Anderson tries give a rational for their actions and even introduces a character in parallel to Carl, Lenard, the son of the chief of the Lann.

      "reviews.text":["When I first read \"Vault of the Ages\" it was an exciting book; in reviewing it as an adult close to 40 years later as an adult I find it still an enjoyable read. Looking back on the stories I read in my youth this had to be the first in the series of this genre of post doomsday chronicles that I continued to enjoy...This book emphasizes messages about human responsibility and the importance of using science only for good almost as though accentuated with a bright yellow Hi-Lighter Pen.The story is set in the Alleghenies roughly 500 years after a nuclear holocaust, Vault of the Ages tells the story peaceful farming tribes vs. fierce warriors. Carl, our lead hero and son of the village Chief is responsible for trading with the people from the ruined city to obtain metal and other needed materials form the remains of skyscrapers etc...Carl and his companions discover a \"time vault,\" basically a large time capsule remaining from the pre-holocaust civilization, containing numerous tools, books, models of apparatus and more depicting the sciences that have since been lost. With the aid of the newly discovered sciences and much common sense he is able to help his people.In rereading the description of the 'VAULT' it brings a smile to my face when I look around our office, library and museum facilities here at the Southwest Museum of Engineering, Communications and Computation here in Glendale Arizona.... I can imagine a facility such as this being the 'VAULT' spoken of in this story. I wonder what the world will be like in 500 years and what part the material preserved by the museum here will play in it....Ed Sharpe, Archivist for SMECC[...]","With a slight word of warning from Joachim on the juvenility of Vault of the Ages, I forged ahead on my sixteenth Poul Anderson book knowing the above objective truth with my own subjective truth: Poul Anderson has his hits (Tau Zero[1970] andThree Worlds to Conquer[1964]) more often than he has his misses (The Day of Their Return[1974] andOrbit Unlimited[1961]). Sadly, the familiar theme of The High Crusade, minus the aliens, comes across as shallow entertainment with a flowery epimyth or a conclusion. It's not a dud, but doesn't hearken to Poul's own science fiction traditions of wonderment and/or zany originality.Rear cover synopsis:\"20th Century, Mystery Century!Once upon a time (which hasn't happened yet) the fierce Lann army thundered down from the North to conquer the peace-loving Dalesmen. The `Doom' had destroyed nearly all concepts of civilization 500 years earlier. Defying charges of witchcraft, Carl of Dalesmen entered the forbidden city and the vault which held secrets of the long-ago twentieth century.\"------------With the winters being colder and longer than in recent memory, the northern clan of Lann has dispatched an army to the south in order to find new land to settle and cultivate, but not before killing and pillaging. Their reputation as a ruthless clan has reached further inland has become known as the fiercest, largest army. Lann's King Raymon's own son Lenard is the captain of the thousand-man platoon; both the leaders and the led are driven by the need to make a settlement further to south to ensure their clan's survival. In their way is peaceful town of Dalesmen.Democratically governed by Chief Ralph, the village has survived through the decades with the assistance of the town's \"Doctor,\" Donn. As with every village, the Doctor bears holy symbols, beats drums, and chants spells against witchcraft (130). One law of the Dalesmen tribe, and many tribes like them, is to not enter the City, where the scaffold remains of an ancient city still stand amid the rubble of concrete, steel, and glass. Though inhabited by a industrious yet cowardly band of so-called witches, the town is off-limits, especially so for the Time Vault within the city proper.Chief Ralph's son Carl treks through the forest and happens upon a country home where two boys, Tom and Owl, decide to tag along to enter the city, their mission to find reinforcement against the Lann horde. Their horses packed, they travel towards the City only to be chased by the Lann band, but they find solace in the City where they are greeted by the City's own Chief Ronwy. Permission is eventually granted for them to enter the Time Vault, where books and machines abound. To prove to his own clan that the City holds power enough for them to defeat the Lann clan, Carl takes a hand-crank flashlight to impress everyone.Denounced by Doctor Donn, the trio are ever eager to prove themselves potent in the eyes of the village and, most importantly, in the prying eyes of the Lann. Though the magic white light emanating from the contraption may have scared the army once, further technology must be attained so that they may conquer the horde of heathens at their threshold. Captured by the Lann eventually, the trio of Carl, Tom, and Owl defuse their situation craftily and return once again to their village where another challenge is thrown at them: the death penalty for trespassing on the ground of the City and overstepping the boundary of the Time Vault and the demons which lurk within.Yet another timely escape brandished by the young whippersnappers of Dalesmen sees them charge back into the City once and for all to gain control of the technology within the Time Vault, whether the City inhabitants or the Lann can stop them.------------Joachim is right when he states the juvenility of this novel. The gallivanting between their village, through the enemy's encampment, to the derelict perches of the City's skyscrapers is repetitive. The Vault holds such wonder to the trio of boys, but it also holds wonder in the reader. However, don't expect to be immersed in the ancient wonders of the Vault's bounty because only a handful of pages pertain to the Vault's treasures.You should familiarize yourself with some of the science lingo before dipping your toes into this science fiction novel:Smiting sabers, lancing pikes, gleaming shields, fringed buckskin breeches, sledging hammers, silver-studded boots... stop me when this begins to sound more like science fiction than fantasy or historical fiction... thudding hooves, drawn bows, quivers of arrows, moccasined feet, fur-lined tunics, saddle blankets, catapults... I could go on... hamstringing swords, creaking wagons, fur-trimmed boots, etc.It's not really that bad but it does drag on.I wasn't sympathetic with anyone in this novel, be they a person or a tribe: the morally high-grounded post-apocalyptic tribe (before post-apocalyptic was \"cool\") of Dalesmen pitted against the advancing threat of an impoverished clan from the Lann. Perhaps the Lann came at the encroachment the wrong way, with force, rather than diplomatically, but I didn't feel sorry for the villages left in their wake or those who had yet to feel the brunt of the great Lann warrior clan.The greedy territorial advance of the Lann army is synonymous to the technological lust of the Dalesmen youth. Where the Lann simply wanted land to live and thrive on, the Dalesmen youth look to the non-solution of technology to solve their problem of invasion. In the Time Vault itself, there were more than mere inventions of gunpowder and electricity, but there must have also been the inventions of the mind, something which they felt they could easily bypass. This reliance on knowing of technology rather than the knowledge of technology casts a dim view on the young bandits, be it for the greater cause or less. Even when they discuss to share the treasures within, they mention the material good rather than the good of knowledge.Even Doctor Donn says, \"There is no evil in the vault. There is only evil in the hearts of men. Knowledge, all knowledge, is good\" (187). If this were true in the context of the story, then why would the Dalesmen tribe offer to share the Vault's technology with competing clans when the exchange of ethics, morality, or religion could better change the \"hearts of men\" than a schooner could? Presuming the Vault is full of not only the world's most important technologies, but also full of the virtues of the world's most gifted thinkers, I would think the first thing to share would be the goodness of words, not the goodness of the material wealth.This will be one of the few Anderson novels that will be taken back to the second-hand bookstore. It's a pity that even the cover isn't noteworthy. I'll remind myself in the future to steer clear of Poul Anderson's historically themed novels if they don't include absurdity like The High Crusade. Now I'm only left with The Psycho-Technic League (1981) on my shelves... an ominous sign that I either need for Anderson, or none at all. Considering his wealth of material, there must be tastier morsels out there.","Poul Anderson's \"Vault of the Ages\" is a good tale of life going on after all is lost. Set 500 years after a nuclear disaster, a tribe in what is now the Alleghanies tries desparately to keep an invader from taking over. The son of a chiefian seeks shelter in a place that the others in his tribe are afraid of, and finds a very large time capsule in which the technology of our day is preserved in record. The rest deals with the invading horde which desparately needs fertile land or it'll strave and the fears of the tribe. Anderson showed his good writing from the beginning","This contains very succinct writing that conveys a very imaginative glimpse of a fictional post-apocalyptic future where civilization is about to be re-kindled. Very well written. The author doesn't get extravagant or excessive. This book is much more enjoyable when you maintain the perspective of what our culture was like when this book was written. It's also helpful to keep in mind that science fiction was comparatively rare when this book was written.","I love to read anything by Anderson, and decided on this because it is short and looked like a quick read. I knew going in that it was published in 1952, and tried mightily not to let that cloud my judgement. I have read many books in the genre from that time period, and most of them suffer at least a little from the changed times.Anderson's books are always polished and concise, and this one is no exception. The writing is clear and to the point, without being boring. It is a fine adventure story, and would likely have appealed to a young audience of the time, who undoubtedly would have found it exciting. Perhaps that would still be the case today, but the odds are that the overwhelming supply of these types of post-apocalyptic adventures written since this book appeared would provide a lot of competition. The story here is really all about the adventure and struggle that the young protagonist embarks upon, and the time vault is the vehicle for the adventure. The vault itself is only vaguely described, as far as its contents are concerned, and that is okay because it clearly is not the point of the book. The vault serves to provide a possible source of unity among otherwise warring tribes, who differ in their views about the possible harm or potential benefit the vault could provide humanity. Much of the book describes tribal warfare, but there are some memorable scenes that occur at the site of the time vault.If you are a fan of early science fiction, meaning perhaps the golden age or just a bit later (such as this book), you won't be disappointed with this. If you are a fan of Anderson, you'll enjoy it. If a young reader wishes to read this, the effect will likely not be the same as it was for young readers of the time. Unfortunately, in my view, excitement today is derived from a lot more dazzle and glitter than the days of this book. To be fair, there are many fine books of this type out there, and my rating takes that into account. I'm unable to view this, as it turns out, in a vacuum consisting of 1950's science fiction. This is a fine book for what it is, and I enjoyed reading it.","Vault of the Ages (1952), one of Poul Anderson's earliest novels, should not be missed. Although Vault of the Ages is at its core a simplistic juvenile (50s sci-fi for younger readers), Anderson's budding storytelling skills make it engaging and a joy to read. If only I had read it when I was younger! Suggested for any fans of 50s sci-fi, early post-apocalyptical sci-fi, and Poul Anderson completests.Brief Plot SummarySometime in the future the \"Doom\" (caused by atomic weapons) wipes out civilization -- all that remains are intensely superstitious loosely confederated tribes who live in wooden houses and tend livestock. Five hundred years after the Doom somewhere in the Alleghenies a boy named Carl, the son of the chief of the Dalesmen, dares to defy taboos and seek out the City (the ruins of a pre-Doom settlement).The plot concerns an invasion of fierce northern peoples called the Lann. Driven by a cooling climate and attacks from other unnamed peoples, the Lann desire to occupy the lands of the Dalesmen. Unlike other authors who are content to leave the \"barbarian\" enemy a nameless force of evil, Anderson tries give a rational for their actions and even introduces a character in parallel to Carl, Lenard, the son of the chief of the Lann. Like Carl, Lenard also does not fear the taboos and supposed curses and demons associated with ancient technology and the City.Carl is sent to the City to acquire metal (yanked from old skyscrapers) from the \"witches\" (various people who eek out an existence in the ruins). Here Carl finds a time vault with instructions to resurrect ancient technology (including simplistic mechanical technology -- windmills, sailboats, etc).The Dalesmen are suspicious of the time vault and its contents and condemn Carl to death. It's up to him and his few trusted friends to rescue his own people (despite their suspicion of him), raise the taboos on the technology which can deliver his people, and obtain the secrets of the vault before Lenard and the Lann!Final ThoughtsThe plot itself pulls no punches -- it's predictable and free of frills/twists etc. However, Anderson infuses his narrative with energy and excitement. Despite knowing the outcome I found myself rooting for Carl nevertheless! Vault of the Ages is characterized by unbridled optimism and obvious morals -- technology is beneficial if used by the right people and the right people are the idealistic young who push against the boundaries imposed by their elders with the good of society at heart.In frustrating 1950s fashion, the \"idealistic young\" are men... Women are nowhere to be seen.","Have looked at libraries and book stores for this old book for some time and finally found it at Amazon.

      "reviews.text":["Originally released in 1952 under the name \"Star Man's Son\" this story is set in a post-atomic war future. While that may seem cliche, at the time it was quite original. The story focuses on Fors, who lives in a remote mountain village. As the story opens, Fors is passed over for the postion of \"Star Man\" - a man who goes out into the wilderness in search of ancient technology for the village. Fors blames this on the fact that his mother came from a tribe outside the village.Fors decides to abondon his village and sets out for the wilderness anyway, accompanied by Lura - his hunting cat companion. On his journies he encounters various other tribes, mutated wildlife and ruins of the past civilization.Although one of the main messages of the book - an apocalyptic nuclear war is a bad idea - seems obvious now, it is still an enjoyable story. I think the strength of the book is that the focus is kept tightly on Fors. The book does attempt to provide a post-war history, delve into a scientific mistery or reveal a complex political stuggle. Instead it revolves around Fors' desire to vindicate his father's belief in a large undiscovered ruined city, his desire to prove himself to his village, and struggle to warn his village of the growing threat of the \"beast-things\" that live in the ruins. Because the book centers around the protagonist's individual struggles, it does not seem dated in the way that a more technologically focused book would have. The post-war world is revealed enough to keep it intersting, but not so much as to be tiresome.This is a fairly simple sci-fi novel, that younger readers will enjoy. Despite that it does end with some ambiguity. While Fors may experience a personal triumph, what are we to make of the fact that the humans can only be united by a common enemy?","Unfortunately, the author passed away last year. Fortunately, she had time to write a good number of novels. This one, written in the fifties, is a more than average post-apocalyptic novel.It is the story of a mutant who doesn't feel at home in his tribe. One of the early X-Men :).Even if you can read it in a matter of hours, you will find that Andre Norton had plenty to say about the actual world men lives in and not so much about the nuclear war that happened, which is fine by me. The trip of Fors in one of the ruined city and his encounter with the Beast things is very gripping.Usually, I resell the books I read. I am keeping this one.","It has been almost 200 years since the global destruction wrought by nuclear war. The tools of man's technology lie rusting alongside broken roads between ruined cities. In the mountains, the descendants of people who were training to colonize other worlds when war broke out, struggle to survive.After decades of isolation, members of the tribe who have earned the title \"Star Man\" have ventured back into the lowlands. While trained in combat, they are not warriors. They are seekers of lost knowledge, consecrated to the task of recovering their past.Andre Norton's book \"Daybreak: 2250 A. D., originally titled \"Star Man's Son,\" foretells a cautionary tale of the future, one in which humans still have not learned the lessons of the past. The tribe known as The Eyrie are the descendants of scientists and engineers who were sent into the mountains to prepare for life on other worlds. When the affairs of man turned critical, their mission of discovery became a quest for survival.Wary of radiation-induced genetic mutation, the tribe in those first few years took drastic steps to maintain the purity of the human race. In their fear, the Eyrie have isolated and even killed those with characteristics that drift from the norm of humanity. That fear became, over time, a cultural prejudice against anyone who came from the lowlands.Onto this stage steps a young man named Fors. He is the son of an honored explorer, a Star Man, who took to wife a woman of one of the Plains tribes. That union bequeathed to the son hair of silver, the visible flag of mutation. Ostracized by his tribe, he has been denied the honor of following in his father's footsteps.After a youth filled with rejection and bitter prejudice, climaxed by the loss of his last opportunity to be a Star Man, Fors leaves the mountain stronghold of his people and sets out alone on a trail that will change the history of not only his tribe, but all that remains of the human race.Through the eyes of Fors we are given a fascinating glimpse of a post-apocalyptic world; the remains of the last great war of technology. In this world, the survivors of the human race have separated into tribes, each jealously guarding a swath of territory. Relationships between the tribes are bound in suspicion and conflict, but all share a mutual fear of the dwellers of the urban ruins, a human-rat hybrid known as the Beast Things.All of the human tribes have striven to turn their backs on those characteristics which drove the Old Ones to war and destruction. But Norton makes it clear that suspicion and hate, and the inevitable conflict arising from them is an irrefutable part of the human make-up and despite the naive desire for \"world peace,\" it would seem that humans will always reach first for the spear. The climax of the book, when the tribes gather for one last great battle against each other, becomes the moment when Fors steps forward and restores peace. He reminds all present that everyone faces a common enemy in the Beast Things and if humanity is to survive, that they must all band together in mutual support, or by choosing to exterminate each other, leave the planet to the Beast Things.In the ruined cities, we see in the buildings, the towering monuments to man's creativity. Yet, we are forced to come to grips with the truth that even in the face of a terrible lesson, we would still run the risk of destroying our each other. In the conflict between the tribes, we are challenged to rise above our primitive instincts and choose survival. In the travels of Fors, we find our own restless desires to go beyond the horizon; to seek knowledge of distant lands and unknown peoples. And through Fors' experiences, we discover that we can choose friendship; we can choose life; we can choose peace.There few problems with this story, the most pronounced being that it would be virtually impossible for a genetic mutation such as the Beast Things to rise to such an advanced level in less than 200 years. Perhaps 2000 years, but then there would be precious little evidence of the Old Ones left for exploration. The dialogue is pure Tolkien, and at times almost descends into Iambic Pentameter. Despite the stilted language, however, the story is clearly and descriptively told. The descriptions of landscapes and cities tantalizes the reader to consult a road atlas to identify the land where Fors traveled. The description of the big city on the Great Lake that Fors discovers sounds suspiciously like Chicago or Buffalo.At 191 pages, it is a short read, but an intense one. The book moves along rapidly from start to finish and Norton has taken the reader along for the breathless journey.Norton crafted a tale that is part Star Wars, Terminator 3, and Lord of the Rings, although its publishing date, 1952, predates all three. If you enjoyed Tolkien and Lucas, and you feel the hope that the best parts of humankind can always survive and arise from an apocalyptic future, then this book is for you.(A respectful attempt at a sequel: http://starmanssaga.blogspot.com/)","This is a book i read many years ago in middlw school and wanted to get a copy for my son whiole he was in middle school. What a great find and it was in great condition. Thanks.","Saw this in the amazon books available. Read it in High School, and had to read it again. A great read, not as techy as newer sci-fi. Good book.","Alright, most sci-fi fans have seen all the post-apocalyptic movies and played the video games, so seeing or reading about ruined cities is nothing new anymore. This tale though was a real trail-blazer, being written just after the birth of the atomic age. The stories central protagonist (Fors) is believable and deep enough to connect with. The strongest attribute of Daybreak is Norton's vivid and living descriptions of the ruined world of the future. One really gets the feeling that they are seeing the ruined planet through the eyes of the young mutant. I have read this novel about a half a dozen times now and each time I get lost in the descriptions.This is a simple read that is a lot of fun, check it out!","Have not had time to read the book yet. It was an Andre Norton book that I read as a teenager and it must have left a good feeling about it because I had to have it to read again"],

      "reviews.text":["This is in the post-apocalyptic survival genre and is rated 18+ due to violent content. A new virus has spread through humanity, hardening the skin and dissolving internal organs. Those who are still alive are crippled, cybernetic or immune. Meanwhile, the human desire for power continues and there is a new organization looking to rule the world. It's an interesting look at man and nature.This first volume is very good. The art is excellent. The story is introduced well and in an interesting way. I'm looking forward to finding out not only what will happen to the characters, but filling in what has happened in the past.","Finding out that Dark Horse has picked up this amazing manga is one of the most exciting events of the year. It is one of the best series I have ever read, and I am surprised it took so long to be picked up.It takes place in what could be considered a post apocalyptic age of man, but it is nothing like any other post apocalyptic manga out. It is filled with political intrigue, personal drama, and mind blowing plot arcs. The apocalyps is just the beginning and the canvas on which this story is painted.It follows the life of a boy, Elijah, and his travels through the unique anarchic landscape of a world ravaged by a plague known as the Closer virus. With an ensamble of friends of happenstance, vicious enemies, and mosters, Elijah's world is far from the biblical paradise of Eden.The author builds an array of interesting complicated characters, giving time to them as much as any main character, no matter how brief their life in the comic is. They are people for the most part real, aside from some who have been modified cybernetically.As far as the artistry of the graphic novel is concerned, it is precisely that, graphic. It is not a novel for children, and often attacks adult issues head on. Aside from that, the action scenes are dynamic representations of the climax, either emotional or physical, of that scene. No shortage of blood, and guts, but not so splattered across the page as to be considered obscene.These pictures are only there to support the myriad of plots, sub-plots, serializations and cliffhangers that are throughout the manga, as it heads toward an uncertain conclusion. There are twists turns and, growth, actual full fledged growth of the situations present, which become continually profound.Read this manga for its drama, its violence and its imagination, whose vision of a post apocalyptical world can only be described as human.","Eden is an awesome manga. If any manga has achieved a literary state it has to be this one. For example, it doesn't exactly present characters the way other manga do, by showing what they look like, and having them act out in a way that would be characteristic. What Eden did in this volume was present the setting first, and have the characters interact with that setting. Being a post-apocalyptic tale, the setting is key, and having certain people react a certain way to the setting will reveal a lot about that character. Personally, I thought this was brilliantly done, and I felt that I knew Elijah, the main character, well enough to like him, even though he was only in three short chapters of this volume.The story in Eden--in this volume at least--begins with two teenagers, Enoah and Hannah, as they care for their guardian Layne, who's dying of a disease that hardens the skin and turns the insides of a human to mush. While caring for Layne, these kids learn of their responsibility to human-kind, as well as the tragic past that aided in bringing about the apocalypse in which they are living in. Later, the story moves to young Elijah, a boy whose only companion is a robot named Cherubim, as he goes about the everyday job of survival, including scavenging and hunting, as well as dreaming of girls.Though admittedly the story is slow, and very little is given away as to what direction Eden is heading in, I can't knock it for the simple brilliance in which it is unfolding. Hiroki Endo put an emphasis on presenting the stark setting and conditions of living in the volume, and also made it clear that it is an intelligent plot no matter how slow it is. The back cover states that Eden is \"a brilliant love song to post-apocalyptic survival genre\" and I would have to agree on that. Eden is a smart story rivaling even Akira, and one I highly recommend for fans of darker, smarter manga.","Having read the first three volumes so far, I'm blown away. I haven't found a manga this engaging since Akira. At first glance, what appeared to be a typical \"post-apocalytic\" story is actually deeply fascinating on multiple levels, most especially characterization. The technological elements are as well done as anything by Shirow (Ghost in the Shell), perhaps even better, as they are more clearly explained and shown to be a logical extension of present-day technologies. The future the author has created here is totally coherent and convincing. Like the best sci-fi, you feel like you are simply glimpsing one aspect of an enormous world.The visual storytelling is extremely well done. The battle scenes are clearly sequenced and paced in a way that is very cinematic. I found myself racing from panel to panel, my eyes frequently bugging out at dramatic and gory moments that are perfectly presented in service to the larger narrative and the emotional content.The characters are quite convincing and engaging.This is a fantastic piece of entertainment!","A worldwide plague has struck Earth, and there's no cure in sight. The disease is particularly nasty because your skin hardens into rock-like consistency and then your internal organs liquefy and drain out through your orifices! So you have all these statues of people laying around like so many victims of Medusa. A bio-dome named Eden is constructed under UN control to quarantine uninfected humans from the pandemic sweeping the world. Many years later, all that's left of the once hopeful experiment are two adolescents named Enoah and Hannah, who have genetic resistance, and their dying guardian Layne, who is rapidly succumbing to the sickness. The rest of this first volume fills you in on how Eden, which was once a bastion of Man's hopes, has now become an empty shell of its former self. We're also introduced to Cherubim, a military robot which Eden's now dead inhabitants blamed for their destruction. The second half of the book takes up a different thread, 20 years later as a young boy named Elijah, accompanied by Cherubim, fights to survive in the ruins of civilization.This first volume of Eden had it all: Sci-fi, Violence, love, human fears, religious symbolism, and realism. The characters at times feel like mythological, if not Biblical, figures given human shape, but they retain our sympathies. They are protagonists trying to live in a world that has been destroyed by forces on a different level than themselves. As in all times of chaos, factions arise to take advantage of the situation and take control. It's difficult to see how these characters are going to fit into the scheme of things. The little violence in this book is graphic but necessary to tell the story. Death isn't pretty. The art in Eden is some of the best I've ever seen in a manga and is reminescent of a more refined Ghost in the Shell style-wise. Video Girl Ai is another series that is similar in art. This is a gripping and thought provoking first volume in what looks to be a great series.","All I have to say is that this series is by far the best manga/graphic novel I've ever read... This is not the plotless violence that you see in many manga series', Eden's story line is one of the better plots that I've read in quite some time. This series is absolutely incredible and a 'must-read' for everyone who loves... well... anything.","Eden is simply an amazing graphic novel set in a world ravaged by a killer virus, that wipes out the majority of the population. We start with three survivors on an island. A dying man confined to a wheelchair and two children. From this simple begining we delve into complex subject matter. The concept of sin, sexual desire, explore the meaning of life, question the existence of god and man's role in the natural order. Heady stuff to say the least and then there are the mecha robots, cyborgs, mercenaries and global conspiracies. Breathtaking in it's scope and imagination, Hiroki Endo has created a tribute to the cyberpunk and post-apocalyptic survival genre.","Eden Volume 1 is a great addition to the genre of post-apocalyptic literature. While the scenario of a government conspiracy-related pandemic is nothing new, Hiroki Endo's iteration in Volume 1 is worthwhile reading. This book's intricate plot and great character development give the series a strong start. This review comments on three elements of artwork: scenery, characters, and action. The review then discusses plot and storytelling. Finally, it concludes with brief thoughts on the overall series.The characters are drawn with distinctive features without resorting to over-the-top hair profiles and character designs, for which manga is known. The more subdued character design allows the artist to demonstrate the subtle deterioration in health over time, as the infection takes over a person's body. I believe this is one of the book's most distinctive visual characteristics.The artwork is superior to the average manga, with an emphasis on electronics and machinery in interior scenes. Exterior scenes show an interesting mixture of real-world places and architecture. The setting in first half of closely resembles Biosphere 2 in Arizona, while the cityscapes in the second half closely resemble Hong Kong (i.e. Lippo Center). Seeing these buildings somewhat confused me where the intended setting for this story is, but this is fiction after all! And the scenes are beautiful nonetheless.The characters are well developed. Endo successfully introduces a large cast, and is able to give each motivation and weaknesses without being stereotypical. Character development is excellent, and one of the best reasons to read this volume.Volume 1 has the most interesting plot of the Eden series, with big, visionary ideas and layers of conflict. The pacing is good with well-timed flashbacks, dialogue, and action. Each element purposely advances the story, unlike the gratuitous ultra-violence and raunchy sexual dialog of later volumes. Overall, this volume has great artwork and a compelling story--what more can be asked of a manga? I recommend Volume 1.***However, I do not recommend later volumes of Eden, where the overall series takes a bizarre tangential direction, losing Volume 1's focus of survival in a post-apocalyptic world. Every subsequent volume feels detached, like a different genre all together. Volumes 2 and 3 are simply futuristic war stories, with emphasis on brutality and mutilation. Volume 4 is a coming-of-age Yakuza story. Volume 5 is a ghost-in-the-machine story. Volumes 6 and 7 are street gang/drug cartel stories. And so on...I only mention these later volumes because they feel like completely different stories that simply reuse the same characters. Some of the later volumes are interesting in their own right, but together, the books begin to feel like schizophrenic, unfocused storytelling. While reading the later volumes, I got the impression that the original virus piece of the story becomes simply an excuse to explain the ridiculous cyborg-like weaponry implanted into the bodies of villain characters. I believe Eden's original premise of a pandemic-induced societal collapse is so powerful, but is wasted and eventually forgotten halfway through Volume 2."],

Only bad thing is that there's 19 of them. I only read the first one, and want to read the rest but I dont know if I will...","I actually read #3 and #4 before I read the first 2 and I was hooked after that. Its a futuristic battle of good vs evit and it will keep you entrapped until the last page and leave you begging for more. The only problems I had with these books are 1) The Rock can do just about anything except kill the ultimate evil, Col Killov. and 2)Rock gets captured and escapes in just about every book.","Don't get me wrong, I love this genre of literature. the idea for the series sounds great. The problem I have with the series is that it is just too over the top. Ted Rockson is apparently able to do anything in these books and often does, to the point of absurdity. It seems that there seriously is only one man that can save america from the russians, ted rockson! The author of the novels seems to write it so that the only american in the novel that understands combat tactics is rockson, in the 1st chapter of the 1st book he pulls off some stuff that is so insanely over the top that it was real hard for me to continue reading. The author also goes to great lengths to insure that the hero of the story is also the most interesting character in the book, he has eyes of 2 different colors and a stripe of white hair down the middle of his regular black hair. Also the author for some reason thinks that 9mm is the coolest ammo in the world, often having the characters use their 9mm \"liberators\" for uses that the ammo is not designed or good for. The use of grenades by the characters is stupid also, one character is written as pulling the pins on 2 grenades and throwing them at helicopters. it should have been written as he attempted to pull the pin on a grenade with his teeth and yanked out 2 of his teeth and then the helicopter shot him for being an idiot. So if you want a book packed full of miracle shots, a godlike hero completely surrounded by a bumbling renegade american force that relies soley on him for ideas, and idiotically over the top action sequences, this book is for you. or your children, whatever. just don't buy it full price."],

      "reviews.text":["\"No Blade of Grass\" stands out from most post-apocolyptic or \"survival\" scifi in that the disaster that starts things off is not the predictable nuclear war or the occasional asteroid hit, but rather an environmental disaster. The first portion of the book, in which various characters sit by and swallow whole the lies being fed them by their government and the media about an innocuous virus that is killing all the rice in China, feels chillingly realistic and all too possible. Although written in 1956, one imagines that the response of modern governments to a similar situation today would be little different. The second half of the book, in which the main characters endeavor to save themselves by making a cross-country trek to a safe haven, focuses on what one individual, particularly a parent, would do under such dire circumstances to survive. The novel is saved from falling into predictability through strong writing and believable characters that kept me turning the pages until the very end.","The idea behind this book is fascinating: how does one country handle a food crisis caused by a virus (in this case the country is China & the virus destroys rice crops)? If & when the virus spreads throughout the world, destroying all grasses & grains, would civilazation survive, or would societies revert back to Middle - Ages brutality?While I do agree with john Christopher that civilazation will not last very long under these conditions, but I don't gree with his black & white attitude toards the events occuring after civlazation breaks down & each man is out to save himself, & maybe the few people close to him.","This is now out of print: cheap paperback editions from the 60's are now selling for forty or fifty bucks. Most of John Christopher's stuff (actual name: Samuel Youd) is for pre-teens, but this novel is for adults -- though it is a short one.This book manages to be both gripping and depressing, but it's not without its problems:1. It seems to take forever to get started.2. I would say that characterization in this novel is a minus. Christopher throws too many characters at you too fast. Since he doesn't bother to distinguish them much, it's a bit hard to tell them apart until the middle of the novel. But once the middle of the novel hits, even more come along.The one thing I liked about this novel was that our heroes, in an attempt to survive, resort to murdering innocent people using an \"either us or them\" philosophy. Since you don't see that very often in the post-Apocalyptic genre, I would recommend it in that respect.","The basic idea of this young adult story is really interesting. A mutant virus has appeared, but it only affects certain plants, not humans or animals. \"Well, that doesn't sound so bad,\" you say? Wrong! The virus destroys all grasses and grains. This not only means brown lawns in the suburbs, but also leads to a total lack of food for cattle and other livestock. Furthermore, it entails a similarly utter lack of wheat and grain, for humans. Within a year, terrible famine spreads throughout the world. Civilization collapses. The few scared, skinny survivors who remain huddle together in isolated valleys, growing rare virus-resistant potatos for food, and fighting off bands of marauding scavengers.The premise of this story is really intriguing and provocative. However, as usual, John Christopher is too preoccupied with creating extremely brutal, murderous, unnecessarily tough-guy characters. He did this in the Tripod Trilogy, he did it in \"The Long Winter,\" and he does it again here. I personally think that characters like this seem to take up residence in a reader's unconscious mind. For literally years to come, they can provide a feeling of justification for all kinds of mean, evil behavior. Why not write about people who make things work out? Why not focus on the good? Or at least, why not write about the scientific elements of this virus, and a scientific struggle to cure it?If you'd like to read some nonfiction about this kind of scenario, I'd like to recommend \"Catastrophe: An Investigation into the Origins of Modern Civilization,\" by David Keys. That book is about similarly widespread famines, and struggles which the author believes may have taken place during the medieval period. Or, you might wish to read \"The New Nuclear Danger,\" by Dr. Helen Caldicott. Anyway, \"No Blade of Grass\" is interesting in a way, but it has too much negativity. One thumb partly up.","I am a big fan of post apocolypse and alternative future fiction, and as this is a somewhat different type of disaster, I pounced on it with eager anticipation. The plot has been covered quite well by other writers here - death to all forms of grass and the chaos that ensues, so I won't add to this in any detail.What I will voice is my disappointment in the book. What I like about this genre of fiction is that it tends to show people surviving under the worst conditions that can be thrown at them, and to a degree this is no different. However, what we do have in this story is a group of essentially decent people descending into barbarism, and whereas this is in all probability entirely what would happen, it doesn't necessarily make for an entertaining read. My preference is for the characters to step up to the unthinkable challenges and become better people in themselves.Added to a relatively weak plot line, these unpleasant characters make for a disappointing novel. It is an interesting enough book, for its rarity and unusual take on the \"end of the world as we know it\", but it's definitely not among the best.","This was and is a great book, and needs to be made available again.A post apocalypse classic.Doc","Christopher has done a good job with this format of science fiction. This novel rates up there with Lucifer's Hammer by Niven. Although it is out of print, try to find it. You'll be glad you did. By the way, could it happen? Hmmm.....","Although quite old (first published in 1956) and not very long (barely two hundred pages), this is a very good \"post-apocalyptic\" novel, which didn't age much and still packs an impressive punch. As the title indicates, the story develops in a time when a deadly virus decimates all kinds of grass on the whole planet - and that includes all the main crops... This causes a worldwide collapse of modern society and this book describes those times in Great Britain, on the example of tribulations of a group of people gathered around an architect named John Custance. The small band travelling through the country to find a safe refuge includes Custance's friend Roger Buckley (a civil servant), a certain Harold Pirrie (a somehow aged gun shop owner - a particularly interesting and important character) and their families.The story of their trek through a country where all civil order quickly collapses is an excellent study on the fragility of complex and advanced societies when the situation forces people to focus on the most basic priority - physical survival of themselves and their families, at all price, in an extremely hostile environment, in which every error, hesitation and/or weakness means a horrible death. All involved will find in themselves surprising ressources and will do - finally quite easily - things they wouldn't even believe possible barely a week before. The transformation of John Custance and his small tribe during this voyage is almost incredible and the way it is described constitutes the reason why this book didn't really age. I believe \"No blade of grass\" will be still as relevant and interesting in AD 2056 (one hundred years after its first publication) as it is today...I do not want to provide too much SPOILERS, but be warned, that this is a very tough book and it can particularly shock women - and especially for any feminist the reading of some of the pages can be life threatening, as in this new horribly barbaric world strong and violent men exerce an almost total power... The ending is extremely sad and shocking, but also very clever and highly symbolic, clearly inspired by some of the most ancient myths, like the foundation of Rome and the Arthurian legends (sovereignty of a warlord being confirmed and sanctified by the receiving of a \"magic\" weapon).","John Christopher was one of a small band of British Sci-Fi writers writing in the 1950s and 1960s who delighted in destroying civilisation in an amazing array of natural and unnatural ways. The results are future dystopias that have given us some true classics: The Day of the Triffids by John Wyndham for instance.This work is not as well known as the Triffids, but in this genre, I think it really should be. this is no formulaic treatment of the subject, but rather was an original, intelligen and thoughtful story set in a world in which grasses are wiped out by disease. Without grasses we lose cereals (when I read this first as a teenager, it was news to me that cereals including Maize are grasses!). Without cereals and grazing land, the food crisis quickly becomes acute.The story focuses on two brothers - well one of them in particular, and his fight to survive and make a new life for himself as society quickly disintegrates. John Christopher writes it well, and I think this may well be his best work (I have read them all).I first read this as a teenager, and I was deeply affected by this book. Definitely a moving story designed to make you think. Throughly recommended. Personally I think its better than Day of the Triffids. Even if you disagree, you ought to enjoy it.","This was a little bit of a slow starter but once I could see where things were heading every sentence was laden with a sense of dread and impending doom.A widow leaves a dreary London behind and returns to her girlhood home along with her sons. She is anxious to reunite and repair her strained relationship with her dad and share the joy of a hillside surrounded by lush green pasture with her boys.25 years later John has taken to life in the city and fathered two children; David has devoted his life to the farm and remained a bachelor. All seems idyllic but then they start speaking of the rabbit plagues in Australia and a virus attacking rice crops in Hong Kong and millions starving and resorting to cannibalism. When David removes a patch of pesky rice grass and discovers it is diseased things start to take on bleak outlook and he tells John to return to the farm before things get desperate. John returns to his life in the city unwisely waiting far too long as things begin to take a turn towards the bleak.Thus begins a nicely detailed onset of the apocalypse and a tale of greed, morality and the breakdown of civilization. The most disturbing thing about this story was just how quickly the darker instincts bubbled to the surface of the characters when they were faced with their own mortality and forced to protect those they loved.This book focuses strongly on the breakdown of society and it is effectively chilling in its portrayal of the desperation for all involved. It truly is survival of the fittest and gets pretty brutal, pretty quickly. Our stubborn city boy is now on a road trip through hell with his young family and some friends, picking up guns and stragglers to strengthen their numbers and attempt to find safe haven. But, really, will anywhere be safe?This was very disturbing read considering the background for this apocalypse, that it affects major food systems and that when the story takes place half the food consumed was imported from other countries. It would be so simple to have a food breakdown nowadays. How many of us are even somewhat self-sufficient? Where would we begin?Some of the most blood chilling quotes for me:\"Things will be hard, but it may not be a bad life. It will be up to us what we make of it. At least, we shall be our masters. It will no longer be a matter of living on the sufferance of a State that cheats and bullies and swindles its citizens and, at last, when they become a burden, murders them.\"\"The country's food position is desperate. No more grain, meat, foodstuffs of any kind, are being sent from overseas. We have nothing to eat but what we can grow out of our own soil, or fish from our own coasts.\"Shudder, I don't want to ponder on this too long when I should be building my chicken coop out back!","Interesting...but not what I was expecting at all, considering the premise of the book. I thought the book would be more about the circumstances that led to the premise of the story than that 85% of the book was the group traveling from London to the farm and the situations they came across along the way. And I didn't really get the end....A good read, a good story, and definitely a classic.","Interesting book. A world-wide crop disease starves most of the world causing widespread famine and the associated breakdown in law and orders.A small band makes their way from London to a safe place in the country.It didn't go as far as I would have liked; it never showed them dealing with the challenges of maintaining their refuge.I would recommend it.John Severson","NBOG has always been one of my favorite apcoalypse books, combining a fast moving plot with well defined characters and thought-provoking questions.Like most post-apocalyptic novels, No Blade of Grass ostensibly focuses on the effects of, in this case, an ecological holocaust, on the lives of a small band of survivors in post-apocalypse Britain. The tale turns on what these survivors must do to reach \"safety\" on a small farm in a protected valley far from urban centers. In this, the book differs quite dramatically from much of the rest of this genre. Rather than dwelling on the problems faced when the world's population is decimated, NBOG poses the much more interesting question: What happens when most of the food supply is destroyed while most of the population remains? Christopher's answers will provoke, even anger you. But, whatever your response, the situations he poses must be taken seriously.This is a book well worth reading together with Earth Abides or Lucifer's Hammer. Though both books take the more conventional route of killing off 99% of the world's population (the first by disease the second by a meteor), they deal with similar questions regarding civilization yet come to different answers. For my money, while NBOG's answers are the most distasteful, they are also the most realistic.","John Christopher writes some pretty gripping science fiction novels about alien invasions (The Tripod trilogy) catastrophic shifts in the earth's weather (The Long Winter) and terrifying tales of the savagery that humans revert to when civilization breaks down (A Wrinkle In The Skin)-- potent stuff indeed. His books share with JG BALLARD a fascination for post-apocalyptic settings but are really psychological character studies about how people change to fit their environments. This book is perhaps Christopher at his starkest and most frightening. A man simply tries to take his family safely out of London to his brother's farm in the North after a genetically engineered bio-weapon gets out of control and wipes out the world's food supply, causing anarchy and chaos to erupt all over the globe.It is interesting to note that on the page the protagonist's actions and \"him or me\" ethos seem to make much more sense than they do in Cornel Wilde's gonzo 1970 film adaptaion, where the main character comes off as much more trigger-happy and casually lethal & ruthless than in the novel; one might say its only a matter of degree once the civilized world has crumbled but that doesn't make it any more palatable. Sounds like a bad review, doesn't it? On the contrary, today almost all of John Christopher's nightmare scenarios seem only a few CNN headlines away...and thus more compelling than ever.","Most apocalyptic novels are marked by spectacular explosions, loathesome invaders, or the like. This one is not. Instead, in a very believable scenario, a rice virus develops in China, and the Chinese government tries to keep it secret. However, when the great famine develops, the UN comes up with an isotope that stops it. But the cure is worse than the disease, for this allows an all encompassing grass virus to come out of hiding.What follows is a civilization ending virus that kills all grasses, including all food grains. So, in one swoop, livestock and grain are gone. The Eastern hemisphere descends into famine and cannibalism. In England, the site of the story, the government decides to use H-Bombs on the cities to alleviate the famine. All well and good, and frighteningly believable.But what isn't at all credible, and what detracts from the book is the tale of a few people who go into a small, secluded English valley to live on potatoes and root crops. Except for a brief foray, the group faces no meaningful attack, and the book ends with the Western Hemisphere intact, and the valley's few survivors planning to build new cities. The ending is a sop to the desire to give some hope where none would exist. Personally, I much prefer George Stewart's much more honest approach in &quot;Earth Abides.&quot;","It's been years since I read &quot;No Blade of Grass.&quot; It's a story that should not go out of print, but has. It has the same haunting quality as &quot;On The Beach,&quot; or &quot;Alas Babylon.&quot; They depicted a world following a nuclear war, with differing results. This story uses a grass blight to achieve basically the same result, a world-wide disaster that presages the end of civilization as we know it.The story itself takes place in England, and portrays the events following the destruction of all grass species by disease, including grains, with the resultant loss of grazing animals and looming human starvation.The main story is the human reactions that follow--how the characters cope with the situation, and how they react and are changed by the anarchy that results. The story promotes thought about how much we rely on external controls in our daily life, and the necessity of individual internal control in our everyday struggle for existence, especially in such dramatic life-threatening situations.A good book, if you can find a copy.Joseph Pierre","No Blade of Grass is even more timely today than when it was written. The plotline is familiar. It shows a very dark view of ordinary people trying to cope with the end of the world. That is well-done but it is the fact that the collapse of civilization is not from nuclear war or such but from a simple virus. The virus kills all members of the grass family. When you consider how many major food crops would be affected and then the domino effect of the loss of feed for animals, you are reminded of how truly vulnerable life on earth is and how easily the balance can be upset. I don't know if John Christopher was being prophetic or simply wanted a different sort of disaster for background, but with today's concerns about viruses, the book is chillingly real.","A chilling study of the start of a new Dark Ages, written in a John Wyndham style. John Christopher's excellent novel charts the fall of the human race into barbarism after a disease wipes out all grass crops. Powerful and unfortunately all too believable. Track down this book and read - it will haunt you for ages after.","The novel is as brilliant as ever and shares an important place in speculative fiction despite its frequent imitators. This is the book that defined Christopher's reputation for creating believable characters and placing them in precarious situations to the pleasure of the reading public. FIND THIS NOVEL and set it alongside the Tripod Trilogy. You won't find that damned movie, this I can tell you.","No Blade of Grass is story of an agricultural experiment gone totally awry. It attacks all grain like produce(oats, wheat, alphalfa, etc)and kills them without mercy. When the worlds best can't stop it and panic across the world becomes the norm. The story ends up following a group of people who join together to reach a farm in Ireland that grows potatoes, one of the crops not affected by the grass killer. I highly recomend this story for anyone who likes good scifi and human conflict tales. I read this book when I was freshman in high school at the behest of my father. And though I resisted at first I grew to like this book as I contiued to read it. This is a book no personal library should be without,","This was published in the USA as No Blade of Grass, but was originally published in the UK as The Death of Grass. An absolutely awful movie, titled No Blade of Grass, was made in the US and did not do well here, nor did it deserve to.It was classed as juvenile fiction or Young Adult Sci Fi here in the US and was never considered a classic or a must-read. A few forward-thinking teachers once had it on their reading lists for teens or used it as an alternate in the middle school grades in the 170s and 80s, ie: the kids could choose between this and other, more mainstream fiction.It is an excellent book, with a believable plot and chillingly accurate details; psycholgical profiles of most characters, for the most part, do not seem intusive, but naturally part of the narrative. These people and their thought proceeses and behaviors, given their circumstances, seem real and unforced.Though, near the end, the rather broad strokes he paints a few characters with---notably the large, stodgy family who are hangers- on, not leaders and who are not cut out for this new world, where people survive by wit and skill---stand out badly in contrast to the rest. A little preachy there, I thought.Why it is that this book has not been reprinted or made more easily available to all readers, regardless of age, I will never understand. I did read somewhere that the author, who writes here under the pseudonym of John Christopher, had stated, long after its first publishing in the UK, that he did not wish it to be reprinted (but as he does not own the full international copyright, I am not sure if that alone is enough to prevent it). The author's real name was Christopher Youd. [...]Unlike On The Beach, which was published in the same vein and time period, it begins not with a devasting man-made accident, but an event completely natural and more realistic---a disease affects all the graminae--grass---plants.Sounds simple, right? But as the disease organism naturally fights to survive, it mutates, as do many naturally occuring molds and viruses now. Man unintentionally worsens the advancing disease, as they interfere with and ultimately strengthen a strain they hadn't known existed, until its dormant version rears its ugly head.It reminded me a bit of the current medical and scientific problems we face, one example being MRSA vs the current roster of antibiotics. If that nasty little bug ever gets out of control, we'll all need our own happy valley to retreat to.","I found this book at the library. I had heard of it. My father told me it was published as a serialized novel in the Saturday Evening Post when he was a teenager, which caused a lot of controversy. Many people found the novel upsetting. Though somewhat tame by today's standards it is still a potent look at civilization crumbling after a plague wipes out all grass, wheat, oats, and other plants destroying most of the world's food supply. It is great in showing how quickly civilized people very well could resort to violence once civilization no longer exists. The characters and well drawn and intriguing, especially the gun expert. I recommend it."],

      "reviews.text":["This is a classic end-of-the-world novel. The plot develops with rigourous precision and inexorable realism; there's nothing Brin depicts that would be unreasonable should a global A-B-C war actually engulf the world to-morrow. Scary in its plausibility, and heartening because of its hopefulness, this is a wonderful book.Warning: I'd call this a 'PG-13' book, primarily because of some of the violence.","The movie was ok, but the book was great (how often do you hear that!). This was an engaging look at the life of a man doing what he needed to survive, while giving hope by accident. The story moves along quickly, and I couldn't put the book down. A great buy!","It starts off very well, the story draws you in immediately and I really liked the main character. It could have been a five star book, but for me persnally, the story fell apart in the second half with the super soldiers. The battle, as I read it and drew it in my head, seemed a little silly to me. But through it all I couldn't help pulling for the main character and the hope of a new beginning. If you like sci-fi, this is definately worth reading.","I first read the Postman when I was 18 and I loved it then but it just gets better with age. Kevin Costner's desecration of this book remains one of the greatest cinematographic crimes of all time.","Excellent and uplifting tale about trying to knit at least part of the US back together after a nuclear war. Good characters and believable plot. Ranks up there with Alas Babylon but reads more up to date. If you like stories about what happens after the end of the modern world (with no zombies!), don't miss this one.","I saw the movie first so was worried that i would not finish this book cause i already knew the story. But not the case at all! Nothing like the movie and much better!","Though dated the material holds up well. Quite a contrast to the movie,which is usually the case. Now that women are allowed in battle gave it a touch of poignancy.","I listened to the audio book and it completely pulled me in. Perhaps it was because it is set in a part of Oregon I know and love. Perhaps it was the reader. However, I think what pulled me in the most was the engaging story.Set in a post apocalyptic Oregon, a drifter spends a night in an old, abandoned/forgotten U.S. Mail jeep to keep warm and avoid a gang intent on beating him up. He steals the long dead postman's uniform for warmth and a few letters to read to pass the time. However, in his travels, he discovers the people are thrilled to have a postman around and he invents a story of being a postal inspector from a recovering government. The problem is his lies get bigger and more complex as he passes village to village, fulfilling the fantasies of the people and passing letters around. As his prestige grows, he finds himself at odds with local warlords and maintaining the facade of his creation.Brin writes a very tight story, examining the aspects of maintaining a lie and the inner turmoil of a weak-willed nobody who enjoys the perks and prestige his fabrications bring. I enjoyed watching the evolution into the leader he becomes and the change in his morals. Along the way, unbeknownst to him, he becomes the lie, making it a lie no longer.","I really enjoyed this novel. Brin did a great job giving some life to the main character Gordon Krantz. Gordon continued to fight his hardest to escape the lies he built only to fall deeper into them. With each lie however, hope is given to the surrounding towns and each look to Gordon as their savior. There are not huge levels of Sci-fi, but this is still a great post apocalyptic story.Now moving on to the movie adaptation. I thoroughly enjoyed the book just as much as I enjoyed the movie however, for two completely different reasons. Kevin Costner pretty much read the novel while he was doing work around the house, because he must have taken the script and had at it with the weed whacker, then stomped on it with his golf shoe, and topped it off by using a flamethrower. Whatever pieces were left over he made the movie and then mainlined some coke, then decided to make his own movie/ending. However, as unlike as the novel and the movie are I did really like Kevin Costner's movie, but I enjoy it as if it were a completely different concept involving a postman.","It feels a little odd to review a book so old that even the film version is practically archaic. But a friend only recently got me reading Brin, and this Brin book is my favorite so far. I love this book. For a start, I love the contemplative tone of the writing, and I enjoy following the protag, Gordon, through a post-apocalyptic Oregon. It's pretty fantastic to walk through a broken form of Eugene and a torn-up U of O campus, and then to travel farther up north where a civilized society has reseeded itself. Conceptually, the survival mechanism of pretending to be a postman is a compelling one because it quickly takes on a larger meaning than that of Gordon's survival. People place their hopes in weird ideals, and the postman represents the ideal of a unified nation. It represents the benefits that infrastructure brings to humanity--lofty dreams of education, wealth, and order. While the protag's main focus is to stay alive, the stolen uniform and a handful of old mail--that's it--enliven the people around him to desire more than base survival. The falseness doesn't matter, though, nor does it matter that what is driving the renewed civilization up north is also a facade. Hope (or magical thinking) is just that powerful. Also, I love that none of the romances pan out (unlike in the god-awful movie)--romance isn't the point at all, except in the pragmatic sense that Abby's husband has something to fight for after Abby becomes pregnant from Gordon's \"donated\" sperm. This isn't a false ideal of hope at all, and one that men need, I think, in order to build a society. It has a cyclical cause and effect to it.All in all, the thinky nature of the story is studded with enough action scenes to keep up the tension. I only suffered through a few eyerolls owing to the fact that the evil survivalists (whom Gordon must ultimately fight) live along the Rogue River in southern Oregon. Those who know Oregon will recognize that stereotype--oh, you know, the one about white militias stockpiling weapons. Yup. That was about my only criticism.","The novel the movie with the same name was based on is much better (although I admit to liking the film as well). Gordon Krantz is a wandering minstrel in a post-apocalyptic hell. Robbed by lesser survivalists, he comes across a post-Doomwar US Post Office vehicle with its dead driver inside. Intent on surviving, he dresses himself in the long-dead man's uniform, bringing the \"last idealist\" to a new role: that of a postman representing the Restored United States (a ruse to keep him alive). What he discovers is that people long for symbols to inspire them and unite. That, plus the common cause of stopping a Holnist ultra-survivalist invasion, return a bit of humanity to the long-suffering survivors as they struggle to rebuild from the ashes of the past.","David Brin's \"The Postman\" is a post-apocalyptic novel depicting civilization following a nuclear war which almost wiped out all of humanity. The main character, Gordon Krantz, spent many years following the disaster as a loner, drifting from place to place in search of a leader. He knew society could be repaired, and he wanted to follow a leader. Without giving away the plot, Gordon assumes the role of a Postman and many changes follow.I enjoyed this book because it really showed man at his best and worst. Brin paints a picture of the many ways in which different people react to situations. Some hide, others exist, some rebuild and some hunt and destroy. Gordon's character was a leader despite the fact he only wanted to follow.Brin makes you question your own actions were you in a similar situation. How would you respond? Be a sheep, a mole, a dove or a hawk?The book reads quickly and easily and would be appropriate for high schoolers.","Don't let the horrible movie spoil this book for you; they are very different bodies of work. In fact, if I were Brin, I'm not sure how I would have let that movie hit the screens, but that's not really relevant to this review.This is a post-apocolyptic tale of a survivor who runs across the remains of a US postal worker, and dons his uniform to stay alive. Soon he discovers that the uniform gives him an instant authority with people which allows him access to places he might otherwise be shut out of. He discovers that this authority comes with a price, and he finds himself fighting for his life and the lives of the people he's met and trying to defend against the attacks of an army of ruthless survivalist armies.Brin only briefly describes how the world ended in this book, and that is only over time. Since the reasons for the apocolypse are not very important to the story, it probably would have seemed out of place to have added them. I wanted to point that out because at times fans of post-apocolypse works tend to be looking for a new and imaginative way for humanity to destroy themselves, so be warned you won't find it here.Brin doesn't go very deep into his character development. Other than Gordon, we don't learn very much about the supporting cast, even though a few of them have very prominant roles in the book.The story itself was entertaining for me, and I found it to be a quick read. It was interesting to watch Gordon get himself deeper and deeper into his charade, and to see the desperation of many of the survivors to find something to believe in. I think Brin really captured what life may be like for the early survivors of a world-ending war who remember the past but may not have totally lost hope that the old world would rise again.Also, as Gordon got back into touch with more survivors, he began to morph back from the survivor to \"the idealist\", which often put his life in danger, which was the opposite of how he would have acted before he found the postman's uniform.Mr. Brin does not seem to be a big fan of the survivalist movement, and one of the heroes of the story is femenisim; so if these things bother you, you might want to avoid this book. I was worried that Brin was going to end the book laying this on a little too thick, but in the end it was well put together.I've seen reviews stating that this isn't Brin's best work, but I thought he did rather well. It was concise; perhaps a bit spare on the character development, and I thought the whole plot was imaginative, so I'm looking forward to reading more books by him.I would recommend this book to anyone.","Anyone who saw the movie and thinks they know what happens now so the novel is ruined for them, or who disliked the film for its cheezy and epic required dramatic music etc. (I loved it myself!) shouldn't be put off reading the novel! Although the theme of hope and the symbol of a postman beginning to reunite a nation is the same, (and the occasional character or event) essentially it is completely different...Brin's writing style is enjoyable but not constantly completely engrossing like Michael Marshall Smith (amazing sci-fi writer!)or Anne Rice, for example, but the imagination and scope and detail, the characters and ideals and events that he describes are so real - he really recreates the whole world (well, the US anyway) post-apocalypse and its very believable. Towards the end I was completely enraptured in the events and its a great book!If you've seen the film dont be put off when you're reading by thinking you know what happens next, go into it with an open mind because what happens is almost completely different...","In my experience, if something exists as both a book and a movie, whichever I encounter first is the one that I like best and &quot;The Postman&quot; is no exception. I do feel that the Costner film would have benefitted GREATLY from the detailed explanation of the circumstances which led to society's collapse and the rise of the Holnists which Brin provides in his novel. However, by trimming the fat from the novel (a priesthood of timid computer nerds, a brooding hippie-cyborg)Costner actually created a more believeable story.It has been stated several times that the novel's greatest weakness is that Brin tries to cram too many themes into too small a space. The novel goes from being an engrossing study into societal decay and the power of myth to inspire hope to a treatise on male/female social dynamics in the space of a few pages without us understanding why. Likewise, Brin transfers the source of horror surrounding the evil Holnists from their ghoulish and all-too-plausible socio-political beliefs to an a contrived, overused device of man fusing with machine to create the ultimate evil. Like many others, I also found the ending to be rushed and unsatisfying.However, I overall I really did like this story very much. Try not to view it and the movie as the same story, but two entirely seperate imaginings of how the same story *might* have happened. A very worhtwhile read for any fan of speculative or apocalyptic ficiton.","This is the most thought provoking end of the world novel since Lucifer's Hammer. David Brin takes up the question of what roles government, and leadership take in our society. He points to a need for people to take responsibility. The main character in the novel finds out, quite accidentally, that all that is needed for people to recover from the most terrible tragedies is a sense of direction and leadership. This book gives one of the most candid views on how people respond to our government, and helps to remind us what kind of effort it has taken to build this country.In the novel, the main character finds an old postal uniform with some ten year old letters, and finds out that something as simple as someone delivering mail can bring people hope. He then finds that this helps people remember that they were once part of something greater than themselves. This book manages to be inspiring without droping down to the level of a cheesy disney movie.The only reason this book doens't get five stars from me is that I felt the end cheated in a way that made it lose some its focus. But this hardly overshadows the brilliant bulk of this book.","Anyone who fears a world war should read this book. It is obvious that the author knows a lot about politics and is well read. This book presents an interesting main character, good plot, great setting, and believable back up characters to create a dynamic read overall.","Mr Brin wastes no time in posing the hard questions: What really constitutes civilization? How much of it is illusion? How might that quintessentially american virtue -- rugged individualism -- turn out to be America's undoing? And in asking these questions he lays the groundwork for a philosophical and cautionary tale that might've compared favorably to A Canticle For Leibowitz -- if only he'd been able to carry through with it.Instead, inexplicibly, The Postman changes genres in mid-stream and transmogrifies from philosophical musings to cartoonish action in the space of just a few pages. The big questions posed at the beginning are never really answered. The bad guys, who might otherwise have caused an NRA type to stop and give his philosophy a serious second thought, are all two-dimensional sub-human supermen with no believable motivation for thier bizzare actions. And to top it all off, at the end we're treated with a deus ex machina that would've choked Sophocles.A disappointing ending to what had otherwise promised to be an excellent book.","I found this to be Brin's most frustrating book.The Postman's America went out with whimper, not with a bang. The exact cause is unimportant, and I'm not even sure it's revealed. (Nuclear weapons were used, but they seemed to be a last gasp as nations collapsed.)The true cause of the collapse was the vermin who nibble on the edges of our soul; they caused America to lose faith in herself. When the inevitable rough spot happened people just resigned themselves to the &quot;inevitable.&quot; America collapsed into isolated feudal societies; most of these pocket fiefdoms were ruled by &quot;survivalists&quot; who had pushed the country over the edge with their own egocentricism.Many years later our protagonist arrives in Oregon. He is no hero; instead of fighting to improve his own town he was hoping to find a mythical land of easy living. He's attacked and barely escapes with his life. To survive he takes a postman's uniform which dates to the collapse. He also takes the postman's leather bag.At the next town he approaches cautiously, but a few other survivors of the earlier America insist on seeing him as a symbol of a reborn America. Long delayed letters in the leather bag reinforce his status. Like Moses, he has found his promised land only to be turned away. While many townsfolk know that a reborn America is just a fantasy, others would never tolerate his presence as a constant reminder of how they fooled themselves. He relunctantly moves on to the next town.To make a long story short, America has not been reborn... except in one small area where a reborn United States is personified in an unwilling postman. Young boys are eager to join the new postal service. Families are reunited for the first time in years as townsfolk look beyond their own town borders. The protagonist feels like a fraud and misses the miracle of rebirth surrounding him.Needless to say this rejuvenation is not welcomed by everyone. A survivalist nation-state in southern Oregon and northern California wants to expand its slave base, but it can no longer pick off towns one by one through sheer intimidation.This is a wonderful setup. Will the common citizens newly rearmed with a faith in society defeat the heavily armed barbarians who have a social pecking order so rigid that barnyard fowl seem democratic? Which matters more, steel forged to the human will, or the human will tempered to the hardness of steel?We never learn. The climatic battle is not between two men from different worlds, but between two men with special military augmentation to their bodies who just happened to be on opposing sides. The change could not have been more abrupt if we went to Psychotic Theaters and saw the first two-thirds of a classic Hitchcock thriller followed by the final third of Friday the Thirteenth, part VI.The movie treatment of the book has not been released yet, but I would not be surprised if the superhuman feats of the final fight are emphasized and the morality plays on the importance of self-reliance in the service of the community lost. And that's the ultimate shame. In many ways our country is forming isolated fiefdoms of special interests; instead of asking what's best for the nation our first demand is &quot;what's in it for me?&quot; The Postman is a good cautionary story, but the augmented marines seize the story and leave its broken body trampled in the mud.The first two-thirds of the book are a solid ten. The deux ex machina conclusion would have been interesting in another novel, but not this one.","Read this back in high school. I remember clearly the excitement I felt when I began reading this book. The back of the book and the opening seemed perfectly in sync; in a post-apocalyptic world one-man restores hope and begins to rebuild a ravaged America... Ahhh. Now if that were only really the case.The first 1/3 or so of the book is about the \"postman\" but after that it turns into a weird liberal - maybe \"peacenik\" is a more appropriate descriptor - rant against evil survivalists and the military. The author clearly doesn't know beans about the military mind and the book's climax seems more like a novelization of a Manga plot or over-the-top anime movie. It certainly doesn't seem like the work of so well-regarded a person as David Brin.I really came to hate this book as I slogged through it. When reading a book that promises hope and the triumph of man over hardship, you don't want to suddenly find yourself on the receiving end of a double-barreled harangue on the evils of a military machine run amok.Besides, it is not even a good diatribe. It is basically an infantile rehash of the old saw that the military just wants to kill and kill some more. Frankly, it would be funny if it weren't so off-putting. It just goes way off the rails as it rumbles along to its unsatisfying end. Groups are introduced and hyped then wiped out like they were insignificant. I also felt that most of the mechanics of a post-apocalyptic world were simply ignored.Brin would have had a winner if he figured out how to capitalize on the ideas at the beginning of his novel. Sadly, he didn't. So, save your money and pick something with a real plot rather than just a pretext for inflicting anti-war invective on unsuspective readers. For good anti-war fodder read \"A Bright And Shining Lie.\" For insight into the military mind read Hal Moore's classic \"We Were Soldiers Once, And Young.\" For great post-apocalyptic reading look up \"The Earth Abides,\" \"Alas Babylon,\" or even the short story \"Thunder and Roses\" by Theodore Sturgeon.","Not as fantastic or far removed from the familiar as Brin's other books, the Postman tells a hopeful tale of post-apocalyptic America. True to form, the Postman leaves the reader with more questions than answers.","This is simply one of the best novels I have read in a long time. It's various themes and morals can be felt, not just seen, as one reads this moving novel. It is a must read for anyone who still believes in love of country and one's duty to his fellow men.","Forget the ego-centric mess that Kevin Costner made of the film. This is an excellent book showing the effect of hope and self-belief on ordinary people.","The Postman is a parable about modern America. It plays on a completely different level when you consider that the hero was completely wrong about faking the Restored United States; he was busy creating it. It may have been a lie the first few times he said it, but a nation is a collective figment of the imagination. He began to get people's imaginations thinking about being part of a nation. He created the Restored United States as surely as Jefferson, Washington and Franklin created the original United States. A nation is an idea and ideas are the most powerful weapon you possess.","These novel by David Brin is one of the most inspiring story he has ever written.The Postman is unlike other SF novels which emphasis on technology.The Postman is about hope and redemption.A very moving story.Keep up the good work Brin!","The Postman is an interesting book, yes, but lacks a good ending. It was obviously written that way to make room for a sequel (Which never materialized, by the way).All in all, I enjoyed it. The plot was very creative. It was just the ending that I didn't like.","I first heard about David Brin's postman when the Kevin Costner movie was publicised on &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; (naturally!). Of course, we all know what happened to the movie but that should not deter someone from reading Brin's superb novel. As someone who loves to write letters, I could empathise with the villagers who relished receiving letters - the thought of communications reunifying the &quot;Restored States of America&quot; was a superb concept. Yes, I would like to read a sequel to the novel. Who knows, maybe someone else will have the opportunity to remake The Postman as a movie which has the vision that David Brin's novel has. Maybe a director of the calibre of Atom Agoyan can tackle a remake?","if there really was a war (or whatever) that destroyed/alienated civiliation? What would it be like to not have to live by any rules save the rules of survival? This book truly made me think of whether I would be up to the challenge. Not to be a Gordon Krantz, necessarily, but simply to live as long as he and all the others did in a chaotic and violent &quot;new&quot; world. I almost stopped reading it, though, when Cyclops was introduced. I though to myself &quot;Oh, no, here comes some story about some magical machine that will save the world, or plot to destroy it further!&quot; I won't talk further about it here, so as not to ruin this sub-plot, but if you come to that point and draw the same conclusion as I did, please, just keep reading. Great books leave you thinking and wondering. It's been over a month since I've read this, and the &quot;what ifs&quot; are still lingering in my mind!","I read this book when it was originally published back in the '80s It was and is one of my favorite books. I re-read it once every other year. A lot of your reviewers who dislike it seem to be missing the point of the book. Yes, it is a post-apocalyptic story, but this is not hard science fiction. It's social commentary and, most importantly, this is a story about the power of stories. The details of &quot;how the apocalypse happened&quot; and, to a certain point, the characters themselves are secondary to this. This is a story about hopes and dreams and how they can transform us for good and for bad.A bad story is what destroys the United States, not nuclear war. The words of Nathan Holn are what finally bring down a nation. Now Gordon has a different story to try and bring it back. Words, ideas have more power than actions. Gordon's story of an R.U.S.A., the story of Dena's Scouts and the idea of Cyclops are the tenuous glue that will bring a community together.","For those who enjoyed &quot;The Postman&quot;, I recommend &quot;Earth Abides&quot; by George R. Stewart. They share a post population crash theme and characters that act and react in a believable manner. It is a little dated but thoroughly enjoyable.","One of the greatest relatively short SF books I've ever read. This was my first encounter with Brin, and I was very impressed. It is possible to read The Postman as a straight adventure, a philosophical allegory, or a satire of modern America--so many different messages, I think, are hidden here. Brin sheds light on that strange world of survivalist/neo-fascist militias, and creates completely believable, ordinary characters. It is the perfect liberal humanist response to A Canticle for Leibowitz! If you were one of those happy few who disagreed with the critics about the film adaptation, you'll love this book.","Excellent book. It was different than the movie and in some ways better. I would definitely recommend it. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.","I didn't know what to expect with this book was certainly happy that I read it. All I had ever hear was that it was a bad movie. Now I will watch the movie and see if it really is or not.About the book though... A very deep story that, while not as detailed as most apocalyptic stories, has a really strong and likeable lead character.The complexity of the story is what I found so appealing. The lies that are told from the Restored United States to the Cyclops added a layer to what could have been an average story.I did not like the politics of the book. It seemed to be trying to convey a comment on American history that seemed to be stretching at best. I was also not to fond of the ending. There seems to be something that was trying to be said that would have been better if the author had just came out and said it. Maybe I just didn't get it.Overall a very good read.","I see a book as well worth reading when, years later, you can still remember the characters and plot. This is one of the few books that stands out for me. I can remember scenes in the book, interactions between characters and the premise. I cannot tell you how it stacks up against other of it's genre, because this is probably the first post-apocalyptic book I read and thus had a big impact on me. But it's been years and I can still remember the changes that happened to the main character as he traveled the crazy new world.I am reading a much newer book calledThe Passage: A Novel, now. It's a similar \"throw back of civilization\" type novel. It is longer than Postman, but has a few similar concerns. Good books both of them, if you like science fiction with introspective angles.","I liked the Postman's second half because it delves more into the Holnists and the neohippy Powhatan, and it reiterates the power of myth with the Cyclops and Danaids. The movie covers the first third of the book, mainly a simple message of hope, and patriotic duty, within the context of the Big Cause(Big Lie), but I wish it adhered more closely to the science fiction novel including the second half.","Copyright in 1985 by David Brin. This book survives the test of time. I can't think of any of this genre I haven't read and I recommend The Postman highly. It's an excellent story, well thought out, well written, and believable. The characters are very well developed, and the story line never falters from its beginning to the excellent ending. I enjoyed the movie as well, and although it was true to the idea of the book certain items (not many) were changed. And honestly, I'm glad I read the book last as it helped me understand the film better.","David Brinn does an excellent job at creating a realistic world after a nuclear war. He does this by using two great characters, Gordon and Nathan Holn. Gordon is a survivalist that was alive before the war and frequently reminds us of what we have now that we take for granted. He is kind hearted, very intelligent and has a strong will to survive. He uses his skills in drama to get food and supplies. Gordon is the opposite Nathan Holn. Nathan is also intelligent and strong willed but he acquired power of a large gang of survivalist called the Holnist and uses them for plundering and destruction. Nathan is also knowledgeable in the fine arts and is impressed with Gordon. These charters become enemies. Gordon was taken prisoner by Nathan's men and went to \"boot camp\" to become part of the Holnist. Gordon escapes to find out that he created something very special before he left. My favorite part of the book took place during the beginning of the book. Gordon was sitting down to eat his meal at camp when some thieves ambushed him. He had to run away in the bushes. Gordon had his gun but in the postwar days ammo was spare, so he dare not use it. When Gordon went back to his camp after the thieves left, he discovered that they have taken everything of value. Gordon decided to cut them off up the path. As Gordon went through the dusk he saw a shinny reflection from what appeared to be the thieves hide out. Gordon arrived at the \"hideout\" only to find that it was a mail car from the prewar days. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes adventure or a book that inspires and creates hope.","I had never heard of this book until a friend gave it to me to keep me occupied on a long train ride. I thought it moved slow at first and it took me a while to get through the first couple of chapters. However after a while the plot took off and I found it almost impossible to put the book down. This is one of the most interesting, exiting, and moving books I've read in a long time. Thoroughly enjoyable and highly recomendable.","Even though I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, this is one book that should not be passed up. I highly recommend the book for anyone who has questions about the movie.","I loved this book. Both the setting and the characters were perfect. The plot was excellent and once I started reading this book I just couldn't put it down. This book is a great piece of work and I definately suggest that you read it.","In David Brin's postapocalyptic novel, The Postman, the civilized world has been destroyed by a brief nuclear war and the ensuing nuclear winter, diseases, and barbarism. Set in what used to be Oregon, remnants of civilization exist in small independent towns inhabited by survivors and their offspring eking out a living through agriculture and trades.Gordon Krantz is a lone wanderer, surviving by moving from village to village as a storyteller and minstrel. He finds a dead postal worker's skeleton in the woods and co-opts his clothing to stay warm. With the bag of postage, he hits upon a scam of representing himself as a postal inspector of the \"Restored United States,\" sent to establish post offices in each town and re-establish mail service. He is surprisingly embraced everywhere he travels because of people's thirst for community and communication... and hope. He unwittingly becomes a victim of his own scam and is reluctantly thrust into a leadership role in reuniting Oregon, and by implication the rest of the nation in the future. Along the way, he discovers the way each town coped with the aftermath of the war, makes various friendships, falls in love, and leads the war against the rogue survivalists from the south.I quite enjoyed this novel and found it uplifting in the message of a regular man who had greatness thrust upon him and came to realize that he had to take responsibility. The movie, starring Kevin Costner, is also good but diverges a good bit from the book, especially in the second half. As is often the case, the book is better.","At one point in David Brin's &quot;The Postman,&quot; the narrator intones: &quot;Gordon's appointed postmasters would continue lying without knowing it, using the tale of a restored nation to bind the land together, until the fable wasn't needed anymore. Or until, by believing it, people made it come true.&quot; There is more than a touch of William James here, of making it so by believing in it, of the &quot;Will to Believe.&quot; Certainly, Kevin Costner's movie version demanded a heavy dose of the willing suspension of disbelief from us when an army of postmen rode to the rescue under a restored &quot;Old Glory,&quot; forming an unwitting parody of &quot;cavalry to the rescue&quot; scene in old westerns, as well as of an earlier Costner epic ... the mounted ride-by presented as holy defiance in both The Postman and Dances With Wolves.Because Brin was crafting a book, and not painting visual symbols, his demands seem more reasonable. Despite some stretches, and unlike other reviewers, I did not see the mano-a-mano at the end as &quot;deus ex machina,&quot; but instead a reasonable question -- are we as capable of creating one kind of &quot;superman&quot; as that other, most feared? The fight woven into the endstory is, after all, symbolic of a struggle between Titans (an image and a term Brin consciously employs): competing world views. If we are prepared by science fiction to accept the evil member of the &quot;superman&quot; twins, why not also the good? Is science fiction so jaded, or will it accept the myth of the good in people as quickly as the myth of evil?By using the Postman as the handy symbol for &quot;swell the music, pass around the Kleenex&quot; scenes, Costner buries the underlying irony. The Postman as epic hero.... Brin demands that we attempt, and then understand that it is, faith in such simple images of normalcy, justice and peace that make it so. As his apocolyptic tale has it: &quot;More people died due to the breakdown and lawlessness -- the shatt! ered web of commerce and mutual assistance -- than from all the bombs and germs, or even from the three-year dusk.&quot; It is belief that must re-weave the web, not brute power.Brin's demand, the demand he lays equally at the feet of the idealist, the pragmatist and the intellectual, is more fundamental than the &quot;willing suspension of disbelief&quot; with which we watch TV reruns. We do not allow the show to end, but make it real by our belief that it is. This demand is at the core of a basic rift in philosophies of law which both book and movie drive home. To Costner's credit in an otherwise overwrought and manipulative movie, he did not lose sight of that demand.The Holness and survivalists, in both Brin's work and Costner's, are embodiments of a conception of law as a one-sided exertion of power. Brin comes close to quoting the power-oriented political philosophy of Thomas Hobbes' classic &quot;Leviathan&quot; when he describes the life of women in the new order as &quot;poor, painful and short.&quot; Against this philosophy is one that grounds law and orderliness in the notion of the reciprocal nature of the relationship between people and law, the governed and the governing. Against the power-oriented visions of law and government, Brin has set a view, well expounded in jurisprudential works by the late Lon Fuller, who saw law as an enterprise with an internal morality demanding commitment from both the government and the governed to do things well and right if it is ever to succeed. Law as more than Fascist &quot;Law and Order,&quot; imposed from without, law as good order springing from the better side of people.By the story medium he chose, we should assume that Brin is, after all, making a point in political philosophy. We slip further and further away from our own responsibility for our government and our laws, a responsibility which the Postman shortsightedly fails to recognize as his own when he whines about wanting someone [else] to take responsibilit! y to set things right. The further we slip, the more we silently accept the message of the Nathan Holn and his survivalist gangs. We become mere followers in a world where only a few are willing to take responsibility ... and seeing the free reign they are given, abuse it.Unfortunately, there is in Brin's tale more than a suggestion that &quot;extraordinary individuals&quot; are still required, and that it is acceptable for those individuals to use the &quot;noble lie.&quot; In this one particular, Costner surpasses Brin at least once, when the movie's Abbey admits that she knew that the Postman was not really a messenger from the restored government -- a passing moment of recognition by the &quot;little people&quot; that they are participating in the forging of myth into reality. In Brin's book, only the leaders, the cognoscienti, appear to be smart enough and dedicated enough to acknowledge the Big Lie yet adhere to it as a Noble Necessity.The fundamental message, still, is a simple one, and one that America sorely needs to grasp as one of the central demands of a free and open society. We are responsible for our government and our laws. It is only by accepting responsibility that we can keep alive our part in our government and our fate. There is no Sugarloaf Mountain on which we can hide for long, and the other alternative is passive and slave-like acceptance.","I really enjoyed the first half of this book. The wandering postman poser bringing hope to every town he visits. I enjoy the post apocalyptic genre, and felt the story was proceeding enjoyably without many post-ap cliches. I really liked the hope springing eternal aspect to it.Unfortunately the second half of the book devolved into something that could only be saved by deus ex machina - which is exactly what happened. The characters stopped acting like believable people. Critical events happened that were difficult to believe and never explained (the Scout's plan \"somehow\" was uncovered). Characters were being killed off almost as though the author were afraid that the story wasn't having any emotional impact for the last many pages so maybe if someone we had been introduced to died...I was very disappointed by the end of the book. If it had left the standard \"good guy vs. bad guy climax\" out, the whole story would have been better for it. If you really want to enjoy the book, just stop at the second interlude.","I have to go against the overwhelming tide of opinion that holds this novel to be an excellent work. The first half of the novel isn't bad as we accompany the protaganist and his effort to survive in post-apopcalyptic America. The character isn't heroic. Instead he's a survivor. And then we get started with the postman charade. At first it has potential - the reestablishing of communications to rebuild civilization. The lowly mailman suddenly stepping into a position as savior or at least rebuilder. The mundane civil servant now is heroic. Very intruiging. But then David Brin - ex-NASA scientist - has to bring in technology. Suddenly we have genetically engineered super-soldiers and something called neo-hippie technology. In one quick turn we are in some kind of world involving ressurrected 1960's philosophy! The book wanders around, looking for some kind of philosophical grounding. Why? Isn't it enough to have a story about the rebuilding of the country? Or did David Brin become bored with such an Earthy story and feel the need to go into space - so to speak. No I believe this book suffers from a lack of focus. A good idea, but not carried out completely.","Brin's tale of a loner's midlife journey in a world devastated by warfare, climate change, and disease is exactly what genre-bound science fiction readers expect. The protagonist, Gordon, is an intellectual male whose resourcefulness has helped him adapt to a world whose institutions have collapsed and whose people live in tiny, scrabbling communities. He traverses the (former) Northwestern United States in vague search of something hope for - but accidentally, by way of a postman's uniform he finds in a moment of desperation, brings hope to everyone he encounters. Ultimately he must reconcile himself to the world as it has become and decide what is truly worth fighting for.\"The Postman\" fancies itself an ideological novel, and Brin lays it on thick. Gordon's search for meaning is unceasing, and unceasingly discussed. While his crusade is at first sympathetic, it quickly wears thin under the novel's weight as, instead of developing Gordon's character, Brin attributes his every decision to the increasingly desctructive cause.More than just lazily written, \"The Postman\" can be frustratingly immature. The protagonist's - and the book's - tone toward technology is plausible for the young college student Gordon once was, but inappropriate for a middle-aged man whose life and country have been destroyed by a machine society. Brin's version of feminism seems designed to win bonus points with female fans, but its heavy-handedness and condescension are no less alienating than outright sexism. These flaws, combined with Brin's broad-stroked, barely-serviceable prose, undermine any serious reader's enjoyment.But \"The Postman\" is appealing nonetheless. It's easy to get into, and the action sequences are freqent and page-turning. The plot meanders pleasantly, making the book seem longer and meatier than it actually is, and although the ending is both sudden and predictable, it's not unsatisfying. And ultimately, Brin offers what many sci-fi readers are looking for: a world in which things are different, a new set of rules and a history that comments on our own. This is not great literature, but it's a fairly good book.","I love end-of-the-world fiction. My picks for the best of the genre include &quot;The Stand,&quot; &quot;On the Beach,&quot; &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; and &quot;Lucifer's Hammer.&quot; Unfortunately, &quot;The Postman&quot; just isn't up to the standards set by these works. For one thing, the narrative ark takes some twists and turns into some unusal, but not at all together satisfying directions. For another, several key moments in the plot are based on non-too-plausible scenes of the hero overhearing conversations of his adversaries. Some of the action scenes are not terribly believable, and the ending of the book reads like a cliched Western. Nevertheless, Brin does pack his novel with a number of interersting ideas and notions that at least make it worth reading for those with an interest in this particular genre.","\"You know why we just did that, don't you?\" the reductive shell of a female character knowingly asked Gordon. She had long hair, and the diminished subservient personality of an aged male-virgin's fantasy. Her fearful, yet seductive stare betrayed an author's utter lack of contact with real women. She continued, \"So, both of us understand why that just happened?\"Gordon nodded, and returned his focus to the ambiguous task at hand. \"Well I don't!\" cried the reader, panicked. But the chapter had already changed, and like the anthropomorphized weather, the mysterious dialogue was unyielding.***Several unspecified units of time later, the reader scrambled to find purchase on a new plot line. Gordon scraped the depths of his jaded mind to find obscure, archaic, quasi-metaphorical words to replace the simplest of adjectives. The tone was bombastic and stiff. An impentetrable fog of passive voice and rampant - Gordon chuckled as he acknowledged that some might even say reckless - thesaurus usage.\"For God's sakes, man! I prayed that you would return safely!\" Gordon announced, with the boisterous formalized fervor of an Austonian aristocrat. Although there had been no context, it surfaced over the next few lines that he was speaking to a character previously unmentioned. Had the reader encountered this character before? Flipping back through the last few pages of italicized monologue proved inconclusive. He could not be sure. The character had spawned like a specter from the abyss of a sudden and unceremonious chapter break. This would be all the explanation given. A new chapter began, and the character vanished.***The reader despaired at the unsettling crumbling of a once coherent and optimistic plot, abandoned so many pages ago. Had the brilliant first third of the book been a dream? He could barely remember. Characters and locations now flitted in and out of the universe like confused curse words in a reader's mind. Bitter tears spewed forth, languishing in the protagonist's hypocrisy and wasted potential as the very genre itself shifted violently. Gordon's obsessively-repeated mantra breached again, this time taking on a new, universal meaning: \"Who will take responsibility now?\" Exhausted and exasperated, the reader bid Gordon farewell. Although the meeting had not been wholly unpleasant, they did not meet again.","There just aren't enough epic novels of post-apocalyptic survival. I have enjoyed every one that I've read, and I keep trying to find more to read and enjoy. Now, that is not to say that all of them were good. Many of them were completely ridiculous and repellant. David Brin's &quot;The Postman,&quot; however, manages to be not only enjoyable, but also good.On his way across the fractured, war-wracked Northwest, world-weary Gordon is shot at, robbed, and generally kicked around. That's the nature of life in post-WWIII Oregon. As the story begins, Gordon has been working as an itinerant entertainer, reciting Shakespear for a bowl of soup and a place to sleep. When he stumbles across an old US Postal Serviceman's uniform, though, he decides to try a new scam. The idea of the United States' continued existence, however, is something of a free radical, inspiring anger and defiance against local warlords. Gordon becomes an important, if unwilling, figurehead in the locals' struggle for autonomy and a return to real civilized life.Brin's book is a good read. The story's characters are few, but generally interesting and believable. Several of his sub-plots are iffy, especially his third act treatment of male-female relations. The book was written in the 80's, and his prediction of world events in the 1990s is also so wrong as to detract somewhat from the story (at least in my reading.) Still, it's satisfying, overall, and has both a sense of humor and a moral, not to mention laser satellites and artificial intelligences. For sci-fi fans, this is a fine choice.","Before SF novelist David Brin became known as one of the \"Killer Bs\" of 80s and 90s SF, he penned a serial novel called \"The Postman,\" a post-apocalyptic romp through the Williamette Valley in Oregon. Set in an area dominated by militias, survivalists, and the kinds of folks who like to blame Jewish people and blacks for America's troubles, Brin lampooned the typical, gutsy, survival-of-the-fittest attitude in post-apocalyptic (PA) fiction, creating a unique blend of adventure story and important moral lesson. In an interview, Brin said that most PA fiction revels in the downfall of civilization, creating a kind of macho paradise which would be great if you were a gun-toting conservative white male. For everyone else, it would be hell, and that is exactly what \"The Postman\" tackles.Fifteen years after the Doomwar, a combination nuclear, biological, and chemical exchange between the US and an unknown enemy, Gordon roams the landscape looking for a cause to follow. The largest organization in this atmosphere are a loosely-organized militia-army, who follow the teachings of the deceased Nathan Holn, a racist whose beliefs about life and freedom were a mix of Ayn Rand, David Duke, and a badly warped Charles Darwin. Gordon, a college-educated thinking man, wants nothing to do with the militias, but is inadvertantly forced into acting when bandits steal his clothes and he is forced to dress as a postman and invent a story about the Restored United States to get some food.On his way, Gordon meets towns wallowing in drugs and violence, paranoid people so scared by oppression they trust no one, and an organization seemingly controlled by a computer artificial intelligence. When the militias begin attacking the Williamette Valley in far greater fervor, Gordon begins to organize the resistance, aided in part by George Powhatan, an organizer who has begun to rebuild civilization in his own way.\"The Postman\" makes clear that the downfall of civilization would not be a good thing, especially if you happened to be a woman, or black, or anything else not conforming to the WASP-militia stereotypes. Aside from a good adventure story, Brin's book bucks convention and treads new groud, providing an obvious stepping stone for later SF novels in the genre like \"The New Madrid Run\" and \"The Rift.\" The prose can be rocky, but given \"Postman\" was published serially (and wasn't necessarily aspiring to high literature), this can be overlooked for the far more positive points of its content.Final Grade: B-","&quot;The Postman&quot; is set in the 21st century. A war has brought about the collapse of civilization. America, once a great nation, no longer exists. All that is left are ruined cities, scattered tribes and lawlessness. It has been like this for sixteen years.The hero is 34 year-old Gordon Krantz. He is travelling across the country, looking for something. Some sign of revival, someone who is &quot;taking responsibility&quot;. After being robbed by bandits, Gordon is left with almost nothing. It looks as if he will either starve or freeze to death. Then, by an amazing stoke of luck, he finds the body of a postman. He puts on the uniform, and from that point, even though he doesn't know it, he has a new purpose.He visits different tribes claiming to be a representative of the new government, the Restored United States. Gordon is really acting out an elaborate scam so he can get food and help. But Gordon is also giving people hope. Gordon becomes totally involved in his role, so that he almost believes in the lie himself. He even delivers mail to people as he travels.&quot;The Postman&quot; has a &quot;Mad Max&quot; feel to it. There isn't as much action however, it's more of an intellectual story. This is the only novel I've read by David Brin. Even though we're told it's wrong to lie, Gordon's deception is the catylist for America's revival. The return of technology, a new beginning.Everyone needs something to believe in. It's what keeps us going when times are hard. This is the message I believe Brin is trying to get across.","Actually I can't attest to having seen said movie, but a cursory reading of the plot of the movie shows that they seemed to have played a bit fast and loose with this book, which considering the reviews it got, probably wasn't a good thing. Oh well. To each his own, you're never going to get an exact translation. At least they're restored the brilliant reissue cover, much as one can admire Kevin Costner as an actor, I would have preferred not to have his bedraggled face staring at me every time I go to pick the book up. That all stated, this is a highly entertaining and fairly straightforward book, probably not as deep as Brin would like it to be, but a good try nonetheless. We have a future US destroyed by war, with scattered towns basically living their own separate existences, while an army run by survivalists inspired by a Hitleresque fanatic are trying to take over everything in sight. Our hero enters this mess while trying to escape some roving raiders and finds a postal uniform and some mail . . . from there he concocts a lie to help him get food and stuff but winds up inspiring everyone and restoring hope to a faded nation, regaining his own lost ideals in the process. Needless to say there's plenty to like in this book, Brin's envisioning of a future US with everyone living in the shadow of the past war is great, the story moves at a quick pace, so even when it's not that engrossing you're still reading, and the situations are varied, with a fairly uplifting message that manages to come across as sincere. However, most of the stuff you can see coming from miles away so don't expect &quot;shocks on every page&quot;, with the exception of maybe the main character and some others, most of the people populating the book are a tad one dimensional, sure there's lot of them but very few of them feel &quot;real&quot;. Brin appears to be shooting for the same status that Earth Abides (a really great novel, by the way), Alas, Babylon and maybe even On the Beach have garnered over the years but he defeats himself by making it too science fictional, what worked in those books was a palpable sense of reality, that this stuff could happen tomorrow, Brin's got too many talking computers, augmented humans and fancy future stuff to give the reader a true connection with his future. So in the end what you wind up with may not be an enduring classic beloved by millions but merely an extremely entertaining and diverting SF novel. Which, all told, may be enough.","If you've seen the movie version with Kevin Costner then you know the story, though the novel is even better, as is usual in such things. The story of a post apocalyptic world of warlords and people just trying to get along, it delves into the hopes and dreams of people trying to survive, where a man brings along an idea that the government is trying to reorganize and help them. A great read by a very good writer and well worth the look. Highly recommend.","There are very few Armageddon tales that are as well constructed as this one is. 'The Handmaid's Tale\", the trend-setting \"We\" and \"A Canticle for Leibowitz\" while also being well done, lack the overall atmosphere created in this dystopic novel. David Brin not only creates a believable tale of the future destruction of the planet but he brings so many other concepts into it as well. Women's equal role in society, the possible dark future of technology, the innate bruteness of some of society's males, the roles that hope, responsibility, honesty and altruism play in social structure, and what is necessary to become a 'hero' in a world that needs it most. The ending, in itself, is highly realistic insomuch that we are left with hope for the future that is clouded over by the sadness of the past.Please do not equate this novel with Kevin Kostner's movie of the same title. While both attempt to deal with the same concept, they are as different as chocolate and chalk.......","So far the book is very enjoyable, especially if you like this genre. Now that it is 2011, time of events in the story take a little imaginative restructuring on the readers part. If you have seen the popular movie I still recommend this book, as events are different. Also a little light is shed on things that, in the movie, may have inspired questions.","The front half of this book is great. Gordon Krantz, struggling across the wilds of the Western United States, telling stories and singing songs to earn his keep along the way. A minstrel spinning tales reminding people who they are and what they were before a series of events called only The Doomwar. He continues doing the same but in a broader context after becoming the eponymous Postman.That's the front of the book.The second half, unfortunately, lacks that same power and wonder. The figure of adventure becomes little more than a bureaucrat, and the carefully crafted tale a hairy-chested men's science fiction adventure novel, complete with genre clich&eacute;s and right-wing manifestos. And I like a good manifesto ...","Author David Brin has done a fine job crafting the United States post collapse, however, he has a completely different take on the port events. Inspired by the rigid, extremist survivalists of the 1970's and early 1980's, Brin chose to write a post-apocalyptic science-fiction novel focusing on the potential influence extremists could have on society after collapse.The novel is well written, with enjoyable prose, and a unique take on the genre. As other reviewers have mentioned, and I agree with their assessment, the first half of the novel is much better. It is considerably more believable than the later half, and in my opinion, more enjoyable. I did like the second half, but the story takes a slight turn away towards a traditional science-fiction arc.In comparison with the movie, which I do enjoy a great deal, the book shares similar characters and plot points with the first half of the story, but is an entirely different animal. On the author's website he speaks about the similarities and a genuine fondness for the movie, while accepting that it is a completely different interpretation.After reading this book, I can't help but see the influence in many other contemporary pieces of post-apocalyptic fiction and art. For example, in Fallout: New Vegas, there appears to be a very strong influence with \"The Legion\", their methods of raiding and killing, and even the Roman influence: Cinncinatus and the Holnists (methods of war) in The Postman; The Caesar and \"The Legion\" in Fallout.Overall, I really enjoyed the book. I would recommend it fans of science-fiction as well as those who enjoy the post-apocalyptic/collapse genre.","David Brin's The Postman tells the story of Gordon Krantz, a man who finds himself still struggling for survival some sixteen years after nuclear war has almost completely destroyed the United States. Luckily for him, Krantz had been a bright student before his school days so suddenly ended forever at the age of sixteen, and he remembered enough Shakespeare and other classic literature to be able to earn his food and shelter as a traveling entertainer as he made his way westward from Minnesota.But Krantz knew that his survival always depended on his ability to avoid bands of murdering bandits or sudden death at the hands of Mother Nature. One day his luck ran out. After an encounter with bandits left him with little more than the clothes on his back and in desperate need of shelter to avoid freezing to death, Krantz stumbled upon an old post office jeep, complete with the driver's remains. In order not to freeze, he clothed himself in the heavier clothing of the driver for the night and continued to wear the old uniform the next day when he left the jeep's shelter.Much to Krantz's surprise, the next group of people he encountered was joyful to be hosting a mail carrier, someone they never expected to see again after having lived through sixteen years of isolation and precarious survival. They insisted on sharing past-life memories and stories about the mailmen they remembered from childhood and Krantz did not have the heart to tell them that he was a fraud. But, fraud or not, Krantz realized that he could easily acquire food and shelter by pretending to be a postal inspector sent by the \"Reformed United States\" to set up post offices throughout the state of Oregon. He justified his lies by telling himself that he was offering hope and inspiration to people who probably needed those things for their long term survival almost as badly as they needed food and shelter.As word spread throughout the region, Krantz was soon to learn that the hope he offered created both opportunity and risk for the people who heard his story. For sixteen years those people had managed to survive, but they feared a large group of survivalist refugees from the past who intended to take what they had and make them into little more than slaves. Suddenly, with knowledge that the \"Restored United States\" would one day be there to help them, people were almost anxious to confront their vicious enemy. Only Krantz knew the truth, and he dared not steal the hope that these people embraced so desperately.The Postman offers another doomsday scenario, this one a little more hopeful than most. It illustrates how a man who believes in ideals and morality can make a critical difference if only he has the courage and near foolishness to tackle what seems like an impossible task. Krantz wanted to give up but he could not abandon the people who had embraced \"the postman.\"I suspect that many people, like me, have not read David Brin's novel because of exposure to Kevin Costner's rather lame movie of the same name. Although the movie was based on Brin's book, rest assured that that is where the resemblance begins and ends.","Unlike the movie, this book is not only better than the movie, but it doesn't have Kevin Kostner in it ;)I really liked this book, but then again I have always been a sucker for EOW stories (end of world). If you liked Lucifer's hammer then you will like this book. If you liked Lucifer's Hammer or this book, then you may also want to check out Earth the New Frontier by Adam Celaya (a brand new post-apocalyptic novel that rocks the house!!)If you like EOW books, then get this one. You will not be dissapointed!","The postman never believed he was one until he stood back and saw the effects of his lie. He was a wanderer, a man with no plan that had survived an unthinkable war ending the United States. His calling came on accident and then a lie, but it gave hope to all he spoke with and all those people spoke with. He accidentally started a fight to bring back the United States. This story is truly amazing and makes the book a must read, though it isn't written all that well and is not considered David Brin's best writing. The idea will keep the reader intrigued and is a must read for anyone that likes an adventure incorporating love and hope.","What I find so amazing about this book is how well it relates to current times. one of the main themes in the book is holding together and standing up for our country as well loving our neighbors and sacrificing for things much bigger than any of us. especially after september 11 United States Citizens must pull something from the ashes, must try to right what has been wronged, must hold together for country and the the things we stand for, this is what this book embodies. I strongly encourage everyone and anyone to read this book; it is an experience that will never be forgotten.","Some years ago there was a movie titled &#8220;The Postman&#8221; with Kevin Costner that was loosely based on this novel by science fiction writer David Brin.There is nothing science fiction about The Postman. It&#8217;s a post-apocalyptic story that plays in Oregon.The book was first copyrighted in 1985 and Brin, being a science fiction writer, created an all-out nuclear war that took place in the early 1990-ies and that brought down civilization worldwide.I like to read science fiction written about a time way in the future from the writer&#8217;s present perspective, which also happens to be the present time for me. To do that, you have to not read a new book for 25 or more years.This story takes place in the 2010 to 2012 timeframe, referencing the war that took place 16 years before the start of the story.The immediate aftermath of the war caused a three-year-winter and lawlessness. Massive extinction took crops, animals and people. In the U.S., the government collapsed, and civilization was reduced to marauding bands of violent survivalists and homesteaders who sometimes banded together for mutual support and protection in small communities.Gordon Krantz, the protagonist, is a lone survivor who wandered from St. Paul all the way to eastern Oregon over a period of 16 years, keeping a journal of his travels, surviving somehow off the scraps left by a looted civilization. When the story begins he is robbed of all his possessions by bandits that outnumbered and outgunned him. Faced with imminent death from freezing and starvation in winter in the mountains in eastern Oregon, he must get creative quickly.When he stumbles upon a corpse of a former postman in a Post Office Jeep, he takes the uniform for warmth and the bag as a container &#8211; and then he has an idea that changes his life and that of all the people he encounters.Like in most apocalypse stories, there must be some evil besides just the natural disasters that cause impossible situations for the people. In Stephen King&#8217;s The Stand, that&#8217;s Randall Flagg, the dark lord that takes over Las Vegas and builds an evil empire. In The Postman, the evil people are, ironically, the remaining militant survivalists who concentrated in the Pacific Northwest before the war, digging bunkers, hoarding supplies and ammunition, training in hunting and warfare, with the sole objective to survive in the case of a holocaust. As it turns out, the survivalists, due to competition with each other, pretty much kill each other off, but in the end, after things settle down, they have coalesced into an empire of abuse, slavery, and exploitation &#8211; feudalism in the American mainland. And they go to war against the villages and settlements who try to survive against all odds and build a new civilization.Gordon, unwittingly and not really a hero, through the circumstances he creates for himself, becomes key to the solution of this conflict.The Postman is a captivating read, stronger in the first two-thirds of the book which deals with his discoveries. Things get complicated in the end, and the climax is somewhat quick with a deus-ex-machina-flavored solution in the end.Overall, The Postman is a good, credible and entertaining story of a post-apocalyptic America.","This book reminded me about what I loved about sci-fi when I was a kid. And the location was spot on, speaking as an Oregonian","Having seen (and liked) the movie, I was really pleased with the book. I have read and enjoyed many of the books from David Brin. He is a very talented writer and his character development is terrific. I guess I was amazed at the extent of the detail and intricate plot development offered in this work. In retrospect, It made the movie seem very one-dimensional...","The book is nothing like the movie! It allows your imagination much more latitude to fill in and imagine what you might do in this guys situation and how others totally out of his control affect his circumstances. It was a good read!","I loved this product very much. It makes a very good gift to anyone. would highly recom mend it to everyone.","This is a good read. I watched the movie a long time ago when I was in high school. Back then I had no clue this was a book. I am really into these kinds of stories and it was great. Read it!","after watching the movie and loving it I felt the book would be very entertaining,but for some reason this time the movie outdid the book,while it was a fair read,it was not a book that I read cover to cover or hated to put down,I give this book a three on the scale of five,watch the movie and you decide.","Worth reading for the apocalypse fan, but not a life altering book. The good news is that the story had enough differences from the movie that a reader will be surprised here and there with the happenings.","I bought this book based on how well I liked the movie. I disappointed to find the book was a very little like the movie.One of the few times the movie was better then the book,at least for me.Now having put that behind me,the book was interesting in it's own right.Gordon finds a Postman's uniform and in his desperate struggle to stay a live, he puts it on and the story begins. The clothes give the people Gordon meets in his travels hope that the old days are not gone forever.In this hope Gordon finds the man with in himself that he has all ways wanted to be. Not bad,but not great either.The price point could be better considering how long ago it was published.","Those looking for a novelized version of the infamous Costner vehicle may be surprised/disappointed by its source material. The short novella bears little resemblance to the film other than its title and post-apocalyptic setting. That being said, readers who enjoy day dreaming about the world sans-civilization could do worse than this simple little story with its non-threatening prose and stock characters. Always remember, there is no shame in putting down Faulkner and wasting an afternoon with a little harmless trash....G.R.R. Martin can attest.","I read this when I was in high school and although I understood it, I didn't really take this story to heart. Two questions were finally answered: Could I have survived like Gordon Kranz did? and What would life be like without life's simple pleasures...? David Brin brings to life a normal Minnesota man who struggles with the way things are now versus how they were before the war and the winter. Gordon gets lucky and makes a lie become a truth when he takes on the persona of the Postman and reconnects several Oregon towns while keeping just a step ahead of Holnist survivalists. Brin also ties in the dependency on technology for the survival of a community...Cyclops, as well as the government's military experiments (not in the movie). In the end, because of a simple pleasure, something that we take so much for granted...the mail...a nation is restored. I loved the book, winced at the movie version (although it does turn out quite nicely), and wished that other writers could capture, as Brin does, the very nature of the post-haulocaustic U.S. Read it, understand it, and think... Could I have survived like Gordon did or would I have listened to those &quot;little&quot; voices that told me to quit?","In this book Brin tries to make a point of women needing to understand technology better and to participate in political disscussion. A very valid point. Too bad almost nothing in the story conveys this moral. This is like watching MadMax and then at the end of the movie the moral is &quot;Be Kind to your Elders&quot;. Doesn't make alot of sense. Despite this I thought the book was pretty entertaining. It's just that when an author wants to show us an important point or moral, the moral should be the cornerstone of the story and the focus about which the characters revolve, rather than something thrown in at the end. To do otherwise is an injustice to the moral, and make the moral seem unimportant.","I've read this book many times. It's one of the most inspiring works I've ever encountered. I'm actually avoiding seeing the movie because I'm afraid the story has been changed (a'la Dune) to suit Hollywood. If that's the case, I just hope David Brin got a LOT of money for the rights. (Keep up the good work in print, David.)","I found the book a quick and easy read. The story premise is an interesting one, and in light of the current militia and survivalist movements, it does make one think. But the book seems to run out of gas 3/4 of the way, and although the isolationist tone of the story is the focus, in the end, you wonder, &quot;Yeah, but what happens to the rest of the country?&quot; I can only surmise that in the end, Kevin Costner gets a hold of the postman's badge and the whole thing turns into an utter disaster...","I read The Postman several years ago and enjoyed it thoroughly. The casual references to the end of the world were much appreciated after reading books like lucifers hammer which intricatly describe the end. Brin does it fabulosly! I am sad after seeing the Movie version which leaves out so many interesting things like the College at Corvallis which would have made for an even more hope filled movie. Also, whose idea was it to change the Holnist leader from General Macklin to General Bethlehem. Otherwise, David Brin rocks!!!","Brin makes a case for being top dog in the genre. I've gotta say it...read down a few reviews...the guy from Houston completely misses the point. Go back and read it again...and again.","I found the story interesting. I did not miss the usual gory boring details of the holocast which preceeded the story line. I didn't agree with other reviews written here, you have to remember that this is fiction writen for entertainment. If you sought a moral then I would conclude you could find it here in the people's Hope the postman exploited and which finally they used on him.","one thing many people forget when reading this book is the time it is set in. not only after a cataclysmic war, but when the war happened. the reaction of the townspeoplle are very realistic when you actually apply them to small town america ten or so years ago. this book is a must read, and from what i have seen the movie adaptation will be very good.","In facing the plausable unknown of whole-earth catastrophe, Brin has unveiled simple innate needs of humankind. Maybe too simplistic, but excess detail would only spoil the view.","Rarely are we granted the privelage of reading a book that personifies so much of what we love about the world around us. The Postman, as a story, succeeds where others have failed in that it seizes upon the fundemental ideals that makes us smile when we behold the red, white and blue of &quot;Old Glory.&quot; The ideals of liberty, justice, honor and innocence are held up for us to recognize clearly for what they are in its pages. For reasons that are never clear, we seem to forget and loose the spirit of what is granted to us all by being simply born in America. For all the griping about political graft, scandals and taxes, it is not until times of adversity when the precious jewells of everyday life, such as receiving a simple letter, or sleeping in a warm house, are denied us that we see the truth. That we are enjoying a golden age of freedom and liberty that is rare even in the world today. They say that amputees often reach to scratch at limbs which have been dust for years. When we are healthy and hale we rarely notice the ease with which we move until a limb is lost or broken. Gordon Krantz experienced this same sense of removal and yearning and unconciously attempted to bring some semblence of that lost dream back to life in the lie that was the Restored United States.Although the analogies speak for themselves, I feel that we should all stop, take stock of what we see around us now, and search for some way that we may stregthen our ideals and limbs.The United States isn't a country, a person, or even a flag, it is everyone of us that believes in a just society of freedoms and fairness of an age of optimism and hope. As an American I am proud of the spirit that has manifested itself in the pages of this book. Regardless of what age, color, creed or religion you follow, we all share a commonality unbroken by geographic or idealogical boundaries, we are citizens of the land of the free and the home of the brave.","I read this book a few years ago and to this day it's one of my favorite's of all time. The movie was forgettable, so I hope that doesn't give you a bad impression, because this book takes an old subject but refreshes it in a wonderful way. A very moving story that you won't be able to put down.","This was the first book I've read of David Brin and I was not in the least bit disappointed. The Postman was realistic and the Characters were done great. I found myself feeling for the characters and Mr. Brin paints a post-WWIII America so well that it felt like I was there. This book comes off greatly. Also I plan on reading more of Mr. Brin's books.","This was a pretty entertaining book. A movie based on it came out around Christmas, but I've had this book for years and decided to read it before seeing the movie. It's about a post-apocolyptic America and centers around a protagonist who was in college when World War III broke out. Though things got a bid cheasy toward the end (I won't say how), it was nonetheless a very entertaining read. The story tracks this reluctant hero's treck through Oregon in a bleak landscape of fudile villages and city rubble. His chance finding of a dead postman changes him and is the catalyst behind much of what happens throughout the novel. By the way, the movie, which is now the butt of jokes on Leno almost every night, deserves the jokes - it is a insufferably long, slow movie, terribly acted, with painfully contrived sentimental moments. It's too bad that the book now has this associated with it...","I read all things by David Brin and have yet to be disapointed. With The Postman I started reading it, then passed it around my dorm. The book became quite a sensation (and this is in 1996). As for the movie, well, we all know that the book is usually better, but by no means should anyone be discouraged. I know many people who would kill to see a work like Startide Rising make it to film. No matter, David Brin is truly THE author for the 1990's...and beyond.","The Postman is great. People think it is an unrealistic plot, but I think it is ultra-realistic. Brin has a way of describing people and creating truth-to-life character that react to events how you and I would. A reversion to feudalism is a likely event after such a war, but people would remember democracy. I think that everyone should read The Postman, especially if they have been disillusioned by the movie.","Superb. A compelling story about hope. I read it all in one day - couldn't put it down","Brin creates this universe of the Postman in such a unique viewpoint. I've never seen such an environment described in such believable terms before. I've read it 4 times now, and I hope to again have the time to read it. It gets better and better each time you read it - and it changes the way you feel about life in the process.The best way I can describe it is that every time you read it - you can notice a new aspect of the ongoing story with each reading.David Brin is writing genius with books like Earth, Startide Rising, and with the Postman. I hope he continues to bring us to where no other science fiction author dares to take us..","I loved this book I couldn't put it down. I recommend this to all science fiction readers. I can't wait for the movie","This is early Brin, but one of his best. After a nuclear war, what survives of civilization?What gives hope to the people of America? Answer: The U.S. Postal Service, or is it one man's effort to make sense of a world in chaos.A movie version is currently being filmed starring Kevin Costner.I highly recommend this book.","Brin's best","The Postman is an action-filled novel about post-apocalyptic America. Death, despair, and darkness reign as Gordon Krantz finds and wears a postman's jacket, turning his life from the path of mere survival to one that breathes new life into the people he meets. While The Postman seems to be merely a sci-fi adventure story, I find myself constantly re-evaluating life in light of Gordon's circumstances. In the novel, the United States government has been dissolved, leaving people to fight against the cult-like Holnist survivalists, created by Nathan Holn to wreak havoc, destroy towns, and enslave the people. Gordon is constantly in a fight with chaos and with the Holnists who will kill him for the trophy-death. In this war we discover Gordon's humble strength: he gives people a reason to live. I recommend this novel because of its combination of suspense, action, and philosophical morals. David Brin captures the feelings of helplessness and hopelessness that people in our reality feel daily, and through Gordon allows us to dream and hope once again. He uses the classic science fiction device of physically improved humans but brings it to a higher level, that of chaos against tradition. In The Postman Brin is questioning our society and its ability to reshape itself to survive. If you want a fast-paced story with a deeper moral behind its suspenseful action-packed faade, read Brin's The Postman.","The main criteria for judging a recreational novel like THE POSTMAN is whether or not it kept the pages turning. This one did, which is why I finished it, and which is why you are getting to read this fine review. David Brin offers up a vision of life in the near future after the Doomwar and the ensuing anarchy has destroyed civilization as we know it. What remains is a healthy scattering of small communities struggling to survive the chaos.Some of the survivors are would-be tyrants; the rest of them are decent, but cowed folk who try to get along. You can guess who gets the better end of the deal. The novel follows Gordon Krantz, one of the decent, but unusually strong guys as he tries to navigate the bleak landscape. He stumbles upon a Postman's uniform, and accidentally discovers that he can trade dreams of a restored United States back East in exchange for food and lodging. The question of the novel is whether the myth Krantz is offering is enough to get the decent folks to come together and throw off the tyrants.The writing is not terrific, but the action unfolds at a good pace. We are drawn into Brin's world enough to care about how it all turns out. Along the way, Brin invites us through a meditation about the foundations of civil society. His main question is how a \"civilized\" guy can exercise violence against the tyrants, without becoming one of them. In Brin's vision, the women who live among the despots are treated despotically, and his insight is that genuine civilization depends, in some way, on the strength of women. What he lacks is any good vision of how that necessary feminine strength can be used to civilize the men, and so the end of THE POSTMAN falls flat. My guess is that Brin's failure simply reflects our own society's inability to really understand the nature of feminine strength. Still, give Brin credit for seeing that it is a question.THE POSTMAN is a fine way to while away a few hours at the beach. It might even cause you to pause and muse over a few ideas in the shower, before the whole thing washes away and you move on to your next good read.","Mr Brin is obviously a very gifted writer. I listen/read lots of modern authors, and it is a pleasure to find an author who just plain writes well!That being said, I saw the book on a different level than any of the other reviews I perused. The whole post-apocalyptic setting in my mind, was simply a background against which to analyze the heart of humankind. The post-apocalyptic world made it easy for Brin to cut through a lot of the fluff that clouds our thinking and get to real issues of life, justice, ethics, and finally idealism. Along the way he explores several social models: benevolent socialism, leader worship, feudalism, and separatism. Brin also weaves an interesting subtheme about what it means to be a man, or to be a hero.This book is way more than &quot;a good read&quot; or &quot;highly entertaining&quot; - it will make you think and examine your values. - the sign of a truly good work.","I must confess that I am not a native english speaker and I have read &quot;The Postman&quot; in russian translation, but I do hope that a translation was precise enough and my comment willbe of some value to the other readers. The first time I read this book was over three years ago and since then it became my favourite book which I reread now for the 17th time with a great pleasure. With every reading I discover more and more in it. The tru meaning of this book lies deep inside and it has to be read &quot;between the lines&quot;. Each and every of scene in this book has its own secret and has to be taken almost a philosophical peace of art and has to thought over. The film to my mind was to much &quot;on the surface&quot;. Kind of standart hollywood movie - a lot of shooting and fighting, bad guy and a good guy, and a tipical &quot;happy end&quot; stuff. It does not leave anything to think about aftervards like the book does. I was really disapointed when I found out that there are people who really did not like the book and some of them even say that the movie is better. If I may make a suggestion, I think these people who did not like it do not have to change their opinion because of this review (what is very unlikely anyway) but to try to reread the book, looking on it from the different perspective and even better few different perspectives. This might help you to find something in this book for yourself and maybe even to understand what kind of a man are you.","Some people's only exposure to this work has been through the movie of the same name starring Kevin Costner, and I've heard them call the premise such things as absurd, silly, or worse. How then, am I to reconcile this with the inherent believability and truth I found in it?Basically, the movie was doomed from the start. When considered on its own, the premise of this novel, that one man in the discarded uniform of a dead postman can change what once was a nation, seems implausible. What Brin does is take that premise and make it believable through a story and overarching world that makes myths like these natural. Its not the plot twists so much as the words of Brin that make this story believable.According to Brin, World War III was not the &quot;big one&quot; people have been expecting, instead lasting only a week or so and leaving many survivors. What killed people afterwards wasn't the nuclear or biological weapons so much as the fear and paranoia preventing the nation from reuniting again. Worst of all was the plague of &quot;survivalism&quot;, of deciding that your strength and guns allowed you to do whatever you wanted because you &quot;needed&quot; it to survive. Gradually, society begins to spiral downward into more and more isolated villages, uniting only when a common enemy such as the Holnist survivalists come along.Enter Gordon Krantz. An ex-student from St. Paul, he's been wandering west over the years in hope of finding civilization somewhere, anywhere. After being robbed, he takes the only warmth he can find, a uniform pilfered off of a dead postman. What starts out as a harmless little myth ends up spiralling out of control, as people grab onto the only remembrance they can find of the old United States. But who will take responsibility...?","This is a good modern classic Post-Apocalyptic Sci-Fi story. If you were an adult (or teenager) in the 1980s, you understand the cold war paranoia of the threat of limited nuclear warfare, the spot light in the media of the rise of survivalists & militia groups, the conspiracy theories of various advanced technology \"secret\" military projects and the beginning of personal electronics. Well welcome to the world of David Brin who wrote this book in the 1980's. These themes are seen throughout the story.This is a well written, fast paced story in which you lose track of time as you read it. In the post-apocalyptical US, one man's ideas of survival is to \"act\" as a US Mail carrier and create a myth that the US government has reestablished itself. He uses this technique to obtain his means of survival. There are many plot turns, some of which you anticipate and some that are mildly surprising. To some, this may be somewhat dated due to the 1980s cultural influences in the story line, but overall a very good read.It is a well worth the time to read it and I recommend it if you have never read post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi - this makes a good first choice for this genre.","Yes, this is the book that inspired the movie. No, they are not very alike except in the bare bones way. I never liked Costner's acting but I always liked the premise of the movie, so when I found out it was based on the book, I had to read it. The book is much more stark, more inside The Postman (Gordon Krantz)'s head, and is weighty. The torn countryside, pocket communities, survival mindset, and daily hardships are represented so much stronger within the pages than on the screen. It has some uplifting moments as well, which really touched me (ie the first time in 17 yrs that Gordon sees a light bulb on instead of a candle or oil lamp, he cries for all that is lost even though he thought himself a \"hardened survivor\"). It can get a bit monotonous with Gordon's waffling on helping himself or helping others, but overall - well worth reading.","This is going to be one I have to read every few years. A classic of life during nuclear winter. Civil society in America has died in a slow battle with post-war chaos, hypermilita groups, and famine. It's a wonderful tale of a professional liar, a traveling actor who becomes mired in his deceptions and in the process starts a legend that might lead the survivors back to civilization. The first step is the simple act of starting a postal service. There is interesting musing about feminism in this story. I found this narrative to be make the book worth it alone. Also, the book is a great travel guide through some scenic spots in post-apocalyptic Oregon.","Perhaps better known in the form of the mediocre Kevin Costner action flick, Brin's novel is actually an interesting tale of a society devolved into feudalism and redeemed by an idea. Post-war Oregon, which has been devastated by nuclear warfare, disease, and banditry, is inhabited by isolated villages preyed upon by suvivialists called \"Holnists\". Gordon Krantz is the titular character, a wandering bard who stumbles upon a Postal Service uniform and uses his acting skills to convince scattered villages that he represents the \"Restored United States of America.\" Miraculously, the con catches on, and the communities begin to coalesce, brought together by Krantz's fiction and the existence of a mysterious AI supercomputer named Cyclops.However, the struggling towns are soon threatened with invasion by an army of extremist Holnists. These men have taken the militaristic, individualist, might makes right philosophy of their leader, Nathan Holn, to an extreme. By recreating and improving upon societies like feudal Japan or medieval Europe, the Holnists want to banish the constitutionalism of the Founding Fathers, which they feel perverts nature by protecting the weak at the expense of the strong.Brin blends the grim barbarism of his world with the idea that people, even in the darkest of times, will hold onto even a glimmer of hope. The gritty realism is hampered somewhat by the inclusion of the Augment subplot, but other \"science-fictiony\" elements are seamlessly fitted into the world. Overall, the book's criticisms of survivalist thought may be rather unnecessary with the threat of nuclear war no longer in the public mindset, but it is an entertaining read nonetheless.","I have not seen the film version with Kevin Costner, but that's where I'd first heard of the story. A friend lent me the paperback, and it was interesting and a good, quick read.Gordon Krantz walks through a post-apocalyptic world, trading stories for what he needs, a nation torn apart by war and now divided. His finding of a Postal Service vehicle and its dead driver is his turning point as he moves through the Restored USA, though its restoration is far from done.Brin's attention to character development and detail is excellent--Krantz and the people he meets and comes into conflict with are compelling, and you just can't stop reading to see how it all goes.The back cover talks a little about how this can be compared to \"Alas, Babylon.\" I don't know about that; I agree the style is a bit alike and it takes place largely in a similar situation, but Brin doesn't steal from that.With the world as it is, this could be a cautionary tale. What happens when your universe collapses, and you realize what kind of real trouble you can be in, it makes one think. For me, that's the mark of a fine book!","All too often, when friends discover I enjoy science fiction, there is the qustion of why. I point to The Postman as an example of what a gifted writer can do with the genre. If you heard that this is a tale of post-apocalyptic America, your first thought would be Road Warrior and you could not be more wrong. Its simple plot gives way to complex themes. Mr. Brin examines the relations that keep society together, the relations between men and women and the need for one man to be a part of something lager. In the end, it is hope, fragile as it is, that binds us together. If you do not like science fiction, if you do but are longing for something with a little depth, please read this book.","Brin's novel of a postwar America, and a man who becomes a symbol of hope to a group of Oregon survivors, is a compelling, thoughtful tale. UNTIl, in its last third it becomes a macho, mano a mano action tale. I LOVED the first two-thrids, but was disappointed by the ending. Still worth a look for the engrossing first two-thrids. I'll bet the film will be nowhere near as well-done.","Read _The Postman_ when you're fed up with society. This book made me proud to live in this tragic and wonderful era of history.&quot;I am a member of a civilization&quot;- that simple phrase, never stated in the book, will echo in your head and ring true inside your ears after you finish. This is likely to stay my favourite book of all time- it's the only one I've EVER given a ten so far. Instead of going to the lousy looking movie, I think I'll just stay home and re-read the book. I may just buy a second copy soon.","Amazing. This book is about the depths of despair and the heights of the spirit. It is about how people, no matter how battered, will fight to carry light into the darkness. It is about how a few desperate lies can become the most astonishing, dangerous and beautiful truths. And somewhere in the real meat of the story, it also becomes a book about women; their power, their failings and their responsibility. David Brin has done an astounding job of presenting the reader with a very tragic, terrifying and yet believable account of post-apocalyptic America and the very flawed but very human men and women who fight to keep a dream alive. I can't believe I have not heard of this author before! His writing is beautiful, the story is human, humane, poignant and powerful. No matter what your opinion of the movie was, this book cannot be passed up.","How can anyone say the movie was better? Wow. This book is so engrossing as the story moves along, it's impossible to put down. Someone needs to remake this book as a movie: a movie that follows the book and not someone else's intentions.","One of the best books I've read all year. Brin's story flows with a grace and power little seen these days. His skillfull use of plot device and interludes ties the story together and reveals it's depth. This isn't just the story of a few minor skirmishs in hope-starved Oregon, this is the story of the history, present and future of the world. Brin conveys great personality and belivability in each and everyone of his characters. It will chalenge your way of looking at the world and at history. Highly recomended!","There's a piece of advice passed among fiction writers: &quot;Show, don't tell.&quot;A post-apocalyptic United States is a wonderful setting for exploring the myriad possible deteriorations of human, specifically American, society. A wandering minstrel, who conjures up for awed and wistful audiences the images and profound emotion of Shakespeare's great plays and some of the founding fathers' great speeches, seems to be a rich character for exposing the prejudices, fears, naivete, and nostalgia of the human character suffering under survival stress and attempting to make sense of a lost civilization.Unfortunately, Brin tells far more than he shows.Gordon, as he travels what's left of the American West in an attempt to find what he recognizes as hope and civilization, baldly and often sentimentally interprets the scene for us. His dialog, internal and external, tends toward the mundane, the obvious.The people he meets on his journey are, on the whole, predictable and uninteresting, caricatures of what could have been complex people with complex motives. The dialog given them is painfully trite.Why is this the case? Why does Brin, who is capable of subtlety and indirection in his revelation of character, succumb to pulp technique?One major problem with The Postman is that it is nigh on impossible to believe that the average American has such warm and fuzzy feelings for the &quot;postman&quot;. How many young readers of this book have seen a postal service worker bringing round letters and packages? If the young reader lives in an apartment complex or attends school, s/he probably hasn't. If the not-so-young reader is a working adult, s/he probably hasn't seen such since childhood. The person most capable of feeling such devotion to a postman is someone who has seen the original postal network formed in the United States and appreciates the fact that the postal service was functioning long before the telephone. Brin is gambling on the reader's confusing a &quot;service&quot; with an individual -- the postman -- and uses the emotional pull of the individual, who in many cases is rarely seen, to make a connection between Gordon's self-proclaimed role and the various townspeople he meets. The reader is left watching the story from afar, with no real emotional stake in it.And because the idea is so hard to swallow, Brin seems to feel it necessary to tell us what is going on in the book, not to allow the skillful writing that he is capable of draw us in and compell us, like the various townspeople (who should have been equally hard to sell), to believe in a truly far-fetched ideal of faithfulness, trust, and hope. Gordon wanders through the book with his heart on his sleeve, in conflict with his desires and conscience only in passing moments, and the people he meets try very hard to pass themselves off as exactly who they are -- there is no sense of discovery for the reader, who has everything laid out before him. It's as if Brin succumbed to the well-loved idea that if one says something often enough, it will be true; his intent appears to be to force us to accept what he has on offer not because it is compelling, but because he keeps saying it.A fundamental aspect of this connection between villages and towns -- that communication means power -- is never adequately addressed. It is ironic that Gordon uses the power of memory and sentimentality surrounding his &quot;position&quot;, essentially the power of the press, to establish and maintain his persona, but that no one appears in the book to truly exploit that newly-recovered capacity for propaganda and influence.Perhaps in his next novel Brin will trust himself, and his readers, more than he did in this one.","From the opening pages alone, you can tell that this book is going to be something special. It tells the epic tale(although the book is not epic-sized) of a post-apocalyptic drifter by the name of Gordon Krantz. In the unforgettable opening scene, Gordon is set upon by a roving pack of bandits, who take all his valuable possesions, including his tent. While attempting to head them off and get his belongings back, Gordon becomes lost and darkness falls. While wandering in the certain-death circumstances of freezing temperatures and rain, Gordon finds an abandoned postal jeep. In it he finds hope for a new beginning. Thus starts an incredible novel. David Brin has done an extraordinarily great job of making the settings and characters of Gordon's world believable to a person in our day and age. College campuses, shopping districts, and decaying highways all come alive in Gordon's words. I have read this book many times and each time I re-read it I pick up something new which seems to further spark my imagination. Unlike the other &quot;disaster&quot; novels, this one has a fair abundance of people and towns. But these people have lost hope in the world and although they are perhaps ten miles away from other towns, there is no contact between these isolated hamlets. This book really drew me in and made me seem a part of it's world. I love the way that it makes each setting and backdrop seem real and accessible to our modern day minds. Trust me, The Postman is one book that will stay on your shelf long after it is completed.","For anyone who has seen the film, \"The Postman,\" read the book. It's a great read even if you haven't seen the movie, but to realize how much someone can screw up a book in making a movie out of it, this is a classic example. The Postman (movie) has practically zilch in common with the book - continuity, location, characters, storyline. Wow. Set largely in western Oregon, Brin's novel starts slow but builds to a great crescendo at the very end. Wish Costner had had more faith in following Brin's storyline. It would have made a great movie.","Despite the melodramatic moments and the somewhat hurried ending of the hero's love interest, I really liked this book. A great story about being a man and fighting for the common good.","This was an interesting novel with a little bit of everything. It built on several post-apocalyptic novels I'd read, taking small functional towns from \"Alas, Babylon\" and the envoy wandering hippy from \"Lucifer's Hammer\" and the heroes of \"Patriots: Surviving the Coming Collapse\" somehow became the arch enemy villains of \"The Postman\". (This is particularly interesting because \"Patriots\" was written twenty years after \"The Postman\".)One of the things I liked about this book was that it started 13 years AFTER the apocalypse. When I read these stories I don't really much care how TSHTF, I just want to know what to do next. This chopped off a hundred some pages by just skipping to the interesting parts. Of course, that leaves it with no comments about emergency preparedness, other than some vague ideas that it might be a good idea to learn to use a bow and wear a fanny pack at all times.I know they made a Kevin Costner film out of it, but I haven't seen it. I suspect they kept all the violent parts of the book (lots of bad guys ranging from casual everyday unorganized chaotic evil to Government-Augmented Lawful Evil) and left out the good parts of the book (small dignities making ever-widening circles of larger dignities.)The hero of this book is at his heart a lover, not a fighter, and it was sort of nice to see how arts and intellectual pursuits could re-emerge. Basically, this was a fantasy written from the opposite point of view of \"Patriots\" where everyone left alive gets together to sing Kumbaya at the end of the day. These dystopian novels tend to say a lot about the author's personality as they form their own version of utopia against the backdrop.It was a quick read with some interesting points about how Big Ideas have a role in rebuilding. I would call this a 3.5 star book if I could.","The Postman is part of the end of world genre that I've always enjoyed. 16 years after a cataclysmic event a loner and wanderer stumbles upon a US Postal workers gear and invents a story in which to survive. He claims he is a representative of the restored United States of America and that the east coast will send reinforcements and supplies out west. He of course knows this is not true, but this fantasy brings hope to many people.This independent personality that invented the farce begins to believe his own fiction and suddenly goes from recluse to leader. The story quickly slips into a clich&eacute;d comic book type ending of good and evil. I found the premise interesting but the actions of the individual characters, especially the protagonist's transformation to be far-fetched.","How is this book multi-faceted? Even a grade school student could see that this book has many themes in its presentation. It carries with it three main struggles for Gordon:1) man vs. man: Gordon wanders America while trying simply to survive and to be just. Others are hyper-survivalists and injust. There's the classic good vs. evil.2) man vs. nature: Gordon walks across America, and the only way to the west coast is through the American terrain - thorns, radiation and twigs present day-to-day battles.3) man vs. himself: can Gordon continue to live a lie, suppress a lie and maintain hope for the greater good of mankind?In itself, the book is simple yet thoughtful... elegant yet honest... beautiful yet reality-based. All things fall into place when the story unfolds and the reader is drawn into post-apocalyptic America.","So, that's what the movie was supposed to be like. I wish it had lived up to the book. Post-apocalyptic America in a vision more real, gritty, and troublesome than anything dreamt up by Stephen King. Good Book.If the movie had tried to be half of what the book was, it'd have been a classic. Why is it that Costner stars in these duds made from great material? Are they just hiring the wrong screenwriters?","This is post nuclear war story writing the way it should be done. If we stuck solely with Mad Max we would realy be in trouble. If you enjoy a really good read this is for you even if you are one of those who generally doesn't read science fiction. This one is one of the best entries you will ever find. And if you haven't seen the movie with Kevin Costner yet do so. In some ways it is even better than the book is if that is ever possible with Hollywood. The script is very well written and the acting is superb.","David Brin's The Postman uses the post-holocaust type of novel to send several relevant messages among them: the importance to take social responsibility, the urgent need of hope and the value of things that we usually take for granted.Brin's novel might not be brilliantly written, and it certainly doesn't have any kind of epic scope. Indeed its scope is quite locally limited and the writing is simple and straight-forward. Nevertheless, the brilliant idea of a made-up Postman bringing new light into a broken country and the weight of the messages that are delivered makes this book a fine read to be recommended.","I read The Postman long before that horrible movie came out. Women who have not read the book will be pleased to know that there is more than one female character in the book. The choice of Costner, et. al. to make one character that is an amalgamation of the three central female characters is deplorable, at best.After watching the movie, I had to reread the book, just to make sure I wasn't hallucinating A LOT of actions in the book that never made it to the screen.Don't let the &quot;film&quot; sour you on reading this fantastic work.","I read the book long before I saw the movie, which is why I was somewhat dissapointed. This is not to say that Mr. Costner did a bad job of directing, or acting. In fact a lot of his mannerisms were close to how I pictured Gordons to be. However I think that a closer screen play could have been better. For instance some little things where left out, like his obsession with clean teeth. That would have been definitely more realistic. Also , and I realize this goes against every movie law, but there was entirely to much gut fire. It was pointed out a number of times that this was a resourse that was scarce, and everyone knew it. Lastly the thing that annoyed me the most was the movie character Ford-Lincoln-Mercury!!!! The guy had a real name, does anyone know it? I'll let you read the book to find out.","This book takes place in the future after a nuclear war. Times revert back to the dark ages and peoples hopes are crushed. Terrorist know as 'holnist' cause pain and suffering for everyone in the western states. The a lone traveler comes along in a old postman's outfit. Along with this he brings leadership and hope for the people to rise up against the holnist and fight them off. This is a great book!","I first read this book years ago, probably when it was first printed, and I found it to be a very powerful story of one man's fight against oppression. Granted, we've all heard that before but then what plot hasn't been heard before. There's just something about America that brings us all together when some dictator wannabe comes along to take away our freedom(s) and that's what this book is all about.","Of all the ways in which you might die after a nuclear holocaust,I had not considered the possiblity that something as mundane as periodontal disease might get you in the end. This is a truly insightful, thought provoking book.","I know that many people have panned the movie based on this book, but frankly of the two, the characters in the movie are much better drawn and developed than the book. The movie has its slow moments but the book was more than slow, it frankly just stalled and I had to force myself to finish it. In the end I did not much care about what happend to the characters. The movie is very under rated and is a nice jewel about \"hope\" over coming cynicism. Since we live in a country full of cynical critics that is probably the main reason the movie was panned. I would not recommend the book but would recommend the movie.","Just another post-apocalypse view of the future, and not a very good one at that. I saw the movie and it was even worse. I couldn't believe they made a movie of one of his poorer works. I wish someone would make a movie of this Startide Rising/Uplift War series.","I read this book a couple of years ago and just decided to write this after I saw a commercial for the film version. This book was nothing more than just &quot;OK&quot;. Brin was able to hold my interest long enough for me to finish it and that's it. Not totally boring, but definitely not worth a second read. Here's the story in a nutshell: Gordon Krantz survives the Doomwar and after a particularly close encounter with death dedicates his life to attempting to restore America to its former greatness by lying to everyone he meets. His lies cause the deaths of nearly every really strong character in the book. Yet this deceiver has the nerve to whine on and on about &quot;who will take responsibility?&quot; as though he is the only person left on the blasted planet who is trying to do more than just survive. What conceit! Don't buy it, go to the library and check it out.","Well just finished this book and i loved it. The book i read previous to this was \"World War Z\", So the \"Postman\" was up against some pretty stiff post apocalypse territory here! Well i wasnt disapointed, the story, the characters and the plot all mesh really well.The main character was real, not an ex special forces hero ready to take on the world,thank god im sick of those characters!i really felt for the main player in the book and his plight in trying to stay alive in a world without rule or law, his plan worked a treat and the authour had me in for the ride!My only real complaint was \"spoiler ahead\" the unnecessary inclusion of super enhanced gnome experiment human bad guys and \"hero\" at the last quarter of the book,it was ok , it just wasnt really needed.Why he felt he needed to do this confused me, it didnt need this inclusion, maby the author felt he needed a science fiction type addition, or maby the book has dated a little in regard to dna enhancement, well it isnt going to disappoint the other 98% of a really really great post op book!","My review comes late, since I just now read the book. So I won't give an outline of the whole story, only my reaction to certain elements. Some people liked the first half, but I almost put the book aside after the opening pages.The story starts with action, but our first glimpse of Gordon, the protagonist, is as a coward or a weakling. He let 5 bandits who robbed him run off without firing a shot, though he still had a loaded .38 revolver. He also had a clear shot at the ringleader, but he lets them take off with his survival gear after vainly appealing to their \"good natures\" to leave him some basic items. They left him to die in the cold with no real resistance from him. Somehow this doesn't ring true, since Gordon had the grit to survive 17 years of wandering after the Collapse, and he surely must have encountered other bandits and bloody macho types.A short while later, with an injured foot and weakened by hunger, and not knowing where his next meal might come from, he digs a grave for a nameless skeleton, thus jeopardizing his own survival chances. Again, this is not really credible. The skeleton is all that remains of a mailman he found in a long-abandoned postal vehicle.He dons the postman's jacket to keep out the cold, and later concocts a fanciful tale about being a postman for a \"Restored United States.\" This ruse does gain him some free meals; in one town it even gets him ten nights in the sack with a comely young wife whose husband can't give her a child.He does show some intestinal fortitude when he attempts to rescue a pretty young woman from a brutal captor who wants to rape her, but he pretty well flubs it, resulting in her death, although he does save her now-orphaned young son.It's kind of hard to respect this bozo, an opportunist who's plagued by ineptness and tender scruples at all the wrong times. He does manage, however, to become an accomplished liar, although he consoles himself that he's doing a service for those he dupes.I didn't feel it got worse throughout the story, though there were still many incidents that were unexplained or not really credible, particularly the ending with two different \"Augments\" fighting each other to the death. That was rather fanciful and brought to mind two \"Terminators\" battling each other. I also felt the view was rather parochial in that it's all happening in a limited locale on the West Coast, mostly Oregon. And I felt let down by the rather blah ending.So, why give it 3 stars? It's not terribly bad, and the author does know how to build sentences. He gives us a glimpse of how things might be, given the circumstances, even though he often tries our willingness to believe. And once I reconciled myself to Gordon's non-heroic character, Brin did keep the story moving along. I don't feel the book was a total waste of time, and some parts are better than others. For anyone interested in post-Collapse stories, this certainly isn't the worst, and I could recommend it in that spirit.","The depiction of events in David Brin's The Postman is well-observed, provides great texture, and yet is minimal. Gordon Krantz is studied with care, his inner thoughts communicated very well, yet most importantly his temperament is established through various trials he handles or mishandles. Other characters are touched on, some remaining highly memorable.","If you saw this movie and think the book would be just as pathetic, dont even think about it. Brin writes an interesting story of life after a revolution, a nuclear war and the destruction of our American Culture and the travels through Oregon of Gordon, the man who would become the postman. It is a very good book to read and I do recommend it even if 'end of the world apocalyptic' novels aren't your style, youll find this a good book to finish.","I won't review the plot and I won't say how bad the movie was (although its dreariness was predictable); it's been said before.David Brin, by his own account, writes straightforward stories for his books, and tends to be more mythic in his short stories. The Postman is the exception. It began as a short story which Brin later expanded into a novel, expanding the mythic element as well.I enjoyed the book as a story but what really drew me to it was the political philosophy. What makes one country different from another? What makes a story suitable as the basis of a national character? How did the US acquire its essential nature? How do we teach our children -- and our military -- the difference between service-out-of-duty and service-for-power? By having his hero unintentionally recreate a nation, Brin brings these questions to the fore. We get to look at them, and think about how they apply to our nation's founding. The hero talks about Ben Franklin (good buy) vs. Aaron Burr (bad guy); the Roman legend of Cincinnatus and why he refused the crown; that with freedom comes duty. These are things worth thinking about.Or you can read the book as a simple SF novel. That, I think, would be missing what makes the book truly special, and why many of the reviewers were disappointed.","David Brin did a good job writing this book. Years later it is still a good read. He gets off track sometimes and that can be annoying. But generally he drives the plot fairly consistently.The book is drastically different from the movie. And it is possible the movie could have been better if it had stayed with the original plot. But both are good in their own way.","Its probably my own fault that I didnt like this book. I chose to read it based on my thorough enjoyment of the movie with the same title. I mean, I LOVED the movie. The movie was an inspiring story of accidental hope. A man assumes the guise of a postman in an attempt just to survive and in doing so he inspires everyone he meets to become active participants in changing their collective destinies.David Brin's book certainly illudes to spread of hope, but really its a story about Gordon Krantz's deception and desperation. The biggest game changer for hope seems to be Cyclops and that is all a scam. Gordon is really the only character that I feel like I got to know in the book and I didnt really like him. This is survivalist fiction, and yes- characters in this genre are often selfish and self-focused. The world as we know it ended, its consistant for them to only be concerned with their immediate survival.The story line was well constructed. The plot never dragged, unnecessary tangents werent explored. Overall- its well written. As far as books go- not an awful read. Lots of food for thought even though it is fiction. Just dont read it with the movie in mind. They are completely different stories and you will be disappointed.","To Brin's credit: this book moves along quickly, follows a nice formula, and goes roughly where you expect it to go with just enough twists to keep it engaging along the way.That said, this is also an exemplar of a very average novel about a \"post-apocalyptic America\". It makes me want to see the film with Costner. Just to compare.Also: Brin's attempt at being sympathetic to a woman's plight in this post-apocalyptic scenario? Fell way short. Trust me bro, these broads would be way tougher than you've painted them here. Even with a bunch of survivalist ex-soldiers with rampant genes and hormones.","The novel concerns a wanderer some years after an apocalyptic series of disasters results in the disintegration of the United States. He comes across a dead postman and his letters, and he takes the uniform and letters. People afterwards mistake him for a real postman, and he uses the misunderstanding to his advantage. He eventually establishes postal routes between several towns and sparks hope in the people for the future.That premise is a somewhat interesting one, and it drives the first third of the book. After that, though, the book is not interesting. The protagonist finds a series of villages who owe fealty to a computer named Cyclops. He soon discovers that the computer does not function and that it is a lie just as his own postman hoax is.Even worse is the feminist motif of the last third of the book. The protagonist meets a headstrong woman who thinks the country's women are to blame for the apocalypse because they could have reined in their men. When the Cyclops villages are threatened by hostile forces, this woman organizes a band of women to infiltrate the invaders as seductresses who will, on an appointed day, kill as many of them as possible.The book ends musing about the flaws of man and the virtues of woman. No mention is made of the subtlety that men have the capacity for brutality only because women favor strong and aggressive men.All in all, the book seems to lose the post-apocalyptic feel, it loses the interesting postman ruse, and finds itself in some totally lame feminist screed. The worst part of the book is the climax in which two augmented soldiers fight one another to the death in hand-to-hand combat.Another annoying aspect of the book is the protagonist's constant soul-searching. It occupies the first pages and does not relent.","I love this book, and was one of the books I remember reading until 4 in the morning just because I couldn't put it down. Then came the film, which I actually picketed at our local cinema, I couldn't in all good faith allow anyone who had read the book to see the film. David Brin kindly shared some of his thoughts with me on the matter via the power of e-mail and whilst he was generous in crediting Mr Costner with trying to stick to the spirit of the book, this is definitely a case of \"if it aint broke, don't fix it\". Ok, this would make a better mini-series than a film, but there you go. Anyway, where was I? Ok, itinerant story teller adopts identity of long dead postman, builds new hopes, defeats survivalist army, sets off to California to reform the Beach Boys (it is unclear whether Tom Petty assists him in this endeavour) etc etc. I have begged and cajoled Mr Brin for a Postman 2 (Postman 2 - Not known at this address\") in which a furious Oregon populace get all annoyed for having wasted all their time doing stuff in the name of The Restored United States only to find it doesn't exist, well, you would be a trifle cheesed off wouldn't you? Anyway, book good film bad, and by the look of the economic and energy situation as I write this (October 2008), you will all soon be able to recreate Gordon Krantzs' adventures for yourselves! So in summary, visit the apocalypse before it visits you. I bid you farewell","The only time I can honestly say I enjoyed the movie better than the book. I suppose my biggest gripe is style...the author comes off almost pretentious at times. Plus the thought of \"neo-hippies\" as some kind of scientist/artist/wood elf kind of makes my stomach turn. All the hippies I ever met smell bad and have no job.Also, I guess it might be kind of picky, but count how many times he uses the word \"irony\". It's just about every other page. Sorry. Loved the movie though.","As a post-apocalyptic novel, The Postman is mediocre at best. As a social/political commentary, it's much worse. There are many other books better than this. Give Costner (and the screenwriter!)credit that the movie made a solid adventure story out of a poor novel. Its too bad, the basic premise of The Postman is very interesting. However, the end result is disappointing.","When I picked up tis book, I expected it to be another one of David Brin's interesting novels. And, when I started to get into the book, I hated it. I thought, maybe, that the book would be different from the movie, which I also didn't like, but it wasn't.","As a self-professed post-apocalyptic fiction aficionado, I was very disappointed by this book. It cannot compare to some of the classic apocalyptic novels. Poorly written, very painful to read. The characters are wooden, the plot is simple, the dialogue is artificial, and there is nothing about this book that sets it apart from any other post-apocalyptic novel that you could find in the mass-market stack in the Walmart sci-fi section.Very disappointing. Boring. Do not recommend.","This is one of the worst books that I ever MADE myself read. That's right, I actually forced myself to complete this poorly written book. I kept waiting for the author to redeem himself, but alas I remained dissapointed. The really sad part is that the theme could be quite interesting. Unfortunately, the author creates a probable view of society after a holocast and does nothing with it.What was the deal with the mutunt soldiers? That was realistic (sarcasm). And of course the author couldn't give women too much credit by allowing them to be victorious in battle. Oh yes, the computer, stupid stupid stupid. If the scietists were able to get computers going again, do you really think that they would only repair hand-held children's games?This is a horrible book and a great waste of time. Unfortunately, Amazon has not given me the option of giving less than a one star review. The author owes my life a more than a few hours.","I am an avid reader and a fan of the &quot;post-apocalyptic&quot; genre, but I have to say, this book is utter garbage. I only read up to the third chapter or so... I couldn't take it. Terrible writing, disjointed pacing, awful introspective ramblings, and unrealistic, two-dimensional characters make for great kindling, and little else. It's the only book I've ever thrown away!","\"The Postman\" by David Brin is a brilliant concept. The unifying symbol of a post-apocalyptic America is a man in the uniform of a much-maligned civil servant.Gordon Krantz was a Minnesota university student when the U.S. and the world were hit with a triple-whammy. First a limited nuclear war followed by germ warfare then the deranged fanatics of survivalist cult in sequence destroyed civilization. Gordon became a soldier in the Minnesota National Guard. He had a front row seat as society and government were overwhelmed by catastrophe after catastrophe. He sees the heroism of the men in his unit and others as they lost the battle against chaos.Years later and much farther west, Gordon is a wanderer in search for a home. The US has sunk into barbarism. The few places there is order are ruled by feudalism. There is little technology, little interaction between communities. Occasionally, he finds some isolated communities that will allow him to perform his one man theatrical show. The life of this drifter is changed forever when reivers chase him from his camp. He finds shelter in the vehicle hidden by a dying postman.Like others Krantz knew, this mail man continued to deliver mail months after the US government had ceased to exist. Taking the man's bag and putting on his uniform, he resumes his search for a home.At his next stop, he goes through his usual vaudeville routine in exchange for food and shelter. But something peculiar happens. The people of this settlement believe he really is a mailman. They give him letters for the next town.Gordon conceives a simple con. He will pose as an official for the Restored United States government. What was originally a scheme for food and shelter becomes a great movement. People believe because they want to believe. Gordon finds himself as a leader. In his heart he is an idealist. All he wants is the old peace and order. But he is unaware that his years of wandering have made him resourceful and creative.Order is gradually restored in Oregon. This can't happen too soon because unknown to Gordon, other forces are conspiring to impose an order of a much more brutal nature.\"The Postman\" has a simple message. Sometimes ordinary people can't look to someone else but themselves for their own salvation. We live in comfort and security because ordinary people were willing to pay literally in blood.","I am not a fan of fiction, but I read this book a few years ago when the movie came out and radio personality Art Bell spoke about the book. I read it and found the book to be a pleasant surprise. The book is about Benjamin Franklin as much as anything else. It gives Franklin a lot of the credit that modern America seems to have forgotten about. The Postman also gives a little type of history lesson about early America and how it actually came to be a unified nation that would someday change world history. In a nation without TV, telephones, radio or other communication due to lack of electricity, the postal service is much more important than one could imagine.Brin's book is also a lot about women in American society and how much worse things would be for them in another, tragic, furure society. Brin dedicates this book to the women in his life who have fascinated him and that dedication is evident throughout the book. Brin's ability as a writer takes what might otherwise be only a dark and ugly story of futuristic nuclear disaster, and makes it one of hope for the future and appreciation for the past.As I wrote earlier, I am not a fan of fiction, but I found this worth the read. Forget about the movie, give the book a chance and you may well agree with my appreciation for this particular work of fiction.","David Brin sets out to create a post-apocalyptic world of the near future, a world of villages and fallen cities in the northwestern U.S. recovering from the loss of technology following an almost-all-out-war and surviving threats of political anarchism in the form of self-centered town governments and marauding bands of survivalists. The book's most interesting conceit comes in the form of the main character, Gordon Krantz, a traveling bard who is mistaken for a &quot;postman&quot; while dressed in official issue postal duds he stumbled upon in an old postal jeep. Unfortunately, this is Brin's best idea of the novel and he uses it to excess to carry and deliver a series of philosophical epistles centered about ideas of community, citizenship and belief in doing what's right and decent for our neighbors. The assumed &quot;postman,&quot; Gordon Krantz, creates the fiction of a &quot;Restored United States of America&quot; in order to get a room and meal in a hostile and paranoid township. But the idea takes on its own life as people begin to think again of folks beyond their own town borders and ultimately Krantz finds himself being recreated and &quot;restored&quot; by the power of his own fiction as it catches fire across the small towns of the Oregon countryside.. The &quot;good guys&quot; vs. &quot;bad guys&quot; confrontations lack any originality and wit. The interweave of subplots are glaring in their lack of subtlety regarding outcomes. Readers will anticipate what's about to occur long before the novel does and so one starts reading faster and faster muttering, come on, come on, come on. Mix this with shallow, two-dimensional characters that you've met before in other novels and you have a disappointing work by a writer capable of much better. THE POSTMAN reads like a sci-fi novel meant to teach basic civics 101 to late adolescents. It could have made a strong short story or novella, but it cannot sustain its conceit for over 300 pages. I applaud Brin' attempt to express his own political vision for a recovery of simpler and more elegant virtues and values in a contemporary world that does indeed appear overwhelmed with the ethic of personal aggrandizement and survival. But the power of the vision is lost. The novel ends with a set up for a sequel. Perhaps the next delivery will be closer to what we hoped we would be receiving.","Having not seen the movie, I was not sure to expect. It is a very well written book and keeps your interest from beginning to end.SMOOTH WRITING CONTRUCTS THE WORLD:This being my second David Brin book, my first was Kiln People, I amazed at his writing. As a sci-fi buff so often the description of the &quot;world&quot; the novel takes place in is cumbersome. There are explanations of the situation, technology and social structure that weigh down most sci-fi stories. David Brin has a wonderful way of weaving this into his stories so they are part of the dialogue or the unfolding scene. Trust me, this makes reading his books effortless. I found this to be true in Kiln people as well.A TALE OF A DRIFTER:The story takes place after society is recovering from a major war and social upheaval. Gordon the main character is a drifter moving West to find a better place to live. He is a older survivor, so he knows of the times before the big war and society fell apart. He is accosted by some locals in his travels and while planning to retrieve some of his belongings happens upon an old mail truck. Here he realizes that the world fell apart a bit differently than he supposed and in acquiring the wardrobe of the hapless dead postman, he has taken on the mantle of that title.HOW HOPE CAN BE GROWN:The rest of the story is how Gordon continues his travels from town to town and the saga of the postman is begun. Some of it is driven by its own momentum. Some of it is driven by Gordon's imagination. Mostly it is interesting how a theory can help hope form and become self perpetuating. Here the Postman becomes the icon of a world that is gone. Maybe just maybe, it can be rebuilt.IT IS ALL SO PLAUSIBLE:Ironically, when you read of how the world fell, you can see where we have this potential. It is all so plausible. We have the elements in today's society to create this very same mess.David Brin does a nice job working from that and from the hopes that could rebuild that.","I have never before read a David Brin novel, others here say this is not his best, but I found this novel a very good read. This book begins approximately sixteen years after an NBC war (for those who don't know, that stands for nuclear, biological, chemical) that was called the doomwar by those who lived through it. That war nearly destroyed the United States as a civilized society, but soon after that war survivalists plundered and destroyed most of what little civilization remained. Gordon, the primary character, traveled from one small isolated village to another for sixteen years after the Doomwar and at one point was robbed of most of his meager possessions. Soon he found a United States Postman's uniform and badge, and from there he impersonated a postman from a long dead government, a scam that had unusual consequences to say the least and created a very interesting story, with danger all around.This novel is fast paced and always the human nature side of the story is not neglected, and womens' view of things is well discussed, and as David Brin seems to say in this novel, how can us guys really know what a women thinks, down deep, all the time? This book is rich in descriptive detail without overdoing it. I found this book very easy to read, the words seemed to flow off the pages, well written.","I was hesistant in buying this book due to my unfavorable impressions to the horrible trailers that I saw for the movie, The Postman. The story intrigued me, but I had passed over the book 4 different times in various bookstores. Well finally on my 5th lookover, I decided to buy it and I'm sure happy I did. I took it home and read the book in two sittings. Couldn't get enough of the book and was sad to see it end.It was a fast read, and I liked the fast plotting of the book. I wanted to see how each new town that Gordon, the &quot;Postman&quot;, traveled to would react to him. Great read.Although labeled as a Sci Fi book, I tend to see some Western aspects of the books. There aren't cities anymore, but towns. Plus Gordon is traveling in the wilderness like a frontiersman, trying to rediscover the west. I find the western sci-fi/fantasy genre to be a very unexplored genre. Some books I recommend would be Devil's Tower, and Devil's Engine by Mark Sumner. A nice mix of traditional western with Fantasy.Brin, I sure hope you write a sequel. Gordon still has more of the west to explore!","Book Review by C. Douglas BakerTHE POSTMAN is set sixteen years after a cataclysmic event (presumably a nuclear war although there is room for speculation that it may have been some other disaster such as a large comet hitting the earth) has plunged the world to the brink of a dark age. Trying to survive in Oregon's Cascade Mountains, Gordon Krantz happens upon a run-down United States Postal Service jeep while trying to find a warm place to sleep and spends the night. Taking the leather jacket and cap off the skeleton of his unfortunate bunk-mate, with the full regalia of the U.S. Postal Service as accoutrements, and a sack full of old mail, Gordon sets off to hunt supplies. Thus begins Gordon's almost unconscious generation of a false legend.Attempting to extort supplies from settlement in the mountains, Gordon comes up with a story about a \"Reformed United States\" to the east and the reorganization of a Postal Service. Using his newly acquired postal gear as props, Gordon takes upon himself the role of a \"postal inspector\" who has come to reestablish postal routes and \"inspect\" local governmental institutions. He even, luckily, comes up with a few letters from the mailbag addressed to relatives of people in the community as a ruse to bolster is story. Through this reckless prevarication Gordon weaves his way into the good graces of the people he comes into contact with, simply by being a catalyst to their nostalgic remembrance of a time when the United States was a superpower and the postal service was so reliable as to be taken for granted. Gordon's \"big lie\" offers hope of a return to better times.Traveling around in this persona, Gordon lets the legend grow, even appointing \"postal inspectors\" in various areas as he goes along, creating a loyal cadre of \"followers\". As the legend takes hold, Gordon finds that he cannot tell the truth or back out of the duty that communities impose on him--that being giving them some hope that a better world is ahead and doing something to bring that future about. They believe in Gordon and his\"Reformed United States\" and he cannot let them down.Despite a very promising plot, THE POSTMAN is a bit frustrating. Authors using a lost-holocaust world as their setting must viscerally convey the extent of the catastrophe and the eeriness of a post-technological world. Brin in THE POSTMAN fails to do so. The reader never really emotionally feels the impact of the disaster and the odds facing the main character, Gordon. As a result, the book never delivers the emotional blow that is necessary to make the struggle back to a semblance of civilization satisfying to the reader. Brin is too contrite in his brief descriptions of run down cities, empty wildernesses, and struggling communities. The novel just does not \"feel\" like it is set in a post-holocaust society, despite that the characters and actions take place there.Brin also fails to bring life to his characters. Even the main character, Gordon, is not as well drawn as he could be. Brin does an even less stellar job at developing his peripheral characters. When important persons are suddenly killed the reader does not feel the sense of grief that great authors can convey, because the reader never really \"knew\" the character. This is particularly true of his female hero Dana. Her attempts to save her community and the fate of her band of \"scouts\" does not touch the reader because Brin never fully cultivates the reader's sympathy or understanding for her or her comrades.That being said, I actually enjoyed the novel (surprise!). Despite feeling estranged from the characters and plot, Brin's prose and ability to write action scenes and keep the story moving made it an enjoyable reading experience.","I saw the Kevin Costner film before reading the book, and unlike seemingly everyone else I enjoyed the movie. However I didn't know what to expect from the book, and so I was quite pleasantly surprised. I am of the school that enjoys movies, but knows that the books are almost always (if not always) better than the movies. The only problem I had is that I kept expecting things to happen as they had in the book, but specific details were different enough that it wasn't really ruined for me.There was thankfully no complete answer at the start that fully explained the condition of the world. This can have a place, but its absense strengthened this book. Instead the mystery is gradually unveiled until we find out that there were many wars and attacks that damaged the world. World War III errupted after an upswing out of the 80s depression. Thankfully explanations weren't simplistic and were quite credible in light of human character.Gordan Krantz was a fun character to journey with along the course of the book. Yes he is somewhat of an educated rogue that starts a huge scam to keep himself alive, but as you go along you begin to feel yourself caught up in what others feel when they hear of the \"Restored United States\" and the Postal Service. You cannot help but feel hope for these people, so long beaten down by the brutal Holnist survivalists and harsh post-apocalyptic conditions.If you enjoy science-fiction this book is peppered with enough of it to hold your interest, yet it isn't based of technical specs or diagrams. It is easily intelligble to the non science or sci-fi buff, yet at the same time it doesn't talk down to them either. I found it a very enjoyable story with empathetic characters and concepts that tie the whole together into something greater than the sum of its parts","A few years back I got interested in seeing how many books out there were written about life after either a nuclear war or massive epidemic that wipes out a lot of the earths population. There are many, to say the least.Most are purely trashy adventure novels full of tough ex military types killing each other and nearly non existant plot lines. The Postman, on the other hand, is one of the few that I personally thought had an element of realism and an interesting plot. Earth Abides would probably be another.A word of caution - if you liked the Costner movie 'the postman' and haven't read the book don't expect many simularities - other than some very general ones. Costner apparently thought that his ideas were more 'filmable' or whatever, but it ruined a great story (which I personally think would have made an excellent movie unchanged from how it was written by Brin). The character Gordon is completely different from book to movie, and this may throw you off if you are expecting the warrior minstrel from the movie in the book.4 out of 5 because I didn't like the ending (the part about the females).","I decided to read The Postman because I had heard good things about both the book and it's author, David Brin. I couldn't have been more misled. The book follows the adventures of a wandering loner in a post apocolyptic america, who finds that by impersonating a US postman, he can find saftey and food within the dwellings of the usually untrusting survivors. Along the way, he finds that his ruse has generated an icon that people can follow, to re-build america from the ashes. It doesn't sound too bad, I even liked the idea. Unfortunatley, Brin's writing style is flat, boring and so mundane, that he fails to bring any sense of drama, romance or even interest to any of his situations and characters. An example includes the postman falling in love with a woman for the romance part of the book, and then when he loses her, we don't care, because she was NEVER DEVELOPED as a character...This book is full of &quot;bad sci-fi&quot; cliches, and predictable plot developments. Everything from the Wizard of Oz computer to the characters refering to things like, the &quot;Doomwar&quot; or the &quot;Anti-Tech Riots.&quot; I mean this book was written in 1985? The dialogue and writing sound more like 1955! like Even such small things as how ALL the survivors refer to the Doomwar and the Chaos that followed (Brin's capitals) by the same names, even though we are told that they have all been isolated from each other for 20 years WITH NO COMUNICATION! This tells us that Brin didn't give this world any thought! The book is supposedly full of grand ideas, and in reality they all fall flat, and become cliched, mostly because Brin treats his readers as idiots when his main character, who is delivering mail and bringing hope to the surviviors, stops and thinks to himself, &quot;Gee if there was only a symbol, a person that everyone could rally behind, I would help them if I could...&quot; A good author would have given us this sense of events, (i.e. - the postman not realizing what he is doing, as he himself yearns for hope) in a subtle, interesting way. Unfortunatley, Brin just can't deliver his own ideas, and instead we end up laughing, when we were meant to be inspired. BMAN","this is an ingenius plot....a character to get behind is very much welcome, here it is Gordon Krantz...such an interesting idea, with villains that you actually dislike and you have yourself a good read...ive read this book twice now, and loved it both times...i just love the whole idea of moving the capital of the restored US to St. Paul...and how Krantz plays the role of government worker...this is an excellent book, well written, with a very interesting idea...worth the price at a bookstore? for me it was, others may be better off with a quick pickup at the library, because this is one of those books that you love or you hate","The Postman is an intelligent work with deep concepts. Describing the aftermath of war in America is done beautifully and with enough ambiguity to make it seem plausible. I live in the States, and there is that underlying survivalist mentality when you leave the Major cities. This representation is a good spin on the concepts and the possibility of post-apocalype survival.","I've read &quot;The Postman&quot; some three times, BEFORE the movie. When I heard they were going to make a movie out of it, I was almost aghast, afraid that they'd ruin a great story. The movie was not as good as this book, so if you were disappointed in the film, BUY THE BOOK. I was, however, especially pleased to see that one of my close personal friends played the Sherriff in the movie. :&gt;","I haven't seen the movie, but from what I have heard, it did not pay justice to the book. (Yes, few films do.)In The Postman, Brin writes about life on earth which is a different location then in most of his books. And the communication he writes about is not the touchy-feely kind, but the &quot;Hey I am alive what about you?&quot; kind. The Postman made me wonder again about how really important it is to know what is happening beyond our own communities.If you like science-fiction, but are tried of the usual humoid aliens, try Brin's The Uplift War.","David Brin's &quot;The Postman&quot; is a brilliant conceptualization of the human truism &quot;where there is no vision, the people perish&quot;. With his main character, Gordon, he portrays the plight of an idealist and dreamer thrown into a situation that demands decisiveness and action; in short, a modern Hamlet. Like Hamlet, Gordon is torn between his natural idealism and the terrible cynicism that the reality of his situation forces on him; like Hamlet, he flounders in moral introspection and debate when action is clearly required. It is interesting how natural cynics (call themselves realists) despise Gordon, while natural idealists understand and admire him; both within the novel and on this review site. Like every great novel, it reveals truths about human nature to the extent that the reader is able to perceive them. Keep writing, David! SF has too long been dominated by cynics, sensationalists and technotwits!","Mr. Brin's Postman is the story of the journey of Gordon, which never leads him to an inner life except to ask, who is going to save humanity from itself? The closest we ever get to something beyond the scope of human beings is Cyclops, the computer, who turns out to be the front for a group. The questions I ask are: Wouldn't the farmers have had some kind of worship service to a Higher Power? And, is Gordon going to California to find just more of the same or to find God? To me it is a good read on hopelessness and despair. Cause and effect.","The Postman is a good, quick read, but about halfway through the plot and story start getting fuzzy as Brin uses the story to explore philosophical issues. I'm a big fan of post-nuclear fiction, and the book does not fully exploit Brin's interesting postnuclear view of the world. (the jack-of-all-trades and the master of none syndrome) The movie, on the other hand, does. It has a good, consistent, patriotic story and is everything the book should've been. (which doesn't happen very often) Still though, the book is quite good and I'd read it again if I had to do it over. I only wish the movie was longer and had more time exploring the postnuclear world as it did in the opening scene.","I just could not put this book down! David Brin's short story-turned-novel got me wanting to read on and on- hungry for more. I finished reading within 12 hours just in time before the movie release on Christmas Day implying that a curious non-sci-fi fan can expect easy reading with technical language kept at a minimum. Certainly not Brin's best but possibly his most glamorous and profitable work thanks to Kevin Costner and (ugh)Hollywood. Nevertheless, it is an exciting and thought-provoking reading as we witness the deeply nostalgic &quot;Postman's&quot; inner struggle for clarity. As for the ending, I smell a sequel. It had me visualizing the final scene from &quot;Back to the Future&quot; which, as I recall, had the audience shouting &quot;WHAT?!&quot; Obviously, Brin knows book sales to have written such a annoyingly simple ending. Just make sure not to let that Huey Lewis song enter your mind after finishing this wonderful story. You won't be able to get rid of it!","A reader of the book will see that The Postman (which is not related to the &quot;Il Postino&quot; movie of a few years back) illustrates the power of memes over brawn. From the indications of the advance trailer, Kevin Costner is butchering this book by turning the physically and intellectually weak protagonist of The Postman into a Mad Max hero of the Reformed USA. &quot;Waterworld goes Postal,&quot; indeed, from the catcalls and jeering evident in the theatres where the trailer runs, the movie is set to be as well-received as Waterworld. In the book, the Postman is merely a catalyst - to turn him into a heroic leader utterly destroys the meaning of the story. Can anyone tell me if there's some wonderful story that got perverted into Waterworld?","There are only two things wrong with this book, and if you quit reading this review now, you'll probably miss one of them.The first &quot;wrong&quot; is the fact that the story leaves so much of this &quot;future&quot; unexplored. I'm going to go back and read this one again, just to see what I missed.The second &quot;wrong&quot; is that someone is actually making a movie of this book and it stars Kevin Costner. Oh no! &quot;Waterworld goes Postal&quot;?!?Other than that, this book is a great story and worth your time! Thanks David! Get to work on the sequel (or if there's one out there, email me!)","Through this book, many fictional works have flowed forth.If you have played such games as:Fallout,Fallout 2,Fallout 3: Game of The Year Edition,Fallout: New Vegas, Half-Life, Half-Life 2, you have experienced the reality and atmosphere.The only post-apocalypse book where post-nuclear feminism elements are clear and reformed. Reformed in ways both big and small.How does one prevail when the darkness of man is unleashed and roams freely. This is where Gordon finds himself. Wandering. Not knowing what to do. You see Gordan's soul where it has been repeated killed and repeatedly revived.Gordon wanders looking for something to believe in. Anything. He's seen all the horrors of the post-apocalypse world. Yet he is always wandering and roaming, being unable to settle down.","I've read this twice and it affected me differently each time. For a book that is, ultimately, about hope and optimism and the capacity to rise above, this is an amazingly grim and downbeat novel. But if post-apocalyptic stories are your cup of meat--this is one of the best. It shares with Robert Edmond Alter's novel PATH TO SAVAGERY a strong capacity to make you feel the cold, the wet and the hunger; rather than glorify physical combat, both books convey the fear and desperation of a lawless, dog eat dog world. Kevin Costner's notorious film version isn't as awful as most people claim, but it doesn't manage to hold much interest after the first hour. There are a few things wrong with THE POSTMAN--namely the chief villains, who are a bit unbelievable, but that is just a quibble; David Brin has written an engrossing and thoughtful novel and its well worth seeking out.","You know, without having to look at Kevin Costner, this is a pretty good story. I haven't seen the movie, but I have read many other books by David Brin, and they've all been enjoyable, so I decided to give this one a try. It's a philosophical story more than anything else, but set in a nice post apocalyspe landscape that makes the abstract issues a little more urgent. Is it wrong to deceive people, possibly into giving their lives, if the myth you are pushing might eventually bring great benefits? Is it possible to have a system where the powerful do not abuse their power? Most impressive of all, this book avoided the standard hollywood ending, and left us wondering if there really was any hope, if the myth was really true or not. It's even aged well, unlike a lot of other science fiction books set in &quot;futures&quot; that are already in the past.","I can't believe I never read this book after seeing and kinda liking the movie itself.Of course, the book is far superior in just about all ways as far as characters and storyline.","David Brin's concept is truly remarkable, and his plotting is superb. This is a wonderful story.But in the end, the verdict on this book is the same as the verdict on the Kevin Costner film that takes its name: With such a good story, there's no excuse for &quot;The Postman&quot; to be as bad as it is.Brin's technique, his craft, betrays his own vision. At best the prose is serviceable; more often, it is an excruciating thing to read. The &quot;Damn you&quot;s that constantly bounce around in Gordon's brain are straight out of the worst community theater's Shakespeare festival.Would you like to know why so few people will rightly call science fiction legitimate literature? This is why: most science fiction writers, like Brin, just can't write--and some of the worst, including Brin, are given the most glorious &quot;literary&quot; prizes. Any serious critic would laugh out loud at this book's Nebula Award; the award doesn't compliment this book so much as this book incriminates the award.It is true that many science fiction writers have brains as active as any writer of &quot;serious&quot; fiction. But only a few in the history of literature could be trusted to transfer those ideas well to paper. Read Ted Sturgeon and Kurt Vonnegut for real reading, and then read this and other Nebula Award-winners if you want reading that is imaginitive but atrociously written.","This is great book and I enjoyed reading it years and years ago. It sticks with you, however I found the ending to be greatly disheartening.David Brin essentially has no faith in traditional western values or culture and sometimes it just shoots right out at you. If you are OK with that, then enjoy, otherwise leave it alone.","After coming across the movie one Saturday morning I became inquisitive as to how good the book would be. The movie wasn't the Oscar winning title, but hey movies based off books aren't the best anyways. I knew the book would be better so I decided to read it my senior year in high school.It basically starts up post end of mankind and follows the life of a \"postman.\" The first portion of the book really yanks you in and makes you not want to stop reading. As he travels town to town he somewhat is seen as the hero of the noble guys, yet he is just disguised as a postman to save his life, and his only. It follows intensely into his thoughts and steps as he travels across the leftover states. It sadly doesn't stay like this forever.It abruptly turns into a bad action movie. Excessive amounts of action but no real rhyme or reason. Nothing gets explained fully and makes you somewhat guess about why something is happening. He evidently falls in love with a woman from a town, but doesn't really tell a thing about her whatsoever. So again throws you up against the wall making you guess about things again. Mr. Brin being the scientific man that he is, I guess feels obligated to throw in some high tech parts into the book, that were so out there, that it made it almost unbearable to even read.Yet some parts were good, okay maybe only the beginning, it was overall a decent at best book. So to sum it up, I'd give it a two, out of five stars. The movie is far better compared to this book. I wouldn't recommend reading unless you are greatly bored out of your mind.","Public service prevarication brings realistic results.An ordinary guy who comes up with a scam to get himself through in this nasty postapocalyptic world, after discovering some gear, ends up an important figure in starting to rebuild, and in a conflict. In a society like this it is no surprise that there will be a crazed religiously motivated and influenced ultra-right militaristic fascist group wanting to keep things how they are, and not allow information to again be widely communicated.","If you liked the movie...well, watch it again. It's way better than the book. Brin gets credit for the cool main idea, but it's developed better in the (notably different) movie. The execution in the book just isn't very good--and like most sci-fi, the book's poorly-written. By the standards of sci-fi, I guess it's o.k...maybe alright for the beach or whatever. But really just not very good. I love post-apocalyptic fiction, and even I found myself skimming to the end.","A Nameless man whoses a solitary drifter to a devastated USA, dons a Postman's uniform and becomes a Postman, a man re-presenting hope to Battle General Bethelem and his evil Holonists.","David Brin does not disappoint with this book. Much better than the movie. Although the movie was good, the book was better.","The Postman is an insightful and inspiring story of a man in his quest to protect the flickering flame of civilization from the imposing dark ages of a post apocalyptic world. As Gordon Krantz makes his way across the apocalyptic wasteland, barely surviving among the ruins of civilization, he stumbles upon an old United States Postal vehicle that forever changes the direction of his life. What starts out as a lie to simply gain shelter and food becomes an idea that ignites a revolution. This is a story more about ideas that any particular ideology. In fact, David Brin often presents ideology as being part of the reason for civilization's demise. For instance, the term \"survivalist\" becomes derogatory as some radical elements of the community have embraced the fall of civilization as an opportunity to subdue, pillage and conquer. Don't fret preppers: The Postman was written in 1985, before the more recent, positive culture of self-sufficiency and permaculture which has become more widespread in recent years spreading through good people like Jack Spirko at The Survival Podcast. The power of ideas should not be underestimated. While it is easy to focus on the more negative examples of crooked idealism gone astray such as the case with hitler and the nazis (disrespect intended), Brin proposes that ideas can have an equally positive effect as he presents the United States as a successful society structured upon ideas that actually lead to a decrease in human suffering. Civilization is presented as an idea or a collection of ideas rather than a physical manifestation. The Postman is a substantial work of fiction that will provide you with considerable grist for the mill of contemplation, if you are so inclined. Alternatively, if you are simply seeking a great story with likeable characters, you will not be disappointed.","I saw the movie years ago and really didn't like it. All my friends said to read the book - great EOTW fic.I liked the book - sometimes. Loved the first half, second half was just kind of bizarre and I thought the end was good. YES, I shed a tear. Just one :)I liked Gordon, the postman, and felt bad about his inner demons over his choices. I thought the author made that compelling. On the one hand he was living a lie and wanted out but, HOW? On the other hand he was bringing hope and a sense of patriotism to the survivors. It was truly a moral dilemma.It's hard to talk about the second half of the book without spoilers. What I CAN say is there is a machine named Cyclops. Hmmmm, what exactly is cyclops. I think of Star Wars with those big marching machines. I wasn't far off. The dictionary says -- member of a race of savage ones, one eyed giants. I'm perplexed why this machine garnered that name. Kinda nitpicky I know. It was pretty obvious what was going on anyway. I thought the \"engineered soldiers\" were unnecessary. Too far out there for me. As I said, the second half of the book waded into strange territory -- that was too bad.Lastly, it looks like I didn't like the book. Just the opposite. I liked the premise, I liked the action, I liked the characters, I lied the message. I loved the end of the book -- not your usual shiny, happy people.Recommended highly!","This was an enjoyable book to read. This could actually happen to mankind. The book kept my attention throughtout, right up to the end.","Be prepared for a slightly different ride to the movie. I purchased this after watching the movie and as usual there are differences, but enough similarities to not disappoint if you have seen the movie.I think, as a book, it captures a lot of the struggle of humanity with it's own self destructive tendencies. I found that I kept making excuses to read a bit more and a bit more. I will be interested to read other of David Brin's work and have high hopes that I have found another great author.","At times, heartbreakingly poetic. Brin creates an interesting character and lets him evolve while staying true to the traits. Yet it felt very dated to me, especially the latter half of the book. I felt that Brin's choices with regard to plot were decisions made on the fly, rather than something planned in advance, and that bothered me. A good read, groundbreaking for its genre, but (can't believe I'm saying this) there were times when I wished it were closer to the movie plotline instead.","In a post-apocalyptic future, Gordon Krantz is something of a nomad, drifting from village to village, acting out one-man plays in exchange for food and shelter. While evading bandits he stumbles upon an old postal truck. Krantz takes the dead letter carrier's uniform and, helping himself to the mailbag, begins playing a new role: that of a postman dispatched by the reconstituted government to reestablish delivery routes. There is no new government but villagers fighting for survival and fending off tribes of marauders are desperate to believe him. The question is whether Krantz will live up to the illusion he's invented.I'm a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction in general, but I approached this novel with the thought that it might not live up to its hype. I was mistaken. Brin created a credible future world, and the concept of a survivor feeling compelled to deliver the mail (even if he stumbled onto the idea for reasons that were far from altruistic) is brilliant: mail delivery becomes not only a means of stitching together a torn nation, but a powerful symbol of national unity and pride. Gordon Krantz is more than a bit torn himself, a man of less than heroic stature who, by the novel's end, has grown into not just a hero, but an icon of heroism. Krantz is a fully developed character (a rarity in sf), and his personal transformation is inspiring. The supporting characters are also solid and purposeful. The Postman is a strongly plotted, well written novel, in many ways better than another, more celebrated version of a post-apocalyptic future:The Road.","This small book allows the reader to enjoy Brin's unique style. He is obviously an extra-ordinary thinker. I doubt this is close to his finest work however. I feel that it needed more editing to be considered a master piece. I would give it 4.3 stars if I could. It is quite interesting and easy to finish.This takes place in a post nuclear world. Mutant soldiers wreak havoc amongst the remaining colonies of survivors. Even gold has no value. In these uncertain times, some of us try to plan for different scenarios. The Postman introduces a scenario that is likely to introduce a few curveballs into your way of thinking about a breakdown of the system.We should all hope for the best and plan for the worst. This is probably close to the worst.","In post-apocalyptic Oregon, nearly two decades after the Doomwar, Gordan Krantz, a drifter who trades his skills as an ersatz thespian for room and board in the small hamlets he encounters in his travels, finds a new purpose in life. When Gordan happens upon a long dead mail carrier one day, Gordan takes his coat to help him stay warm on his journey...and nothing is the same again. As he travels from one small enclave to another, the people in these towns respond to the sign of the postal service in an unexpected way. The people in these towns are soon writing letters to loved ones that haven't heard from in nearly twenty years. Gordan gives no promises, but does his best to deliver these letters with the aplomb of a genuine mail carrier. But that's the catch, the people of these towns don't realize that Gordan is not an actual mail carrier. And soon, Gordan is the \"representative\" of the Restored United States...a fiction Gordan creates to give the people some hope. Hope that they are not alone in their small part of what was once a great country. Hope that there is someone else out there...that they are part of something greater than themselves and their small, introverted enclaves.Growing up most of us are taught to \"never tell a lie\". But David Brin's thoughtful examination of how a lie can turn into myth...a myth of a nation reborn...can deliver hope to people where there was none before. And the very act of spreading this myth can make it true, a nation can be reborn if enough people believe it can be. Are there really lies worth telling?I very much enjoyed Brin's concept of Gordan creating this myth, initially out of personal necessity, and then watching Gordan do his utmost to turn the myth into a reality.The only significant qualm I had with the plot itself was that there was an awful lot of \"stuff\" going on around Gordan that, because the tale is told entirely from Gordan's perspective, we never really got to see in a lot of detail. I would have like to have seen the story told from the perspective of those around Gordan, as well as Gordan himself. Nonetheless, when I read a story by Brin I am always impressed with his characterizations, especially the characterizations of the main protagonist...and The Postman is no exception. I would certainly recommend this tale to anyone who enjoys, not only solid scifi, but plain old good stories.","I had not seen the movie when I read this book, so the story was fresh for me. I was looking for a smaller story, I think, of the post apocalypse, but this was an exciting surprise. It is a great adventure and survival story. Good writing, good characters, but it may seem a bit sexist at times, so it should be taken into consideration the times in which this book was written. There was a breaking point for me though, at the ending. I'm not sure why the author made such a departure from the basic plot and tried to go sci-fi.","This is a rare positive postapacolyptic plot with intriguing insight into the what makes the human animal a social being. It's premise is simple but the results are as complex as our society. It is thoughts such as these that give us hope for the future of humankind.","IF I remember right, this story was first released as a Short Story or Novella in a SF mag years ago. It was one of the best short stories I have ever read. Later David expanded it to a Novel - and created an even better story. At the time, I remember telling my friends this would make the ultimate End-of-the-world Movie ever. Well - Somebody finally thought of that. Can't wait for the Movie.","I just finished reading the Postman. It was one of the best books I have ever read. I could not put it down and finished it in only two days. The main character just captures the reader pulling him into the story. All the character and situations are completely belivable. No MADMAX wastelands or Mutant blood sookers. All and All a very good book for SF nuts and general reader's alike. I hope the do the book justice in the movie.","Until I read this book by Mr. Brin I had never been one of his biggest fans. I am now a convert. The premise behind The Postman is one of the most unique that I have ever seen, and while reading I often found myself unable to think of anything else but what was happening in the story. In my mind this is the hallmark of a great writter. Even if you are not a traditional science fiction fan, you will find this engrossing and witty story very enjoyable.","I loved the book. I think I have read it a total of eight times, and it is still interesting. It has a more realistic attitude to it than Startide Rising and the Uplift war, which were both great books, but neither captured my attention like the Postman. I would stayed up for hours just reading the book, and not get bored. A great book. -Ben Presley","This book has its limits in its origins so it may seem disjointed, but not an impossible read. It is classic science fiction because it gives new points of view and it makes you think. It even tried to explore how feminist ideas might survive the apocalypse and that such a society may not necessarily repeat mistakes of the past.If you are looking for a new book and haven't read this one buy it","I grew up in Oregon and have been to most of the places that he wrote about. Lived in Cottage Grove and Eugene later in life and grew up in Florence. Brin's research was PERFECT. I have personally taken the &quot;Trail&quot; from Culp Creek to Oakridge. GOOD JOB DAVID....Rosi Bentley","I found the Postman to be a pleasant surprise. I bought the book because I enjoyed Brin's Sundiver series and his ability to generate interesting story lines. The description on the cover led me to believe that this was going to be a campy, possibly downright silly outing.True to form, Brin finds a way to generate a fresh look at a story line that has been visited before. As I read on, I was surprised to find that he had quite intrigued me. The subtle supporting details resulted in a more believable interpretation of the post-apocalyptic tale of survival than any I had previously read. The scheme initally spun by the title character slowly takes on a life of its own until he, himself, becomes the servant instead of the master.Brin solidifies his reputation as a story teller with this effort.","In the tradition of stories like Alas, Babylon, Brin weaves a tale of hope in the aftermath of a modern world war. With some of the finest dramatic skill I have ever read, Brin takes us on a journey with his main character to find a means of survival and redemption not just for an individual, but for a people.Also in the best tradition of science fiction, Brin demonstrates the effect technology has on human societies in a most poignant way...by removing it. In a time of pragmatism, the last idealist must have enough hope for everyone.The Postman is a story which is so well written that you don't have to be a science fiction buff to quickly claim it as one of your favorites!","Brin's novels tend to be &quot;simply&quot; stories. His short stories almost always have an element of the mythic and moral to them. For this reason, The Postman always seemed strange to me: it is mythic and definitely has a moral. I tracked out the first edition and learned why: the book started life as a novella. If this is the result, I wish Brin would make more of his short stories into books.Humankind did not blow itself up, it sort of sputtered most of the way there -- with a couple of nukes, a couple of biological weapons, and a big push from those descendents of gun-nuts, the survivalists -- and stopped. The main character combined the survival instinct of postWar types with the wonder and intellectualism of the preWar types. He is wandering the US, looking for something. In the end, he himself creates what he has been looking for -- someone who is taking responsibility, who is creating something greater than himself or his village.The mythic and the moral emerges towards the end of the book, and it is for this element that I take this book to my desert island. It becomes a fight between good (those who will take responsibility, however unwillingly) and evil (the survivalists, who won't), unexpectedly involving preWar science and philosophy. The forming of the US after the Revolution, the thoughts of Ben Franklin, and the legend of Cincinatus (look it up, it's worth knowing) are the pegs upon which Brin hangs his moral tale.And, as always, Brin has written a simply good book."],

      "reviews.text":["Templesmith is a master artist and conceptualist, but Singularity 7 shows that he still needs some work on storytelling and characterization. Some of the characters are hard to tell apart, and no character ever comes out as a lead. I have no problem with emsemble pieces, but there were characters that seemed like they were only in the story to serve as a lead, then never got to be one. The boy with the dragon tattoo on his face, for example (those who've read this will understand).Negatives aside, Templesmith's art has always been exceptional, and he does not break from that here. Plus, the concept of the story is extremely engaging, even when the characters are not. It's too bad that this is a self-contained story, because the story could have gone on as a series for quite some time. I have high hopes for his current series, Shadowplay, and hope to see that published as a collection soon.","I will be simple... Great story (it is Templesmith debut as a storyteller), the art is his own kind, very special, I love all the details of his art and this terror scy-fi graphic novel. I rate this book with four stars (instead five) because the quality of the binding is disgusting...","Then this is for you. It's an interesting story about a post apocalyptic world, but the art just threw me off. It was chaotic and a bit jarring. The story was decent, with flat characters and some gore.Wouldn't recommend unless you like strange graphic novels","An awesome story-line, fantastic artwork and a superb mix of horror and science fiction make this one to remember. Highly recommended to anyone who likes the band Fear Factory, as the artist of Singularity 7, Ben Templesmith, was actually commissioned by the band to do their artwork.All in all, worth the money and worth a read. Over and over again","Ben Templesmith has done it again, presenting us with visions of nightmares and violence that insidiously place themselves over our subconscious fears, but in a fun way. Terrifying, but funny. I can see here the beginnings of Wormwood.","Product came with very heavy / prominent creases and one small tear in a page. However, that still made it no less enjoyable as a story - which is unbelievably fantastic i might add - a testament to Mr. Templesmith's ingenuity and to his mastery of freshly crafted ideas. I actually can't remember where the tear was - very small and i fixed with some tape. This sort of thing would usually bug someone as finicky as me but the art/ story really makes up for that. I would really recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Mr. Templesmith or of works of the post - apocalyptic genre.","If you want an idea of Singularity 7, think of the liner artwork from a third-tier industrial band combined with the writing of an angsty teenage aspiring novelist, and you'd be in the right ballpark. This is not to say that Templesmith's art is without some technical ability; it's more to say that it's painfully unoriginal, and the melty surrealist style serves to neuter what little action is available in the book, leaving mounds of mushy exposition to carry the plot.A much better version of a very similar basic story can be found in Snikt, the post-apocalyptic Wolverine story by Tsutomu Nihei, for those in desperate need of a moody, nanotech apocalypse story in graphic novel form."],

They find a lush planet inhabited by a civilization far more advanced than their own, waging a seemingly endless war against a constantly evolving enemy. The Sorans call the pair of them the “Earthborn” and they’re welcomed as heroes, almost as gods. To an audience of billions, they swear an oath to avenge their fallen planet by aiding the Sorans in their war against Xala. But soon Lucas and Asha find Sora just as dangerous as apocalyptic Earth when they’re targeted by the Fourth Order, a rebel collective who decries them as false prophets and harbingers of further bloodshed. Their friend and turncoat Xalan scientist Alpha believes he’s located someone who can help them turn the tide of the war for good, stranded on a conquered colony planet. But landing on the new world, Lucas and Asha find themselves hunted by a violent, mysterious beast, known only as the Desecrator, let loose by the Xalans. Escaping Earth was only the beginning.

      "reviews.text":["Earthborn is the story the desendents of those left behind when Colony, the giant mother ship went searching for a new place for mankind 300 years ago. It is a companion book to Skyborn....the story of those raised on the ship before it crashed back to Earth. The charactors and stories intertwine. I read Skyborn first. There are some nice elements of leadership, primate anthropology and civilization gone bad. The Australian setting was interesting. They are simple good reading...bedtime stuff.","Earthborn is one of the more disappointing reads I've had in years. I was attracted to it by the cover art by Jon Foster and by the synopsis written inside the jacket. Unfortunately, the jacket synopsis turned out to be better written than the book.The premise was intruiging enough: a multi-generation interstellar colony ship destined for Tau Ceti ends up instead torn by internal conflict and returning to a post-apocalyptic Earth, and conflict ensues between the imperialist/fascist high-tech Skyborn and the survivalist low-tech Earthborn, with all of the main characters kids due to vaguely described afflictions affecting both societies. But the novel itself is plagued with even worse afflictions: (1) The characters never rise above anything but sketches, with so little description you never have any clear idea of their appearance and with so little identity you don't feel anything when bad things happen to them. In most of the novel they seldom come across as anything but talking heads. (2) The setting is generic throughout, from the generic colony ship to the generic post-apocalyptic cityscape. For a story that's supposed to be set in a post-apocalypic Melbourne, Australia, the details are so sketchy and generic that it could be any low-budget sci-fi movie set anywhere in the world. And worst of all (3) The prose style is passive and distancing, with the author always telling instead of showing, making for a very dull read. The following excerpt is typical:\"Sarah swung down with a piece of timber and drove another stake into the ground. She knew that the ninety-yard-high mountain ash forests with the understory of blackwood and tree ferns provided decent cover from Colony craft, but even at this early stage, she was planning to outmaneuver Colony. She had no delusions about ever conquering the Skyborn, but maybe, just maybe, she could discourage them. Even now she realized that time was her enemy.\"This is pretty much how the whole novel reads, and the further it goes, the worse it gets. After about halfway through I has having to force myself to keep reading, and I was even more annoyed at the end (after a confusing strung-out fight where half the characters die but you don't feel anything because they were never more than sketches) to find that the story is not complete at the end because this is only the first book in a series, a series I have no interest whatsoever in continuing.If you're looking for something good in similar veins, I would recommend Heinlein's Orphans in the Sky (for the divided multi-gen colony ship), Wyndham's The Chrysalids (for the post-apocalyptic society) or even the \"Miri\" episode of the original Star Trek TV series (for the kids plague that kills you when you reach adulthood). As for Earthborn, I could only recommend it to younger readers who haven't read much science-fiction and who aren't very demanding about what they read in general. For anyone else, don't waste your time or your money.","Three hundred years ago, the Colony starship was launched to colonize the world of Tau Celi but when they arrived, there was no habitable world to colonize. Some of the passengers felt they should continue but those who wanted to return home took command of the ship. They land on what used to be Melbourne and plan to commit genocide on the genetically inferior humans that survived.Welkin Quinn is one of the first groups of Skyborn sent out to reconnoiter the area and he falls in with a clan of Earthborn who want to unite the people into a cohesive group so they can do more than survive. Welkin learns that the Skyborn have fed him misinformation and throws in his lot with Sarah and her group. Enemies surround them from the Skyborn to the barely human ferals to the roaming gangs of jabbers who work with the Skyborn to destroy the Earthborn.This is Paul Collin's first book published in the United States and it is easy to see why this Australian author is a hit back home. The story line is fast paced but does not skimp on character development. The hero learns that his ship's elders had an agenda to stay in power when they got to earth. He inserts himself into a group of Earthborn survivors that have a chance of uniting the various disease free factions on Earth if they can figure out a way of appropiating technology only available on the Colony. This is the first installment in what looks to be a great new seriesHarriet Klausner","Wish it had been better. The book seemed to lack detail and had a certain, I dont know, \"fakeness\" to it. Of course it is Science Fiction, but I just couldn't find the characters believable. I think the author should have devoted a few more pages on character development and back story. I thought the beginning went too fast and could have provided more depth to the fanaticism of the Skyborn and their mysterious past. An okay read, but I found myself struggling to finish instead of anticipating the next read. Hopefully, the sequel will be better.","An award-winning Australian writer, Paul Collins makes his North American debut with \"The Earthborn\". Though Collins is best known for his action sequences, his creation of unique and believable societies along with the character development of the protagonist Welkin Quinn make \"The Earthborn\" a work that will be enjoyed on a number of levels.Born aboard the terra-forming skyworld `Colony', Welkin Quinn is raised in the militaristic culture of the Skyborn. As this society prepares for its return to earth, its leaders--an order of elders--brainwash the people of `Colony', using misinformation to ingrain a hatred of the Earthborn and a fear of the Skyborn's homeworld, Earth. Using these emotions, the elders plan to commit genocide.When Welkin is falsely labeled as a seditionist, he is tortured and threatened. He is told that his only opportunity for redemption is to prove his loyalty by serving as a member of the Skyborn expeditionary force--an assignment where fewer than half of the Skyborn expect to survive. When his group is attacked by a viscous pack of Earthborn predators--the Jabbers--Welkin is rescued by an Earthborn woman named Sarah. Sarah leads a band of noble Earthborn, a makeshift family of sorts. Her family struggles for survival in post-apocalyptic Melbourn, a landscape populated by rival gangs who engage in turf-wars for precious commodities of food and medicine.Placed in an unfamiliar and hostile environment, Welkin Quinn is forced to think for himself--forced to confront the worldview with which he has been indoctrinated since birth. His revelation leads him down the path where friend and foe, right and wrong seem terribly reversed. To survive, Welkin must confront the society that created him and discover his place in a new world.The story of Welkin and his newfound family continues in Collins' recently released novel \"The Skyborn\" (2005), and the soon-to-be-released conclusion to the trilogy: \"The Hiveborn\" (Fall 2006).","&quot;Move over Ebola -- the cesspool of life has a new Supervirus&quot; --Glyn Parry&quot;Far-future adventure and excitment, science fiction as it ought to be&quot; -- Sean McMullen&quot; ... worthy of sitting on the same shelf with early Heinlein and Norton&quot; -- Don D'Ammassa, SF Chronicle 2003"],

      "reviews.text":["My reason for writing this review is the others have missed the mark by a mile. They are all fans of George R.R. Martain's other more fantasy oriented work. This series is wildly removed from them. Of the entire line the 1st three are the absolute best. Only the 3rd book is realy one compleat story. The 1st 2 books are a collection of short stories. This simple fact seems to have escaped all the other reviewers. After words the series slowly degrades, as they all do, but there are still gems. It never gets bad just average at worst. If you are a fan of comic book heros and want to see a very well executed, realistic look at them this is the place to be. Now if they would just relase some new ones and get Allen Moore to write a story.","As a huge fan of Martin's SONG OF ICE AND FIRE series, I too picked up some of his older work. The WILD CARDS series was a pleasant surprise. The series has an interesting concept, and good writers participating (esp Roger Zelazny, who's Sleeper-character stole my heart).The WILD CARDS stories are all different, dealing with different times and storylines, but they are without failing interesting and original. Some of the stories had me secretly wiping away some tears (the Turtle, Golden Boy), others had me chuckling (the Sleeper)or reading with my heart in my throat (Fortunato).In retrospect, the first two books were a setup for the grand happenings of Book 3, when all hell bursts loose on Wild Card Day. I loved the way the stories were weaved together in JOKERS WILD, where everything seemed to come together. It had a superb story/tension arc, and the characterization was without failing very well done.I have only read the first three books so far, but I'm definitely keeping an eye out for other installments of this series.I give the authors involved a big thumbs up for an original project like this!","Last night I finished reading Joker's Wild, the third installment in the Wildcards series.Joker's Wild reads a bit differently than the first two books of the series, in that instead of a collection of related short stories, this book reads like a regular novel. At the end of the book they have credits stating who wrote and invented what character, and each chapter is divided up into sections, so I'm guessing that each author wrote a \"section\" pertaining to one of their characters. It may be my untrained eye, or the fact that I was so into the subject matter, but I had a hard time telling the authors apart in this book. As I said, it read like a novel, but it was also quite a page turner, so I was swept up in the story most of the time, and perhaps not paying enough attention to the techniques of each particular section.The plot centers around the Wild Card Day celebrations in New York City in 1986. I can't really get much deeper into it than that, because I don't want to add spoilers, but I really enjoyed the story. It spans a little more than 24 hours, but there is a ton of action and intrugue in that twenty-four hour span. As I said, I found myself swept up in the story many times, and can't really think of a part that I didn't enjoy.All of the best known aces appear in this book, but we learn more about some of the jokers as well. I found myself watching the line between joker and ace blur in this book; for example, the character of Spector (aka Demise) is a big part of this book, but at times I could see how his power would be considered an ace power, but to others it would definately be seen as a joker. A deadly one, but still unwanted. Incedentally, I really like the character of Spector. He's very interesting and well written.At times I found the focus on sex a bit much. Yes, I understand that Fortunato's tantric power relies on sexual energy, but we also have sexual murderers, sexual ice sculptures, old aces wanting to have sex with young aces, etc. I'm not a prude, but it was a bit much at times.Other than that, this was a very satisfying addition to the Wildcards series. Now if I can just get my hands on the next book....","If Aces High (Wild Cards #2) presented Earth's fledging new aces and jokers with an external menace in the form of a giant alien Swarm, Jokers Wild drags the action back to this stratosphere and pins it very firmly to the ground. The threats faced by the protagonists in this novel are all painfully, recognisably human - whether or not these threats have been twisted into monsters by the wild card virus. Jokers Wild unequivocally makes clear that the potential for great evil and corruption exists in anyone, and sometimes that malevolence is enhanced out of all proportion - whether by masses of ill-gotten gains, or through a spectacular range of psychic powers bequeathed by the Takisian virus.The novel is made up of several strands of stories woven together into a surprisingly coherent whole - many different characters set out to accomplish many different goals (some to escape/destroy the villainous Astronomer from the previous novel, others to work their way through the tangled web of conspiracy and corruption that surrounds uber-criminal mastermind Kien). The ghostly Wraith starts the ball rolling by stealing some extremely valuable notebooks, but eventually the paths of all the characters cross as they hunt or are hunted by the Astronomer. Characters earlier introduced all return, like Bagabond and Jack, Fortunato, Tachyon and Hiram Worchester, the deceptively portly proprietor of Aces High.If that sounds like a rather vague description, it's because there really isn't much point to my attempting to summarise each character's storyline - there are probably at least eight major character perspectives contained within this mosaic novel, all of which interweave with one another as the action, stakes and power balance shift across Manhattan and among players. All of this mayhem unspools over a period of just twenty-four hours - in fact, over the fortieth Wild Card Day anniversary - so, as you can imagine, the pace of the narrative is fairly brisk.Jokers Wild is a true testament to Mr Martin's talents as an editor - the first two novels comprised individual stories written by various authors, compiled more or less chronologically, with connecting material created (as necessary) by Martin himself. With this novel, he artfully slices up the various stories written by his stable of collaborators and skilfully weaves these threads into an unexpectedly smooth narrative that flows and ebbs with its own dramatic pace and style.If the climax seems a little too pat and disproportionate to the build-up throughout the entire book, there's still much to enjoy in Jokers Wild - mostly in getting the chance to delve deeper into the lives and minds of some of these wonderfully complex characters. The insights provided into Demise's power and motivations are both gruesome and intriguing, and it's great fun to learn more about Aces High, its traditions and clientele from the very proper Mr Worchester.If you still feel this review is rather vague, I'm afraid I can't help you there for fear of spoilers - but rest assured that Jokers Wild is a good, punchy, FUN addition to the series that rewards fans without being too confusing for newcomers.","This book is about the events of a single day. Although the chapters are written by different authors, there is a unified plot running thoughout the entire book -- actually one main plot, and two subplots. The main plot is that the Astromer is out to kill the Aces that beat him in book 2. Secondary plots include Wraith's (formerly known as Ghost Girl in Book 2) accidental misadventures when she accidentally steals the wrong thing from a mob boss, and Alligator Jack looking for his niece Cordelia who suddenly left home in Louisianna for New York City. The subplots twist and turn and coincidentally overlap with each other, and to a lesser extent, the main plot. Thus, this feels like a single book written by a single author, even though, as usual, chapters are written by various authors. The writing is pretty engaging and well done, and carries you along nicely.Although this is the first Wildcards book with a complete cover-to-cover plot, there are a lot of negatives as well. First, the subplots, while well written and somewhat engaging, are perhaps a little trite or pointless, and get a lot of pages. For example, Ghost Girl, who had a one night misadventure in book 2, is the focus of one of the subplots in book 3 -- and has another one night misadventure. The only real difference is that she gets more pages here. Second, almost no new hero aces are introduced, and there are no new origin stories. Third, the only two villains we spend any time with (besides the Astronomer) both channel the bad experiences in their lives in the course of their kills -- Demise, a villain from book 2, channels his death experience using projective telepathy, and Roulette, channels the birth of her baby with the Black Queen (a fatal Joker) to summon poison during sex. The similarity between these two villains is mirrored by the similarity between the Astronomer and Fortunato -- one draws power from sex, murder and torture, why the other draws power from sex. Fourth, while Hiram has some time and Tachyon is involved, the most interesting characters from the prior books have at most cameos -- the main characters here are the Astronomer, the two villains that kill by channeling their bad experiences, Alligator Jack, Bagabond, Ghost Girl/Wraith, Hiram, Tachyon, Fortunato and Brennan (the Green Arrow type).I read many of the Wild Cards books 20 years ago. I still remember favorite characters, heros and villains and events, from books 1 and 2, and some that I havent encountered yet in the first 3 books -- i.e., I remembered nothing about book 3. What is missing is the \"Geez thats cool\" factor found so often in books 1 and 2 -- there is nothing as inventive or original as, for example, Croyd or Modular Man's origin stories here. Nothing to remember.Basically, you have to judge this book like a conventional book, on the strength of its plot, as there is not enough of the inventive, original, cool Aces and Jokers stuff from prior books. Although the writing is good, and the book is entertaining, the plot cant really compare to the plot of top fantasy books, and as a result, this book just didnt feel like anything special the way books 1 and 2 did.","The third book in the &quot;Wild Cards&quot; series by George R.R. Martin (editor), this is a &quot;shared world&quot; series, where various authors get together and write in the same world. The world is one where an alien virus was dumped into the air shortly after WWII, and still randomly infects people nearly forty years later.The virus - called the Wild Card for its very random results - proliferated in earth's atmosphere. First, nine in ten people who contract the Wild Card virus &quot;draw the Queen of Spades,&quot; and die. Of the survivors, nine in ten people &quot;draw a Joker,&quot; and end up hideously disfigured. Of the non-Joker survivors, some draw a &quot;deuce,&quot; and get a power or ability that's pretty much useless (&quot;I can change my hair colour at will!&quot;), but many who survive as non-jokers &quot;draw an Ace,&quot; and gain super-powers. The massively telekinetic Turtle, the projective teleporter Popinjay (who I really liked in this book), the any-lizard shapeshifter Kid Dinosaur - these are some of the Aces. They're solid, fun to read, and quite well drafted.This story all takes place in one day, and the novel is very well sewn together (especially given the different tones and styles of the various authors) and has a very complicated and complex interwoven plot. Kudos to Martin for wrapping it up so well.This forty years later is the anniversary and what is likely to be the largest &quot;Wild Card Day&quot; celebration ever - except one recurring villain is using this day to kill off all the Aces who bested him in the previous books... Who will survive?As Martin is well known for in his &quot;A Song of Fire and Ice&quot; series - there are no holds barred in these books - heroes die. And horribly. Very solid stuff.'Nathan","The repercussions of the battle with The Astronomer continue in Jokers Wild. It is the fortieth anniversary of the release of the Wild Card Virus (scientically known as Xenovirus Takis-A), and The Astronomer is out for blood.Fortunato is his main target, being his most powerful opponent and directly responsible for his previous defeat. He recruits killers, including Demise, and a woman that kills men with sex, to start taking out his enemies.","i read these when they first came out in the late 80s, and got theurge to re read them. the charecters in these early wild card booksand the things they encounter really pushed the bounds of sci fi.","The repercussions of the battle with The Astronomer continue in Jokers Wild.

He recruits killers, including Demise, and a woman that kills men with poontang, to start taking out his enemies.","Wild Cards III: Jokers Wild is a novel, written by different authors. Each tells the story of one character: Melinda Snodgrass -roulette and her attempts to murder Tachyon. Leanne Harper - the Bag lady, bagabond Walton Simons - Demise, the black queen who survived Lewis Shiner - The annoying Fortunato, pimp in an endless quest against all sorts of things. John Miller - Wraith, a thief who can moce through walls. Edward Bryant - Sewer Jack, an Aligator man who's a friend of Bagabond. and, the highlight of the book, as well as most of the others: George R R Martin - tale o Hiram Worchester, the owner of the acclaimed ACES HIGH, a true anti hero.Basically there are two plot lines - Wraith steals a note book from Kien, a minor villan from Wild Cards 2 and 3, and lots of characters get involved in the attempt to reach them. This is a 'McGavin' of the worst kind, though there are some nice twists to the tale, and after all this is a parody of Comic books. The other plot involves the Astronomer, who summoned TIAMAT in ACES HIGH. He wishes revenge on all the aces who attacked his Mason in that book. All these events happen during 'Wild Card Day', September 15, when NYC is filled with Jokers, Aces and tourists, and Hiram Worchester puts a huge party in 'Aces High', his restaurant( not to confuse with ACES HIGH, the second wild card book).sound interesting? Well, it is, but it's also really confusing. Written by 7 authors, it follows 7 different tales, and they don't combine into a single one all too well. Oh, it's often exciting, but its difficult to follow, especially as some of the writers( Martin, Snodgrass), are far more powerful then some of the others( though they aren't the only talented ones, of course).Another flaw of the book( a complain, rather), is that none of the main repeat characters are favorites of mine. I've loathed Fortunato from the moment I've first read of him, and while he improves occasionally here, he's not someone who's tale I particularily enjoy. But at least his stories feature the cool Astronomer( A true Comic villan, though I would have liked him to interact with the heros a little more) and other aces. Sewer Jack and Bagabond deal only with each other, and with equally dull and bizarre DAs and Mobsters.Overall it's nice but I don't see the great varriety and uniquness of the first 2 books. Its neither a dark tapestry of interesting, if uneven stories like WILD CARDS, or a comics book with an edge story like ACES HIGH. Its just a highly readable, if disjoint, action novel.I liked it, but I hope the next ones will be better."],

      "reviews.text":["Blaine Kittredge woke up to find that mankind had finally done it. World War Three. Chicago was in ruins, survivors were fleeing the burning cities and the sun was blocked by the nuclear winter that had been created by the bombs. For a amoral vampire this SHOULD be a perfect time. But it isn't. Many of the humans have become contaminated, radiation sickness making their blood useless to him. And the heathly humans are in danger from roaming bands of looters and killers, as food and water becomes more and more scarce.Can he learn to feed without killing? Can he learn to protect the humans he needs to live or will he give into his hunger?I think Kittredge is one of the most realistic vampires I have ever read about. He never pretends to be a good guy, he starts out doing what he does purely for selfish reasons. He doesn't want to be a Rock Star or a God or discover the secrets of the Universe - he just wants to live.And we don't know what will happen when the sun returns after the winter ends.","I bought \"Vampire Winter\" based on a recommendation in another reader's amazon.com list, and I do not regret it. Although VW is not as moving or as thought-provoking as \"I Am Legend\", my favorite vampire story, the post-apocalyptic setting does call that book to mind. VW is short (almost too short IMHO), the prose is spare, and the radiation science is a bit simplistic, but it's still a great little story. A vampire wakes up one evening to discover that humanity has just nuked the bejeebers out of itself. This isn't the beautiful, sexy, seductive vampire of Anita Blake's world. He's old, he's dangerous, and he enjoys the experience of killing the people upon whom he feeds. But as nuclear winter settles in, and isolated groups of humans struggle to survive the radioactive fallout, the vampire finds himself in the position of having to change his very nature in order to ensure his own survival over the long term.","I'm not sure how I feel about this book. Part vampire story and part gritty survivalist story, the author creates a skewed universe in which the reader comes to feel equal amounts of sympathy and antipathy for the characters.The protagonist, Blaine Kittredge (the one grating note in this story is the romance novel name for the vampire), is a vampire who likes killing and fear and madness. He comes to realize that not only must he stop killing in order to be able to survive after a nuclear holocaust, but he must help his prey survive, as well. They fear him but reluctantly depend upon him, as the line between enemies and allies continually shifts and changes, post-apocalypse.An interesting take on the vampire mythos, and worth a read.","Blaine Kittredge is a vampire who survives the dropping of a nuclear bomb (actually the dropping of nuclear bombs perhaps all over the world -- we never learn the full extent of the devastation). The symbiotic relationship that develops between Kittredge and the human survivors is pretty much the story of this book. And what a great story it is! I can't help thinking what a great movie it would make, as long as the makers kept strictly to the storyline and didn't twist and warp it out of recognition, e.g., have Kittredge fall in love or endow him with utterly fantastic supernatural capabilities. It is simply a really, really good vampire story and I highly recommend it.","no explantation is given for the vampires existance, is it viral or demonic or other? this vamp is capable of thought but unable to overcome the lust for blood....all in all a great read, a light read.","I am not sure if Lois Tilton was trying to be funny when she wrote this. But some of the things that Kittredge went through were hilarious. I was actually feeling sorry for him towards the end of the book. No one should have put up with so much. (Only a vampire could)I can not recommend this book enough. If only their could be a sequel, but I don't think Kittredge would survive it.","I bought this book new, hot off the presses. Since then I have given it away and repurchased it 4 times. Vampire Winter is a book that stands alone in concept and embraces the the vampire mythos without the tarnish that Ann Rice and her ilk sullied it with.VW blends the post apocalyptic genre seamlessly with a vampire story by setting the novel immediately after a series of nuclear blasts. As a huge fan of Rawles, Stirling, and anything post-collapse, VW satisfied me. Looters, radiation sickness, food shortages, small town solidarity, and the depths of human depravity...all there.Amidst the chaos, is our reluctant protagonist, vampire Blaine. After discovering that his sunless paradise will be a cold place without an uncontaminated food source, he sets out to save himself. Keeping people is difficult for everyone concerned, but but Blaine soon finds someone to take out his anger on. Blaine's interactions with the leader of the small town that he targets are delightfully psychological. I often don't know who to route for because Tilton never paints a single character in glowing, unrealistic terms.Overall, I can't recommend this book enough..I.am sad to be only the 10th reviewer.","LOVE this book. Read it many, many times growing up. Good depiction of a post-apocalyptic world as well. I miss the days when vampires were something to be feared, not something to jump into bed with.","I almost passed up this book because I thought the cover was cheesey. I'm glad I didn't.

They don't know about each other because they all live in fear simply trying to survive each night while the vampires stalk for food. Anyelet is the queen vampire who decided not too long ago to create more of her kind in order to not have to hide her existence. Unfortunately, this quickly grew out of hand, and now the vampires must scrounge for a food source. Navarro gives us a story telling us what happens when these few humans and these powerful vampires clash, and the struggle the humans face to free themselves from the plague.This was such an entertaining and creepy novel to read. There were a few passages that actually had me checking over my shoulder to see if anyone was there (I dare you to read the first several pages detailing the doctor's search and discovery mission without shivering). It's no wonder that this novel gained enough attention to warrant a special hardcover release. The story has adventure, vampires, guns, medical experiments, human slaves used as food, and an apocalyptic vision. Afterage is relatively original, well-written, and fun. Sometimes that's exactly what you need in a good, scary read. If you want something refreshing after reading all those other copycat vampire novels, then give this one a try.","AfterAge is a fantastic vampire post apocalyptic thriller no doubt, a different sort of vampire story. This well thought book twists the vampire story to a new dimension of coolness, mixing (in my eyes) a type of zombie esk \"I Am Legend\" type story and that of the plight of a world conquered by vampires, the struggles the humans go through are well portrayed, and really brought to a personal level.Definitely get your hands on this book, you will not be disappointed..And most important.... no stupid sparkly vampires...!!!!!","This is one of the greatest horror masterpieces of all time. I've read hundreds of horror novels and this is easily one of my favorites. Deserves to be right up there with I Am Legend. I wish Navarro had kept this direction instead of writing books for teenage girls. Though, the \"Impact\"/\"Shadows\" series is a worthy read as well.","Posted 04/11/11: This Vampire scenario is believable. It was fascinating and apocalyptic without being too dark. It was an enjoyable read and I highly recommend it to all the Vampire lovers out there."],

      "reviews.text":["As adolescent fantasy and post-holocaust stories go, it's pretty good. Be warned, however: the tone of this book (or collection of three books, each with its own protagonist) is almost relentlessly grim and tragic, as befits a setting that arises from a civilization-ending Blast. You can't have what you want - it will always be out of reach, taken from you, or turn out to be not what you wanted after all. Characters are often forced or manipulated into things they don't want to do by their personal honor. One character, who represents innocence and simple enjoyment of the pleasures of the barbarian life, comes to a bad end because of the designs of others; like Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet, most of the remaining joy in the story dies with him.Anthony's usual sexism is present, though arguably appropriate in a barbarian society; most of the women are chattel, to be won or lost in the dueling circle, and don't even have names of their own (instead taking a derivative of the name of the man who's won them, as do the children he fathers).If you're into watching a succession of men struggle against their fate, in pursuit of goals that turn to ashes in their grasp, read this book.","(from my son:) I am 10 and reading BattleCircle. in school i read this EVERY MINUTE its the best book i have read. People say it looks awful, I simply say \"Dont judge a book by it's cover\". i recommend this to ANYONE. (But i have the old book cover which looks kind of cheesy.)","I found this an amazing treatise on the value of a society based on honor. Two men, one circle. All decisions were final. Any dispute settled, any argument quelled. And then the novellas grow from there. Very often, one reads a book, but never actually feels anything for the characters involved. Sos changes all of that. Quite simply, the most amazing piece of literature I've read by Piers Anthony or any other author.","Battle Circle, by Piers Anthony, is an excellent story that I would recommend to anyone who follows the fantasy or S/F genre. When I began reading the story I read it as a Fantasy book. However, Anthony does an excellent job at swinging the readers vision of the world described from a fantasy to a S/F world. An excellent blend of the two genres. The three part layout also works well as each can be read as an individual story. I would recommend this and love reading it over again.","This book is extreamly entertaining, a real page turner. I would recomend this book for any fantasy or science fiction reader. If you've never read a post apocolypic type book, this is the book you want to read. It has everything: Love, courage, honor, etc.","I first read this collection of novels about ten years ago and immediately went out to buy the book for myself. Since then, I have read it several times and have been continuously pulled in by its alluring nature and by its own truth about a very imaginable post-apocalyptic age. Unfortunately I have lost the book through its many travels and now I have to have Amazon get me a copy!!! One of the most interesting books I have ever read... Bravo Mr. Anthony!","This was one of the first books that got me into reading again. I was taken by the scope and imagination of the book. It painted a very bleak world, but at the same time left me with the sense of hope, of the triumph of the human will and ingenuity. This book truely had it all, action, humor, romance, drama, a marvelous work. I commend Anthony.","I've read this book several times over the years, and it remains my favorite story of post-apocalyptic survival! It is very much worth the time and money required to find a copy!","This is a great book, about the courage of 3 men. There are romantic parts, funny parts, sad parts, and more. This is a definite must! This is one of the best books I have ever read!","This is one book I've read over and over again. Piers Anthony creates a world so full of detail that all the characters jump from the pages. If you have a copy you don't want, let me know!","This is one of those books that is not apealing based on its cover. Once you get into the second chapter you will not be able to put it down.","If you are into post-apocalyptic America, this is the book for you! When I read this in 1984,it started me on what has turned out to be a lifelong passion for Sci-Fi of this type.A must read for Sci-Fi fans..get the book, you'll enjoy it!","I was hooked 2 pages into the book. It is a fasinating story about the future, of earth. It has very interesting characters, that make you feel like your in the book. I am Not in the least dissapointed. Piers Anthony at his best.","written back when piers anthony still realised he needed real plots and characters -- proved he actually had some writing skills before the moronic output of xanth. good, solid if not particulary thoughtful post-apocalypse stuff","I've read this trilogy many times, starting back in the early eighties. I think they should have made a movie (or three) from these books, in the tradition of Planet of the Apes. The books are cool, and they tell a good story.","This book is extreamly entertaining, a real page turner. I would recomend this book for any fantasy or science fiction reader. If you've never read a post apocolypic type book, this is the book you want to read. It has everything: Love, courage, honor, etc.","These are the three finest man's books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. They're classic tales of honor, strength, loyalty, loss, coming of age and all the things that drive the male spirit. This is testosterone city my friends!

It's an intriguing three part story you wont be able to put down. The charictures are so indepth that you will want to cry for them. It's shocking and provacative. it stirs the imagination and leaves you wanting more. I hope this book becomes a movie someday.","The first two novellas, dealing with Sos the Rope and Var the Stick, are good reads. The third novella, which tells the story of Neq the Sword, takes the most appallingly stupid plot twist I've ever seen in a novel. Neq loses his hands and has a sword grafted directly to his arm. Kind of grotesque, but I could live with that a as a plot device. Not too many pages later, he has a glockenspiel superglued to the sword and becomes Neq the Glockenspiel. I flung the book across the room in disgust. The book is worth a look for the first two installments, but don't say you haven't been warned about the third.","I picked up Battle Circle purely on a name-recognition basis, and was rewarded for my faith. The three volumes of Battle Circle are some of the least lighthearted of Piers Anthony's work. Sos the Rope, Var the Stick, and Neq the Sword are parts of a very tragic and captivating story. Par for the course for Anthony, the characters deal not only with their own situations, but with the ethical considerations associated with their actions and others'. For this reason his heroes always command respect and those of the Battle Circle, while violent and largely illiterate, are no exception.","The time is the barbaric future and you have to take up a militant profession to survive and live well.Warriors, pick up a sword, a club or a rope and enter the Battle Circle to show your skills!This is one of Anthony's seldom-talked-about-book and difficult to find in bookshops (at least in Singapore and Malaysia)compared to some of his other titles. Hey, even amazon.com has only a used copy for sale!The trilogy trails the stories of Sos The Rope, Var The Stick and Neq The Sword (no prizes for guessing what weapons they use), with the tale turning from just another military fantasy type yarn, to post-Apocalypse sci-fi in an interesting manner.","Battle Circle incorporates the stories of SOS the rope, Var the stick, and Neq the sword: this is Piers Anthony work orginally published in the early 1970s.The stories of SOS, Var, and Neq are based in a barbaric world (possibly america), where honour rules supreme, and disagreements are sorted by challenge and battle in the &quot;circle&quot;. Each story is vastly entertaining and follows the trials and tribulations of each man fulfilling his destiny and dream/s.An avid Piers Anthony fan, I believe that this novel is one of his best works and so was surprised that only used books are available for this novel!Piers Anthony's Battle Circle is original, thought provoking, and evokes emotional interest/empathy with each character (which is something worth mentioning: a truly good author is hard to come by these days!).In three words, I believe you will find this book: a timeless &quot;keeper&quot;.","Battle Circle is a trilogy of Books - Sos the Rope, Var the stick and Neq the sword, available as a set in one volume. The story follows the life of a wandering warrior in a land of nomadic fighting tribes, and charts his adventures, and the changing fortunes of his empire. The book is perhapst he best work, and yet one of the least well known by this great author. The plot is watertight, and gripping, and the characters draw you into this wonderful work of storytelling. Excellent.","This is, without a dought, the most amazing piece of literature I have ever read. It is three books in one: Sos the rope, Var the sticks, and Neq the sword. Anthony intertwines them masterfully. He creates his own world that you will sucked into and accually start wishing our world was similar. The dimensions of this book are astounding. You will want to read it over and over","A very old series from Anthony, back from before he was rich and famous, but it's a very good series, one of the best he's written. I like it so much I've re-read it many times in the time I've owned it.First of all, a word of warning. This series is very dark and gory, it will make you wince. Since I first read it, I've become old and cynical and all the gore and treachery I read in it is no more than what I've seen in every day life, but it really bothered me when I first read it as a young lad, such as the dismemberments, the rapes and the tortures - there, does it shock you yet?Having said that, I think the impoverished Anthony poured his heart and soul into the book. What I like about this book and all of Anthony's good books is that he really invests his time in to the main characters, yes, he pours his heart and soul into writing them. They are fully fleshed and in our consciousness when we read them. Thus, I feel for Sos, or Sol of all weapons, or Var the stick. The characters stand out and up. And then Anthony discovered that the public would simply simper over light fantasy, and he poured his heart and soul into that. I don't think Anthony will ever write anything as good and as dark as Battle Circle. He is no longer hungry or impoverished. This series is a chapter in the life of Anthony pre-famous era and it's a gem.I won't say much about the plot as you can read that above. I will only say that your soul and your mind will be taken into a deep and dark journey into a sadistic post-Apocalyptic future if you choose to read this book, and it's a real treat.","Piers Anthony may be best known for his tongue in check Xanth series, and for his Adept and Incarnation books, but he also has written some excellent \"serious\" sci-fi and fantasy. This is one of there, ranking ver close to hisBio of a Space Tyrantbooks.I will not rehash what the other reviewers have covered so well, but let me just ad that this is a standout from my teenage reading days -- it made a big impression. If you are in the mood for a gritty, post-apocalyptic battle world where honor is everything, then this read should not dissappoint.","The first time I read this book I was about 12 years old and yes, I am a woman. I loved it and have read it a few more times since then. During the three stories the characters must master (or fail) tests of courage, skill, and strength. A must read for any fantasy fan.","This is really Piers Anthony's best book (although the Omnivore trilogy is great too.) A much different tone than his Xanth series. (Lacks the tongue in cheek playfulness that was fun for the first several Xanth books but began to cloy somewhere along the way.) A must read for Fantasy fans.","WHEN I FIRST READ THIS BOOK IN THE LATE 80'S I LOVED IT! I HAVE READ MANY FANTASY/SCIENCE FICTION BOOKS, AND THIS RANKS IN MY TOP 10. I HIGHLY RECOMEND IT."],

      "description":"Journey of a Thousand Miles tells the remarkable story of a boy who sacrificed almost everything – family, financial security, childhood and his reputation in China’s insular classical music world – to fulfil his promise as a classical pianist. Lang Lang was born in Shenyang in north-eastern China just after the end of the Cultural Revolution. He began piano lessons at three years old and by age ten had been awarded a place at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. In order to continue his studies he moved thousands of miles from home, living with his exacting father in a cramped, shared apartment, while his mother stayed at home to earn the money to pay his fees. At fifteen he moved to the United States to take up a scholarship at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia; by nineteen he was selling out Carnegie Hall. His tutor and mentor Daniel Barenboim was perhaps the first to describe him as ‘extraordinarily talented’; today his assessment is shared by millions. Now in adulthood, Lang Lang tours relentlessly, delighting sell-out audiences with his trademark flamboyance and showmanship. Journey of a Thousand Miles is a tale of heartbreak, drama and ultimately triumph. His inspiring story demonstrates the courage and self-sacrifice required to achieve artistic greatness.",

      "reviews.text":["This book started off boring, continued on being boring and ended boring.In a post apocalyptic world, the main character meets his fantasy, loves his fantasy despite knowing nothing about him, and lives with his fantasy. The author makes not so subtle points about the evils of religion, corporations, military, and man. It all combines to conspire against this supposed utopian society where art is the key to membership and to hell with the rest. Never mind that someone who might pose a better choice because of his skills than some flighty artist, just so long as you can play an instrument, you are guaranteed membership in Utopia.Basically, the story arrogantly says in a voice reminiscent of Porky Pig and Elmer Fudd \"unless you match the 'art' sterotype, you have to prove you are worthy, over and over again.\" Oh, and all heterosexuals are bad, unless they are women.Steer clear of this book if you are expecting a realistic approach to a post apocalyptic gay life. This is one of those stories that just didn't need to be told.","Finally got the book from Amazon and read it &quot;straight-through!&quot; I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book. Finding good SF/F novels, whose main characters are gay, is very difficult. Refreshing! Looking forward to a sequel!","An excellent first time adventure story. The intriguing plot and very well crafted characters really kept me going. I usually like to savor my novels, reading just a little bit at a time in my leisure. But by the time I got 3/4 of the way through, I was so excited that I couldn't stop reading! Peter Kasting amazed me with his ability to weave such a lavishly descriptive action packed story considering the context, background and setting for this novel. I really began to identify with Rafael, the Army Medical officer who is forced to come to terms with his gay feelings and the rapidly changing violent world around him. I was truly flabbergasted.","Buying small publisher books is always a gamble, as is relying on the on-line reviews of \"normal\" folk. I thought long and hard about this book before I took the plunge, mostly because of the price. The first few paragraphs were enough to make me think I'd made the right choice. The writing was intelligent, the main character extremely likable (if you're into cute, buff, modest guys, that is.*rowr*) The setup is interesting, if a bit unbelievable -- from what little I know of radiation, the sort of attack precipitating this book would have made any sort of normal life unattainable -- but, hey, it's called 'fiction' for a reason. Rafael's and Leo's growing relationship is sweet and loving, in an inevitable way. No complaints whatsoever on these counts. And yet... Bad things keep happening. Very bad things, from which there is no recovery. This book takes the adage of 'anything bad that can happen, will happen' one step too far. The last half of the book is one bad thing after another, with enemies who must be either precogs or psychic, judging by the way they anticipate every single movement of the good guys. The ending drops off quite suddenly and very ineffectually. The focus on Rafael's and Leo's love all but ceases as soon as they get into bed together (something which is handled quite tastefully -- if you're looking for smut, this isn't your book). It all devolves from people with pasts and histories reacting to situations into which they've been thrown, to things happening to 2-D representations of previously 3-D characters. All in all, it was worth reading, but I would have much rather borrowed it from a library (as if... >_&lt;).","This was an increadible read/find for me. I am not new to the SF genre but SF with gay main charaters yes. I have read gay charater driven stories before but it was too smutty or over sexed, it seemed that sex was the main part of the story and everthing else was just filler, like a plot. The scenerio is over the top but echoes very much the present, scary when this happens \"Science Fiction becomes Science Fact\".The characters are wonderful. A quick satisfying read, great for a rainy day or lazy afternoon, I definitely recommend this book.","Kasting has given us some characters we can care about. And his world is really interesting, too. Society has fallen apart, but not completly. There's still government and culture. He focuses a lot on a commune of artists in the Pacific Northwest and the descriptions are beautiful. You really care what happens to these people.","Kasting's writing is highly engaging and his vision of the distopian near-future, though published years ago, seems very apt again. The fact that internalized and externalized homophobia should remain unchanged and foremost through a nuclear disaster is made easily believable.His story held me in thrall throughout and his settings stayed with me after the reading. It's nice to have a musician and a karate expert as the central characters, emphasizing the energetic and spiritual forces as embodied by Leo and Rafael.Finally, though, the book reads a bit like a chess game -- sacrifice so many pawns, exchange the rook for the bishop, the queen ... it plays painfully on the fact that fiction is \"not real\" -- and the characters never quite emerge from being game pieces which is too bad. Because they almost became people one could care about.","Set in a grim, oppressive post nuclear future of military and religious dictatorships this work allows its characters and its reader no real hope. Mankind is just as mindless, cruel and obtuse as it has always been all through the millennia and it is believably so.While admitting this is perfectly realistic I must also wonder if fiction really needs such boundless pessimism unless the writing is so beautiful to justify any kind of content.In this desolate, not too hypothetical future of ours moves Rafael, a 24 year-old deserter looking for some happiness and love: he finds them (sort of) rather early in the story in the arms of another young man and in Wellspring, a -not so- utopian community that is willing to accept him, his troubled past and his homosexual tendencies. Everything comes at a price though: Wellspring and Rafael are not out of harm's way and do not get out unscathed.Mr Kasting is a competent writer. His writing is neat, very fast paced; his plot believable and interesting.His fault lies in characterization, which is rather sketchy both for the main and the side characters. This, together with the sad, hopeless atmosphere probably make this book of interest only for those willing to read gay-themed fiction.Sex is often mentioned but it is never graphic. The book might (or not) disturb very conservative/religious readers: Mr Kasting's opinions on religious fanaticism (which I happen to share entirely) are harsh enough and clearly inspired by some very conservative religious communities which are to be found in the States.","Wow, this book was so awesome! Rafael's story is inspiring and real. In a near-future America, Rafael goes AWOL in the hopes of finding a place where he can be himself. He finds a closed community that's willing to accept him--as long as he has something to offer. But he's not sure what that is. Meanwhile, he finds himself falling in love with a musician who's sure to be invited to stay.Rafael's story is a lot about self-acceptance and gaining a feeling of self-worth in a world that seems to have gone completely crazy. He makes friends, learns to accept his gayness and undergoes some remarkable transformations. It's really a great story--don't miss it!","This is a very interesting book. It is set in the future. in a world that has survived a nuclear blast. But the world that remains is a very scary one, with enclaves of people living wary lives. Rafael lives in this world and he has to cope with it and also with his blossoming gay feeling for Leo. A very intesting book with a lot of relevance for our world today.","When Peter Kasting first brought this novel to Windstorm, I read it in one sitting. What intrigued me about the novel, and why I decided to offer Mr. Kasting a contract for publication, had less to do with the utopia he creates and more with Rafael's personal journey. Rafael's road is never easy. He has to come to terms with his own self-hatred. Until he does this, he knows he will never have anything to offer the community he'd like to join. Rafael's inner journey also mirrors some of the physical journeys in the book and creates the bulk of the multi-layered tale.Any book you pick up should at least be a good story. The writing should be solid, the characters believable. If those basic elements aren't present, you might as well throw the book out. Journey of a Thousand Miles is all of these things. It's not an easy read at times--Mr. Kasting makes you think--but he's a very strong writer with terrific ideas. Journey of a Thousand Miles isn't just about gay characters; it's not simply a \"gay\" novel. It's a novel about real people who are struggling to carve out some kind of existence in a violent, post-Apocalypic world (more like post-Pulse ala Dark Angel rather than post-nuclear winter). Mr Kasting takes us on a journey that's worth taking and I encourage you to take a risk on a book from a publisher who takes risks everyday with unknown, first time writers who are producing something other than mind-numbing sludge."],

He contacted another seller and had one shipped to me. When another may have simply told me what had happened and left me to search again, this seller truly honored his commitment. I thank him.","I've been reading Andre since the 70's, and while the book was okay, it didn't thrill me like most of his work.","Norton wrote this when this type of story was still fresh in 1952. It was an era that produced some of the finest of these stories ever written, including Walter M. Miller's masterpiece. Against Miller's work, this one struggled to hold my attention. I am a Norton fan, and certainly didn't expect it to resemble any style but Norton's. The story of mankind's struggle to learn about their ancestors' ways before nuclear destruction, and the struggle to regain some of the lost knowledge while seeking to avoid a repeat of past mistakes, is pretty straightforward here. The message of the story seemed obvious and cliched. It probably was not yet cliched when it was written, but it is obvious enough for even the youngest readers to comprehend.Messages and lessons aside, you will enjoy it if you enjoy any of Norton's work. There's no mistaking her style, and it is evident here. The adventure is solid, action is swift and suspenseful, and an outcast character named Fors becomes the star. His companion is a mutated cat, as he steals a map and leaves his clan to journey in search of lost cities and knowledge. The story follows Fors as he encounters prejudice and tribal warfare, and tries to encourage cooperation among tribes to combat a common enemy. The nature of the Star Men, from Fors' own clan, is not revealed until the end, and it is one of the brighter moments of the story. As an adventure story, this is as competent as any Norton book. As a memorable or thoughtful statement of the futility of warfare, it is far less successful.","Star Man's Son (1952) is a post-apocalyptic novel that takes place about two centuries after the Great-Blowup. This story is also entitled Daybreak - 2250 AD in reprint editions.The cause of the catastrophe is unknown, but the effect are quite obvious. Much of the population was killed by the immediate effects of nuclear bombs, many others died later from the direct radiation and fallout from those bombs, and many more died from induced radioactivity, plague and starvation. Many plants and animals had been mutated into unrecognizable and deadly forms. Only a few humans survived and many of these were also mutated into Beast Things and other horrible creatures in the \"blue cities\" where radioactivity lingered. A very few survivors, however, received beneficial mutations that improved their chances of survival, but the seemingly normal survivors generally feared and hated any and every mutant.Fors is the son of Langdon, a Star Man, a far ranging explorer and leader of the Eyrie, and a woman that Langdon had meet down on the plains. Although Langdon was seemingly normal, Fors has inherited white hair from his mother, a mutation viewed with suspicion by the other residents of the Eyrie. While Langdon was alive, he protected Fors from most of the fear and hatred, but then Langdon was killed by Beast Things on an exploration into a far city and the men who find him bring back only a few of his belongings.After that, Fors was mostly ignored in his efforts to become a Star Man like his father. He has been adopted by Lura, a great hunting cat, and has made his own sword, knive, bow, and arrows as required. His father, a master teacher among the Star Men, had already ensured before his death that Fors knows all that is required. Nevertheless, the Council has passed over him for five years and tomorrow he will have to give up his weapons and become a tiller of the soil. As he ponders his options, Fors conceives a bold plan and immediately starts gathering supplies and equipment, including his father's pouch, for a great journey to search for the lost city in the north that was never bombed and thus is safe for scavengers.Although Fors has tried to hide them, he has some unusual talents that will help him on his trek: he is able to communicate empathically with Lura and he has much better night vision than most humans. Moreover, he has other, more subtle talents that manifest as he travels.This story is based on the premise that mankind will come close to destroying himself and this premise is found in many other works by the author. In many respects, it is a reflection of the worldview of the Cold War era, but it persists even in recent SF stories. In most of Norton's tales, this apocalyptic vision was like Pandora's box, in that there was an element of hope among all the horrors of war.Recommended for Norton fans and anyone who enjoys a mostly optimistic story of the possible future.-Arthur W. Jordin","This was one of the first science fiction novels that I ever read, and the ideas and images in it have stayed with me all this time. Nor is it really \"dated\", it could all still happen- only it is now 250 years into the future instead of 300.This is the story of Lars of the Puma clan, of the people of the Smoking Mountains. Lars's father was of the famed Star Men- explorers of the blasted wilderness beyond the mountain stronghold of the Star Hall. The brotherhood of Star Men sought to carry on the tradition of their research scientist ancestors- to seek out new knowledge for the betterment of the tribe- and of the world. This was to be Lars's destiny also, except that his father failed to return from his last mission and there was no one to speak for him at the last choosing of apprentices. So, rather than accept the insult of a lesser life, Lars took up his sword, bow, and his father's pouch, and along with his great mutant hunting cat, Lura, went out to find the great lost city of the Old Ones that his father's last journal entry spoke of.Published in 1952 this was one of the first post-apocalyptic novels. It is also one of the most believable. Even in light of current knowledge you still find it believable.One other thing, in spite of the tales about the unimaginable horror of nuclear war, this book was about hope. You see, even after you press that big \"reset\" button, mankind will yet find a way to survive; the great cycle of re-civilization from the ruins of former greatness will start again. If you were a kid growing up during the Cold War this was an important message to keep at the back of your mind.","I can't believe that I never read more of this lady's books! I remember reading at least 3 of her novels back when I was a young'un, and I wasn't all that enthralled to read more. I read the time traders and iron cage and none of them was as good as this one in my opinion.I'm currently reading The Beastmaster and it's already good.Starman's Son was a good, fun, fast read full of action and adventure, full of cool and rich characters of both human and animal. A must read!","As an 11-year old reading this in '76, the rat-mutants (yes, some creepy illustrations in the hardback copy at the Beaumont, TX Public Library) were deliciously twisted outcome of mankind's nuclear idiocy. I was firmly convinced at that age that nuclear oblivion would occur before the year 2000. Sifting through bombed out cities looking for unspoilt, unradiated tins of food from centuries previous, the hero battles odds, overcomes fear, and brings hope in the end. Nice.","StarMan's SonThis was the very first Science Fiction book that I ever read, my Brother had purchased the paperback version sometime in the 1950's and was kind enough to let me read it, I was \"hooked\" then and still am, Andre Norton shall never die as long as she has readers.This is about a young boy Lars of the Puma clan; Lars's father was a Star Man- explorers of the blasted wilderness beyond the mountain stronghold of the Star Hall. The brotherhood of Star Men sought to carry on the tradition of their research scientist ancestors- to seek out new knowledge for the betterment of the tribe- and of the world. Unfortunately Lars was a mutant, and his mutation was very apparent, his hair was white, and the Clan had not accepted him. What was not so apparent was that he had the ability to telepathically communicate with his great hunting cat, Lura. When Lars's Father failed to return from his last mission Lars snuck out of his village to explore the vast Wilderness , rather than accept the insult of a lesser life, Lars took up his sword, bow, and his father's pouch, and along with his great mutant hunting cat, Lura, went out to find the great lost city of the Old Ones that his father's last journal entry spoke of.Published in 1952 this was one of the first post-apocalyptic novels.

If you were a kid growing up during the Cold War this was an important message to keep at the back of your mind.I believe that this was the first book that I used a lined 3 X 5 card as a bookmark. Anytime I came across a word that I wasn't 100% sure of the meaning I wrote in on the lined 3 X 5 card. At the end of the book, I would write down the word and the definition into my personal Lexicon. Over the years I found that there were fewer words on the 3 X 5 cards. Science fiction seems to have an unwritten rule that the author must use a wide vocabulary.I strongly recommend this book to every teenager who wants to discover the exciting world of Science Fiction and to their parents who want to improve their reading ability and their vocabulary. You might want to do the lined 3 X 5 card thing, also.Gunner May, 2008","I read this book as a pre-teen, and it has remained at the top of my list since. Fors was my hero of many an imagined adventure of my youth. It is admitadly dated now, but I still recomend it to someone who enjoys a good sci-fi book, especially a young reader.","A fun read with an admirable message about the necessity of cooperation among all peoples if we are to avoid destruction. It's interesting that humanity requires a common enemy, the Beast Things, in order to unite it. This displays a realistic understanding of human psychology that is undermined to some extent by an ending in which everything is wrapped up a bit too tidily. There is a problem with pacing--the most exciting scenes occur in the middle of the story. Also, the Beast Things just never seemed like a particularly menacing presence outside of the abandoned cities which were their lairs. More of the novel should have happened there.","You've probably seen dozens of books that are about &quot;post-apocalyptic&quot; adventures, but this is the one that started them all. Its the Greatest! Like all of Andre Norton's stories it contains colorful characters, imaginative settings, and good plots which are interesting. Plus the author blends a good deal of drama into the adventurous storyline. Read about the adventures of &quot;Fors&quot; and learn why he is venturing into the ruins of ancient cities.","My daughters both enjoy reading science fiction. While discussing The Hunger Games, I told them about Starman's Son. Although I had forgotten a lot of the details or perhaps didn't understand them fully as a young teen, I do recall it being one my favorite books. I am anxious to read it again and share it with kids.","I read this as a kid back in the 1970s and always remembered it. The adventures were so appealing that, as a middle-schooler, I half hoped that the Cold War would blow up just so I could get out of the tedium of public school and become an explorer of the ruins too. I read it again while on vacation this year and it was a page turner... a classic post-apocalypse novel with mutants galore."],

      "description":"A Philip K. Dick Award Winner from “a brilliant writer”: In a ravaged California, a man tries to rescue his lost love from a soul-devouring religious cult (William Gibson). In the twenty-second century, the City of Angels is a tragic shell of its former self, having long ago been ruined and reshaped by nuclear disaster. Before he was in a band in Ellay, Gregorio Rivas was a redeemer, rescuing lost souls trapped in the Jaybirds cult of the powerful maniac Norton Jaybush. Rivas had hoped those days were behind him, but a desperate entreaty from a powerful official is pulling him back into the game. The rewards will be plentiful if he can wrest Urania, the official’s daughter and Gregorio’s first love, from Jaybush’s sinister clutches. To do so, the redeemer reborn must face blood-sucking hemogoblins and other monstrosities on his way to discovering the ultimate secrets of this neo-Californian civilization. One of the most ingeniously imaginative writers of our time, Tim Powers dazzles in an early work that displays his unique creative genius, earning him a nomination for the Nebula Award. Alive with wit, intelligence, and wild invention, Dinner at Deviant’s Palace is a mad adventure across a dystopian future as only Tim Powers could have imagined it. This ebook features an original introduction by the author.",

      "reviews.text":["Post nuclear holocaust LA? - Heard it before! Lost love refound? - Been done. So why read this one? Because it's so different.Aspects of this book have become quite common place in the SF movie world, that I can't help wondering just how many people read Powers. I can't give any examples here, 'cos I don't want to spoil the astounding revelations exposed throughout the book but if you read it, you'll know what I mean. And you should read it.Amusing word plays - like the blood lusting Hemogoblin - show Powers humour to be unsubtle, unlike the plot, which is so full of sub-plots and different levels, that you can't help sharing the calm desperation of the main character as he sinks lower and lower into a reality he could not have suspected existed.","This is the first Tim Powers book I've read, and though I can't compare it to the rest of his work, it seems that he is more inclined to writing fantasy than science fiction. Yes, the setting is L.A. after some (unmentioned) armaggedon, and, without revealing too much, there are alien beings here, but the treatment is closer to a sword-and-sorcery tale... with swords exchanged for slingshots and guns, and religious mysticism for sorcery. And then, there are Powers' grotesques, like the hemogoblins and those weird trash men within the Holy City, that don't seem scifi at all.So: the tale IS about a man, Greg Rivas, bent on rescuing an old flame from the clutches of a religious cult, and the subsequent confrontation with the entity behind it. It IS NOT about this post-apocalyptic world the action is set in.In my opinion, the one weak point of the novel is character development: Greg goes through several mood swings that don't mesh together well. But the plotting is strong, giving an envolving tale.To those willing to taste this fanciful dinner, enjoy.","I have to disagree with the previous reviewer regarding Gregorio Rivas as a weak spot in the book. While on this &quot;quest&quot; for his long lost love, Rivas actually changes and grows as a character. Here we have someone who is affected by his enounters instead of just a fellow meeting external obstacles. Rivas doesn't have mood swings. He confronts himself as he revisits people and places from his past. He gradually goes from being a rather arrogant egotistical jerk to an empathatic decent human being trying to do the right thing instead of a one dimensional idiot bent on just earning his &quot;brandy.&quot; Here Powers has created a man capable of learning some things as the story progresses. How many contemporary authors of any genre can pull that off without making readers snicker and say, &quot;Yeah, right.&quot;","As a writer, Powers had a penchant (reputation?) for being both tricky and odd in his constructions. His great talent is the ability to take a fairly \"real\" scenario and add layers of twists onto it that tweak it into something that is just left of the world we know, where magic lurks just underneath the surface and the stakes are as great as the rewards. His best novels (most people agree on \"Last Call\" and \"Anubis Gates\" being the peaks) section themselves off into a territory of urban fantasy characterized by intelligent and extremely deft plotting as well as a seemingly endless stream of ideas.\"Dinner at Deviant's Palace\", however, is something different. It's far closer to science-fiction than almost anything else I've read from him before. Granted, it's an early novel (though not embryonic, \"Anubis Gates\" had already been published) but it shows an interesting direction that he could have gone in, plus an example of what a novel in another genre might look like once he applied his abilities to it.It takes place in a future US where civilization has been drastically rearranged. Currency appears to be based on alcohol and several nuclear wars seem to have occurred, leaving the remaining cities to function more or less as their own entities. Fairly musician Greg Rivas is going about his business as usual when an old girlfriend's father shows up with a proposition. Even though he hates Rivas' guts, he will pay him handsomely for a job he used to do: \"redeem\" people. You see, there's a cult wandering around the area, the Jaybirds, who are very good at bringing people into the flock and not letting them out. In fact, people don't want to get out. Rivas, as a former cult member, is more than decent at it, so against his better judgement he goes in again.The most interesting thing about this novel is how straightforward it is. For the most part Rivas' quest proceeds in a linear fashion and while he runs into detours and obstacles along the way, we don't run into any big twists or surprises as the novel winds on. Most of the appeal of the novel comes from exploring the future world that Powers has created and looking to see where it deviates from our world. It's clear pretty much from the onset that he has thought this through to a ridiculously detailed degree, down to the slang terms and the texture of how this new world would operate, the rules of the differing factions and how those factions would affect each other. There's a certain sense of history to it, that this world had a long and fruitful life long before we came stumbling along to read about it. Done improperly, this could become a mere travelogue, with Powers like a kid who just bought a museum, eagerly taking you on the tour to make sure you've seen everything. And the plot skirts just clear of becoming that.What's interesting is that for all the issues it potentially could raise, the necessity of cults in a world without marked consistency, the the fear of falling into the comfort of a collective, the exploration of loss in an environment where you're constantly on the verge of losing everything, the fear of re-inhabiting the past in order to refute it, the novel sticks to the pace and conceits of an adventure story, content to move onto the next exhibit in the catalog.It's a world just on the verge of the magical realism, for every SF concept there are bits like the hemogoblin, a vague gaseous intelligent beast that likes to suck blood. And then there's the whole concept behind the cult itself, which vaguely involves space and I can't go into too much without spoiling the story. Powers clearly had fun coming up with it, putting as much research into it as he does for his more historically based novels, extrapolating as best he can. Which helps, because since the story lacks his typically controlled and breakneck notion of plotting, we're left with a man who is discovering his world at the same time we are. If the thrill of discovery is right up your alley, then there's loads to discover here, the machinations and the ins and outs of how the world functions. There's hope early on that this novel might go somewhere mind-bending, as Rivas confuses past and present as he gets back in the cult, but that perverted sense of time goes nowhere.Instead, we get the plot hurtling forward like a bird skimming the top of a lake, occasionally plucking out a shiny and iridescent fish for us to marvel over. We get scenes inside the cult. We get scenes of Rivas running and scheming and reacting and eventually getting closer to the aforementioned dinner at the palace of the deviant. Readers will probably have seen this coming before Rivas does but when the climax finally arises and we meet the head Jaybird himself, who the entire novel has spent foreshadowing, there's an odd flatness to it. Entering the palace should be an introduction to the Gothic and alien, a true tonal shift leaving behind all the strangeness we've seen already for a strangeness that even Rivas can't cope with. But the horror eludes us. There's one creepy moment of real danger and then it resolves and we're left feeling this was the way it has to be the whole time. At some points it feels like Powers was so fascinated with the world that he didn't pay as much attention to the plot as he normally does. And what was up with the sacrament anyway?It reads fast and maybe shouldn't leave any impression at all for the speed with which it races through itself . Still, the details that make it stick. The fracture of society, the way that cult members chant out the thoughts of another, the stalking of the hemogoblin, all of these are images that will stick with you, images that you won't be able to find anywhere else. Such is Powers' skill. But the rest of it feels like Powers doing what most of us are doing when we enter the book, feeling around this new world, trying to find our footing before moving off to see what we can see. Another novel in this vein of exploration would have been interesting, with perhaps a deeper examination of the themes that were starting to be raised here. But alas, where Powers wanted to go was somewhere a bit different. Oh well. It's nice to at least have this.","Very few books deserve a ten. This is one. It amazes me that this book is not a classic of modern science fiction/fantasy. Dark, mysterious, almost pre-cyberpunk. Powers does an amazing job of setting up a post-nuclear war devastated L.A., populating it with well thought out characters. Drop in drugs, violence, religious fanatics, and psychic beings and you have an amazing read. Anyone who has played the classic computer role playing game &quot;Wasteland&quot; will feel right at home.","I'm really sad to find that this book is out of print. In my opinion it is one of the best books ever written. Dark, apocalyptic science fiction set in a Post-War Los Angeles. It's quite unlike the other books Tim Powers has written, but in my opinion it even surpasses The Anubis Gates by far","Most of Tim Powers' later works share such strong common threads that they could almost be called formulaic. This book, however, breaks the mold. Although the writing style is not as polished as &quot;Anubis Gates&quot; it's definitely a must-read.","I like Tim Powers' books. I don't like this one too much though. Powers love of the grotesque is in full force here, but what you've really got here is two stories that don't need each other. Post holocaust LA and the mysterious evil thing don't need to be in the same story, and one basically distracts from the other. Also, what's Powers' deal with mutilation? Why ask here? Might as well here as anywhere."],

      "reviews.text":["This book is, for some unknown reason, one of my favorite stories. When I picked it up at a book fair way back in high school it was because the cover caught my eye. The story has a fine plot that moves well, and it was filled with novel characters. It's not like it's great literature or anything, but I liked it. Thank you Mr. Lanier, even if you never create another tale. Terrance Gallagher","Hiero's Journey began well enough. The writing is average and the story is interesting enough. The psi aspect is good, as are the animals. But then, about half way through our Hiero meets an adorable princess and from then on the story becomes way to precious, coquettish and coy to stomach. No one told the author that once the lovers declare their love the romance is over, I guess. What this book needed was an editor with a red pencil to cut all this flowery language, redundancy and cuteness. If he's still alive, the writer is in his eighties, but the prose reads as if a teenager wrote it. This comes from a romantic, by the way. Anybody want to buy a copy (and the sequel) cheap? Lesson one: never buy the sequel until you've read the first book, regardless of the reviews. Live and learn.","I confess that my biographical knowledge of Sterling Lanier is somewhat spotty. He graduated from Harvard in 1951 and did graduate work in anthropology and archeology at the University of Pennsylvania. He was an editor at Chilton in the early 1960s, where he persuaded that company to publish Frank Herbert's _Dune_. He began publishing science fiction of his own in 1961. Lanier seems to like writing adventure stories with military heroes. At their worst, they stike me as terribly dull. At their best, they are irritating because they fall barely short of being truly memorable works of science fiction.In _Hiero's Journey_ (1973), Lanier takes an interesting idea but does not give it the treatment it deserves. Five thousand years after a nuclear holocaust, the face of North America has been altered. Mutated plants and animals have spread over the land. Per Hiero Desteen, a kind of warrier-priest, is sent by his abbot from what was once western Canada on a quest to the south. His mission is to discover what a computor is and if possible to bring one back. Accompanying him is a morse, a mooselike mount with which he has a telepathic bond. Opposing him are the Unclean Ones, a satanic sect which is intent on exterminating most of humanity. It has the makings of a good adventure, but it falls a bit short.The problem, I think, is in Lanier's background. He has populated it with a great many mutant creatures, but he has failed to make them part of a plausible ecology. Back in 1963, L. Sprague de Camp published a gem of an essay titled \"How to Plan a Fauna\" (_Fantasy and Science Fiction_, October). The article is an excellent how-to-do-it guide for science fiction writers who want to plan a realistic ecological setting for their stories. I don't plan to reiterate de Camp's article in detail; but there is one basic rule that de Camp discusses that an author should follow: _Don't populate your setting exclusively with carnivores._ In _Hiero's Journey_, Hiero encounters a large number of spectacular creatures on his quest including giant weasles, 15 ton frogs, a giant snake, giant snapping turtles, giant fish with tails hundreds of feet wide, birds with 30 foot wingspans, giant monkeys and giant rats. While Lanier does give some attention to herbivores-- giant hippos, mutated cows, and giant elephants-- the carnivores greatly outnumber the herbivores in numbers and size.As the novel progresses, the carnivorous creatures become bigger and bigger. At one point in the novel, a giant fish rises out of the ruins of a sunken city to gobble up a boatload of villains. It's an impressive scene-- until you stop to ask how the creature lives in a spot where there aren't ordinarily any people to eat. There just aren't any animals large enough or numerous enough for it to feed upon.Because the ecology of _Hiero's Journey_ is not credible, the monsters appear to be plot devices-- creations that exist primarliy for the hero to fight and overcome. Unlike the alien life forms in a novel by Hal Clement, John Varley, or Larry Niven, Lanier's creatures don't seem to be part of a real ecology. They are not as believeable or as complex.","Update Dec. 1 2012: Attention Sterling Media Group: On the off chance that you read these reviews or that somebody can bring it to your attention, I stripped the DRM from your book and fixed the HTML the last time I read it. Give me my $10 back and I will give you the edited copy and you can fix this book for everyone. You can't beat that deal!Update Dec. 24 2011: The Kindle book was recently updated and the new version is improved. Unfortunately, it is also still terrible. Many of the OCR problems were resolved, but not all of them. Improper paragraph breaks and missing or incorrect punctuation still abound. Italics have not been restored. Overall, it is better, but still bad. It would be so trivial to fix the problems that it is really inexcusable for the publisher to be asking $10. It is obvious that nobody who gives a damn has read through the text.Original Review:As Hiero's Journey is one of my favorite books, I was happy to see a Kindle version available. Unfortunately, it is a big disappointment.The formatting is terrible, with line breaks in the middle of paragraphs, missing punctuation, many bad-OCR character substitutions, and none of the italics used to identify mental communication in the original version.For ten dollars, this is a complete rip off. I'll stick with my old paper copy.The publisher should either reduce the price to 99 cents or fix the text. Preferably the latter since I already wasted $10 on it. Don't make the same mistake I did.(I see that Sterling Media Group LLC has recently released all of Lanier's books other than Menace Under Marswood. I would happily have repurchased all of his books for the Kindle if this one had been well done. Hopefully they will release a fixed version. Until this one is corrected, there is no way I will be taking a risk on the others.)","Believable, imaginative, engaging. An extremely satisfying read from start to finish. I've read the book at least ten times, each more enjoyable. While based on a world atomic disaster this is an uplifting, feel-good story. The next volume, Unforsaken Hiero, keeps up the pace and adds more dimensions to Per Hiero, our hero. While each book tells a complete story, the saga is incomplete. It has been frustrating waiting for years for the third volume. Despite the lack, the two books are incredible.","If science fiction/fantasy is your genre of literature, do yourself a favor and take a weekend to read this excellent story by Lanier.His lead character, Per Hiero Desteen is an instantly likeable warrior/priest who must undertake a critical mission in unknown and forbidden territory in a post-apocalyptic North America 5,000 years in the future. The story is a real page-turner with dozens of believable plot twists and supporting ideas that make for a fun and fantastic read. The typical good vs. evil sub plot takes a fresh approach in Laniers world with many diverse characters including dozens of grotesque, nuclear-spawned mutations, some intelligent and allied to humans..others maelevelant but equally intelligent aligned with evil humans known as the Unclean. This unholy alliance is dedicated to the resurrection of the nuclear technology that decimated the Earth 5 millenia in the past, as well as the total subjigation of normal humankind.All these things become quite plausible thanks to Laniers excellent literary style and flair for creating believable, likeable characters. He is a master storyteller with a gift that so few authors have. Ultimately, this book is pure fantasy that is extremely fun! The sequel, Unforsaken Hiero is equally entertaining and a must-read once you gobble up this first book.Sadly, Mr. Lanier has never written the third and final book in the trilogy and it appears he may never do so. For the many Hiero fans left waiting, we can only hope Lanier may someday rekindle his passion for this series and finish the story. Or perhaps authorize a third book by a young upcoming writer in the sci fi/fantasy industry. I've been waiting for book three for over ten years.Regardless, please take Hiero's Journey. You won't be sorry.","I would wholeheartedly give a 5 star to this book as it is one of the finest example of post-apocalyptic fiction.However, Kindle edition is so badly ruined by publishers decision to just use a bad OCR device on the book and do absolutely no editing or even proofreading afterwards.For this, shame on you Sterling Media Group because you defiled such a beautiful book and Amazon because you shamelessly sell it in this shape.","\"Hiero's Journey\" imagines a long-dead North American continent. Nearly five thousand years have past since a horrible war decimated the world, turning it into a mutated hell. Pockets of humanity dot the wastes, with many sects having reverted to primitive savagery. Taking the center stage is Hiero Desteen, a telepathic Canadian priest assigned with the duty of venturing into the forbidden areas of (what were once) the Great Lakes and New England regions in search of technological artifacts. With only a few companions at his side, he must fend off an onslaught of hideous, war-spawned beasts and tattered remnants of civilization.The plot is really nothing new, but beauty is in how Lanier puts it all together. His post-apocalyptic world is vividly imagined, brought to life by description that is neither flowerly or sparse. The great monsters of the wastelands are mutated to comically huge proporations, yet instead of going for completely overkill, Lanier gives us only glimpses of them in action. He leaves most of it to the reader's imagination, and the result is a series of rather impressive scenes and a tense, foreboding atmosphere. The characters are standard - the lone warrior and his animal friends, the mysterious girl, the evil brotherhoods of evil. It has all been done before, but Lanier does a great job of breathing just enough life into them. They're tiny, pen-lights of goodness and humanity in a savage world, and while none of them are all that extensively realized, I could nonetheless believe in and sympathize with them and their plights.\"Hiero's Journey\" is a product of a time in which science fiction didn't have to be horribly complex and thought-provoking in order to be considered good. It's a great story with larger-than-life characters battling rediculous odds in a harsh world. It has action, adventure, corny-but-lovable dialogue, and some wonderful imagery. It's not a novel to be taken seriously, but it's a novel to be read and enjoyed for the hell of it. And it's certainly worth some extensive excavating at the local used book store.","Rereading this book for the 10th time or so, I am still amazed by how well this story works, relative to so many other fantasy and sorcery tales. There is no padding, no excess, no digressions even when the plot seems to be a series of hung-together adventures. Moreover, &quot;the Unclean&quot; are really evil and horrible, in a way that not many other authors seem to have captured. This book, and its sequel, deserve to be reissued. And maybe other authors should use it as a model for how to write fantasy/adventure that endures.","If science fiction/fantasy is your genre of literature, do yourself a favor and take a weekend to read this excellent story by Lanier.His lead character, Per Hiero Desteen is an instantly likeable warrior/priest who must undertake a critical mission in unknown and forbidden territory in a post-apocalyptic North America 5,000 years in the future.

The typical good vs. evil sub plot takes a fresh approach in Laniers world with many diverse characters including dozens of grotesque, nuclear-spawned mutations, some intelligent and allied to humans..others maelevelant but equally intelligent aligned with evil humans known as the Unclean. This unholy alliance is dedicated to the resurrection of the nuclear technology that decimated the Earth 5 millenia in the past, as well as the total subjigation of normal humankind.All these things become quite plausible thanks to Laniers excellent literary style and flair for creating believable, likeable characters. He is a master storyteller with a gift that so few authors have. Ultimately, this book is pure fantasy that is extremely fun! The sequel, Unforsaken Hiero is equally entertaining and a must-read once you gobble up this first book.Sadly, Mr. Lanier has never written the third and final book in the trilogy and it appears he may never do so. For the many Hiero fans left waiting, we can only hope Lanier may someday rekindle his passion for this series and finish the story. Or perhaps authorize a third book by a young upcoming writer in the sci fi/fantasy industry. I've been waiting for book three for over ten years.Regardless, please take Hiero's Journey. You won't be sorry.","Per Hiero Desteen.Prest, warrior, and telepath.a Jedi before we even knew what the term was!What a great adventure, the author is a master of his field, and puts our hero through his paces,. In a holocaust world five thousand years in the future where atomic death has changed both man and beast,he was the last hope for the few remnants of normal humanity. In his way,the dark brotherhood of the unclean and there followers of mutated intelligent beast, &quot;The leemutes&quot;.together with his great riding moose and a young mutated bear,he rode forth to find the secrets of the past which might save the humans who were ruled by the abbeys.Through the heart of the unclean he went, and they were waiting for him!","I have the paper back of this book. I was very disappointed in the quality of this ebook. It looks like it was scanned, OCR'ed, and maybe spell checked. It appears that no human bothered to look at the output before they published it. The formatting is very bad and there are special characters in place of letters through out the text.","A tremendous story that draws the reader into the tale and attaches a personal interest to the hero's triumphs and perils. Each new character is crafted with honor, courage and wit or, in the enemy's case, with malevolence and evil foreboding. Each preceding chapter ends demanding the next one be started without delay. Humans and mutants, both good and evil, are brought to life with clarity and purpose. You can practically smell the fetid forests and, in the swamps and bogs, feel the bites of pests and clammy heat. The story is written enjoyably and makes the reader ponder what it would be like following a nuclear holocaust; the rabid growth and mutation of humans, animals and plants from the lingering greenhouse effect, even five millinia later. Humans and animals with the noble purpose to reestablish normal humanity throughout the land, able to communicate with their minds, form alliances to thwart the foul purposes of the evil enemy known as the Unclean. Hiero, a kind-hearted and sincere Priest, yet ruthless Killman when need be, sets out on a last ditch mission which, if successful, will allow the far flung Abbey fort-communities to turn the tide of the war they will inevitably lose to the Unclean wizards and their evil allies, the Lemutes (slang for animals that have gone through &quot;lethal mutation&quot; and are now harmful to humanity) if nothing is done. However, he must pass straight through the heart of the enemy's territory to get to his evenutal destination. Along his way he makes allies and friends and, as the danger mounts through the story, the pace increases and doesn't let up until the last page is read. And trust me, you won't want it to end!","I was very impressed with this book. It is about a human in a future made desolate by a nuclear war. The story takes place long after all the radiation is gone. This is a story of new beginnings. Our hero is pursued by a group of phsychic warriors who battle largely through the mind. Hiero discovers that he has an innate ability in this area that is awakened when he is attacked. As he explores his ability and tries to stay alive the reader is taken along a wonderful journey through the cities that have been taken over by the wild life.Sterling E. Lanier did a wonderful job on this book. I respect him as an author and have enjoyed everything of his I have read","Lanier's most distinctive gift as an author is an enthusiasm for his stories. Even if you are not a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction or adventure fiction you cannot help but be caught up in the frenetic eagerness of the narrative. The sheer number of expository sentences that end in explanation points is staggering. He may not be the most gifted author out there, but he obviously had a lot of fun writing Hiero's Journey and I found it a bit contagious.The \"Hiero\" of this story is a priest in a future Catholic order (as is typical of many post-apocalyptic stories) who sets out on a quest across a drastically changed North America looking for technological relics of vanished civilization. Mutated animals and people (and iterations of the two) abound. Do not try to look for scientific accuracy in this tale; it is \"soft\" science fiction resolutely and unapologetically. There is nothing really innovative or genre-busting about Hiero, but it was not a waste of my time. One minor complaint I have is how Lanier constantly relied on metaphors about radio and other technologic trappings when describing how telepathy worked in this story. Considering the main character had never heard of radio or seen anything like it these descriptions broke the fourth wall a bit.","Hiero's Journey (1973) by Sterling Lanier - 275 pages - rating: 7.5/10Adventurous journey across post apocalyptic North America ( including many Canadian references ) reminiscent of classic odyssey style tale. Hiero meets and picks up several interesting characters along the way as he heads towards an uncertain goal while battling numerous evil creatures of both human and animal origin. Jungles, the high seas and swamp settings keep the backdrop ever changing. He even hooks up along the way with a tasty young female morsel with a shockingly significant age differential.The writing style flows smoothly but there are several uncommon words that would require most of us to consult a dictionary. Otherwise a highly enjoyable and frequently exciting story.Claus Kellermann2006 April 11Sci_Fi_Researcher@yahoo.com","I've read this book over 10 times in the past 20 years and I have to say it's one of the finest sci fi books ever. It is post apocalyptic but it also is one of the finest and believable explorations of mind powers ever. Truly original in dozens of pioneering concepts!!An absolute must read!","Although it was many years ago I first read this book, it left such an impression on me that I went looking for it again. What a great adventure - good storytelling, terrific imagination and unexpected heroes and villans everywhere. Where's Hollywood?","Alternative future. Long after the nuclear apocalypses Earth is not quite apleasant place to live on. That concerns as well the places where Canada andUS are in our time. But it is not as terrible as you could imagine either.Through radioactive marches and ruins of great cities populated by belligerentmutants and other weird and evil creatures Hiero, abbot and priest of what wecall now Christian church, brings his pure soul in a quest for the ancientknowledge - the only thing which can save the reviving civilization of thefuture. And when in this journey he meets and saves his love she is definitelyworth all the trouble.Well, you guess all right, she is princess, and there will be pursuit andescape, hiding and fights, friends and enemies, and even some kind of dark andlight magic.This is one of the best mix of romance, fantasy and action I ever read.Maybe it would be right to place it in one row with the first &quot;Witch World&quot; ofAndre Norton and Christoffer Stasheff's &quot;Wizard in Spite of Himself&quot;.","I believe the Sterling Media Group LLC must have re-formatted the Kindle version recently as I just purchased it (August 2011) and it looks great. No line breaks, missing punctuation, or bad OCR substitutions. This is such a great story. It's a must read for lovers of Sterling Lanier's work and anyone who enjoys the fantasy/adventure genre. Thank you Sterling Media Group LLC for paying attention to the reviews and doing justice to Sterling Lanier's work.","This is one of the best sci-fi books I've ever read. And I've read a lot of sci-fi novels.The author writing style is vivid and imaginative, in this case putting you in the shoes of protagonist, Dasteen Hiero, to experience his amazing journey through the post-apocalyptic American wilderness to save mankind. It has everything you can imagine: a sunken city in the great marsh, bear with great intelligence and potential psychic communication abilities, villains and their hideous followers, and oh, a beautiful princess our hero saved along the way, I first read it through a borrowed copy more than a decade ago, since then I've bought my own copy, together with its sequel -The Unforsaken Hiero.Too bad the author didn't write a third book, that will make the story-arc complete.Has the author already passed away? Anyone knows?","Sterling Lanier weaves a marvelous tale of intrigue, adventure, exploration and romance. This is a book that even the most challenged reader will find hard to put down. It will be a shame if \"Hollywood\" does not discover this gem.","I have been reading Sci-fi for many years and I stumbled across this book review today. It brought back fond memories of my teenage years. I have read this book many times and it never disappoints.I only wish he would have finished the series, Sigh....","Absolutely epic, fun post-apocalyptic soft-science fiction.Sterling E. Lanier creates a highly imaginative world with an excellent protagonist who is easy to empathize with, noble companions, and despicable enemies. The story arc is reminiscent of ancient epics and draws heavily on Joseph Campbell like archetypes.The world is grim and disturbing, yet strangely appealing, a world of the unexpected with danger and wonder a hands-breath away. Lots of fun to read.[...]","I read this book the first time about 20 years ago and was fascinated by its intriguing and amazing story. Since then I always wanted to read this book again, but I never had a chance. Finally, when I saw that an e-book is available, I bought a Kindle reader and this book.It was a nice reading and I enjoyed the book again. However, I noticed something that I missed 20 years ago when I was a kid - the story flow is not always smooth and sometimes changes awkwardly. For example, when the protagonist has some deadly challenges and everything is against him and there is no hope, something magically happens, a new ally comes, or some unbelievable coincidence of events let him out of all situations. It was ok 20 year ago, but now I found this a bit naive and Hollywood-like. Still, the book itself deserves 4 stars.Another issue is a very poor formatting. There are numerous broken paragraphs and some OCR mistakes (use of number 1 instead of letter l). Buying an intangible book for $10 I would expect it to be proofreaded and formatted well. That is finally I use 3 stars to grade this e-book.","Both Hiero books are somewhat light on character development, and the post-apocalyptic flora/fauna are unrealistic. They also both tend to be somewhat juvenile. However, so were the Tarzan and Mars books. The Hiero books succeed for the same reasons those books did. They do not pretend to be a scholarly prediction of how humans would interact long after a nuclear disaster. They are simply entertaining.Sometimes the best judge of a successful book is not its technical merit, but how often it is re-read. I have a paperback of both Hiero books. They have been read many, many times. I have a paperback of Melville's Moby Dick. It has been read once. No question which has more artistic merit. The Hiero books are a fun read, and perhaps the best endorsement is my regret that Lanier never wrote a third book.","This is one of Mr. Lanier's best books. I have read it several times and have never tired of it. The only other book of his that I would rate at the same level is the sequel, Unforsaken Heiro. I have never seen the concluding book of the series, so I assume it was never written, but there two books are worth the time and effort to find and enjoy.","About 5000 years in the future, earth is a transformed planet. Ravaged by nuclear and biological warfare, life has become vastly different from the \"pre-Death\" era. Most of the dominant populations of humanity did not survive, but small, isolated populations were left intact. These are now the dominant humans. They are in a constant struggle for survival against the Unclean, which is an alliance of mutant animals and people, who share a goal of conquering the \"normal\" humans. The story follows a priest, who undertakes a secretive journey to find evidence for a rumored piece of ancient technology, which could provide his people with an important tool to fight the Unclean. Most of the journey occurs in what was once the Great Lakes region, or in the area once known as Canada.This is a pretty classic example of soft science fiction, and it focuses mainly on creating a colorful and interesting landscape. Telepathy is an intricate part of events. Mutated life is described in great detail, but without much scientific grounding. Life forms, it seems, have increased drastically in size and ferocity. The primary explanation is radiation-induced mutations. Telepathic ability has developed to become a fairly common trait among life forms, to varying degrees. Animals and humans can share mental activity, and the priest named Hiero uses that to forge a bond with an intelligent bear-like creature, who assists him with his journey. The bear's motives are never fully revealed, but it becomes a faithful ally.The writing was straightforward and just okay. Events, when they occurred, suffered from the average writing. The book, for me, lacked a sense of excitement. A great deal was invested in painting a colorful, and detailed future earth, populated by strange and interesting creatures. The title of the book is appropriate. In the hands of, say, Andre Norton, I likely would have thought of this as \"Hiero's Adventure\". But the feel is certainly more of a journey. Norton's books shared an emphasis on telepathy between humans and non-human creatures. I could not help but notice how vastly different her stories flowed from this one. Excitement and action in a Norton story is every bit as prominent as her imaginative creatures and worlds. Her skillful writing was the difference. This was still an enjoyable story, with enough wonder to entertain most readers.","I read this book in the 1980's and loved the story of adventure and futuristic mayhem. When recently searching for the sequels, recalling it was supposed to be a trilogy, I could not find any mention of such an author or such a book. Thanks to your reviews I now know the title of the sequel and plan to re-read the first book also.","\"Hiero's Journey\" is a great book, and would make a pretty darn cool movie. Mr. Lanier is quite creative, especially with his ideas on what sort of civilization might emerge from the ashes of a nuclear conflict (a semi-republic centered on monasteries in western Canada, where the damage might have been less). Some of the creatures that Hiero encounters on his journey, such as the Dweller in the Mists, are really cool.","Many years ago I picked up a hard back edition of this book complete with the second volume in the series. It was on a cart of books with a free sign on the front. I was a bit dubious at first, but was bored so started reading. WOW! It turned out to be one of my all time favorite books. So I was quite pleased to see it available on Kindle. I bought it and am current re-reading it. It is very fast moving, holds your interest well and the story line is quite gripping. A rollicking good read!","Came across this book more than 30 years ago, has stuck in my mind since then. I now have it on my kindle forever.","The characters are believable and have enough depth to hold one's interest and the story moves at a good pace to keep one's interest. I like the idea of this kind of result to a nuclear holocaust - some hope long in the future for a positive humanity. I found this book in 1988 first and enjoyed it then. I just re read it. I am pleased that Mr Lanier has written more on the subject! Oh, boy a new story by an old friend!Mr Lanier - thanks for some super writing!"],

      "reviews.text":["First published in 1901, this apocalyptic novel has been reissued as a \"forgotten classic.\" While the \"classic\" label may be something of an overstatement, it is important as one of the first science fiction novels, and the first \"last man alive\" doomsday novel. In addition, it is great fun to read.The plot is segmented into three distinct parts:*The first part covers an expedition to reach the North Pole, a feat which had not been accomplished at the time the novel was written. It climaxes with only one man, Adam Jeffson, left alive.*The second part follows Adam as he makes his way back to habitation, only to discover that a mysterious purple cloud has covered the rest of the earth, seemingly leaving him as the only human alive. Slowly sinking into dark madness, he unleashes his own destruction, burning the great cities.*The last segment cannot be discussed without becoming something of a spoiler. Suffice it to say, it includes Adam's return to sanity and to belief in the future of the earth.The pre-apocalypse first section is actually the most suspenseful and well written, conveying in frenzied language the mystery and actual horror aroused by the frozen Pole region. Of his race toward the Pole, Adam relates, \"...I sped, I spun, with grinning teeth that chattered and gibbered, and eyeballs of distraction: for a Fear, too--most cold and dreadful--had its hand of ice upon my heart....\"The second section unfortunately drags somewhat as Adam relates with numbing detail of his search of town after town and of underground caves and mines for survivors. Only when Adam begins his frenzy of burning does the narrative again come alive, as he watches the burning of London while smoking opium, drinking wine, and playing the harp.The last section features an entirely different tone, as Adam progresses toward reason and hope. Although the story line is more than a bit illogical (if that can even be said of this kind of novel), the ending is very satisfactory.This novel cannot be judged by modern standards, certainly, but it can be judged as a product of its time. Those who appreciate H. G. Wells, H. P. Lovecraft, H. Rider Haggard, and others in this vein will really appreciate this \"forgotten classic.\"","Started out pretty interesting. Middle was a little drawn out. Ending was a head scratcher. I was looking for a interesting ending to make up for the slow middle and,,,,,nothing.Keep in mind that this was written at the turn of the century so wording and writing style are consistent with that time and takes some getting used to,","After reading the reviews on this book, and learning what the plot was about, I was excited to give this book a try.Unfortunately, I really got bogged down in the details as the author describes the main character's journey to London. He could have tidied that part up a bit, perhaps shortening it dramatically to give the story the opportunity to breathe. Instead, it became such a chore to slog through each page that I finally just gave up.Disappointed...should have been a much better book.","Early on, this story impressed me. Well written, good story line, good syntax, minimal expletives,courageous main character--all features of a good read. When the protagonist and the reader realize that he (we) are it, the last guy, the Lone Ranger, the only chip left in the bag--then it falls apart. He begins to dither. The author starts writing the same thing in different ways. It's like he had to fill his quota of words for the book. Other reviewers describe him as going crazy, but I think he just went boring. Anyone can write bad stuff (like this review?) but I was expecting better.","I had trouble with this book at first. If it were printed today, it would be a very fat book. It's printed with a tiny font [most editions] and written in very formal English. It reminded me of Jules Verne. It should be on every science fiction fans list of read books.The story is basically post-apocalyptic, with spiritual undertones. No zombies or roving bands of starving people, more psychological. The main character is tormented, inventive, destructive - engaging.","Like many a reviewer above, I found this book to be totally word-tasty and directly emotional. I described it to a friend as \"virtuosity in the service of SOMETHING TO SAY.\" I hadn't finished the book at that point, so, maybe I'm just one of those people who got to the end and just went, \"really, is that all?\" I like to think of this as \"Lost before Lost.\" That might be kinda cheapening the talent that is gushing from this novel, but the two do share a few things.Without spoiling it for you if you haven't read it, the writer introduces rather a few exciting mysteries and possibilities and just lets them hang and die \"back on page 33\" or whatever/wherever that I found most depressing, unsatisfying and kind of lazy. Anyway, in between you get some of the most intelligent, informed and yet absolute stream-of-consciousness writing I've parsed in my years. And although I share THE OBSERVATION that most \"creative writing teachers\" would bitch about his \"run-on sentences,\" I could not put the book down sometimes-- as it kept me plugging away at the poetic, juicy verbage and stayed with my mind as though -I_ was the one thinking these thoughts. Am I nearly as intelligent as the character/writer=== heavens no, but did that matter=== most certainly not. Although Sheil's passion to tell and describe can get dense and close to entangled, for me anyway-- he never lost my interest or connection with the character and his mindset, despite there being more than a few topics discussed that I am not well-versed in or possess the vocabulary to quite grapple with (bedside companion every tenth page for this novel: a dictionary, and, if you're really committed, have internet accessibility for some of the geographic, literary and historical musings).Anyway, worth reading--- resounding YES. Disappointment--- ditto. Maybe, like one reviewer said, it was 1901, and he was writing for an audience of sorts, so, I dunno... Anyway, pick it up. Read the \"virtuosity in the service of SOMETHING TO SAY\" for the first 170 pages or so, and then get out one of those handy \"Choose Your Adventure\" books from being a kid and enjoy your probably more satisfying ending, although, I doubt you'll be able to couch it in the superior and worthy language of this ridiculously gifted master.By the way, wondered if maybe this was the book that Jimi was reading when he wrote \"Purple Haze,\" as I had always heard it was partially inspired by the sci-fi that Hendrix liked to read. Of course, I willingly applied this book to New Order's \"Blue Monday\" meanings also, probably to my detriment. Maybe, Barney, \"Purple Monday\" instead? I guess with Prince on the horizon that was a no go-- heh heh.","Most of the text of this fascinating novel involves the adventures of one man who is absolutely alone in the world. It is not everyone who can handle a novel with only one character, and this a character who of necessity must be insane. Shiel manages to deal with this very well. He mitigates the horror by having the millions of dead bodies fail to rot or stink. The ending is rather sentimental. It might have been more effective if Adam had not met his Eve.","I ordered an old paperback and was delighted to see it was in good condition. It was as described by mab1218 and the price was very good. I was especially pleased with the service of mab1218 because I received my order in a matter of days. So it was beyond my expectation and I am a satisfied customer.","Lovecraft mentioned this novel in his \"Supernatural Horror In Literature\" essay, and had good things to say about it. The novel deserves the good words. The first half, before our hero finds the inevitable woman to complete him, is really dark. A man alone, totally alone, with only corpses around him. I think that would send me \"over the edge\", too. Shiel captures the pathos of the situation well. Unlike Lovecraft, though, I like the \"romantic\" ending. At least the human race will not die out. This is well worth reading.","I call The Purple Cloud a fantastic fossil because that's what it is. That is not a criticism. I gave it 5 stars. It's simply that the fact it was written in 1911 shows -- both good and bad. Some of the science is off the wall, but I assume accurate for the day. The novel has a fantastic, hypnotic beginning set in the arctic. Like the jungle of Tarzan (written, I think, about the same time), this arctic landscape never existed, but it's a fantastic place of torment for the hero. Why is this book worth reading? The writing is hyptnotic. They don't write like that anymore. Dense, lush with an incredible poetic language, we follow the hero's solitary wanderings across an empty earth. This is a story of the last man on earth. This is a fossil, an archetype for all the later stories about the last man left alive on earth. A purple cloud came by and killed all while the hero was racing to the North Pole. What carries you along is the hero's interior as he undergoes one slow painful change within himself after another as he searches for another survivor, Does he find anyone? That's for the reader to learn. When you see the movies The Omega Man, The Quiet Earth, The Night of the Comet(this is a comedy) and all the other last man on earth movies, this was the great granddaddy of them all.","A cloud of gas that smells like peach blossom kills nearly every everyone in the world. Adam Jeffson is the only man left. He spends years looking for other people, wandering through the remains of civilization.One of the benefits of being the last man on Earth is that you would have the freedom to do whatever you want. The planet would be literally yours. Adam takes advantage of this. He becomes more and more eccentric, travelling around the world, burning cities to the ground. He wants to wipe out all trace of humanity, to make it look as if the human race had never existed. This could be put down to a symptom of Adam's growing madness - a madness caused by enforced solitude.The premise is a good one. &quot;The Purple Cloud&quot; sounds like an HG Wells novel in style. The language is a bit flowery, but I didn't mind that. (The book was published in the early 1900's after all.) When you read this book you travel around the world with Adam and find the same thing - emptyness, stillness, silence. How would you cope?In 1959 a film called &quot;The World, the Flesh and the Devil&quot; was released. It was supposedley based on &quot;The Purple Cloud&quot;, but it had nothing to do with MP Shiel's story.","No one has yet succeeded in reaching the North Pole, and a new British expedition is mounted. As our protagonist, Adam, returns from the arctic, all the humans and many of the animals he encounters are dead. Adam travels all over the world, looking for other living people and, understandably, going kind of bonkers.I wanted to like this book more. Early in the book, Adam finds himself in many morally challenging situations, but he has these voices in his head that more or less compel him to act in certain ways, so the reader is prevented from really entering into any moral struggles with him. I liked the writing, but each place Adam goes is essentially like the rest--everyone's dead--and I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. Near the end, something finally did, but then I mostly wanted to slap Adam around for being so dense.Maybe I'm just jaded from reading too many post-apocalyptic stories and that's why I'm not more enthusiastic about this book. If you're new to this sort of story, you might find this book to be a powerful exploration of loneliness and the meaning of human society and human life. A similar but much better post-apocalyptic novel is Cormac McCarthy's \"The Road.\"","This is the first and best science fiction book I read. I searched for another copy of it for 20 years until I found one on Amazon.com. I read it once again and loved it just as much as the first time. It takes you on a most fantastic voyage, never to be forgotten. Full of great adventure and excitement, I love this book!","This is the typical English disaster story in its earliest stages. Think John Wyndham, John Christopher, J.G.Ballard -- maybe the average English sf writer is a total loner and what he's really writing is wish-fulfillment!.... This book does have a quality all its own, vaguely reminiscent of William Hope Hodgson and I enjoy the old-fashioned textures. If you're at all interested in the origins of the genre, this would reward you on that score alone.","I got halfway through this book some six months ago and then just put it down for a while. Finally picked it back up and finished it today, and I must admit, for being an ancestor of the post-apocalyptic, last-man-on-earth genre, it carries some unique qualities.On the downside, this was just a difficult read, period. The prose was incredibly dense: sometimes an entire page was but one run-on sentence! No paragraph breaks, few semicolons, and even fewer commas. I tried to make an audio version of this book, and found I could not pitch the sentences properly, since I could not see their end!I'm quite practiced at reading, writing, and speaking, always at the head of my class even into the graduate level. That being said, this book almost *wasn't* English, not as modern-day Americans understand it, at least. I have a rather sizable vocabulary, but this was the first book to leave me hard-pressed to determine what he was talking about half the time:\"I paced between the oak pwes of the nave - massive stalls they are, separated by Corinthian pilasters ...some little angels with strangely human faces, Greuze-like, supporting the nerves of the apse\" and so on.Honestly, I'd swear he was making up the words half the time. Sentences ran far too long to keep the thread of things easily; I took to scanning over his florid descriptions but cautiously, for the most obscure little phrase within any block of text could trigger something that I would then be unable to understand.That being said, I really liked the book. Along with \"Earth Abides,\" these are the only two books that take their time looking at a world where man just... disappeared. Most post-apocalyptic stories talk about some war-ravaged earth, or one wherein civilization had been thousands of years ago. In stories like that, Earth might as well be Mars for the reader.Contrarily, \"The Purple Cloud\" and \"Earth Abides\" allow the reader to leisurely stroll through a world that, in one sense, looks exactly like always, yet in another, feels inverted, nightmarish in such ordinary alienness. An emptied - yet undamaged - world always feels far more gripping and interesting to me. In this, Shiel most certainly provides.Like I said, getting through his wording is like jogging in sand, and the guy he describes is pretty bizarre, wacked, and selfish, but I still find it a beautiful book, especially as the reader is slowly drawn from the lifelong nightmare of the protagonist's depravity into a beauty he'd never have guessed, let alone dared believe in.Definitely a must-read, a keeper, and a read-again.","make this book really worth reading. I find the descriptions of an empty world chilling, the familiarity with some of the places(in England) making the story at once believable yet terribly strange to me.

Adam Jeffson is that man, and this is his world.Back in 1901, when this was written, parts of the earth's surface remained unmapped, including the north pole. Jeffson is part of the expedition to reach that pole - as sole survivor, he finds it (an actual upright pole, it turns out), and struggles back to civilzation to claim his reward.

At first, he scours the globe in search of other survivors. After years of solitary confinement in the world-wide jail, his civilized spirit fails.

Adam gradually comes to the realization, after arriving back into warmer climes, that he is the sole survivor of the purple cloud. He now has unfettered freedom to do as he wishes without any restraint, but to what purpose?We follow Adam's attempt to cope in these circumstances as he experiences over a 20 year period alternating bouts of depression, euphoria, despair, megalomania, madness, and perhaps final redemption. He is now the master of the world, but alone, and he demonstrates his powers by torching all the world's great cities and undertaking other grandiose projects. All this is told in exacting detail.If an opportunity were to present itself he could be the \"new Adam\", starting a revitalized human race, but he recoils, not wanting to perpetuate what he believes is mankind's failings. Such an opportunity does present itself, however, and without ruining the ending, he faces the dilemma of balancing his principles against love (and lust). That aspect of the story adds some most needed dramatic action.The writing is representative of that era, with long sentences stuffed with dependent and independent clauses and numerous references to ancient historical figures and mythology. Also, get out your dictionary! I found it a bit of a slog to push through the middle part of the book after his initial searches for other survivors proved unsuccessful. After all, how hard is it to convince us that a person in that situation will go crazy?This book is recommended for sci-fi fans curious about an important historical rendering of the \"last man\" sub-genre and who are curious about an author who apparently was an influence on Stephen King.","I call The Purple Cloud a fantastic fossil because that's what it is. That is not a criticism. I gave it 5 stars. It's simply that the fact it was written in 1911 shows -- both good and bad. Some of the science is off the wall, but I assume accurate for the day. The novel has a fantastic, hypnotic beginning set in the arctic. Like the jungle of Tarzan (written, I think, about the same time), this arctic landscape never existed, but it's a fantastic place of torment for the hero. Why is this book worth reading? The writing is hyptnotic. They don't write like that anymore. Dense, lush with an incredible poetic language, we follow the hero's solitary wanderings across an empty earth. This is a story of the last man on earth. This is a fossil, an archetype for all the later stories about the last man left alive on earth. A purple cloud came by and killed all while the hero was racing to the North Pole. What carries you along is the hero's interior as he undergoes one slow painful change within himself after another as he searches for another survivor, Does he find anyone? That's for the reader to learn. When you see the movies The Omega Man, The Quiet Earth, The Night of the Comet(this is a comedy) and all the other last man on earth movies, this was the great granddaddy of them all.","A cloud of gas that smells like peach blossom kills nearly every everyone in the world. Adam Jeffson is the only man left. He spends years looking for other people, wandering through the remains of civilization.One of the benefits of being the last man on Earth is that you would have the freedom to do whatever you want. The planet would be literally yours. Adam takes advantage of this. He becomes more and more eccentric, travelling around the world, burning cities to the ground. He wants to wipe out all trace of humanity, to make it look as if the human race had never existed. This could be put down to a symptom of Adam's growing madness - a madness caused by enforced solitude.The premise is a good one. &quot;The Purple Cloud&quot; sounds like an HG Wells novel in style. The language is a bit flowery, but I didn't mind that. (The book was published in the early 1900's after all.) When you read this book you travel around the world with Adam and find the same thing - emptyness, stillness, silence. How would you cope?In 1959 a film called &quot;The World, the Flesh and the Devil&quot; was released. It was supposedley based on &quot;The Purple Cloud&quot;, but it had nothing to do with MP Shiel's story.","No one has yet succeeded in reaching the North Pole, and a new British expedition is mounted. As our protagonist, Adam, returns from the arctic, all the humans and many of the animals he encounters are dead. Adam travels all over the world, looking for other living people and, understandably, going kind of bonkers.I wanted to like this book more. Early in the book, Adam finds himself in many morally challenging situations, but he has these voices in his head that more or less compel him to act in certain ways, so the reader is prevented from really entering into any moral struggles with him. I liked the writing, but each place Adam goes is essentially like the rest--everyone's dead--and I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. Near the end, something finally did, but then I mostly wanted to slap Adam around for being so dense.Maybe I'm just jaded from reading too many post-apocalyptic stories and that's why I'm not more enthusiastic about this book. If you're new to this sort of story, you might find this book to be a powerful exploration of loneliness and the meaning of human society and human life. A similar but much better post-apocalyptic novel is Cormac McCarthy's \"The Road.\"","This is the first and best science fiction book I read. I searched for another copy of it for 20 years until I found one on Amazon.com. I read it once again and loved it just as much as the first time. It takes you on a most fantastic voyage, never to be forgotten. Full of great adventure and excitement, I love this book!","This is the typical English disaster story in its earliest stages. Think John Wyndham, John Christopher, J.G.Ballard -- maybe the average English sf writer is a total loner and what he's really writing is wish-fulfillment!.... This book does have a quality all its own, vaguely reminiscent of William Hope Hodgson and I enjoy the old-fashioned textures. If you're at all interested in the origins of the genre, this would reward you on that score alone.","I got halfway through this book some six months ago and then just put it down for a while. Finally picked it back up and finished it today, and I must admit, for being an ancestor of the post-apocalyptic, last-man-on-earth genre, it carries some unique qualities.On the downside, this was just a difficult read, period. The prose was incredibly dense: sometimes an entire page was but one run-on sentence! No paragraph breaks, few semicolons, and even fewer commas. I tried to make an audio version of this book, and found I could not pitch the sentences properly, since I could not see their end!I'm quite practiced at reading, writing, and speaking, always at the head of my class even into the graduate level. That being said, this book almost *wasn't* English, not as modern-day Americans understand it, at least. I have a rather sizable vocabulary, but this was the first book to leave me hard-pressed to determine what he was talking about half the time:\"I paced between the oak pwes of the nave - massive stalls they are, separated by Corinthian pilasters ...some little angels with strangely human faces, Greuze-like, supporting the nerves of the apse\" and so on.Honestly, I'd swear he was making up the words half the time. Sentences ran far too long to keep the thread of things easily; I took to scanning over his florid descriptions but cautiously, for the most obscure little phrase within any block of text could trigger something that I would then be unable to understand.That being said, I really liked the book. Along with \"Earth Abides,\" these are the only two books that take their time looking at a world where man just... disappeared. Most post-apocalyptic stories talk about some war-ravaged earth, or one wherein civilization had been thousands of years ago. In stories like that, Earth might as well be Mars for the reader.Contrarily, \"The Purple Cloud\" and \"Earth Abides\" allow the reader to leisurely stroll through a world that, in one sense, looks exactly like always, yet in another, feels inverted, nightmarish in such ordinary alienness. An emptied - yet undamaged - world always feels far more gripping and interesting to me. In this, Shiel most certainly provides.Like I said, getting through his wording is like jogging in sand, and the guy he describes is pretty bizarre, wacked, and selfish, but I still find it a beautiful book, especially as the reader is slowly drawn from the lifelong nightmare of the protagonist's depravity into a beauty he'd never have guessed, let alone dared believe in.Definitely a must-read, a keeper, and a read-again.","make this book really worth reading.

In addition, it is great fun to read.The plot is segmented into three distinct parts:*The first part covers an expedition to reach the North Pole, a feat which had not been accomplished at the time the novel was written. It climaxes with only one man, Adam Jeffson, left alive.*The second part follows Adam as he makes his way back to habitation, only to discover that a mysterious purple cloud has covered the rest of the earth, seemingly leaving him as the only human alive. Slowly sinking into dark madness, he unleashes his own destruction, burning the great cities.*The last segment cannot be discussed without becoming something of a spoiler. Suffice it to say, it includes Adam's return to sanity and to belief in the future of the earth.The pre-apocalypse first section is actually the most suspenseful and well written, conveying in frenzied language the mystery and actual horror aroused by the frozen Pole region. Of his race toward the Pole, Adam relates, \"...I sped, I spun, with grinning teeth that chattered and gibbered, and eyeballs of distraction: for a Fear, too--most cold and dreadful--had its hand of ice upon my heart....\"The second section unfortunately drags somewhat as Adam relates with numbing detail of his search of town after town and of underground caves and mines for survivors. Only when Adam begins his frenzy of burning does the narrative again come alive, as he watches the burning of London while smoking opium, drinking wine, and playing the harp.The last section features an entirely different tone, as Adam progresses toward reason and hope. Although the story line is more than a bit illogical (if that can even be said of this kind of novel), the ending is very satisfactory.This novel cannot be judged by modern standards, certainly, but it can be judged as a product of its time. Those who appreciate H. G. Wells, H. P. Lovecraft, H. Rider Haggard, and others in this vein will really appreciate this \"forgotten classic.\"","Started out pretty interesting. Middle was a little drawn out. Ending was a head scratcher. I was looking for a interesting ending to make up for the slow middle and,,,,,nothing.Keep in mind that this was written at the turn of the century so wording and writing style are consistent with that time and takes some getting used to,","After reading the reviews on this book, and learning what the plot was about, I was excited to give this book a try.Unfortunately, I really got bogged down in the details as the author describes the main character's journey to London. He could have tidied that part up a bit, perhaps shortening it dramatically to give the story the opportunity to breathe. Instead, it became such a chore to slog through each page that I finally just gave up.Disappointed...should have been a much better book.","Early on, this story impressed me. Well written, good story line, good syntax, minimal expletives,courageous main character--all features of a good read. When the protagonist and the reader realize that he (we) are it, the last guy, the Lone Ranger, the only chip left in the bag--then it falls apart. He begins to dither. The author starts writing the same thing in different ways. It's like he had to fill his quota of words for the book. Other reviewers describe him as going crazy, but I think he just went boring. Anyone can write bad stuff (like this review?) but I was expecting better.","I had trouble with this book at first. If it were printed today, it would be a very fat book. It's printed with a tiny font [most editions] and written in very formal English. It reminded me of Jules Verne. It should be on every science fiction fans list of read books.The story is basically post-apocalyptic, with spiritual undertones. No zombies or roving bands of starving people, more psychological. The main character is tormented, inventive, destructive - engaging.","Like many a reviewer above, I found this book to be totally word-tasty and directly emotional. I described it to a friend as \"virtuosity in the service of SOMETHING TO SAY.\" I hadn't finished the book at that point, so, maybe I'm just one of those people who got to the end and just went, \"really, is that all?\" I like to think of this as \"Lost before Lost.\" That might be kinda cheapening the talent that is gushing from this novel, but the two do share a few things.Without spoiling it for you if you haven't read it, the writer introduces rather a few exciting mysteries and possibilities and just lets them hang and die \"back on page 33\" or whatever/wherever that I found most depressing, unsatisfying and kind of lazy. Anyway, in between you get some of the most intelligent, informed and yet absolute stream-of-consciousness writing I've parsed in my years. And although I share THE OBSERVATION that most \"creative writing teachers\" would bitch about his \"run-on sentences,\" I could not put the book down sometimes-- as it kept me plugging away at the poetic, juicy verbage and stayed with my mind as though -I_ was the one thinking these thoughts. Am I nearly as intelligent as the character/writer=== heavens no, but did that matter=== most certainly not. Although Sheil's passion to tell and describe can get dense and close to entangled, for me anyway-- he never lost my interest or connection with the character and his mindset, despite there being more than a few topics discussed that I am not well-versed in or possess the vocabulary to quite grapple with (bedside companion every tenth page for this novel: a dictionary, and, if you're really committed, have internet accessibility for some of the geographic, literary and historical musings).Anyway, worth reading--- resounding YES. Disappointment--- ditto. Maybe, like one reviewer said, it was 1901, and he was writing for an audience of sorts, so, I dunno... Anyway, pick it up. Read the \"virtuosity in the service of SOMETHING TO SAY\" for the first 170 pages or so, and then get out one of those handy \"Choose Your Adventure\" books from being a kid and enjoy your probably more satisfying ending, although, I doubt you'll be able to couch it in the superior and worthy language of this ridiculously gifted master.By the way, wondered if maybe this was the book that Jimi was reading when he wrote \"Purple Haze,\" as I had always heard it was partially inspired by the sci-fi that Hendrix liked to read. Of course, I willingly applied this book to New Order's \"Blue Monday\" meanings also, probably to my detriment. Maybe, Barney, \"Purple Monday\" instead? I guess with Prince on the horizon that was a no go-- heh heh.","Most of the text of this fascinating novel involves the adventures of one man who is absolutely alone in the world. It is not everyone who can handle a novel with only one character, and this a character who of necessity must be insane. Shiel manages to deal with this very well. He mitigates the horror by having the millions of dead bodies fail to rot or stink. The ending is rather sentimental. It might have been more effective if Adam had not met his Eve.","I ordered an old paperback and was delighted to see it was in good condition. It was as described by mab1218 and the price was very good. I was especially pleased with the service of mab1218 because I received my order in a matter of days. So it was beyond my expectation and I am a satisfied customer.","Lovecraft mentioned this novel in his \"Supernatural Horror In Literature\" essay, and had good things to say about it. The novel deserves the good words. The first half, before our hero finds the inevitable woman to complete him, is really dark. A man alone, totally alone, with only corpses around him. I think that would send me \"over the edge\", too. Shiel captures the pathos of the situation well. Unlike Lovecraft, though, I like the \"romantic\" ending. At least the human race will not die out. This is well worth reading."],

      "reviews.text":["Kamandi was a unique book in a number of ways. It was one of the first projects, along with the New Gods, that Jack \"The King\" Kirby worked on after leaving Marvel for DC in the early 1970's. The days of artists bullpens of the 60's and 70's are pretty well gone today by work-for-hire freelancers and comic writers and artists work for a number of different companies. But back then, Kirby leaving Marvel where he been working since the Golden Age was huge news. It would have been like Mickey Mantle going to the Red Sox. While Kamandi does not reflect Kirby at his very best, it may be his last GREAT work. This Archive edition collects the first ten issues of the Kamandi series.Kirby was given free reign on the book as writer, penciller and editor with Mike Royer handling the inks and letters. Kamandi, Last Boy on Earth, is a wild and adventurous look at a post apocalyptic, near future Earth where a great disaster has all but wiped out the race of men and in their place, talking, intelligent animal races now rule the world. Tigers, Lions, Dogs, Rats, Gorillas, and more now hold sway and the surviving men are basically kept as slaves and though of as animals. The story is heavily influenced by the Planet of the Apes films which were enormously popular at the time but also by other films such as \"The Omega Man\". Kamandi was raised in an underground complex by his grandfather. The complex was named Command \"D\" hence the name \"Kamandi\". When his grandfather is killed, Kamandi finds himself alone and on the run in this strange world of intelligent beasts.He will eventually befriend a tiger prince named Tuftan, aiding the tigers in their war with the gorillas, much to the disapproval of Tuftan's father Caesar, ruler of the Tigers. Kamandi does eventually meet more humans including Ben Boxer. Boxer, in his old style Apollo era space suit looks uncannily like a certain other character named Ben...one Ben Grimm of the Fantastic Four. Boxer and his companions have been exposed to radiation which allows them to undergo a nuclear fission reaction that transforms their bodies making them hard as steel and invulnerable. Once again the theme of radiation causing mutations becomes a central theme. Kamandi joins with boxer and his friends as they make use of the existing old technology of man such as mini subs and air ships.These first ten issues follow Kamandi through one turbulent adventure after another as he finds himself constantly in the wrong place at the wrong time, captured and then having to escape. The beasts of this new world take on the personalities that we commonly associate with them. Lions are noble and good and actually help Kamandi while the rats are devious and attack the weak in packs. The variety of stories that Kirby writes makes these tales all a bit different. There's a wonderful spoof of King King when a giant ape named \"Tiny\" escapes his captors. In another scene, Kamandi is seen reading a copy of \"The Demon\" another 1970's Kirby title and boasting about these \"old comic magazines\". A not so subtle plug but Kirby's certainly earned the right if anyone has.Kirby's art still is solid and I think some of his very best work of the 1970's. Jack's action was dynamic and there are some truly memorable covers and pages in this collection. True, Kamandi does look a little bit like a young Thor with his long, blond wavy hair and square jaw but if you're going to draw on earlier work why not draw on perhaps his very best work of the 1960's. Mike Royer does a great job with the inks doing his best Joe Sinnott imitation. He lets Kirby be Kirby without trying to embellish his own style or diminish Jack's pencils the way a Vinnie Colletta often did.Kamandi was a vastly underrated book back in the 1970's when people didn't pay much attention to a book if it wasn't a super hero or horror theme. Many thanks to DC Comics for giving this title the Archive edition it deserves and preserving the work of the great Jack Kirby.Reviewed by Tim Janson","I started reading comics toward the end of Jack Kirby's career, so I never really had an opportunity to read his mid-70's DC work. I kind of had my doubts about this one, but I decided to give it try. I've gotta say I really loved it. The stories were just bustling with energy and I was riveted by the storytelling. So much so that I read this over a 2 day period. My one early complaint would be how close the first issue is an homage to the Planet of the Apes movie, but things branch out from there. This was a lot of fun and I'm anxiously awaiting #2.","Time and again, Jack Kirby created characters and premises that have gone on to inspire multiple generations of comic book readers. Though Kamandi certainly doesn't rank as one of his best remembered efforts, I truly believe it was his greatest work. Though it contains all of the trademark Kirby touches that one should expect (fantastic layouts, dynamic action, awe-inspiring splash pages, and a strong sci-fi premise) this story of the last surviving boy making his away across a post-apocalyptic American landscape dominated by evolved animals goes so much farther.In every issue, Kamandi ventures into a new area, discovering amazing villains and support characters, unforgettable settings, and bewildering cultures, technologies, and back stories. And yet, every issue, both Kamandi and Kirby move on, leaving behind amazingly rich content that could easily have formed its own hit series, in pursuit of a new city with new potentials for amazing adventure.That's the true wonder of Kamandi. In every issue, the story and setting are so dramatically different from the previous one, whether containing a race of Grecko-Roman inspired tigers, a 1920s Al Capone Chicago run by robots, an enormous department store that sells people, a futuristic outpost of humans representing man's next evolutionary step, or an ape cult that worships the fallen Superman, Kirby keeps producing amazing premises that dazzle the mind while his art works to dazzle the eyes.In the end, whereas efforts like The Fourth World, The Eternals, and even Kirby's classic Golden and Silver Age works began with one fascinating premise and took it until it wore thin, Kamandi's is a premise that forces Jack to keep introducing new premises, literally each issue, and this continually works well for at least the first twenty stories. In a sense, Kamandi is the ultimate Kirby work, the recipient of the lion's share of his creative energies, because it truly is 30+ Jack Kirby premises, each given one to two issues, and each featuring a boy named Kamandi.","In the interest of full disclosure, I'm not only a big Jack Kirby fan but an itinerant comic book writer who's probably learned more about telling a story with pictures by reading Jack Kirby than every other creator I've followed combined.My memories of Kamandi were muddy. I was finishing up on the Fourth World Omnibuses and picked this up out of a combination of curiosity and a desire for another Kirby fix.I read the series when it first came out in the Seventies and recall I was pretty lukewarm about it. Too Planet of the Apes-y, not Super-Hero-y enough. It was just okay.So imagine my surprise when I picked up this volume and was completely blown away!If the conceptual underpinnings of this series aren't quite on a par with the Fourth World the execution and storytelling is. In fact, in many ways the individual tales are often superior, with tighter focus, since the series isn't winding its way along through four separate books.It's rollicking good adventure with interesting characters aplenty, occasionally seasoned with a bit of deeper meaning.The art is simply fabulous, with inker Mike Royer obviously more comfortable and acclimated to working with Jack. Though his earlier work with Jack was a bit touch and go here he operates on a level close to Joe Sinnott, high praise indeed as he remains my very favorite Kirby inker.Any Kirby fan who sort of turns his nose up at Jack's post Fourth World work (and you know who you are) should reconsider and pick up this volume.","When I was a youngster back in the 70's, the Planet of the Apes movies were hugely popular, and I was a major part of that popularity.Then came Jack Kirby's first issue of Kanandi: The Last Boy on Earth.I was instantly sold. The cover art was astounding and new. The storyline took the Planet of the Apes concept, and went further by having ALL animals becoming intelligent and walking on two legs. Lions, tigers, bears - oh my!This was my first introduction of Jack Kirby's writing and awesome artwork. His artwork is so very different and eyecatching, that you can always instantly tell his artwork from all the others. I still have most of the entire Kamandi series.This would be a gigantic Hollywood hit if they turned this into a movie. And it would ambitious and intelligent if someone were to make it. With the success of all the Planet of the Apes movies, taking it further with Kamandi would be a brilliant move by any filmmaker.But that's probably why it will never see the silver screen.But if you've never read or seen these classic comics - then do yourself a huge favor and delve into the bizzarre and action-filled Kamandi comics.","I wanted this edition because another one out there was reviewed as having inferior paper and cardboard.As I hoped, this one is has glossy paper, good hardcover binding and nice color reproduction. Hope that helps.Cool story and art, but I admit I am a biased fan of Kirby. To the uninitiated YMMV.","-------------------------------------------------------------\"Kamandi Archives, Volume 1\"(DC Archive Editions)-------------------------------------------------------------I originally read these stories when they came out as single comics in the '70s and even at the time I was conscious of the book's seemingly slipshod construction, with the same scrappy artwork and haphazard scripts as many Kirby titles of the same era.However, looking back decades later I find these stories to be dynamic, lighthearted and fun - a really great read! I doubt I would revisit Kirby's \"Devil Dinosaur\" or his 1970's stint on \"Captain America,\" but \"Kamandi,\" \"Forever People\" and \"The Demon\" hold up pretty well over time. These are propulsive, fast-moving stories, goofy but captivating - one thing for sure: you can always tell what's happening in a Kirby story! Plus the printing quality is top-quality, well produced and made to last. Now I gotta get Volume Two! (DJ Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's book reviews)","I do not own this particular volume, and I was debating purchasing it. I LOVE Kamandi, and up until a few years ago only had 10 or so issues of the entire run. A few years back I decided to go and get the missing back issues. This I was able to accomplish quite quickly. (It took two days at a major Comic Book Convention). I was able to complete my run on most of the missing issues for $1 to $2 a piece. I don't think I spent more than $10 for any given issue, even the earlier ones. I WAS LUCKY! Prices have since shot up for back issues of this book, so grab it here while you can!This is GREAT Kirby stuff, and I LOVE the \"Planet of the Apes Post-Apocalyptic\" flavor. I still might buy it, just to keep my originals in good condition."],

The main characters in the book are Sander and Fanyi. Sander is a young blacksmith`s apprentice, who is set to inherit his father`s position as Master Blacksmith. At the time of his father`s death, Sander`s uncle, Ibbert, who is also a blacksmith, denies him his rightful position as Master Blacksmith and assumes the role for himself.Sander will not accept his uncle`s decision, and leaves his nomadic tribe that dwells in the plains of the west. Sander set out to the east lands by the sea,in search of forgotten technology. To have knowledge of metal forging from the past would surely give Sander the power to overtake his uncle`s role as Master Blacksmith. On Sander`s way to the east, he teams up with a woman named Fanyi, who is a cross between Zena`s Linda Lawless and the talk show host Lezza. Fanyi not only has beauty and brawn, but also brains and finesse. I enjoyed reading this book, with adventure around every corner and a verity of mutant creatures. The reading is easy, and the author does not insist on technical terms that would have you reaching for your dictionary after each turn of the page. I would recommend this book to young readers or adults who get bored with lengthy, hard-to-read novels. Our characters end up finding more than what they seek. The way they find their sought knowledge is unexpected and exciting.Andre Norton is a exciting science fiction writer, with a down-to-earth technique that does not play on vulgar expressions to entice his reader. The cover page illustration does not do the book justice.I believe my daugther would have done a better drawing with a box of crayons and construction paper.

      "reviews.text":["UNPLUGGED has been billed as an anti-novel and believe me it delivers. Sure you've read plenty of books with anti-heroes but how about anti-villains of the polite and genteel variety? UNPLUGGED is an ambitious novel, dense with layers of meaning and rife with irony. Sakowski has a gift for illustrating the absurd.Follow our \"hero\", The Man, as he makes his way through countless ridiculous and chilling situations. Picture a kingdom of marionettes ruled by an Emperor, a penguin of course. Meet half-crazed citizens clutching their most prized possessions close to them, their misfortunes. Sounds a bit like your average cocktail party in the modern day.Stylistically UNPLUGGED is like an amputating scalpel under operating theater lights. Razor sharp and clinical, Sakowski's words cut to the heart of the matter while casting glittering reflections on countless topics. The combination of stripped bare prose with complex images and ideas creates a dizzying effect which makes you wonder how such a slim volume can contain so much. Put this one down on your reading list, twice.","After discovering Eraserhead Press through reading a book by Carlton Mellick III that a friend leant to me I decided to check out what else they have published and bought this book. In the description, this book says that it is post-modern but I wasn't exactly sure what that meant in relation to literature so I looked it up on wikipedia. One of the definitions described postmodernism as:\"A culturally pluralistic and profoundly interconnected global society lacking any single dominant center of political power, communication, or intellectual production.\"Which I think really sums up the setting of this book. First of all, the main character has no name, he's known only as \"The man\". In fact, none of the other characters have names either. At first this was a little off putting, but after a couple of chapters the allegorical purpose became more clear. This story is interesting and funny. Set in an extremely surreal landscape with anthropomorphic appliances and personified animals every object, plant, and action seems to have a deeper meaning. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in art films or offbeat literature.","Just to get this out of the way right now: I am in love with Vincent Sakowski's SOME THINGS ARE BETTER LEFT UNPLUGGED. I love the chopped, methodical pace of the text; I love the bizarre characters; I love that this relates to Donihe's SHALL WE GATHER AT THE GARDEN?; I love the anti-hero, mythological, hard-to-pin-down, WAITING FOR GODOT-like story.After reading other reviews of this work, it's easy to understand why so many people either just don't like it or just find it \"so-so\". Yes, the structure is unusual. Yes, there is no definable plot. Yes, there is little to no character development. Based upon reviews, I would have never picked up and read this book. So, what exactly is there that draws me to this text? Sakowski brings it like Beckett and allows me to sit and think and make up my own interpretation.This book, like Donihe's works, allows the reader to partake in an epic quest. (I swear that the spirit of Joseph Campbell is haunting me). The result of this quest is based upon the reader's overall interpretation and application of what may or may not be metaphor. This book can serve as a catalyst for conversation and debate. That is something that gives this book energy and power. Love it or hate it, I took away magic from this text, something special and unique to me. I am drawn in by the author's image-weaving and near-purposelessness; I am drawn in by the author's blatant mockery of materialism and ruthless selfishness, of our culture and our inherent inhumanity; I am drawn in by the author's hilarious ending.In short, SOME THINGS ARE BETTER LEFT UNPLUGGED rocks my brain-meat.","I read somewhere that this novella was a sort of \"anti-novel,\" and if not liking it makes it an anti-novel this one wins. I wasn't that big of a fan of this authors style, Sakowski not only seems to leave a lot of stuff out but the plot didn't fully bloom either. Maybe that is what \"anti-novel\" means.\"Some Things Are Better Left Unplugged\" is surreal if anything. Sakowski carefully keeps the reader at arms length, employing choppy sentences, bad grammar, and fragments, describing its scenery with awkward detachment, and avoiding character names in favor of descriptions like \"the man,\" \"the prophet,\" and \"the obese tabby,\" all of which kept me thinking, is the writer trying too hard to make this feel like Noir? Is this what \"anti-novel\" means? Am I just not getting this? Am I in the wrong here? Noir isn't \"anti-novel\" right?I could tell the author knew his characters, at least I got that much; however, I did not, and that left me feeling jilted. I never felt like I had any sort of real grasp of who any character was. I do not enjoy when I have to mentally work harder then the author to get the details of the plot and characters within my own imagination. It was flat read which left me saying, \"blah.\" I don't think this novella was well planned or thought, that it left a lot of the meat of it out. Wouldn't recommend it.","An allegorical tale, the story satirizes many of our everyday obsessions, including: the pursuit of wealth and materialism; the thirst for empty spectacles and violence; and climbing whatever social, political, or economical ladder is before usI expected a little more from this book, still give 4 stars, because it keeps you reading.","A wonderful book. I always relate to insane homeless women so I was delighted this had one in it.","The last review for this book should be ignored! I wasn't going to buy this book originally just because I read the last review. Thank God I changed my mind! After LOVING several books released through Eraserhead Press, I decided to take my chances with Some Things Are Better Left Unplugged despite the bad review. I have to wonder if the last reviewer even read the book at all. He calls it \"just dumb.\" How can this be dumb? You might not understand all of it, but that doesn't mean it's dumb. It is one of the more intelligent books out there. It is very odd and deliciously imaginative, but as literate as Kafka. It's like Lovecraft re-imagined by Terry Gilliam. I bet the other reviewer was just expecting something like Fight Club. Yeah, Fight Club is different and a great read but really not all that weird. This book is utterly outlandish. I'm not going to get into the plot but it starts out strange and just gets stranger. This is the only book by Sakowski I've been able to find but I hope there will be more available in the future.","I dunno, the story was definitely \"weird\" and that's what was promised. As for storytelling itself though, I felt the author left too much out. I could tell the author knew his characters. Unfortunately I did not; I was left hanging when, after completing the first read-through, there was no ultimate delivery. I never felt like I had any sort of real grasp of any character. While I do not mind this while reading (for example, Catch-22 is a great book for re-reading as I learn the characters more completely each time), I do appreciate more detail into the characterizations. I may be beating around the bush here... While I enjoy books that make me an active part of the story (Palahniuk, for example, requiring an active participant in the audience), I do not enjoy when I have to do 50% or more of the detail within my own imagination. This book did not fulfill my needs in supplementing the plot. It was flat and, to be honest, boring.","I have been having a hard time finding good books to read. With all my favorite authors being dead, I really thought I would never be able to relate to modern fiction. But along came Mellick and his Bizarro book genre and Eraserhead press. \"Some Things Are Better Left Unplugged\" is a fine example of what modern writing should be and I thank Satan it exists for everyone to see!Sakowski has a very unique and powerful voice, not to mention an amazing imagination. This book had a very surreal quality that reminds me of dreaming or hallucinating. Not many people are able to properly evoke such feeling through words but Vincent W. does it!I sadly lost this book on the train and need to repurchase it. It's a very well written book that belongs in my library next to my Lewis Carroll books and Chuck Palahniuk collection.","Many of the great stories that humans share with each other feature two entities in opposition to each other. Sometimes these entities are emotionless nations, sometimes equally indifferent businesses. The best of these, the tales that really draw you into their world, feature two people or people-like beings. Some Things Are Better Left Unplugged is one of these stories.The Man and the Obese Tabby are nemesises, but their struggle is not one of swords, sorcery, or other fantastic methods. No, theirs is a battle of words, a fight of gentlemanly means. Both seek the power of the Prize, a formless and unseen concept that drives both beings for dominance of their surreal world.There are no armies, there are no guns. The battles fought are for personal discovery, the spoils are knowledge. There is a climactic battle, but one unlike anyone has ever portrayed in fiction.Bizarro has been compared to the pulps of years gone by, fun and quirky but having little in the way of literary merit. Mr. Sakowski has managed to transcend this idea with this novel, and created what many academics might argue contains the marks of truly classic literature. Timeless in setting, themes, and plot devices while containing universally understandable and memorable characters.Some Things Are Better Left Unplugged is a new modern myth, a tale deserving of careful scrutiny and study. Don't be surprised if this book becomes required reading for contemporary literature courses in the coming years. But don't be scared by its literary merit. Like all Bizarro, this tale is above all FUN!","I loved it. One of the weirdest novels I've ever read. Sakowski picks apart everything we are taught to believe and reveals the silliness of it all. Through a surreal lenses he catalogues everything that is entailed in being human. He goes against the modern novel format and creates an evocative anti-novel. I'm going to seek out everything he wrote.","Take a journey into a surreal fantasy world like that of Alice's Wonderland, only this one could never be turned into a Disney film no matter how many songs are put into it. This is a dark, harsh realm where logic is left outside the manhole and the irrational is king cat. Check it out.","Haha this is in response to Razorgirl on our little thread about Grape City. Ultimately, Grape City was flat and left me unaffected. Conversely, Some Things Better Left Unplugged was fantastic. From the flawlessly eerie introduction all the way through our main character's journey, STBLU delivers an absurd yet meaningful story.Rich details and a masterful use of language are evidence of Sakowski's superior writing. Talking at all about events in the story would be a waste because to read STBLU is to take part in the experience, and at 150 pages, it's a must-read for fans of alternative genres.P.S. I HIGHLY recommend Click by Kristopher Young. It is rare to find a work of this uniqueness and caliber. Read Click and savor the real art of madness.","Awful. Save your money. Honestly THE WORST book I've ever had the misfortune to trust amazon-ians to talk me into reading! I couldn't tell you what that books about and I just finished it. There was no plot to the story; no purpose behind any activity the \"characters\" went thru; even the bizarre happenings were left unexplained and contained no metaphors. Basically it's just ramblings with the same people popping up again and again. I was hoping for surrealism with a good story behind it. If that's what you're looking for too, look away from here. These reviewers who love this book must be VERY easily amused... or just like the breasts on the cover. P.S. - There aren't even naked womyn in the book... nor nurses. It's a simple marketing ploy for simple minds. So is the book."],

Great reading. duellist@interserv.co","I read many SF books, many of these involve a post-apocalyptic earth. None of these books has kept me as enthralled as the Amtrak Wars series has. Patrick Tilley gives such depth and detail to his characters and locations that you find yourself rooting for Steve Brickman and his mute friends as they face the might of the Federation. I would definitely recommend this and the other books but only if you have a lot of free time on your hands because I guarantee that you will not be able to put it down and, when you have finnished it, you will want to start all over again (I did). Five stars.","Steven Roosevelt Brickman returns to the Amtrak Federation after five months of captivity by the Mutes. He thinks he will be a hero - a brave survivor bringing back valuable intelligence that the Mutes are a lot smarter and have a lot more resources than is believed. Instead, he is stripped of everything and consigned to the A-levels to work out his life as the lowest of the low, maintaining the environmental systems the allow the underground Federation to function. And then he is offered a way out, plus a return to the overground. Steve's loyalties are about to be put under even more pressure than before . . .\"First Family\" is as good as \"Cloud Warrior\", though it feels more claustrophobic. That's no surprise, though, as that's exactly how Steve is feeling himself as he re-enters his old life. There's perhaps a little less action, but action is not really the point of this book. Despite the importance of the plot, \"First Family\" is a scene-setter: from it, we learn a lot more about the Mutes and the Amtrak Federation, and especially the manipulations that have affected Steve's life since birth. The First Family - whom we actually meet - view him as a tiny cog in a very large machine, theirs to use at will. Whether he proves to be valuable or dangerous, they'll use him as much as possible. And Steve is still too naive to realise exactly what his situation is.\"First Family\" also sets up the action for the coming books. Roz and Jodi are reintroduced, and we meet two other Trackers who will be very important later, Kelso and Malone. And Steve accepts a dangerous mission from Mr Snow which is played out in the third book, \"Iron-Master\".It's sad and frustrating to see how Steve is manipulated by those around him, despite his cleverness. But he is determined to find the truth and run his own life, and that has just as much impact on the plot as those manipulations.The setting and plot of \"First Family\" are as intriguing as as those of \"Cloud-Warrior\". Just try to ignore the nastiness of the relationship between Steve and Roz.","If you are keen on exploring the tyrannical potential of high technology, you can't do worst than to start here. This is '1984' updated into the info-tech age, makes Winston Smith's life in Airstrip One seem like a totally relaxed seaside holiday in Blackpool! The definitive word in hi-tech dystopia novel, it ranks way up there with 'Brave New World', 'THX 1138', 'The Glass Tower', etc. It is also 1 of the all-time best post-Apocalyptic sci-fi thrillers ever written, IMHO. Cross Adolf Hitler with Bill Gates and Dale Carnegie, stir in Ph.D's for social-psychology and electronic engineering , and you get the 'First Family' of the book's title. A must-read!!! Anyone who knows Patrick's email address pls pls pls contact me - I've been wanting to compliment him personally for a long-while now!","The graphic detail of the book and its plot are nothing short of resplendant. This series is story telling at its best. I believe that I will have a hard time finding another book, series or author, that will come come close to this one. The ending did come as a bit of a shock though. Come on Patrick where's book 7.","A series well worth the late nights spent reading. Where is book seven? On the grapevine a dispute between Tilley and the publisher, regarding movie rights? Does anyone know the truth? Still six of best in anyones language.","Having read all 6 books a couple of times it is still hard to put them down. The detailed description of surroundings and events made me feel like being part of this fantastic adventure. What a tremendous gift to be able to write books like that.

Atlantis was an exit strategy for the corporate elite, a place where the world's Movers and Shakers had hidden from the doomsday microbe ßehemoth--and from the hordes of the moved and the shaken left behind. For five years \"rifters\" and \"corpses\" have lived in a state of uneasy truce, united by fear of the outside world. But now that world closes in. An unknown enemy hunts them through the crushing darkness of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. ßehemoth--twisted, mutated, more virulent than ever--has found them already. The fragile armistice between the rifters and their one-time masters has exploded into all-out war, and not even the legendary Lenie Clarke can take back the body count. Billions have died since she loosed ßehemoth upon the world. Billions more are bound to. The whole biosphere came apart at the seams while Lenie Clarke hid at the bottom of the sea and did nothing. But now there is no place left to hide. The consequences of past acts reach inexorably to the very floor of the world, and Lenie Clarke must return to confront the mess she made. Redemption doesn't come easy with the blood of a world on your hands. But even after five years in pitch-black purgatory, Lenie Clarke is still Lenie Clarke. There will be consequences for anyone who gets in her way-and worse ones, perhaps, if she succeeds... Behemoth: Seppuku concludes the final act (begun in ßehemoth: ß-Max) of Peter Watts's chilling and powerful Rifters series.

      "reviews.text":["First off, for those of you haven't already read \"Behemoth: B-Max\" (at least) you will definitely want to do so before tackling \"Behemoth: Seppuku\". For reasons that the author explains in the first volume, they constitute one book that was split into two due to pressures in the publishing issue. This novel does not stand alone, and will make no sense without reading the previous volume. Furthermore, there are two other volumes in the series \"Starfish\" and \"Maelstrom\" and while each entry stands on its own fairly well, reading the books in order would definitely be the approach I would recommend.For those of you who are new to the series, here is a brief synopsis that should tell you whether or not these books are for you. Essentially, the story arc is about evolution: human, animal and electronic. By mixing a blend of biology, computer science and chaos theory, author Peter Watts has created a near future Earth where man is simultaneously at the height of his powers and walking the knife's edge of total ecological failure. In an effort to maintain the high standard of Western living mankind has turned to deep sea geothermal power to meet their energy needs. Miles below the ocean, specially engineered humans culled from the dregs of society maintain these power plants. However, what no one could have expected was that they would encounter an organism that would unleash an apocalypse. Part hard science-fiction, part post-apocalyptic, the first two books represent a genuinely original voice in the genre.For those of you who have been eagerly awaiting \"Seppuku\" rest assured the ending is eminently satisfying. Given the two volume approach, it is difficult to offer much in the way of plot details without providing spoilers, but I can say that after the somewhat broader focus of \"Maelstrom\" and \"B-Max\" the story has gone full circle and boiled back down to the most perverse trinity of characters one is likely to find: Lenie Clarke, Ken Lubin and Achilles Desjardins. As the three engage in a power-play in which no one's motivations are clear and the fate of the world hangs in the balance, action takes precedence over thought, to sometimes disastrous effect. Nonetheless, the science and technology which has so defined this series is on ample display and is as prescient as ever.Of particular note, I found the conclusion to be perfectly enigmatic. This is post-apocalyptic fiction, and a happy ending would have been wildly out of place, but Watts' conclusion recognizes this without being entirely bleak. In this regard, his novel owes more to \"Alas, Babylon\" with it's open ended conclusion, than the superb, but utterly fatalistic \"On the Beach\".To say more would risk huge spoilers, so suffice it to say \"Sepukku\" is every bit the conclusion I was hoping for. Watts has combined hard science fiction and post-apocalyptic fiction and taken both in new and exciting directions. If you're a fan of the series, you'll be glad at the way it ends; if you're intrigued by this review, grab \"Starfish\" and start from the beginning.Jake Mohlman","Unlike his excellent debut, Starfish and its first sequel, Maelstrom, this conclusion is a disappointing creative misstep on the part of its author. The chief problem with BEHEMOTH: SEPPUKU is that in spite of setting up Lenie Clarke as the heroine of the story, Clarke herself is entirely passive throughout the book, making no real decisions or actions on her own, being led by her sociopathic-but-honourable comrade Ken Lubin. She never achieves any great insight and becomes a bit player in the story.This book feels as if the author had become so preoccupied with his Hard Science Fiction ruminations that he had forgotten that his characters had been complex, dimensional characters in the previous books, and were now merely cartoonish chess pieces wandering through a thin narrative. There are also the deeply disturbing scenes in which the villain rapes and mutilates a sympathetic supporting character that eventually feel like a gratuitous exercise in writing snuff porn with a Science discussion interweaved in them, especially when that subplot no longer links up with the main story and never reaches any real resolution.The first two books in this series brilliantly married the Science with the complexity and pain of its damaged characters, but this book has degenerated into a dystopian cartoon that feels too much like a wallow in the [...] of sexual sadism and social pessimism. There have been brilliant dystopian Science Fiction novels in that past that earned their pessimism, like John Brunner's THE SHEEP LOOK UP. Alas, BEHEMOTH: SEPPUKU does not belong in that league.","An anaerobic microbe from the deep sea may have delivered the coup de grace to an already struggling mid-21st century world.It makes more sense to me to review the whole series when it's one story -- so here goes.I was very surprised to find that the mass market editions of these books are out of print -- even as the final hardcover has only just been released. I can't understand why this series wouldn't get more support, because in my opinion it has everything that successful science fiction needs. Watts incorporates big, shiny ideas -- and the deep-sea biology is a wonderful original touch. The books include a high level of action and tension and, pleasantly unusually for \"idea\" SF, are strongly character-driven. And the characters are tormented enough for anyone.There are flaws. At times, the plot is unclear, and while I like the pivotal role played by ignorance and misunderstanding, at times an irritating back-and-forth plot dynamic (Seppuku is a cure, no it isn't, yes it is) appears. Characterization, while overall excellent, at times seems over the top -- it's not entirely clear why *everyone* is so messed up, and the stupid bickering between the Rifters and the corporates in Atlantis left me with sympathy for neither side. I was put off by the apparent indifference of the characters to the impending destruction of Earth's whole ecosystem -- but then, they're selfish and profoundly damaged people, and creating sympathy for them in the reader's mind does not seem to have been Watts' priority. I would have found the aforesaid destruction more effective had it been shown more clearly.But, despite all these quibbles, I think this series is really good SF, and I highly recommend it.","I am reviewing the last 2 books as one here, which is how the author intended them to be published. First, you will have a hard time with the content if you haven't read the series starting with Starfish. The story is compelling and fascinating and a more than a little horrible. The writing is excellent and the plot unfolds briskly. The science is well researched and accessible to most intelligent readers. The proposed what-ifs of a near-apocalypitcal future are totally plausable.But sheesh Watts is hard on his characters. I give 4 stars for a great book, because it is, but I admit I'm left cold by the violence: some sexually graphic and sadistic, up close and personal, some happening far away from the characters at hand but with devestating consequence. All in the name of saving the world. The ending is enigmatic: I would have loved a neat wrap up of the surviving characters and and exposition of the future, but it's not that kind of book. So be it: that is Watts' choice and I have no bones with it aside from personal preference. But what I do have bones with is the dilution of Lenie's character from a force to be reckoned with to a a whiny nay-sayer. Even if Lenie more or less killed the whole world in the previous books, at least she did it with style (ya know, in a really twisted way). Now she sets off to save the world with a whimper and a moan. Boo. So that's my beef.Conclusion: if you love terse, unshirking, compelling and serious sci-fi, Watts is your man. Read in good health.","Peter Watts concludes his _Rifters_ saga in the fourth and final volume, _Behemoth: Book Two: Seppuku_. Watts had written that he originally planned a trilogy but that changes in the publishing industry had forced him to divide his rather large final volume into two novels, but that he was fortunate to have a good breaking point between the two books and two resulting novels that were different in scope. It seems to have been a good choice, as while _Behemoth_Book One_ focused nearly entirely on the undersea refuge of the corpses and rifters (along with our old friend Achilles Desjardins), _Book Two_ spent no time there at all but instead allowed the reader a tour of a post-Behemoth North America, a taste of international politics, and of course the end game between Lenie Clarke, Ken Lubin, and Achilles (and a new character that the book introduces, a physician by the name of Taka Ouellette).Overall I found it satisfying. The post-apocalyptic world we got to see was believable and interesting though wasn't perhaps as well-explored as what we got to see in _Maelstrom_. We were shown much more of the sick and sadistic pleasures of Achilles. While never really entering \"torture porn\" territory, the reader is left with a sense of disquiet (at least this one was) about how far the author would go in that regard. I didn't think it gratuitous, as this was a fundamental aspect of Achilles' character and of what had happened to him regarding his conscience, but it still nonetheless made me a bit uncomfortable at times (and makes me wonder just what the future holds for some forms of entertainment, given the evolution of horror films and the continual apparent need for succeeding films to outdo one another, a point I think the author was trying to make).I liked the ending, it had two interesting twists I really enjoyed and didn't devolve into what it could have been (one character simply killing another, story over). The world at the end of the novel is fundamentally different and not necessarily a world without hope. It is also a world that would be interesting to see explored in a later novel.I would like to express my displeasure at this series being out of print despite its recent age (_Seppuku_ came out in 2004). That is a real shame, as it is a worthwhile and interesting series, an excellent addition to the end of the world sub-genre of science fiction as well as probably the finest novel to ever handle the deep sea and ocean themes. The series overall was well researched (the author himself was a marine biologist) and had well-developed characters, a fascinating setting, and was an intriguing exploration of developing trends in our world.","The first book, \"Starfish\" was amazing, just a great read. This last book is horrible! Confusing, pointless, and extremely degrading, I wish I had never read it. I agree whole heartedly with \"aisian film c\" above! The rape and torture of one of the more sympathetic characters is what really pushed this book into the crapper for me.","I loved Starfish. I appreciated the smart science (hey, gotta love SF with bibliographies!); I found the world riveting and the characters well-drawn. But I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this book. The sequence of sexual sadism, which stretches on for chapter after excruciating chapter, is simply too visually explicit to be worth experiencing. It's an image I just didn't need, and one I can't get out of my head. It includes an eroticized clitoridectomy, for goodness sake. For me, that sequence overshadows everything else in the book, and however much you may want to see the resolution of issues raised in the other books, be sure you're willing to have that image stuck to your eyeballs before you buy or read this volume.","When I was sixteen I worked at a grocery store with a girl named Marianne whom I thought was pretty attractive. I wanted to ask her out for months but could never build up enough courage. After all, I didn't want to have to work with her if things went terribly wrong on the date. Eventually she quit and on her last day working, I asked her out. She said yes and we made plans for that weekend.A short time into the date I realized that her breath was horrible. I don't know if it was an anomaly or if I had just never been that close to her before. Either way, the date couldn't end fast enough for me. When I took her home I stopped walking halfway to her front door and let her walk the rest of the way alone-where I told her goodbye from a safe distance of about 20 yards.What does that have to do with Behemoth: Seppuku? Very little actually. But it does have something to do with the Rifters series, of which this book is the the fourth and final volume. Several years ago when I came across the first book in the series; Starfish, I was attracted to its eye-catching cover and intriguing description on the inside flap. I read it and enjoyed it. When the next book Maelstrom came out, I started to notice the bad breath. Unfortunately, as I've mentioned before, I have a mental disorder that does not allow me to quit reading a book I'm not enjoying, and apparently the condition makes it hard for me to stop reading a series of books once started.The series takes place in the not-too-distant future. In need of a new source of energy, mankind begins to tap into geothermal vents in the deepest parts of the ocean. It's discovered that hardened criminals possess the type of temperament best conducive to surviving under the extreme conditions at the bottom of the ocean and given the choice between imprisonment and a relatively free lifestyle segregated from the rest of humanity, many choose the latter. These workers are then surgically altered into amphibian-like creatures (rifters) in order to allow them to survive at such depths. Unfortunately, for the rest of mankind, there are bacteria that thrive at the bottom of the ocean. Bacteria that the human race is not prepared to defend itself against. Using the rifters as vehicles to the surface, the bacteria quickly spread with apocalyptic results.As the series progresses, halitosis sets in. There's not a likeable character anywhere in the series and the great idea behind the story gets overshadowed by the author's overwhelming angst and pessimism. Even in the acknowledgement section at the back of the book - yeah, my condition made me read that too, Watts writes that even if the book and the series \"sucks\" it would \"suck even worse\" if it wasn't for the help of the acknowledged individuals. If you're interested in owning the complete series, there's going to be a very cheap set on eBay in a few minutes.","Five years ago amphibious cyborg Lenie Clarke unleashed the microbe Behemoth on an unsuspecting world, killing ten million in North America. Lenni and her fellow cyborgs escape the devastation in the ocean depths and are at war with the VIP's who fled to the underwater city of Atlantis. The people of Atlantis and cyborgs make peace when Behemoth finds its way into the underwater city. For the first time in five years Lenie journeys to land accompanied by Ken Lubin to find a way to keep Behemoth out of Atlantis.Although a vaccine for Behemoth exists, it is in scarce supply so more people die from the microbe and the plagues that follow in its wake. Watchers guard against anyone breaking out of quarantine and many countries want to eradicate North America and thus destroy Behemoth. A new deadly microbe Seppuku is launched as a cure for Behemoth but when it kills the microbe it also infects the host. A watcher, Achilles Desjarding know that Seppuku will eventually die out before killing the host but he doesn't tell anyone because he wants to keep all the power he gained. Lenie and Ken can stop him but it might mean their deaths.BEHEMOTH: SEPPUKU is the last of the Lenni Clark books and it is just as action-packed and exciting as STARFISH: MAELSTROM and BEHEMOTH: B-MAX. This is a dark gritty speculative fiction novel with the survivors grimly determined to rebuild civilization if Behemoth is eradicated. Lenie knows she can never find redemption but she does her best to save what is left of the North American population. Desjarding is the archetype villain who everyone will love to hate. Peter Watts is writing excellent cutting edge science fiction.Harriet Klausner"],

      "reviews.text":["After reading this book in a college Sci Fi class at Berkeley almost 20 years ago, it remains one of my all-time favorites of any genre. It is positively amazing that it is almost 50 years old because it reads so thoroughly modern and relevant. The story grabs you right from the outset and doesn't let up. What makes &quot;Earth Abides&quot; so special is that it can be read on many different levels. While reading it for the first time, I often had to peer out the window to make sure there were still people around! Don't miss this sure bet","As a fan of non-alien, post apocalyptic novels, I sometimes struggle to find truly good books to read. Well, Earth Abides is a truly GREAT book, and you will not regret this choice. The book is well-written and unforgettable. It was written in 1949, but wears its age well. I was even able to enjoy its social perspectives toward women and race. George Stewart, like Mark Twain in Huckleberry Finn, really struggles with the social beliefs of his time, and questions both racism and sexism without overpowering his remarkable story of survival.I'm an avid reader. I especially like realistic science fiction, but don't limit myself to the genre. I rank Earth Abides in the top 5 of ALL the books I have ever read.","Earth Abides, written in 1949, tells the story of the fall of civilization from deadly disease and its \"rebirth\". It is actually three books in one: the disintegration of the world, the establishment of a new collective culture, and the moral weights of leadership. I initially read it as a post-apocalyptic novel and was rewarded with a philosophical treatise on the loss of a way of life and the dangers of man oversimplifying himself. The development of the tiny band's subsequent generations is more terrifying than a plague wiping out the planet. It is a story of 'what man wrought' but not in the way one anticipates. Originally classified a \"science fiction\" novel, now, with time, it must be categorized as literature.","\"Between the plan and the fulfillment lies always the hazard. Between the plan and the fulfillment stands always the frail barrier of a human life\" - George R. StewartIsherwood \"Ish\" Williams is one of the last people on Earth! How will he survive, how can he go on?\"Earth Abides\" is a book that I have owned for quite awhile & a book that I have always planned to read next, but never did. Finally I read the book and I was not only thoroughly impressed, I was in awe of George R. Stewart's ideas about how it would all end and how we could possibly go on.I'm amazed at the amount of the poor reviews for this book, I think most people are expecting moreI Am Legendtype material. This book is not that at all, there is some violence, not alot, there are no zombies, only people & animals. Many reviewers state that Ish should have done this, he shouldn't have done that, forgetting that this masterpiece was written in 1949. The book is so far ahead of it's time, it's baffling to me how George R. Stewart came up with some of these things. Would it be much different it this novel was written today, well obviously yes.Stewart's theory of how each animal will thrive before it's numbers level off really made me think. The everyday things that you never give a second thought, Stewart brings them to the front and makes you think, what do we do now, how do we get past this?If you like to read post-apocalyptic novels, if you've readThe Roadand enjoyed it, read \"Earth Abides\"This is the road that no man finishes traveling. Men come and go, but Earth abides!Enjoy~","How anyone could rate this book poorly is beyond comprehension. This is a well written, fascinating study on human thought and action. As much a intellectual simulation as a study of the time and attitudes of that time in which it was written.","George Stewart's \"Earth Abides\" is a tale of the end of the world by way of a plague that handles the subject in a way much different that similar tales. More thoughtful, deliberate and slow than I expected. More than anything it is a look at how man's conquering of mother nature is temporary at best. Take away man, and the Earth's memory of man will be soon forgotten. At the same time, it deals with civilization - what are the fundamentals of civilization, what keeps people together, and what prompted the creation of tribes, religion, superstition, and war.Without question, I enjoyed this a lot. One of the better takes on a post-apocalyptic scenario I have read to date. No Mad Max BS, no metaphysical The Stand mumbo jumbo, no b-grade nonsense ala The Postman, just pure introspection regarding how mankind would move on, and more importantly, how the Earth would move along as if we were never thereMandatory reading.","Some interesting ideas explored in this novel, such as the true worth, or otherwise of what we today term 'education'. Stewart asks the reader to question the validity of many of our modern values upon which today's civilization is based as well as pointing out how swiftly these would erode in the aftermath of some holocast. I am not sure if Ish made the correct decision when he completely abandoned the school for the children. There was only the one chance to pass on the knowledge of reading and the communication value it holds, and once lost it would be gone for ever. Also, the future survival of 'The Tribe' would have benefited enormously if future generations had access to much of the knowledge contained in the library.Another interesting point was how &quot;The Tribe', or rather 4 of its members, so quickly decided on the death penalty for Charlie.There appeared to be a complete lack of any real emotions in any of the characters. This was particularly noticable at the start of the novel when Ish looses not only all his friends, but his family also. There seemed no grieving process, and although he was certainly sad at the loss of Joey and Em, I did not feel his pain.Stewart could have written a far longer novel without loosing my interest and much more could have been included. The 'Quick Years' passed too quickly for me and I could have handled a few more hundred pages without loosing interest.Altogether an excellent read. We are asked to question so much of what we today hold as important. He questions our complacency, which is always a good thing.","Do you know the joyous feeling you get when you just happen upon a book quite by accident, read just a few chapters of it, and realize that it will be of great signifiance to you? Well, that was my experience with this book! I can't believe that I was not introduced to this book before now. It is with some sadness that I just completed reading it.My degree of connection with the main character, Isherwood Williams (Ish), astounded me; therefore, I must admit that my reaction to this book is quite subjective. It as is though the author looked into my mind and wrote a book about me in a post-apocalyptic world, including my greatest virtues and worst vices. The descriptions of the thoughts, triumphs, failings, joys, and frustrations experienced by the main character are poignantly honest and real. Metaphorically, this story seems to describe, with regard to many things, my existence in this, our so-far non-apocalyptic, world. For example, I find that I constantly struggle to define what I think to be the appropriate balance of individuality and community/state in our world. If you are one who consciously ponders such things or pursues a study of philosophy, I believe that you will view this book as a masterpiece. It just made my top 10, that is sure.I feel that I have gained much in my reading of this book. Mostly, I come away from this reading experience with a renewed feeling of peace and a reassurance in myself and the human spirit. I will no longer, I think, become quite so frustrated with regard to certain things or people in this world.&quot;Am I happy? Yes, I am happy. Things are as they are, and I am part of them.&quot; - Jack, great grandson of Isherwood Williams (Ish), the Last American.","This really great fictional accounting, by G.R. Stewart, of what our future might be, remains my favorite of the genre. I've just reread it for perhaps the third or fourth time - with some years in between. And although just a little dated it retains the vitality of adventure, promise and hope within a story of global tragedy. Considering current media hype about a possible Bird Flu pandemic this is an enlightening and enjoyable reading experience.","George R. Stewart's &quot;Earth Abides&quot; was written in 1949, so of course there are some anachronisms that occasionally jolt the reader. The Giants play at the Polo Grounds and the Dodgers at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. There are no interstate highways and radios all have vacuum tubes.These minor historical curiosities aside, what truly amazes is the timeless of Stewart's story. How many science fiction novels from 1949 still rate the glowing reviews of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; you will find here? By comparison so many modern sci-fi stories are formulaic, written with short, choppy sentences, shallow characters, and action sequences ready made for transfer to the screen.Stewart's vision of the future, where education and especially reading, slowly fad away after an apocalypse applies more to today's world than that of his own. His characters have little ability to bring back the technological remnants of the dead world, and truly, if 99% of the people on the planet were to disappear how many of us have the skills to keep the power going, the water flowing, and automobiles running decades after the disaster? His characters adapt to their environment in the most natural way.In the nearly four decades I have been reading books this is one of a handful that has made a memorable impression and which I consistently continue to recommend.","I don't think I've never read another book like this, so I'm not sure how to describe it. Very slow paced, not a lot of character development. Not a lot of explanation about where everyone went, I just didn't think enough how and why questions were answered early on. Interesting, but I really found it easy to put down. I also found some of the main character Ish's point of view about non-whites curious, yet somewhat disturbing. As if that was the way people viewed each other in the late 40s, and quite obvious lack of communication/knowledge about each other. There are some very interesting plot twists in here, none of them gory where they could be. Seems as if Stewart withheld gruesome details to focus on Ish's response to a completely changed world (no complaints here). I just find this book hard to recommend, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading this either.","I read this book years ago, lost my copy and when I heard the old time radio adaptation I got another copy. My first reading I was waiting for the clashes with other survivers, the cannabiles trying to eat them, you name it. Now after many years and another reading I understand Ish and the other survivers better. People cling to what they know, what is familiar. So did Ish. He was a bookworm, maybe even a geekish type. He loved the Hills, being solitary, studying. He was even in a profession that may have regarded less educated people as stupid (highly skilled science/engineering types come to mind) He was the last person to be chosen to kickstart humanity, to lead it back to greatness. He had the courage to drive cross country,alone, but not to keep the children in school or to take the books from the library.I liken the little colony to an office load of people who have never had to face a deadline, a change of upper management, or a takeover. They plodded along doing things the way they always did until circumstance forced an issue- the water, the visitor, there own need to bring in new blood. Ish knew what needed to be done but he lacked the wherewithall to motivate the others. He was not the charasmatic leader found in later novels. Those by S.M. Sirling come to mind, or Alas Babylon! Ish held the colony together and prevented their complete loss of civilization. He enforced rule of law when necessary, and made hard decisions.As others have pointed out, this book will continue to be debated as long as there are two people who have read it and thought about it.","I read this book aeons ago when I was in high school - of course back then it was a lot heavier (chisled in stone). It's a great book - though a bit antiquated and an interesting twist on the post-apocalyptic genre. The symbol of the single jack hammer has stuck with me through the years to the point that I never pick up my one handed sledge in the garage without thinking of the story. If you've never read it, you are missing a real treat.","I first read this in college for an English class and it really caught my imagination. Overall, the basic plot line of the book is very interesting and thought provoking, though the writing is not what I would call first rate. I like the fact that the book focuses on the fate of civilization in the wake of an overwhelming catastrophe without resorting to the seemingly inevitable appearance of zombies or other un-dead as is the case in so many other post-apocalyptic stories. I also like that the story balances optimism and pessimism, rather than going totally pessimistic a la 'The Road'.","I won't quibble with the author about such things as the shelf life of gasoline. I found this novel an intriguing insight into the era in which I was born. The author draws conclusions about post-apocalyptic civilization that, while I find them disturbing, are certainly possible. He casts the role of the antagonist not as the greed, lechery, or lust for power among others outside his tribe. Rather, the antagonist is the lethargy of a group of survivors who live by scavenging and whose creative urges never develop as a result.Personally, I find that a depressing scenario...perhaps because I also see it as a possibility. The main character, even though the tribe considers him their leader, is cast as one who stands outside the group. Instead of directing their energy toward creativity, he continues to see himself as an academic...an observer. Inevitably, the \"tribe\" is reduced to being a combination of scavengers and hunter/gatherers. Mr. Stewart does a good job of chronicling this decline. I simply think he (and his protagonist) accept this fate too easily.This is a book review, however. It is not a social commentary. The novel, itself, is well written and very effective in its' message. It's a worthwhile read, even if only undertaken as a study of the Amercan culture during the time period in which it was written.","So good. The good beginning and the good ending more than make up for the sometimes-boring middle. The whole, of course, is poetic. The author intended that and he succeeded. And he succeeded in making a post-apocalyptic story that is not dystopian, as so many of these contemporary stories are, and moreover is actually hopeful and, in the end, optimistic. And Stewart is to be thanked for that, as much as for anything else he has done here. As others have said, the novel certainly is worth reading again and I will do so.","At first, I found it hard to get past what I considered the author's naivete. Afterall, 99% plus of the world's population dies out, but there are few bodies...a plague of rats with the same result...the streets, even within the population centers, are virtually clear of stranded vehicles, etc. But, then I realized, this book was not about personal survival, it was about the survival of knowledge. Armed with the world's knowledge and a fine brain, Ish is only able to bequeath to his survivors a hammer, archery skills and the ability to make fire without modern means...despite his best efforts. This scenario of lost knowledge is even more probable today with Wikipedia taking the place of public libraries for many of our youth. An anthropological masterpiece! A must read for those planning to rebuild civilization after its collapse. (It's hard to believe this was written in 1949)","Earth Abides is a 1949 science fiction novel by George R. Stewart. When a plague all but wipes out the human race, a young introverted intellectual decides to observe the way the world responds to the sudden removal of humans, and, later, works to reconstruct certain aspects of civilization while battling to keep education alive.This is a thoughtful book: one of Stewart's primary themes here is a philosophical take on civilization: its pros and cons, what is gained and lost through starting over, and whether parts or the whole are worth rebuilding. Stewart, with the world's last scholar as his main character, does a wonderful job with this.But while Earth Abides is all about ideas, Stewart mostly punts on the moral and theological ramifications, as his characters move on quickly when these themes present challenges. In a world where people can't help but focus on death, that's a missed opportunity.In addition to the book's philosophical emphasis, Stewart's post-apocalyptic world is generally free of unrest and violence. While this allows Stewart to focus on his themes of rebuilding, his characters are rarely in much peril, and there's never much suspense. Yet as Stewart charts the life of his protagonist through the years and decades, the reader becomes invested in and attached to the character, passive and powerless though he may be, and this is why the novel is compelling, and why the reader will not mind the book's many philosophical detours.On the whole, Earth Abides is an intelligent, poignant and melancholy novel, and one of the finer and more influential works in the genre. Bonus points for an interracial relationship during a hostile era.","\"At the funeral of Homo sapiens there will be few mourners.\"I loved this book. So many end-of-the-world tales center on violence, war, superhuman heroes and unrealistic resolutions. Earth Abides is unique. It follows the story of \"Ish\", a biologist who was busy doing research alone in the mountains of California when a virus swept around the planet wiping out all but a few members of the human species. Immune to the virus, possibly because of a well-timed snakebite, Ish proceeds to explore the empty world. He travels across the United States, returns to the west coast, and helps establish a small community with a handful of survivors.Earth Abides is special because it all seems so real and down-to-earth. Ish is a scientist who makes keen observations and comes up with brilliant solutions to problems. But he is always very human. The character never drifts in a formulaic larger-than-life hero who can save the day. I also like the realistic mix of survivors. No, they aren't all Mohawk-wearing rapists and murderers. No, they aren't all highly intelligent saviors of civilization. They are an assortment of people one might see walking down any sidewalk in any city. Some smart, some dumb; some nice, some not so nice.Earth Abides covers a lot of ground, stretching out many years beyond the disaster. It is fascinating to read the author's description of crumbling cities and vanishing highways. It reminded me of the fine nonfiction book, The Earth Without Us.This book was a pleasure to read and I highly recommend it.\"At least,\" he thought, \"life is quieter.\"\"Yes, a tribe is like a child. You can show it the way by which it should grow up, and perhaps you can direct it a little, but in the end the child will go his own way, and so will the tribe.\"\"Men go and come, but Earth abides.\"","Earth Abides is a great book. It has always been one of my favorites. George Steward makes it easy to put yourself in the situation of being the last man on earth. This is the kind of book that you will read over and over through the years.","I, too, read this book 30-something years ago. What I remember most is the boy. I think he is Ish's son. He is the only one of the new generation to wonder how that dark box (the television) once worked. And he dies! I so wanted him to start figuring things out.","i have read the last ship alas babylon year zero footfall lucifers hammer this book was the best even though it was written long ago that is the most epic story MEN COME AND GO BUT EARTH ABIDES i read it 20 years ago and several times since","One of the most interesting books I've ever read. I wish he'd focused a little more on what happened in the rest of the world than the Tribe, but an amazing book all the same.","EARTH ABIDES by George R. Stewart is one of many books that take as its theme the destruction of mankind, leaving the Last Man on Earth as a narrator. THE PURPLE CLOUD by M.P. Sheil did much the same but Sheil's book was marred by excessive racism. Stewart's book is saved not only by the logical working out of the plot by its narrator-survivor, Isherwood, but also by Stewart's clever though subtle use of using Isherwood's slowly failing senses over many decades of post-apocalyptic adventures as a metaphor for the slow destruction of the American ideal of life.As the novel opens, the reader is told that the United States has been hit by a super-plague that has spread with lightning rapidity with near one hundred percent fatality. Ish, one of the very few survivors, passes by a abandoned car on the San Francisco bridge. This car is registered to a James P Robson of Oregon. This seemingly innocuous narration is later seen as the central metaphor of the book. Years later, Ish has several opportunities to pass the car in and out of San Francisco. Each time he does so, the car becomes somehow less distinct, a fuzziness that resonates first in his mind, then in the reader's mind. As the decades pass, Ish meets isolated pockets of survivors who have forgotten their American heritage. To these barbaric Mad Max types, Ish is the Last of the Americans. They tease him, they pinch him, they see him as a failed god type who could not deliver on the promises of the fabled technology of their legends. By the novel's end, he sees them pinching him, but he cannot feel them doing so. His senses have failed him just as America's technology had earlier failed to protect its population from the plague. Just before his death, Ish remembers the car on the bridge. Was it red? blue? green? Owned by Robson? Robinson? Robertson? He does not remember. But he feels sure that America has died, its technology has long since died, but its people live on, possibly learning from the mistakes of their predecessors, or maybe not. Stewart concludes his otherwise depressing work with a hint of optimism: \"Man may come and go, but earth abides.\"","I would have given this book fewer stars if I had been able to put it down. In spite of the stilted prose, odd inaccuracies, and generally bleak view of human nature, Earth Abides' end of the world scenario is completely gripping. There's none of the pseudo-mysticism of The Stand, just pure mid 20th century sci-fi goodness. Some of the scenarios Stewart presents aren't very subtle, and his views of women and blacks are what you might expect from 1949, but if you're at all interested in the &quot;what happens after a mysterious virus wipes out most of humanity&quot; scenario, Earth Abides is worth a read.","I bought this book and read it with the hope that it would be at least as good as Alas Babylon, one of my all time favorites. It was not. Earth Abides may have been the prototype of the collapse of civilization genre of Science Fiction but it has been outdone by so many other later books I hardly know where to start.To begin with, even the main character is very shallowly drawn and it goes downhill from there. You don't really care what happens to any of these people because the author does such a sketchy job of portraying them as having any of the qualities that we need to see in a literary figure in order to identify with them. This book is a science fiction version of The Grapes of Wrath without the character development. Be prepared for sexism, elitism, stupidity, lemming like fatalism and lack of preparation for any kind of civilized future. Also the author totally fails in most respects to know and understand how long canned food will last and how quickly you might be killed by scurvy living the lifestyle described in this book. Add in unrealistic pretexts for the characters doing what they do and you have a book that drags you into editor mode thinking how you could make it better.If you why I gave this book three stars when I disliked it so much, here is why It gets one of them for concept, the second for being the prototype of the genre and the third for having an interesting beginning. Where is really falls down is the ability to deliver on the initial promise. Books and movies for the most part succeed when they take an initial premise, however, far-fetched and then elaborate on that initial premise in a logical manner. After the initial suspension of disbelief this is how they suck you in. This book doesn't suck you in but actually loses you in contradictions, flimsy pretexts, and poor research with an ending that tails off in a whimper and left me whipping through the last several pages to get to the ending only to find that there was really no \"there\" there. Earth Abides gets credit for illustrating very convincingly the complex web of technical knowledge and individual job skills as well as motivations that keep our industrial society afloat but loses all the previous credit when it fails in a primal manner to explain why rational people who didn't really want to do a lot of work would makes life choices that initially and in the long run would mean a lot more work than the alternative choice that they didn't make. A low-tech lifestyle is a bundle of work compared to learning about and maintaining some of the elements of civilization. This is where I really fault the author as I believe that a lot of things including; the shelf life of canned goods, the back breaking labor of a hunter gatherer existence without even any horses, human craving for fresh food, and basic human emotions are ignored or glossed over in order to reach a contrived conclusion.","This a truly great book that everyone should read. Now to my experience with getting. I was looking for a reasonably priced hard back edition. This one said very good condition, in a price range I could live with. When I got the book I was happy with the condition until I found a bar code on the back cover which tore the cover getting it off. They should have specified that there was this sticker on the back cover. I like to keep my books and that is why I buy hard back. I was disappointed. Not only that but there was a sticker on side that read salvation army, $2.99. I really didn't care about the price difference but it showed me lack of concern by the seller which I do not appreciate. ruscolombo","I was really looking forward to reading this book as I have lately been going through a post-apocalyptic literature jag. After thoroughly enjoying \"On the Beach\", I purchased \"Earth Abides\". While \"On the Beach\" centers on humanity's ability to stay hopeful while facing the inevitable, I was confused by the intended message of \"Earth Abides\". The book's protagonist, Ish, likes to think of himself as the forward-thinking leader of a new civilization, but he comes across as more of an apathetic dreamer. In the twenty-plus years following a devastating plague, Ish and his companions evolve from foraging through supermarkets for food to....foraging through supermarkets for even older food. And I guess that is the really frustrating element of this book- in all that time no one has the foresight or gumption to make more than half-hearted attempts at creating some sort of self-sustaining community. The 'Gilligan's Island' crew did more in two years to create a society than this motley crew does in thirty!Kidding aside, I am sure that the author is making a statement about mankind that others have picked up on and that has apparently gone way over my head. I actually look forward to reading more learned reviews of the book to figure out what I missed.","Can't believe the negative reviews of this extraordinary novel. Read it for yourself. Then, you will appreciate life as we know it today. You will sleep well, adore more your family and friends, and rest assured that Earth abides.","I read this book about half way in sophmore year, and quit reading it. Now I'm 20 and I decided I'd give it another try. I have about 60 pages left, and I gotta say, this book is one of the slowest I have read, up there with the lord of the rings fellowship. I know it's a classic, but man, I can't even read this book for more than 30 min. at a time. Usually I blaze through books within a few days, but I'm probably on a month and a half with this book. I work a lot, so I dont usually have much time for reading except while I'm going to the bathroom and before bed, but wow. I mean the book is ok, it's not bad, it's just not a pageturner, which is what I usually go for. The main character Ish is very paranoid, thinks to far into detail over everything, and is in my opinion is a coward. I also feel like there is too much side tracking in this book. It's also very repetuous. I feel like there is too much thinking and too little action about anything. In some ways I relate to the main character, because I overthink a lot of things, I'm not the biggest strongest guy, nor the most handy, but that doesn't make it any more interesting of a read. It kind of defeats the purpose of me reading a book. I read to meet interesting characters, be engrossed in a story that is not mine, and to entertain my mind. I don't want to read about a character thinking. If i did want to read about that, I would read a philosophy book and do the thinking myself, or better yet, I'd read nothing and just think. When I think of books taking place in a post apocalyptic world, I think of a little bit more than this gives you. There could have been a lot more interesting scenarios in the depicted world than the one focused on in this book.I will say though that this book does use an interesting vocabulary, and I've learned a few new words. And the part's in Itallics are by far the best parts of the book. These parts do truly make an impression in your mind, and I would rate these as 5 star. Some of the itallicized parts are very deep and meaningful. I love this quote out of one of those parts \"Between the plan and fulfillment stands always the frail barrier of a human life\"Overall: Id say it's worth reading, but it's by far not the best book ever like some of the other reviewers are saying. I liked Cormick Mcarthy's \"The Road\" as a post apocalyptic story better, it seemed more real, and it moved at a quicker pace.","Every fan of post-apocalyptic stories has his own reason for following the genre. Mine is, that I like to see what the author considers most important to life in this world. When civilization and human society collapse; when food, medicine, and basic comforts become scarce; when friends are few and family is imperiled, what values will prevail? Most of the classic novels of calamity portray survivors determined to carry on, forming communities which are insular and self-reliant; learning and developing the skills and collecting the resources essential to living in a new world. Earth Abides paints a somewhat different picture.Ish is much like the heroes of the other popular disaster stories, in that he is determined to carry on; and to recover, as much as possible, the advances of civilization which are in danger of disappearing with the loss of most of the human race. Ish finds himself the head of a community and extended family; and though he is strong, educated, and resourceful, he finds nothing but frustration in his efforts to pass on his values to the next generation. His children and grandchildren have little desire to produce goods for themselves, having become dependent on the things left behind by those who died from the plague. He is unable to inspire them with his vision for keeping the great accomplishments of humanity alive.Something unique about this story is the occasional vignette describing what happens to the world around Ish, now that the human race has essentially become an endangered species. If you've ever watched the History Channel's \"Life After People\", you'll get a sense of that here - and see how these things directly affect Ish and the other survivors.I'm discovering that those classic novels which I can read many times throughout my life, and which say something new to me each time (see my reviews of \"1984\" and \"Fahrenheit 451\"), are those in which I recognize the signs of true works of genius. This is only my first time reading \"Earth Abides\", but I already wonder what it will say to me in five years, or ten, as I raise my children, or lead kids in my community, and try to impart my own values and experience to them. Will I be able to pass on those things they need to survive, or will I find myself, like Ish, disappointed, or having to realign my expectations?An engaging read, with all the hallmarks of a true classic.","I have read and reread this novel many times over the years, and this was just one of many copies I have bought to share with friends. It is the easiest reading but most thought provoking apocalyptic novel I have ever had the pleasure of reading.","This book is an interesting read about the end of civilization and rebuilding...but honestly nothing really happened in this book. The whole book seems like a huge buildup to some epic conflict/event that is going to happen, but never does.Maybe it's just a sign of the times that today's reader expects action, I always have a hard time with books written in the 50's.","This great book addresses one of the age-old curiousities so many of us have: What would I do if one day suddenly I was all alone in a world wiped clean of almost every other person?Ish, the main character, is a non-descript every-day Joe who finds himself in just this scenario. There are a few other survivors along the way, eventually forming a \"tribe.\" They all have their flaws and eccentricities which makes the story all the more believable. If you plucked a random selection of humanity and put them on a desert island they wouldn't all be super heroes! They would bumble along and learn how to survive as best they could within their limited capabilities.It was the way in which the author wrote the book that made it so great for me. The little interjections within chapters describing the changes in the Earth away from the human plot were great, and they provided context and realism to the human story. The progression through the 60 some-odd years was expertly crafted by singling out the years with momentous turning points for more detail, and speeding through the fascinating \"quick years\" in between. The descent back to a stone-age type existance twists the emotions. Sad for one who is familiar with the conveniences and comforts of modernity, but understandably necessary for the new human condition.A great novel that is considered a classic of post AP for very good reason.","I thought it started a bit slow, but in time I was certainly hooked. The writing style seemed a bit formal but I grew used to it. I found it easy to forget while reading that the setting was decades ago, as I could easily envision it happening in these times.By the middle of the book I was considering it \"required reading\" and thinking of family members I could loan it to. It definitely gains steam as the story evolves. Loved the ending, both powerful and moving.I can see that Stephen King must have been inspired by several different portions of this book to write the Stand. I consider this one better. I would have liked maybe to see it longer, with more character development of the younger generations. I suppose 900 page novels were uncommon in the time it was written, so we are left with what it is. A great, and thought provoking novel.","This book should be considered right up there with the classics of the genre. It's a wonderful and complex narrative that pulls you in and slowly pulls you along. It's not action packed but it is a very realistic look at a future where mankind has suffered a terrible tragedy. Highly recommended!","In 10th grade we read a story that dealt with the end of the world in our English class. I was intrigued. As i spoke again of this story a year later my 11th grade english teacher suggested that i read \"Earth Abides\". I shrugged off the suggestion being as though it was from my teacher (one of the lesser evils in my life) and it wasn't untill later that year when i found it on the library shelf that i finnally picked it up and began to read. I managed to rack up over 30 dollars in library fines because i litterally refused to return the book to its rightfull home. After reading it straight through three times in a row, I began to keep it under my pillow. I would pull it out at night and open it up and read randomly wherever the pages led me. Earth Abides may just be the most inspiring book I have ever read. I am now a Senior in Highschool. I since have bought a copy of Earth abides to replace the library's copy so that i could keep the copy that i had grown so close to. It is not so much the story or the people in it that i have attached myself to. The understanding of human nature and the way we react to crisis, and the way we move through life never ceases to amaze me. As I prepare myself to go into a career in Pyschology Stewart continues to be a constant inspiration in my search towards understanding of human behavior and human emotions. Also I am inspired as a writer. I can only dream that someday i will be able to write as well as Stewart. To be able to convey my thoughts or create and develope a character as well as he does would be beyond my imagination. Earth Abides leaves one person in awe and leaves them dying to read more but afraid to turn over the last page, for fear of ending the story. A wise person once said that finishing a good book is like losing a close friend. This holds true in Earth Abides. Whenever i read that last page my best friend dies with a simple punctuation mark. But as the book continues to remind us, Men go and come, BUT, earth abides.","The characters in George R. Stewart's Earth Abides symbolize many biblical people.Isherwood, the main character, is referred to as Ish throughout the novel. \"Ish,\" however, can also be a shortened form of the name Ishmael. Ishmael was a biblical wanderer who allegedly founded the Islamic religion. In the first half of the book, Ish is a wanderer, venturing all over post-apocalyptic America, eventually settling down and founding a tribe.One of Ish and Em's children, Joseph (who is referred to as Joey), is representative of the biblical Joseph. He is very gifted intellectually, and has the ability to see the deeper meaning in any situation, much like the biblical Joseph's ability to interpret drams; unlike the biblical Joseph, however, his talent is squelched, when he is stricken with typhoid fever, and dies as a result.The mentally-handicapped Evie has a name similar to the Eve, and is nave, much like her biblical predecessor. Eve is targeted by the evil serpent, and is expelled from the Garden of Eden when she partakes of fruit from a forbidden tree. Similarly, Evie is targeted by Charlie, a greasy character who lusts after her and plans to take advantage of her innocence. Before actually seducing Evie, however, he is executed by the others in Ish's Tribe, for Evie's well-being. Likewise, the serpent from the Bible receives his comeuppance in the form of expulsion from Eden and being made to walk on his belly for the rest of eternity.Ish's wife, \"Emma,\" is referred to as Em throughout the novel. This also ties in biblically, for \"Em\" can be short for \"Emet,\" a name meaning \"Truth.\" Emma is characterized throughout the novel as a strong-willed individual who helps hold the Tribe together. After Joey's death from typhoid fever, Ish asks Em if there might be a God taking vengence for Charlie's execution. Em responds, \"If there is a God who made us and we did something wrong before his eyes... at least we did wrong only because we were as god made us, and I do not think that He should set traps.\" (258) She speaks her mind, and she speaks the truth.Ezra was a biblical prophet who chronicled the return of the Jews to Jerusalem after their expulsion by the Babylonians sixty years prior. Likewise, in the novel, Ezra speaks with great foresight-much like a prophet-and lives to observe the Tribe's rebuilding of civilization.These and other biblical parallels make Earth Abides one of the most symbolic modern-day books.","I first read this book nearly 40 years ago, and loved it. I go back and re-read it about once per decade, and I never tire of it. This was the first &quot;post-disaster&quot; novel, and in some ways still the best. Because it was written in 1949 it's a bit dated in some ways, but the human element is so strong that it still holds your interest; you really CARE about the characters! One of my all-time favorites!","Recently I took it upon myself to read the twelve books describing end of the world scenarios that are being recommended by Amazon in one of its lists. Of the twelve that I read, this is by far my favourite book. George Stewart wrote a story that is both believable and entertaining. In fact, with only a few minor historical references to culture in the 1940's, one could easily think that this book was written yesterday. I regret that the other books written by Stewart are not widely available. I think he's an amazing writer. Buy and read this book. You will not regret your selection.","This book was written in 1949. It has withstood the test of Time.If You like a good Post-Apocalypse yarn, Read & Enjoy.","\"the Earth Abides\" is a well written book. It is now somewhat dated, but it still offers a good set of characters that are well developed and a solid story line. Good story telling, realistic characters that are well written, fine dialog, all combine to make \"The Earth Abides\" a pretty good read.","This book should be considered right up there with the classics of the genre. It's a wonderful and complex narrative that pulls you in and slowly pulls you along. It's not action packed but it is a very realistic look at a future where mankind has suffered a terrible tragedy. Highly recommended!","This timeless masterpiece recounts the most likely of the various apocalyptic ends to man's brief reign on Earth. Written from a naturalist's viewpoint, the novel recounts the fall of man following a sweeping measles-like pandemic. The author deftly informs us that the unknown disease is sirborne, that it hits only higher primates, and that the death toll is so all-encompassing that society simply vanishes. Mr Stewart also notes that the bulk of the few survivors are so devastated by the event that they become incapacitated. He also recounts nature's way of restoring an upset ecological balance and how the remaining animals cope with their new-found freedom.Ish Williams, the main character, himself goes through a period of psychological angst, but as with some persons in any crisis, recovers his equilibrium. He sees and meets others who cannot, but eventually meets an equally resolute woman. The book then briefly, but viably, notes how mores change when society disintegrates.In a section entitled \"Quick Years\", the couple meet certain other adjusted persons who have adjusted to the \"Great Disaster\", as they call it, and a rudimentary \"tribe\", so-called, comes into being. A tight, fascinating study leaves the way clear for \"The Year 22\", the next chapter.It is interesting to note how the members retain traditional taboos, remember dates and holidays, and yet slowly return to a hunter-gatherer society. Organized learning is a natural casualty, to be replaced by superstition. Obviously, the ability to conjugate verbs becomes surplusage at such a time.The tribe learns to face disease, criminality, and tragedy. Religious tenets alter in each such society. One is left with the belief that man hasn't really learned very much by all of it. You learn that the most important thing to primitive man was the bow and arrow, and fire-making. Ish preserves these for future generations, along with a less credible democratic tradition. Even the language begins to change, as history marches on.I won't spoil it by giving the ending, but you won't forget it, any more than you will forget any of the details of this incredibly well thought out, impeccably written book.Even if, as with some reviewers, you cannot accept Stewart's approach or result, you will be forced to concede that, in addition to being a great storyteller, he is an incomparable, almost lyrical, wordsmith.I hated to see the book end.","Even Stephen King admits he based THE STAND on this interesting novel. I also recommend Doherty's AREA 51 series.","Considering all the raves, I was disappointed by Earth Abides. Although the premise was interesting, it never really went any place and kind of left me hanging. I thought the discussion of how man's departure from Earth affected other species was thought provoking and well done, but the rather dry writing style and lack of depth in the characters left me underwhelmed.","All i have to say is this book is sooooo gooood!","Allow me to digress for a minute. Has anyone ever seen the Bruce Willis movie The 12 Monkeys? Anyone besides me that is? I didn't think so. Back to the subject hand. The plot of Earth Abides is similar to that movie. A biological plague devastates the United States and the rest of the world. Isherwood, &quot;Ish&quot; Brown, comes across a dying man named Barlow. After Barlow's death, Brown's the last man on Earth. If I may digress again, it's also similar to the 1971 Charlton Heston movie &quot;The Omega Man.&quot; Ish sets out on a cross-country trek to preserve our culture. In Arkansas, he finds roads in disrepair, and forests reclaiming everything. That's all I'm telling you. If you want to find out &quot;the rest of the story,&quot; READ THIS BOOK!!!","I read this for a geography class in college. Boy, what a downer. Think Little House on the Prairie meets Mad Max, it's that skewed and contorted. Moments of trying to rebuild are perpetually dashed. In truth, what we have here is the story of a man trying to recreate the past, and how a world gone wrong prevents him from achieving his dream. He is in essence, powerless to do anything about it for the forces against him are nature itself.I do not recommend this book unless you like to read about characters who have no hope whatsoever. I think the one plus is that it's set in the San Francisco Bay Area, so there's a kind of tangibleness to it from this reader.Beyond that, I should've trashed or donated this thing ages ago.","This is one of the great books of the 20th Century. Unfortunately, a poor job was done producing it for Kindle. It seems to me that the print edition was scanned using Optical Character Recognition software and not proofed. It is full of misspellings and incorrect words due to the software limitations. If Amazon expects us to pay for this, they should make some effort to be sure that their product is correct!","George Stewart has crafted a science fiction tale that stands up fairly well to the test of time. Although it was first published in 1949, the language and ideas are still immediately relevant today. What would happen to you if civilization fell apart? How would you survive? How would people treat each other?The tale unfolds gradually, without suspense. For me, this was not quite the memorable novel that the highlighted reviewers described. I read the whole thing, but I could have easily put it down halfway through, since I did not develop a deep emotional attachment to the story or its characters. The novel is told in the third person, but through the eyes of Ish, the main character. This unusual point of view puts the reader at a distance. I didn't feel that I really knew any of the characters in the book, except for Ish.Ish has a bland personality. He is one who accepts his lot in life, even his lot in death. As the workings of civilization fail, he notes their passing. In the end, he does little to oppose his tribe's drift back into the stone age. This engendered my main disappointment with the novel. Why did the author make the protagonist so weak? There have been great novels fashioned out of weak characters, but ultimately I did not find greatness in this book. It is well written, but it did not fulfill my expectations.","This isn't badly written but, it didn't hold my interest like a really good Sci-fi book will do. It has a good story line but, the characters lack personality. It is interesting to read a book that was written as Science Fiction years ago.Earth Abides","Given a copy of \"Earth Abides\" in 1976 while stationed in Atsugi JA. This novel takes a single premise and projects the \"what if\" to a very logical and believable conclusion. I have read this novel three times since, each time obtaining a different prespective on the way human nature molds our life's decisions. Ranks with 20,000 leagues u/sea, The Time Machine and other SF stories that will stay within your mind years after the final page has been turned. One of the very few works of fiction that I recommend to friends - if you're searching for a believable work of science fiction \"Earth Abides\" will exceed your expectations.","I liked this book, its a very good view on what things could be like for the few survivors of a near species-ending pandemic. Written some time ago it does tend to be dated, but not annoyingly so. I knocked off a star due to the fact that it is somewhat navel-gazing in its execution. There's alot of deep thinking going on by the main character. Given all of this, its still worth a read and will IMO promote some thinking of your own.","The story of a world decimated by a fast-moving plague, Earth Abides follows the life of Isherwood, a 29-year-old loner who, while camping, suffers a rattlesnake bite that saves his life. After recovering from the snakebite (and other symptoms), he makes his way back to the San Francisco Bay area, where he finds his parents gone and the city deserted. Indeed, only a few people remain after the scourge that killed millions.Written in 1949, Earth Abides is a philosophical sci fi classic--it takes place before rock and roll, before microwaves, and way before computers. As Ish bands together with a few survivors to found a new civilization, he must decide what is important to keep from the Old Times, and what can be abandoned. The charm of Earth Abides is that it is as much a portrait of the mid-20th century as it is a futuristic fiction. It is the story of the last Americans.","The first scifi i ever read. Published , i believe, in 1949,the language is still current and still moving. Love a book that makes me think about the end of the world...","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it. This maturity is perceptible all along this work.The story is situated in a world devastated by a sudden pestilence that annihilates most of humankind. Taking into account the last SARS epidemic that jumped abruptly from China to Canada it doesn't look an impossible scenario.This is the story.Isherwood Williams comes down from an isolate spot in the mountains to discover an empty world. He starts searching for survivors all across USA, from California to New York and back again. He finds only isolate human cells, couples or trios, overwhelmed by catastrophe and in a near catatonic state.Returns to his native town and contemplate with a certain scientific detachment the fading world around him.Mr. Stewart intercalate brief vignettes describing what happens to dogs, cats, cattle, plants, roads, dams and bridges, contrasting them with Ish's daily experiences.Little by little the story grip reader's attention and even if action is somehow slow, the book can't be put down.As the story goes on human cells began to draw near each other, grouping and interacting again. A rather feeble structure starts growing up.The author approaches universal questions about survival and extinction; civilization and savagery; social structure and anomie. He also examines religious values, ethics and life's ultimate sense.This book gives the reader a lot of stuff to think about. A very enticing read!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","In this profound ecological fable, a mysterious plague has destroyed the vast majority of the human race. Isherwood Williams, one of the few survivors, returns from a wilderness field trip to discover that civilization has vanished during his absence. Eventually he returns to San Francisco and encounters a female survivor who becomes his wife. Around them and their children a small community develops, living like their pioneer ancestors and gradually returning to a simpler way of life. It may seem odd to say that a book in which the majority of the world's inhabitants die is life-affirming and spiritual, but I'm going to say it anyway. I have read this book again and again over the years, and each time I come away from it with a deep feeling of peacefulness and confidence in the power of Mother Earth.","I read this book about 15 years ago and had completely forgotten its name, but this book kept coming back to my mind over the years and I had to search and rediscover this book. What made this book to stay alive in my mind were my own thoughts and ideas that I have developed during the years about how civilizations grow and develop trends like religions, life styles etc.The central character of this story, Ish was an ordinary man before the plague that wiped out the whole world. In the new civilization, he, oblivious to himself, started assuming the role of a leader. The civilization, against his own wishes, started looking up at him as their spiritual leader.Most of the story is made up of his reflections and ambitions for the new civilization. He intended the new civilization to be based on the old one, taking advantage of the technological developments already in place. But, the civilization chooses to follow its natural progression and he found everyone around him to be very comfortable with the barbarian way of life.It is a thought provoking book. Must read for anyone who is a thinker !","This was one of the early end of the world novels where the survivors try to restart society. Though there is a lot of scientific inaccuracies, what makes this book great are the characters. If you liked Stephen King's The Stand which also had great characters, then you should like this one.The main character is Ish. Ish seems to be someone that we all strive to be. Caring and smart. Ish also, has the son that we all wish our children would be like. Ish's son is the smartest of all the children and he simply idolizes Ish.Ish uses a hammer (a basic, I guess Stanely model) as his symbol of power (or his sceptre) over the survivors. Undoubtedly, the hammer is to pass to Ish's son when Ish dies.The big project for the survivors is to get an old automobilie repaired enough to explore other lands and try to find other bands of survivors and get civilization back on its feet. I don't want to give the rest of the plot away only to say that this project turns out to be a big mistake.","Despite its age and archaic language, Stewart's practical knowledge of nature makes this one of the best epoch-ending books ever written. Other stories reveal this knowledge but unfortunately, are out of print (Storm and Fire). You've probably read enough reviews to know what the story is about, but be prepared for some radical thinking compared to today's social standards. This was written when many words were compounded by hyphens. When you read of the tail-gate on the station-wagon, don't be shocked. We really wrote that way back in the late forties and fifties. His story reflects the way things were then, not now, so you'll likely find this story as alien as many future fiction stories. We really have evolved that much. Enjoy one of the great SF stories of all time. It certainly is my favorite.","This book is a &quot;must read&quot; for those of us living in Northern and Central California. His descripitons bring the story home. I have assigned this book to students for extra reading. I believe it should be assigned reading in our local high schools.","After I picked this up I realized I read this book a long time ago. Because the time setting is over 60 years ago some of the language and terminology has passed into disuse but, what would you expect? Entertaining and thought provoking.","I read this book about 35 years ago as a paperback and just decided to read it again as a Kindle edition. I liked it much more when I read it as a teen, now in my 50's it seemed kind of slow. It's not one of those books you read over and over again.","I first read this book as a senior in high school, and it's stayed with me all this time. Some typos and poor editing in this edition, but the story is worth reading and sharing with friends.","From start to finish, the book was entertaining if not thought provoking. I enjoyed the the perspective of the main character throughout the book and each encounter. He was much more relatable than most protagonists in the genre. I recommend this book to anyone looking in the survival / post-apocalyptic genre.","For the year written, it seemed ahead of it's time. It does not compare to &#34;Alas, Babylon&#34;. At one point I put it aside and read another book. Though, as the principal aged, his thought's and actions, were first class.","Warning before you read, no cannibals or massacres are devices used in this novel. It is a thinking man's teotwawki! I totally enjoyed sharing the thoughts of this quiet man who watched his world rebuild. Great balance for all the survivalist info I glean from all my other beloved shtf reads!","This classic book reminds us how greatly our civilization affects our surroundings yet how temporary and insignificant we are in this world.Mr. Stewart has written a book that keeps pressure on the reader to think introspectively. The style is easy to read and allows such personal thoughts to mingle with the words being read.","If seen only as an example of early writing in this genre - mankind after the apocalypse - this should be taken as an acceptable novel as compared to later attempts in the same vein. The characters don't really develop and just seem to stumble along without learning how to cope beyond what they knew &#34;before&#34;, which makes for a somewhat plodding read.","I read the Earth Abides, after listening to a friend describe this story as one of the most impactful he had ever known. Several years later in the early 1980's, I stumbled across a slightly used copy in a bookstore. George Stewart tells a fascinating tale of a post apocolyptic vision staged in the East Bay section of the San Francisco Bay area. This story has stayed with me and endures as a valued set of images. The struggle to make sense of the horrific and nonsensical was intuitively accurate. The story revealed in human terms the everyday efforts of a small group of survivors, suddenly stranded and adrift. The beneficiaries of a hulking but hollow industrial infrastructure that no longer served those who remained and their succeeding generations. The unfolding &quot;descent&quot; of industriatized society as well as the marginalization of technology was at once fascinating and frightening. The ending left me stunned, yet wisened.","My 12 year old daughter is reading Alas, Babylon right now and was discussing the plot with me. I immediately remembered reading Earth Abides over 10 years ago and was wondering if it could still be found. Obviously, there are lots of fans. What a compelling story about the potential future of mankind. Should be required reading in school","I read this book when I was 12 or 13 years old (more than 30 years ago) and it had a lasting impact on me. I have long since forgotten most of the &quot;classics&quot; I have read but this story has stayed with me through the years. Friends think I'm nuts when I say things like &quot; as you yourself, Ish, well know!&quot; right out of the blue. I just stumbled across it at Amazon and immediately ordered it. I can't wait to read it again!","I first read this book about 20 years ago, it caught my eye because the opening date used in the book is my birthdate 12/22/47. Have read it many times since and it never fails to make me re evaluate my current situation and really look at what is important and what is not. This is a must read book for me at least once evey 18 months.","I read this book 10 or 20 years ago, and I still think about it nearly every week. Where would I choose to live? What would I try to save? I have even thought of making my own screenplay adaptation based on the book. If the author needs help or motivation, then please e-mail me!","Read this book when you're really depressed. You will realize that things are not all that bad. Earth Abides provides hope. Even if everything we hold dear, everything we assume to be permanent, everything human disappears, the dream will survive.This is not the metaphysical good v. evil crap of Stephen King, nor the bang-bang rootin' shootin' end of the world of the pulps, but a quiet look at what the world would be like if mankind silently slipped away.","This book was captivating, and exciting. It makes you think abou the fragility of life, and how quick things change. This should be read at least once in your life. Stewart was 40 years ahead of his time when he wrote this and you don't want to miss out on it.","To read this book for the first time, at 10 years of age, is to enter suddenly into the reality of the fragility of the material society into which we are submerged.How could everyone really die off like that? This was MY town! MY Bay Area! MY UC Berkeley campus playground! A major metropolis! Fascinated, I couldn't put the book down. Living in Oakland, Ca. in the late 60's, I avidly looked out the windows when traveling through the East Bay, striving to see that little pony, running and running and running.It was beyond my comprehension that a thing so large as the Bay Bridge, which my grandfather had had a hand in building, could fall apart! I had thought such a thing would take ages and ages to break, not just a generation.All it takes is an earthquake, a dash of sea salt and a virulent bug.","This book is way ahead of it's time in exploring the way mankind can be taken down by virtue of the adaptabiliy of micro-organisms exploiting the large population of world ranging individuals. This book is scary that way, not to mention the writing is incredibly good. George Steward shows a love and understanding of ecosystems and how culture can be shaken and lost by the loss of the majority of constituant members. How Isherwood Williams copes with his deminishing expectations for the next generation is realistic and shows how most of us adapt to the whims and caprice of what life can throw at us. This book could be a world shaker if given a good rewrite updating the 1940s slant. With what we know now that Steward seemed to predict would come about intuitively, this work would be very popular today. Don't let that stop you from reading this great, great book.","I wandered in here and was suprised to see that the book was still in print, and how many people had read and loved the book. This was recommended to me about ten years ago by the author's grandson, and I agree with many other readers. It is a timeless and thought-provoking end-of-world scenario. It is a strong argument for compulsory education as well. Very enjoyable.","Earth Abides is a fantastic book. When I noticed it was written in 1949 I was a bit concerned, but it was not dated at all. The simple synopsis of the story is that everyone on the planet dies in a plague, except for a few hundred people. The story follows Ish, who was a ecologist or something and is now forced into the role of designing plans for rebuilding civilization. Along with a few others he meets and adds to his community, the book follows Ish's &quot;tribe&quot; for about 60 years. During that time the human build infrastructure deteriorates along with Ish's hopes of quickly restoring an active civilization. I would like to especially credit Stewart for including two long chapters he calls &quot;Quick Years&quot;, where he moves ahead 10 or 20 years. A less confident author would fill that 20 years with the same nonsense over and over making this a much slower and longer book.","It is a mystery how anyone could read this book and feel it is poorly written. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is a heart-breaking, gut wrenching , beautifully written novel. The only fault I had was its' length. I wanted it to go on and on. That is the highest praise I can give any book. Stephen King's Stand is a very good novel, too, but doesnt hit the emotional chords as well as this one does.","&quot;Earth Abides&quot; deals with the collapse of society after a plague has killed nearly everyone in the world. Isherwood (Ish) Williams was in the mountains when this happened, so he was spared the trauma of seeing everyone die around him.&quot;Earth Abides&quot; is probably one of the more realistic apocalypse books. A plague is tidier and more envionmentally friendly than a nuclear holocaust so the world was quite lucky. The survivors who band together are just ordinary people. No military strategists, scientific experts or specialists. No engineers or architects. They have to cope with life in a world without medical services, police, government, or farmers.Over the years, 20th century life is slipping away and Ish's tribe can't bring any of it back. Decades later San Francisco is a jungle and Ish is the last of the old race. The new race are illiterate hunters but they are also a more decent people. They treat the animals as equals, they are happier and have none of the hangups that affected 20th century society before the plague. They'll never know how to split the atom, build missiles, or damage the ozone layer.Because history tends to go round in circles I don't think civilization really died after the plague. It just went to sleep. One day it will come back, maybe in a few centuries. Something new and better. A rejuvinated world, fresh and clean.&quot;Earth Abides&quot; was a good book. It probably wouldn't work as a movie, though. Not after the criticism that &quot;The Postman&quot; got. But I thought Kevin Bacon would be good as Ish. I'm not sure who would play the other characters.","I was really looking forward to this book, and was left feeling really disappointed. I have now read all of what I consider the \"big-4\" of 50's PA literature, I found Alas Babylon and \"Canticle for Leibowicz\" excellent, \"on the beach\" overly depressing and unrealistic (but I was 16 when I read it so my opinion might have changed by now) but Earth Abides left me un-impressed.I thought the central character was so devoid of likeability and compassion it made him entirely unrealistic, in fact he came across as some sort of post-apocalyptic Daily Mail reader who spend a significant proportion of the first part of the book traversing America deciding if anyone was \"good-enough\" to share his planned new civilisation, but found the survivors too emotional, too provincial, too poor, too black, too uneducated etc etc. \"Ish\" would have benefited from a good punch in the face, and the only character who might have offered to give him one was executed for bragging about his carnal adventures whilst drunk.His long suffering and dignified wife Em, also had to make the startling confession that she was of mixed race and was beside herself with gratitude that Ish didn't then and there string her up from a nearby tree (like Charlie).The pace of the story is languid and the descriptions interesting, but for me, the entire book was held back by the attitudes and small mindedness of the central character.I am generally not a fan of the \"marauding biker gangs\" type PA style but in this case, if the Toecutter had rocked up at Ishs' house and decapitated him with some sort of boomerang, then the community and post-plague America would have been done a great service.Sadly, the attitudes of Ish probably just reflected those extant in America in the 50's but that means that the story has dated particularly badly, and although Alas Babylon also suffers from the same malady, the central character in that book is much more human and flawed and this makes that book a more engaging read.I am currently reading \"Summer of the Apocalypse\" which borrows some elements from Earth Abides, but is a much better fit for me in terms of what I like in PA books.","I first read this book when I was twelve and lived very near Berkeley. It was the first time I had seen the word \"ecologist\". The book has stayed with me for the last 59 years. I have reread it many times, and have used it as a basis for many earth sciences classes. While it is in a sense, apocalyptic, it is not preachy, or sensational, but a gentle, detailed reminder that in this day of climate change, it is not earth that is in danger, but our own and related species. That Ish, the protagonist , is an observer rather than a charismatic leader, gives us, as readers, a chance to observe with him the deeply meaningful theme that, \"men come and go, but Earth abides. One of my all time favorite reads.","Man has passed and what remains are the things built to sustain us; our cities, bridges, highways, grocery stores, street signs, power plants and dams, parked cars and canned peaches. These things do not simply disappear. Yet with enough time much will be lost to the weeds, the earth will take it back and intermingle our fallen silver coins with the pebbles of the riverbank.***As one of the founding novels of apocalyptic fiction, \"Earth Abides\" is not only a tale of what comes after global disaster but what is means to be human in the simplest and grandest sense. Although written in 1949, it continues to be praised decades later and for good reason, it is a captivating book that reaches beyond the genre of science fiction and into the heart of humanity. On the surface, \"Earth Abides\" is the tale of Isherwood Williams' survival yet it such an expansive novel that the tale of one man becomes that of all mankind.In our contemporary world we tend to forget (or deny) that individuals are entangled within society for better or worse, but the truth is that we cannot be separate from our culture, our history, and our way of life. I found this novel to be a mindful mediation on what it means to be a part of a community and a sort of Anthropological study of civilization.I was surprised and actually relived to find there were no zombies, no riots, no constant struggle to fight hordes of panic stricken survivors, but a rather calm and quiet end to the human race as it once existed. To be sure it seemed quaint; this notion of a peaceful ending in spite of sudden pandemic and inevitable death, but it was surprisingly optimistic without being wholly nave. Many people would likely continue to follow the rules of society even without the enforcers of law for a while, but with time, these things would matter less and less. And despite many who choose to do no harm to their neighbors, there will always be some men who pose a danger to his peers in malice or self-preservation.","I was surprised how well \"Earth Abides\" held up as a post-apocalyptic novel being read in 2010, even though it was published in 1949 - over 60+ years ago. It was remarkably current, in my opinion. Yes, there were a few politically incorrect/outdated views on women, race and retardation - based on this day and age. But if you read it based on the reality of 1949, some of the ideas put forward by Stewart were actually ahead of his time.This novel is not an action packed, shoot em up, zombies control the earth PA novel. It is a character study on how different people or small groups of people react or shut down in a disaster. And the way they act and react may not be what we would consider to be the best - for the individuals involved or for the salvation of mankind. But I can actually see the events in \"Earth Abides\" happening. Scary to think of but imaginable. This book stands the test of time.","I ordered the audio book based on an article that called it \"one of the best post-apocalyptic novels\". I expected a plot that would detail the heroic efforts of the protagonist to survive and thrive in the world after most of the human population dies. I did not expect the protagonist and his band of survivors to do the obvious - to be scavengers upon the bones of civilization, and to give up or not even try to keep or advance civilization's progress up to that point. The slow realization that the path of least resistance would be the course of action was one of the most depressing and poignant moments I have had in considering the future of humans on this planet. I felt I was personally witnessing the de-evolution of mankind.Of particular interest to me was that the author, George R. Stewart, chose to use a virus as the vehicle that killed most of the inhabitants, not the obvious nuclear holocaust. The fact that atomic bombs were capable of killing off the bulk of mankind was still very fresh in the minds of his readers in the late 1940's. Viruses as agents of destruction seem to be one of the very real swords hanging over our heads today, making us relate to this book even more.","George Stewart's \"Earth Abides\" is regarded as a classic of the overcrowded post-apocalyptic genre, and for good reason. But the book achieved classic status only because its post-apocalyptic setting is a secondary feature of the narrative.Stewart didn't write an adventure story about a loner/survivor who must fend off attacks from marauding mutants. In fact, given the context, there is surprisingly little action at all.Instead, \"Earth Abides\" puts you inside the mind of the main character, Ish, for an extended meditation on the nature, specifically the frailty, of human existence.Stewart ranges far and wide, if not deeply, into an astonishing array of issues, from the personal to the universal. That said, there is a core idea, which the title expresses in part:Earth abides. The dude does not.It is a pagan formulation: Earth 1, Humanity 0. And while I would put it another way, I'm at least grateful that Stewart made me think. Who needs marauding mutants?","This book has been torpedoed by some readers because it isn't \"The Stand.\" While \"the Stand,\" is one of my favorite books, what happens after the world is wiped out by plague becomes highly supernatural. Much as I like that, Stewart shows a much more realistic side of what would happen to whatever few survivors this world might have if a plague took most of us out of circulation. Any possible community would be small, and battle dogs, ants, rats, diseases, and the like. The characters here are never to be forgotten--Ish, Em, Joey and Charlie above all, and the plot stays with you long after the book is finished. I read it in the '80s when I worked on a book assembly line. Imagine my delight that it is now available again. This is up there with \"Alas Babylon,\" and just a bit less depressing than \"On the Beach.\"","I read some of the rave reviews by others which made me decide to order this book. Of the end of the world genre, I would say this rates near the bottom.I guess what annoyed me the most was how far off the author was to guessing how the world would decay... I'll list a few examples and let you decide for yourselves.1. The rate of decay of everything was grossly exagerated. Rail lines reduced to nothing but a pile of rusty chips in only 30-40 years? Entire houses rotting away and completely gone in just 10-15 years? Huge dams rotting and breaking after only 5 years? Very silly scientific assumptions.2. The lack of doing anything worthwhile for a so called smart man. He can only teach just one child to read? Doing basically nothing to improve his life over the course of 40 years?3. He comletely underestimated human will. The children in the tribe lacked any kind of basic intelligence. The author probably never had kids and assumed they are stupid without a formal education.You know what, this isn't even worth my time to continue listing all the flaws. Trust me, spend your time watching one of the recent Discovery Channel episodes on the end of the world without man, it would be much more compelling then this book.","I just finished this book, and I have to say it was interesting but nothing really special. I read The Stand many years ago, and loved it, although it was extremely unrealistic. Earth Abides has the realism, but it overdoes realism, without too much excitement. Basically if you have some time and want a quick read, pick this novel up, but if you are looking for a spectacular sci-fi or post apocolyptic book you are better off picking up another novel.","This tale of the apocalyse is very thorough in its examination of all of the changes in the ecosystem if man were to disappear from the earth. The first half of this book is a real page turner as the main character travels the countryside to discover what has become of the great cities of the U.S. after most of the human race has been wiped out by a deadly disease. Unfortunately, the second half of the book sinks into mediocrity as Ish's small band of survivors shun the \"old ways\" in favor of a return to illiteracy and primative life, which makes the second half kind of not belieavable. Christians [should] be offended that the author has absolutely no respect for and even argues against the existence of God in this book. Nevertheless this is a great book and worth the time and money.","The Greatest Book I've Ever ReadIn the book Earth Abide, By George R. Stewart thesubject at hand throughout the book is the survival of man. Thisbook takes place in San Francisco California where a vast plaguehas almost wiped out all of the Homo-Sapiens. This book followsthe life and times of one man (Isherwood)and his struggles to rrebuild his past American life. This is very heart warming thatour culture would last to the breaking point of our species. Ihope you all feel the same.Isherwood starts out in the mountains on a school studytrip. This is when he became sick from a rattle snake bite. Hereeven before the plague he had to struggle for his life. \"I justhave to cut the bite holes and extract the poison,(Stewart 12).This characteristic shows that he is a survivor and foreshadowshis success aaginst the plague.He also in many other ways begins to stabilize hissurvival iin this book. He ensures safety by meeting othersurvivors and creating a tribe. He tries to edjucate their youthwith their past culture, but loses the young ones to moreexciting activities. He even tries to better the adults, but hefaces complete anguish because not a single person cares. \"Nothanks, were going to play with the bulls, and go dodgin,(Stewart 44).Isherwood thorugh much heart ache and disappointment,goes for one last hurrah to save his people. He teaches his twomiddle aged boys to drive, and sends them in a cross countrysearch of survivors. When they return, it was to no avail. Theygave up and found no one worth finding. Ish is lost agian tothis new world.This is a reamarkable book that is one so captivating iscauses internal turmoil in yourself. By reading of a quitepossible tradgedy, it makes life much sweeter. Also by seeinganother man struggle so hard for all that we stand for isinspiring. Even though Ish couldn't accomplish what he wantedit's good to see he had a moment of clarity at the end of hislife. For then he realized how the only constant is change, andthat Earth Abides.","This book Earth Abides by George R. Stewart is about a man who passes by a massive disease which basically obliterates the US. This man, Ish, has to come to realization of this huge crisis and try to find survivors. It goes on and on about his thoughts and shows the struggles that he faces it the horrid situation. He goes around america finding survivors and ends up making a huge family in the end.This book was basically boring and depressing because it was just lagging on and on about how he thought of everything. It made you want to fall fast asleep at times too. (something that i obviously did) I am one of those kind of people who likes adventure and this book had none. It just was one of those books that wanted to show how horrible things could happen to us if we don't watch it. It sort of chilling and makes you depressed to think that it could happen. George R. Stewart was probably giving a good message out when he wrote this, but in the sense that people want to live there lives without this catastrophe, it is not very good.I would not recommend this book to kids under the age of 12 because it probably is too advanced for them. Also because kids do not have to worry about this sort of horror happening to them at that young of an age. People who need to sleep at night and want to fall asleep fast, please read. If you like adventure and mystery in a book, please go find a different book.","The book held great promise in the first few dozen pages... a believable plague and a believable reason for the protagonist to have survived. It goes rapidly downhill from there. The lead character, Ish, is pompous, self-absorbed, grating, and oh so very tedious. Even giving credit to the fact that the book was written in 1949, there are some very basic errors. Canned goods don't remain safe after 20 years, nor does gasoline remain usable. I kept reading hoping that the book would go somewhere, but it really never did. If you must download this book to your Kindle, do yourself a favor and pull down the sample. Read it, enjoy it, and move on. There's NOTHING more there. If you persist, don't say that I didn't warn you.","2 stars for the \"human\" emotional experience but the book lacked excitement and was mostly dull and depressing. The year of the rats, grasshoppers, etc. How original - not. The only thing the people did was marry more than one wife and breed. No one learned from \"George\" on how to keep the plumbing and houses in good order. No formal schools were set up so everyone learned to read so civilization could rebuild itself. They talked and made plans but never followed though.Ironic their small group refused to breed with a pretty but dim witted female because they didn't want dim witted children yet in terms of learning, each successive generation became dumber anyway. The author must like caveman because his little \"tribe\" is rapidly devolving into that era.","Many of the rave reviews for Stewart's post-apocalyptic novel are by readers who first read it many years ago. After prodding from a trusted reader-friend, I read it last month for the first time. Our hero, Ish, is uninspiring, and the other characters are wooden. Although the premise is a clever one, and many of the events that occur are unexpected and therefore interesting, it's difficult to get caught up in this story of mankind's fate after a disease wipes out most of humanity.Everything in the novel occurs within one man's lifespan, and it is therefore not surprising that Stewart exaggerates character traits so that mankind will swiftly evolve. But the characters are so unenlightened - Ish is the only one interested in teaching children to read, and he gives up after a while - that it's hard to take seriously Ish's assurance (to himself?) that these are average Americans.In short, an interesting concept but flawed in the execution.","If you like this kind of book, you must read this one. Written in the late 40's, this is the grandaddy of all apocalypse stories.","Earth AbidesEarth Abides, a novel by George Stewart taps into people's fascination of being the last one on earth. In this book the main character Isherwood Williams (Ish) survives arattlesnake bite in the mountains and returns to find almost every single person dead from a cataclysmic plague. Ish survives the plague and explores. While exploring he finds other survivors and they try re-founding American civilization. They live above San Francisco Bay in the Berkeley hills.Although this novel is well written and very real, I did not like it. The author put a lot of thought into it but it just didn't interest me. This book wasn't all boring, it hadsome good things about it. One of which is how it was frightening because this could really happen to mankind if we don't watch out, but there was more dull things than scarythings in this book. I also thought that it was weird that Ish and the rest of the community were so interested in caring on civilization instead of thinking about their own survival.The only reason that I finished this book is that it is based in the bay area and that is where I live so I can relate to the scenery that the author describes. If you didn't live in the bayarea then this would be one more thing that wouldn't interest you.I would not recommend this novel. It is interesting at the beginning but then gets boring. It is too long and the author seems to drag on subjects to the point where I don'tcare anymore. If you were going to read this book I would say it is best suited to high school or college students. If a young person read it I don't think that they would understand it.","Stewart's Earth Abides has long been considered a classic in the sci-fi genre and a classic apocalyptic novel (it even helped to inspire Stephen King's The Stand). And it is no wonder why. Stewart has a highly believable, excellently written story here. Though it does lose something in the the third part of the book, when Ish is an old man. One you should definately pick up.","I think I first read this book when I was about fourteen, and it made a powerful impression on me then, so much so that I could still remember almost the entire story some forty years later. But, given that youthful impressions are sometimes not all that accurate, I decided to re-read this and see if it is really as good as my memory said. It is.The scenario is simple: what would happen if a new virus suddenly wipes out almost everyone? And this is no ordinary disease, as the fatality rate is incredibly high, leaving (at most) perhaps one person in 100,000 alive. With this as a starting point, Stewart looks at his new world though the eyes of Isherwood Williams, who is something of a loner, intellectual in outlook, an observer, rather than a doer. This outlook stands him in good stead in the immediate aftermath of the great die-off, as it gives him a reason to live, to observe just how the Earth will react to the sudden removal of that pesky, environment-changing species called man. And reaction there is: ants, rats, dogs, cattle, cats, wheat, corn - each has its fortunes drastically impacted. Many of these changes are detailed in some interstitial material that is told from an omniscient viewpoint, very reminiscent of the similar technique Steinbeck used in The Grapes of Wrath, and perhaps these sections are just as powerful as Steinbeck's, though they don't have quite the great prose-poetry that Steinbeck had. By detailing these changes in this manner, Stewart makes his scenario both highly believable and very immediate.But Stewart's main focus is what happens to the very few people that are left. Ish eventually finds some other survivors, most especially the lady who will become his wife, Em, and here we find some buried social commentary that probably made this book quite controversial when it was first published in 1949, as Em is not white, a point made very subtly and never directly stated, as one of the clear messages here is that race, looked at from the standpoint of long-term survivability, is of absolutely no consequence.Another point of departure for this work from the standard disaster scenario is that there is no world-saving hero; mankind cannot get back on its feet in short order and re-establish civilization, and that the great majority of survivors would necessarily live off the leavings of the old civilization, for the simple reason that it is far easier to open a can of tomatoes than grow your own. That this same attitude of doing the minimum to survive would carry over into other aspects of post-disaster living, so that there would be little or no effort to teach children how to read or fix some of civilization's infrastructure as it slowly fails, such as electrical power or water supplies, is perhaps a debatable point, but Stewart's depiction makes this very logical and believable. Right alongside of this portrayed attitude is what do people do when there no longer is any `law': what is right and wrong and how do people cope with actions by some that threaten the survivability of the Tribe? The answer Stewart shows to this problem may disturb some people, but it strikes at the heart of the whole concept of `for the good of the many' and what personal moral responsibility is.Some have commented that this book is `dated', and there is some of this, as tube radios and phonograph turntables show just where technology was at the time of publication, but any serious reader will quickly realize that the specifics of the technology are immaterial to the thrust of this work. And perhaps somewhat ironically, there is one item detailed here that is as current as tomorrow's headlines, when Ish pulls down a book from the University shelves which details imminent climate change (keep in mind when this written!) and decides that this, too, is irrelevant to his current needs - the climate will be whatever it is, and mankind will just have to live with it.The last section of this book paints a very powerful picture of just how gods, legends, and social mores become ingrained in a society. Perhaps it's not the prettiest picture of where mankind is headed or how well he'll deal with problems, but it is remarkably plausible and will produce strong feelings of melancholy, despair, and (perhaps) subdued pride.A remarkable work which avoids just about all the pitfalls of typical post-apocalyptic works, and has a great deal to say about just what makes man man and what is truly relevant to the daily business of living.---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)","A virus wipes out 99.9% of the population, leaving the few stragglers left to figure out how to survive, organize (or not), etc. Don't be fooled into thinking that because this book was published in 1949 that it somehow won't be 'with it'. It's pretty well thought out, both in terms of what happens to the people AND everything else (dogs, cats, cattle, crops - things which other authors might leave out entirely), and in a departure (which I won't reveal here) from the usual 'we'll survive and things will eventually return to normalcy' plot so often present in this type of book.","Stewart's novel begins with a science fiction premised used by Stephen King in The Stand -- a virus quickly wipes out most of the world's population -- but from that point on, the two books (and others that have used this idea) are completely dissimilar. Stewart has little interest in the plague itself, and it is covered in a short part of the book. Rather, his interest is in how people react to being deprived of modern civilization. For years, his characters try to keep things going by teaching their children to read, and keeping memories of the old world alive. However, the drastically changed circumstances of their children's lives make this impossible, and the small group of survivors descend to a hunter-gatherer civilization.Stewart also addresses the question of what would ordinary people do who find themselves deprived of the protections of the law, and thus having to make their own difficult choices.Those who read this book expecting a typical science fiction novel will be disappointed. Stewart uses science fiction themes to explore significant issues in much the same way that George Orwell did in 1984. An excellent novel.","Apparently many of the reader-reviewers are science fiction or horror fans and thus compare Stewart's novel with that genre. Those readers are not likely to appreciate the ideas expressed in &quot;Earth Abides&quot;. Stewart was one of the first fiction writers to deal with ecology and human's place in the balance of nature and his extrapolations from anthropological thought of that period (1940's) are exceptional. It seems that many of the readers, without realizing it, got so caught up in the novel that they criticise the protagonist's character flaws as though he were a &quot;real&quot; human wanting him to be &quot;more insightful&quot; and less of a pedantic man. Those flaws appear to make him more authentic.Although classified as science fiction, the term speculative fiction is a better fit. It is interesting that the period of time covered, approximately 1948, to the present day, and although it was written in the late 1940's, it is still fresh today. Looking back, if there had been a catastrophe at that time, we would very likely today be at the point where the novel ends. A hundred years from now the novel is likely to be a classic and hopefully be on a shelf not labeled &quot;Science Fiction.&quot;","I know this is considered a classic, but, in my opinion, it does not pass the test of time. None of the characters, including the narrator, Ish, is engaging, and the passivity of the survivors is hard to accept. I don't need zombies to make PA fiction exciting, but reading about survivors who basically just live as if nothing has changed, happy to eat canned food is dull and depressing.","Well what can I say - if you want a book that will make you think about it not only whilst you are reading it but for a long time afterwards, then this is the book for you. The story is great and I thought Ish's character was great too - I know some people didn't like him (including my husband) - but I think that is just the point. He is a young man with little experience who thinks he knows everything because he has been to university, but really doesn't know that much at all. Sure he's not perfect but who is! He does the best he can and whilst we may not always agree, at least he is a believeable character. It has been a long time since I have read a book and thought \"wow\" when I was reading it and wanted to debate it for hours afterwards. The only other memorable books I can think of are \"Wild Swans\", \"Watership Down\" and \"Day of the Triffids\". This beats all of them! I followed \"Earth Abides\" with \"Timescape\" - which made me appreciate even more just how good \"Earth Abides\" really is.","\"...and the government of the United States of America is herewith suspended, except in the District of Columbia, as of the emergency...\"With those ominous words begins a classic tale of the end of human civilization. \"Ish\" (a graduate student whose given name is Isherwood Williams) is the barely tolerable protagonist who survives a rattlesnake bite (and possibly some strange infection) only to leave the forest and find a world of ghost towns. As Ish discovers, while he was in seclusion, engaged in fieldwork for his thesis, a virulent plague broke out worldwide and eliminated virtually every other human being from the face of the earth. Instead of descending into a drunken madness like one of the few survivors he meets, Ish roadtrips across the country looking for a vestige of the learned civilization he remembers. Alas, his quest comes up empty-handed, for, as he discovers, not many people have survived the plague, and those who did are (understandably) not too interested in higher education or high culture, preferring instead to focus on subsistence and maintaining their sanity. Along the way he picks up a loyal friend in the form of a dog, and finally returns to the Bay Area of California, where he meets a group of survivors and sets out to re-establish some kind of human community. In the second half of the novel, we follow the growth of this community and are faced with Ish's growing apprehension about humanity's future. Much to his chagrin, the aspects of civilization he prizes so much--music and art appreciation, reading and literature, mathematics and philosophy, etc.--seem to have no place in this new world where humans are once again a part of the natural order and not her proud conquerors.While the novel itself is quite a good read, filled with interesting speculative insights into human life after the collapse of modern civilization, Ish provides an aggravating example of the 1940s American white male ivory tower academic (his character's qualities definitely date the novel). When he encounters black survivors in the South, he muses about the possibilities of exploiting them and establishing his own little fiefdom. He continually considers his cohorts in the new community as his intellectual inferiors, even as they manage to carve out a new life in the face of this overwhelming calamity while he reads his books. That he spends more time worrying about the restoration of high civilization than about the very real issues of day-to-day survival that they face was also incredibly infuriating. Ish is at his most distasteful when he contemplates his son Joey, a boy whose sole worth seems to be the fact that he is bright and can read. Somehow, though, in spite of all his character flaws, Isherwood Williams ' arrogance and detachment are finally overcome by his circumstances, and he has, if not a complete change of heart, then at least an acceptance of the reality that \"men go and come, but earth abides.\"","This post apocalyptic book starts off strong with somewhat of a new twist on the traditional post-collapse civilization, as told by one graduate student and his struggle with a life after modern conveniences are gone. He is an observer kept alive as the second wave of deaths wash over the world by a mere need to observe and discover. I'll never forget reading as if with him while he waited for electric power to finally fail. The lights dim slightly and with this realization he waits up as a long time friend passes into oblivion. Several of the concepts are quite dated (the copy I read was re-released in the 70s but still referred to household items long since out of date and probably belonged in the original publication from '49).The main character is faced as being the only intellectual left in a small band of survivors he later deems \"The Tribe.\" This is the placement of the majority of the book and faces the questions of what humans would do with so much time on their hands? How they would adapt to a life with everything they need laying about them, but no deadlines to push them to reestablish a civilized world? It also conicals several things other books leave out, such as the adoption of odd superstitions about \"Americans\" by children who have never known a life with organized government or life outside of their small Tribe. I would give this part of the book a higher score, but the later portion fell short of my expectations and the standards set by the rest of the work.As the book continued it became quite redundant and predictable, and though I had high hopes the book would somehow redeem itself and return to it's previous glory, I was left disappointed. If you are looking for a book with a strong resolution upon completion, this is not a book for you. While I am glad I finished it (the first half was quite good), and several major problems were resolved, a larger picture of what would happen with the passing of the main character was left unsaid (though a general idea was obvious and alluded to several times). This portion of the book brought down the overall rating I could give.I would recommend this book as an easy read with an interesting take on the traditional end-of-the-world concept.","Earth Abides from George R Stewart is a good book about what would happen if suddenly the entire world population, except for a few, would die from a disease. As such, the book is remarkable as one of the first post-apocalyptic novels in existence (dating from 1949). And it is a very well thought through one too. Aiming for realism, exploring the various effects and problems the survivors would face, it renders the many successive post-apocalyptic stories as merely unrealistic popcorn stories. However, don't expect the story to \"draw you in\". The events are typically kind of boring, and even though there is a distinct set of characters, they never really develop. Further, the writing style is not always really gripping, but rather unexciting. Also the dated moral reflections might be a let down for some, but I suppose that is mainly caused by the time the book is written.The book details a number of time periods: just after the epidemic, 5 years later, 20 years later, and 50 or 60 years later. The time in between is sketched very roughly. The story centers on Ish, a survivor of the mysterious epidemic. Ish is an academic, working on his (PhD?) thesis in Biology. We learn later that if the epidemic would not have struck that Ish would probably end up as a professor (like the writer). Ish is, apparently, the only 'thinker' left on the world, and all the people he meets are about (or under) average on IQ and ideas, but not necessarily in other practical matters. Ish is an observer, not really a natural leader, and he does his best to plan a safe way for the remaining people towards a new civilization. However, it becomes clear, that even though Ish knows a lot and has many skills, that a lot of work and ideas hardly influence the people in his community and that he fails on many great planned things, even though he also has some unexpected success with small but eventually rather important things.The good part of the book, what makes it a classic, is that it explores most issues you can think off about what would happen if such an epidemic would occur. It explores the psychological effect in the beginning, the scavenging of the stores for existing goods, the mingling of very different average people in a group, the effect on the rest of the ecology by the sudden disappearance of men, the effect of aging on materials, infrastructure and goods, the way the average people would face these changes, (small) group interactions, diseases, unnecessary skills (e.g. reading), the automatic development of groups of people, and the limited effect of the ideas of the intellectual few (maybe dealing with some of the writer's own frustrations). And probably I forgot a few explored ideas as well.However, the book is not perfect, and not a classic in the sense of some Heinlein, Clarke or Asimovs that I have read. Some flaws: characters are rather stereotypical, the main character seems to be a bit thick and single minded at many points (irritating sometimes), all characters have a great lack of initiative and many times things just stay as they are, but also not all ideas are fully (satisfyingly) worked out. Also some logical plot holes exist, and timescales of things happening seem to be bended a bit to fit with the lifetime of the main character.However, in spite of the many small flaws I shortly pointed out, I can still recommend the book. It is not for everyone, and certainly not for people that look for a really exciting story, but the discussed ideas and the thoroughness in which many of those are explored (making it a kind of hard-scifi book), combined with the historical value of this book as a very early post-apocalyptic book make this book really valuable and read-worthy. If you are not immediately letdown by its flaws and if you are interested in idea-books and speculative fiction, I would certainly give this one a try.","It's been awhile since I read this book, but what I remember about this book is that it insults you and basically says that if you haven't gone to college and grad school that you cannot be intelligent or sire intelligent children. The author writes this book about the one truly intellegent person left alive. He portrays the rest of the survivors, who are average non-college educated, blue collar types, as little more than simpletons. The main character and the author doesn't even try to have the survivors learn to use the left over technology to help better their situation because they are too dumb. When they reproduce only Ish sires an intellegent child. The rest of the chilren are all dumb like their parents. Bah, that's it. My hatred for this book is off my chest. I don't reccommend it.","Having loved this story 20 years ago as a teenager, it pains me now to find that it is surely the most badly written book on my bookshelves. All the characters are two-dimensional. The dialogue is uniformly stiff and amateurish. Worse, there's a faintly fascist tone running throughout the entire story that I failed to notice as a callow youth, but that now reveals itself on almost every page. Perhaps the saddest aspect of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that the story is clearly and shockingly the fantasy of an author who was very probably an insecure misfit who dreamed of existing in a world without people, or at least with just a handful of simple folks over whom he could rule as their intellectual master. If Stewart had spent some time in analysis, &quot;Earth Abides&quot; might never have been written. It is a truly awful book.","Plot Kernel - A deadly virus has nearly annihilated the human race, leaving all other life untouched. Civilization has ended. A survivor searches for others and eventually joins with a woman who lost her family in the epidemic. In time, he becomes the leader of a few families who have intermarried and who together live off the abundant supply source of the otherwise uninhabited city.","I love post-apocalypse fiction, but I can't figure out why everyone likes this one. The first 1/3rd of the book is great, as the main character experiences what becomes of his world after everyone else dies. Then it's as if the last half of the book was written by a female. It's mostly introspective, about how the character feels, and nothing really happens. If you want a page turner from front to back, read 'Alas Babylon','One Second After', or 'Without Warning'. I would donate this book to my local library, but I would feel guilty knowing some poor guy might pick this up and waste as much time on it as I did.","Great story of what would happen if a lazy / self proclaimed intellect survived the human apocalypse. Ish may have let thousands of years of basic knowledge disappear without getting off his highchair for a second. But, in the end at least \"Jingle Bells \" survived his incompetence and carried on.","I was very excited when I received this book, because I had read great reviews about it. However, it did not hold up to my expectations. The first two thirds of the story consist of the main character driving back and forth across the country looking for survivors (that is as far as I made it- leisure reading should not have to be a chore). When he does encounter survivors, he only stays for a brief time to visit with them and moves on. That is it. There are no conflicts. There is no tension or threat from others or nature. No plot. He simply drives back and forth looking for people, discovers them, and then moves on. I have never read anything more boring, not even required readings for courses I have taken. Perhaps this book was the first of its kind when it came out, and that may be why it has such acclaim, but the storyline is nonexistent. On the up side it does have some very well written descriptions of the land and animals (that is the only good thing I can say about this book).","Wordy, verbose, unrealistic. Meeting around a table with the woman who eventually gives him children, written like a bad female romance novel.Emotionally mature hunter-gatherers evolve from his haphazardly raised progeny. Unrealistic ending, which was a slog to get to.","If you are easily depressed or get melancholy, do not read this book. If the thought of the human race dying out and mother earth thriving gives you the warm fuzzies, then this book is for you. After the major opening disease-kill tragedy there's *some* hope for man... then less hope for man... then a little more hope for man... then a *lot* less hope, and on, and on. It's an emotional roller coaster that, on average, only looses altitude. In the end, earth wins, man looses. I had 100 pages remaining to read and finally had to flip to the last page so. I. could. just. &quot;end it&quot;. Yuk. Two weeks later I still have a bitter taste in my mind. If you like sci-fi's such as &quot;ender's game&quot; I predict you'll hate this book too. My hope here is that I've saved somebody else the pain.","I started becoming interested in the post-apocalyptic genre after watching a few episodes of the TV show \"Jericho\" (which is quite interesting in Season 1). While searching this category on Amazon, \"Earth Abides\" popped up a few times along with several other titles. I picked up a copy and read it last weekend. The plot and the characters are mildly interesting and I guess I should cut it some slack having been printed back in 1949. However, I have to say as you get more than halfway through the book, the story line just seems to drag on and on and is generally pretty boring. As I neared the end I found myself skimming from page to page and just praying it would finally end. The copy I bought was used and I threw it away when I was done to prevent someone else from wasting their time with it.By comparison, I also bought a used copy of \"Alas Babylon\" (also printed in the 1950s time frame) and I can safely say it is a far more interesting read after only being about 100 pages into it.","I was very disappointed in this book. It was slow, boring, filled with uninteresting characters, and the writing was extremely stilted. And I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to accept that automobiles would still operate after sitting around with gasoline in their tanks for thirty years. I skimmed through most of the book hoping something interesting would happen, but I was utterly dissappointed. There are better books in this genre, don't waste your time with this one.","A half-century ago, Stewart saw too clearly a future which could, indeed may yet, come to pass. He, and only a few others, survive a world-wide plague. How he attempts to preserve his society - how he prioritizes, what agonizing choices he and his 'flock' make, the compromises they have to accept - makes for among the finest end-of-the-world books ever written. Ish, the main character, is no less uncertain, no less fascinating, than Macbeth. Ish is clearly the everyman each of us could see in him/herself after a catastrophe impossible to imagine. A long book - it could be no less - by its end, one hopes for a sequel. It is not clear whether Stewart is optimistic about this future - and that too is appropriate. For every reader will probably come to a different conclusion as to where the 'tribe' is headed based on his/her own perceptions of what Ish did correctly or otherwise and what the reader might have done differently. No modern home library is complete without Earth Abides.","George Stewart provides a compelling &quot;thumbnail&quot; picture of mankind and how adversity can bring out the best and worst in people.

For more than 15 years I have been looking to recapture the insights I discovered in reading the book as an impresionable teenager. How ironic that is technology that now presents me with the opportunity to read it again","I have spent twenty years &quot;selling&quot; this book to friends and acquaintances as a must read.

A perfect book for discussion groups","Lost Books -- Review Number 1 Earth Abides by George R. Stewart D. D. Shade 6/11/98Had Isherwood Williams lived to see our day, with it's social and political decay, he might not have worried so much about &quot;preserving&quot; our culture. As it happens in George R. Stewart's book, the devastating viral plague that cleanses the earth of nearly all human life occurred approximately 50 years ago. Long before the assination of John or Robert Kennedy or Martin Luther King, Jr. Long before the war with Vietnam. Before we put a man on the moon and then cut the space program. Before the pervasion of television and the computer revolution. Before the escalation of the cold war, AIDS, or most of the great serial killers. In other words, Earth Abides takes place in a time that many Americans with gray hair look back upon with nostalgia. The post World War Two years, when those of us between forty and fifty were born. The boomer years. A time of great prosperity. A decade that saw the birth of rock-n-roll, hamburgers, and Oreo cookies. Yet it was a time of great poverty for some. When restrooms, restaurants, and the seats in public transportation were separated by the color of ones skin. When equal pay for equal work was unheard of and a woman's place was in the home. A time when the word 'communist' was the dirtiest and deadliest thing one could call another. An altogether strange time, know as the fifties. It is into this world that Isherwood suddenly finds himself alone. Victim of a freak snakebite while out in the wilderness working on his graduate thesis and survivor of an even more freak accident, the development of a viral plague that wipes out humankind in a matter of weeks. It is altogether fitting that someone named Ish, this is how he signed his name to a hand scrawled will while delirious from the snake bite, should find himself alone in the world. Ish, David Pringle tells us , is a direct reference to the historic Ishi, a California Indian who became famous as the last living representativ! e of his tribe. Ish spends at least a quarter of the book searching for others. He finds a few, lucky people with great immune systems, and in the process stumbles upon the woman with whom he shares the remainder of his years. Together they try to build a community and at the same time rebuild civilization as they had know it. You will have to read the book to learn of Ish's heroic triumphs and failures as he tries to make sure the future has a heritage. Although following the traditional post-apocalyptic formula, that of the earth being cleansed by some means and leaving a few to rebuild civilization, Earth Abides offers some interesting commentary on some central moral questions of our/that time. One of those is racial unrest. Given the nature of European and African American relations in this nation in 1949, Stewart was taking a quite a risk when he developed one particular central character, Em. Ish chooses a strong willed, able, out-spoken, African American woman to be his mate. She was not the first female Ish found, nor was she the best looking, but she had within her the strength to become the mother of a new civilization. Ish recognized this and fell in love with her quickly. And Ish was right-Em alone had the strength and courage to bear the first child in the small community that had grown around them. There was no one who knew how to deliver a baby, and that was frightful enough, but the greatest fear was not knowing if children born into the world would inherit their parents immunity to the plague. Earth Abides is considered a classic by several sources but to my way of thinking, it deserves that exalted position in speculative fiction for having been a forerunner is demonstrating that black and white can live together. Stewart further shows us how important is the relationship between past and future. He does this symbolically through the vehicle of a 4-pound, single-jack hammer. At the beginning of the book, just before the snake bite, Ish is exploring a cave and finds this hammer. It is the! kind miners used in the old days when rock-drills were placed by hand. It is called a single-jack because it can be used with one hand. Ish notes the pleasure he feels when he finds the hammer because of its tie to the past. Even delierous from snake bit, he remembers to take the hammer with him. He keeps it with him throughout the book. As the community grows around Ish and Em, the hammer is used each year to chisel the numbers of the year on a big rock in the hills above where they live. It is always present on the mantel in Ish's living room. And at the end of the book, when Ish has grown old and the younger men, his and other's children, sense that he is ready to pick a new leader for the community, they wait in a circle at his feet for Ish to pick the next leader by giving them the hammer. The importance of tradition to the family and the community is symbolized in the single-jack. John Clute and Peter Nicholls feel that post-apocalyptic or disaster stories are so popular because they appeal to secret desires we all share: a depopulated world, escape from the constraints of a highly organized industrial society, and the opportunity to prove one's ability to survive. I choose the latter of the three. Post-apocalyptic speculative fiction provides a window from which to view the &quot;stuff&quot; of which humankind is made. The writer of a disaster or holocaust story can pit humans against the worst possible odds. The post-holocaust novel gives us the ability to perform an experiment that in reality would be unethical-to put a group of people in hell and record their progress getting out. Earth Abides is a moving, triumpal story of just such a group. No single character in Earth Abides has the stereotypic appeal of Bruce Willis or Nicolas Cage, and yet I came to love them all and worry about their conditions because they were real people. People with many of the same problems and weaknesses I have. People whose actions made me stop and wonder what I would do in the same situation.","I had been really looking forward to this book. Sadly, it really didn't deliver. I found the story telling very linear, the main character Ish, lacking in any real depth and the logic of how he and his small band of people survived, very questionable.I found the first 1/3 of the book interesting. The main character Ish, travels the US in search of other survivers of the deadly plague that ravenged the world. It read more as a travel logue than an sci-fi book, but never the less, was still interesting. However, one would be better served reasing the book, \"A world without us\".Ish, seems nonplused by the vanishing of humanity. The character uses \"logic\" to deal with the situation, but calls those who are enotional or \"crazy\" as being in shock. Frankly, it appeared to me that Ish was in shock, due to his lack of emotion over the loss of basically everyone. It was as if he rationalized it this way, \"wow, everyones gone, oh well, I'm lonely, but that's the breaks\".Finally, gathering enough other stragglers together to form \"the tribe\", they seem to live solely on old can goods from local markers for...22 years!!. I don't know about you, but the last thing I would eat was a can of food that was 22 years old.It appears as if everyone in the \"tribe\" was hit with the stupid stick. Any normal parent would teach their kids the basics of reading and writing, not these folks, it's as if they all just gave up. Plus there is a point in the story where it's highlighted that none of the children even know numbers! WTF? Any normal parent teaches their kids how to count their freaking fingers and toes!Also, the book was written in 1947, yet no one in the book knows a thing about gardening! No one had victory gardens during the war? No one lived on ration cards?It's like all these people dropped out of the sky.There are some many other things wrong with this book, I could go on for pages.Why did I give it 3 stars? 1 for it was a post apocolypic story, the second for the first 1/3 was okay, and lastly, the 3rd star because there were some mildly interesting moments.Beyond that, it's like a group of morons running around in a dark room trying to find the switch.","A brilliatnly written socio-sic-fi. Though the book is a bit austere for the scope fo the catastrophe, it is truly a wonderful tome! Like the later work of Stpehn King's The Stand, Earth Abides explores the questions and illustrates the harrowing reality that might be if a \"super\" disease were to kill most of man-kind.Thought provking and beautifully crafted.","Earth Abides, a novel by George R. Stewart, is an excellent novel that depicts a possible scenario for a post-apocalyptic world. It provides people with a fantasy realm with questions of what could happen and what will happen all through the eyes of the novel's main character, Ish. He joins up with a couple of survivors in what he sees fit for the new world and they create a society that tries to cope with it. George Stewart further enriches the story with character chemistry and strong elements of theme.Themes of survival and love are strongly present throughout the novel. Ish's strong will to contain the community he had once known pushes him to survive so he can teach the next generation of what good can become of it. His relation to Em also draws out the love and caring in Ish.George Stewart uses chemical equations between characters to draw an exact importance of each person in their society. He chooses a man named George who is a carpenter to build and repair homes. He has a friend named Ezra, who acts as an advisor to Ish. They all piece together to form Ish's envision of a good society.The topic that concerns Ish the most is the community he had once known. Ish, who is trying to inflict positive change in society, is cursed with the inability to change himself.Throughout the book, he learns to trust his society and the future, which is dependent on him to lead them. He learns of the differences between the two generations and tries to blend in. He goes through many experiments, which has led in to some disaster and many good.Earth Abides is a great novel about the fantasy and high possibility of a post apocalyptic world. The characters and themes in the novel are beautifully inscribed drawing an essence of drama and suspense into an already stone set feeling of both feelings. Reprising themes of love, survival and many other themes are present to enrich the story. Earth Abides, a novel by George R. Stewart, is a novel I'd recommend to anyone who is interested in character chemistry and the post-apocalyptic ideology of George R. Stewart.","Societies Rise and Decline but the Earth Abides In the classic apocalyptic novel Earth Abides George R. Stewart creates a nightmare on earth that could occur tomorrow when a massive unknown epidemic obliterates almost all of society. A young man named Ish is forced to search for companions on this barren, naked earth void of human life. He searches for sensible people to aid him in his quest for survival and mental sanity. Em is the person who keeps Ish sane and through her love and courage helps him to face the future. Together they find a group of companions, and together they establish a tribe in the Berkeley Hills in the Bay Area. George Stewart1s powerful and realistic writing captivates the reader and makes one imagine how each of us would react in Ish1s situation. Even though his novel gets rather slow in the middle with few dramatic events adding to the plot, Stewart demonstrates the harsh situations and triumphs of life this small nucleus of mankind must face without modern society. Stewart1s writing fascinates the reader by exploring the actions of the offspring of the original seven tribe members and shows how people develops without modern society and all its conveniences. Stewart shows how all-human societies have come about, by tracing the development of this small tribe that survives a cataclysmic disaster. In the novel Stewart puts Ish and the tribe through many difficult trials as they struggle to survive. He is able to create an almost unimaginable situation and turn it into a reality. Each character is developed so well that the reader is able to experience the events. Ish1s leadership is strengthened by Em1s courage and Ezra1s loyal friendship. Because the reader can relate to these believable characters in this unbelievable situation, it is easier for the author to relate his point. Stewart fascinates the reader by showing how man develops with all his customs and superstitions and without a modern society. While reading about the tribe1s triumphs and failures we are able to step back from the modern world and see how civilization perhaps developed. The author examines the growth and characteristics of individual characters. What each of them bring to enable this tribe to survive, show how a society begins and flourishes. Em brings her courage, Ish brings his knowledge and his leadership, George is the carpenter and so on. Each member of the tribe contributed to the betterment of the whole society. Then at that point we are able to see the growth of society again, as if it was cut out from man1s actual past history, when ancient tribes started to develop. . At first the challenges are just simple, to fulfil the basic necessities of survival like shelter, water and food. Once these needs have been fulfilled, the tribe progresses to larger concerns such as education of the younger generations, keeping records and calendars, rules and exploration. Eventually the tribe integrates with outside members sometimes successfully, sometimes not. For instance when Charley comes back with the Robert and Richard he brings disease and chaos to the tribe. The tribe had the difficult decision of banishing him or killing him to protect their way of life. Many of them, including Joey who was the hope for the future as a leader because of his intelligence, die because of this outside influence. Later however the tribe successfully mingles with another tribe, which helps their society grow because there are more possibilities for men and women to find mates in a larger society.All through the novel Stewart accurately demonstrates the development of a simplistic society with all its triumphs and failures, to symbolize the history of human development. He is able to show that future societies would develop as past societies have as long as basic human needs are met. When people have food, shelter and more importantly significant human relationships then a society can begin. The society that Stewart creates starts with two people who found each other in the midst of chaos. They unite with others with whom they are compatible and from this small group a multi generation society formed. In his lifetime Ish saw a society develop. He saw his children and grand children and great grand children living happily. Through Ish1s eyes, the author masterfully shows all of us how societies rise and decline but how through it all the earth itself abides. Stewart in this famous apocalyptic novel captures the reader and artfully demonstrates the nature of human societies.","This book is one of the most moving and realistic surival novels that I have ever read, the suceive plauges of Domsicated animals and pests for one, and the point that the most brilliant minds of of western, and Gobal Civilization would break under the strain of the end of civilization seems all to true. Though the very end of the book was depressing(as San Fransico burns, and the Part about the new Human tribes) but even though civilization is pushed under, it is suggested that it will rise again in the far future though as we watch civilization unravil as Isherwood tries to pick up the peices is heart breaking, his attempt at a school is sad and the way that he finally breaks under the strain of being remembered as a god. This is a great classic of Sf Read this book!!","It really made me think about the sensativity of the planet and society of every day life.","Earth Abides is a great book for the reader new to the science fiction genre. Isherwood and Em are strong characters. The building of a new society is intriguing. I read this book over 25 years ago and I still remember it fondly as my introduction into science fiction books.","I have read and re-read this book over the years. It is riveting, entertaining and more than likely prophetic. The bomb that may destroy us all is the one we can not defend against, the incurable, quick-acting and all powerful virus. A nuclear Dooms-Day could not be more horrifying.","The well conceived story captures the imagination from the start. That's why we buy books like this...right? The intellectual and forward looking main character reminded me of the captain in &quot;The Last Ship&quot;. Read it!","George R. Stewart weaves at once a beautiful and hauntingly believable tale with this novel, one that I've never been able to forget...or wanted to. Once considered dated, with the lessening of global nuclear tensions, the scenario Mr. Stewart envisions for a possible worldwide catastrophe, one brought about not by bombs but disease, has once again come to the forefront and become the most plausible ingredient in mankind's demise. More even than the fact that this is a truly enjoyable read is the deeper message Earth Abides shares with the reader as it reaches down and touches our very hearts, defining what it means to be human in an inhuman environment. The symbolism involved in Isherwood Williams' desire to keep a hammer with him for the future as a tie to the past is obviously an unconscious comment on his personal hope of rebuilding a fallen civilization. A hope that goes unfulfilled in his life time and maybe many lifetimes to follow. The insight into the human psyche that Mr. Stewart demonstates as he carries Isherwood from his youth at the beginning of the book to old age and finally death at the end and Isherwood's subtle change of attitude during that process, rings exceedingly true and speaks volumes about Mr. Stewart's keen and perhaps unique ability to put into words what it really means, or at least should mean, to be human. I've rarely read a book more than once because I just don't have the time, but I've read Earth Abides several times since I was a teen and I know I'll read it several more times before I too reach that stage in my life that Isherwood assures us won't be the calamity our youth oriented culture would have us to believe.","Science Fiction books are hard to remain classics given our growing understanding of science and technology. Earth Abides is an exception because it is written from the perspective of an anthropologist trying to cope with the fact that his world has been destroyed. Like many readers this book changed my life&gt; I read it in my teens, in my 20's and I guess it is time to pick it up again in my 30's.","There are plenty of other reviews that go more in-depth as to why this book is amazing at the top of the list, but i just wanted to contribute to its stats, and give you my .02$Its memorable to the core, i read it almost a year ago now, and have read a decent handful of post-apocalyptic fiction between now and then, and this one really stands out in my mind.From the very beginning it was gripping, and only got better. It didn't focus on the die-off, but on the aftermath, and how it affected the environment, wildlife, and the anthropological ramifications.Once he does meet up with fellow survivors, there's no great battles with cannibals, not even starvation, but just life. The book really gets down to the core of what it is to be human, and what is important, and how different types of people have different priorities, and how these different ways of thinking would affect the rebuilding of human society in a near extinction level event.It both gives you hope, then rips it away, and makes you question what is really important in life. It makes you wonder if the way of life we are living in our modern world is natural, or a freak coinsurance. perhaps it would happen again if somebody hit the &#34;reset&#34; switch.","A bit dated, but a good read nontheless. Some parts are very wrong (such as gasoline, tires, and batteries for a jeep keeping so long, or that all of the stores of weapons and ammunition back when it was written (M1 garands, M1 carbines, 1911s, and all of the civilian models) not being available after the military and most people are gone. But still very imaginative and well written.","This was a real change for me, which I was looking for in a book at the moment. Not an &#34;action&#34; book, but still holds you spellbound at times, and often I couldn't put it down. It had it's slow areas, but not enough to distract from the total experience. A thought provoking story from the 40's I believe - but you will find yourself thinking about things in every day life a little differently. Definitely a good read!","I found this book to be amazing. It is a very detailed -- at times almost too realistic -- depiction of life after an apocalypse. I found Stewart's handling of societal changes quite believable, and more sophisticated than many more modern works. He also does a great job drawing characters that we can believe.I read somewhere that the author was shocked that this is still on the top of many \"The Best of Science Fiction\" lists. Since he set out to write a literary adventure story, and not science fiction. So be it.Whatever you call it, though, it is riveting.","It led the way for so many great apocalyptic yarns, and was influential in literature and in creating an awareness if the fragility of society. Isherwood was a paradigm for most civilized men. He was content to observe life, and was only dragged into life by his wife. When society fell, he calmly observed the fall of civilization, along with it. He dreamt of rescuing civilization...but settled for surviving on it's leftovers.I wonder how many preppers read this in their formative years.","I have read this book several times and it is a timeless classic. It leaves you feeling what the main character would feel under the scenario that this book was created.The World Without Us","The latest post-apocalyptic fiction seems to focus on dealing with deadly infected persons. What if they just all died and a small group had to start over. This book focuses on a main character who is more human than the supermen of modern apocalypse, he's not an ex-special forces operative with pre-med and a welders certificate who grew up on a farm. He's a little lazy, has some relationship issues, a mediocre teacher and in the end is just a normal guy dealing with population events.","A very original and unique plot, particularly given that it was written in 1949, makes this book a great read and not to be missed for fans of the post-apocalyptic sci-fi genre. Most every book since written in this genre borrows elements from this book. The pace of the story moves well and there are many sub-plots which are interesting (in particular, the main character makes frequent introspective observations that are thought-provoking about humankind). Of particular note is how relevant the book is today, over 60 years after it was written.My main negative critique is the general prose and writing style. It is impossible to believe that the author was an English professor... very basic sentence structures, little in the way of character development, and a ridiculous over-usage of exclamatory statements from the novel's characters (literally hundreds of exclamation marks throughout the book). The Kindle version had a number of typos as well.Still a worthy four-star book given its deep and compelling observations on humankind and a very clever and original plot.","I had great expectations when I started this book and got out of it slightly unsatisfied. The book shows pretty well what civilisation is about and how much it is fragile. Also how much civilisation relies on a few individuals only. All the lost knowledge in the library no one can understand remains as a vivid image in my mind.In spite of some theories underlaying the story being already out of date, that book poses essential issues and the empathy we develop for Ish in his efforts and trials to answer them and maintain some civilisation makes the story moving.","This is one of my favorite books. Written in 1949, it's remarkably contemporary and accessible. I love the references to hifi. It seems to me more of a work of philosophy; a meditation on humanity, relationships, change and civilization, which is precisely why it's so timeless. It's also something of a love story and there is a gentle tenderness pervades the entire story. Ish is a wonderful character. As the world is completely and unalterably transformed around him, he strives for continuity and permanence. In the end, his striving is for naught, he's failed. But there is no bitterness and remorse but an acceptance of the world around him and the love that expressed itself in his relationships with others. The story wasn't anything like I thought it would be, much better.","I read this book when I was in middle school, probably 1982, and it's impressive that it seemed futuristic even at that time when it had been written decades earlier. With the imminent release of \"I Am Legend\" I was reminded of this book again as a different take on post-apocalyptic literature.I said it was memorable but flawed because it gave an interesting early look at the idea of a pandemic, and the aftermath of such, but didn't seem to give a realistic take on the survivors' civilization. Why would people suddenly give up their institutes of religion, for example? Historically, when has this happened? He has black people in the south growing cotton \"just because\" and worshipping crocodiles (I don't know if this was a racist component or not.)In the end, his view was rather too cynical and unrealistic about the way people react to the loss of technology. Technology isn't what makes people great, it is their values. I think he didn't realize that.","I first read this book in high school -- 1964! And, loved it soo much I &quot;forgot&quot; to return it to the library &lt;blush&gt;. I've re-read it numerous times over the years and enjoyed it every time. I hope you enjoy it, too. It's a tremendous read.","If you like post-apocalyptic sci-fi, as I do, you'll probably enjoy this book. The book starts out strongly but peters out toward the middle after the narrator settles down and becomes embarrassingly introspective about how himself and what it takes to build a civilization. Parts of the book are clumsily written and pretentious. If you want better apocalyptic fiction, try John Wyndham or John Christopher.","I love end-of-the-world fiction. Call me a gourmand of it, if you will. Well, one story I had missed was, &quot;Earth Abides&quot;. So, I read a lot of reviews here at Amazon and I decided to buy it.I gave it three stars because I did not finish it. Usually, I can read anything. Even bad fiction becomes a challenge to conclude; disappointing fiction is a different story. It's just isn't my type. Though, I can appreciate what others see in it.Summary: A fellow goes off hiking and is bit by a rattlesnake. After his near-death experience and recovery (lasting about 2 weeks), he comes back to society to find no one home. The book follows his life as he: travels, struggles, meets other survivors, starts a fledgling society.The strengths of this book encompass one man's struggle to survive an unthinkable situation. It is wonderful at explaining some the effects of a global disaster in which only the people are gone. Our ordinance remains. But all eventually decays. The next generation of human society loses it cerebralness, but gains an innate link to the earth. Man exterminated by a virus with extreme prejuidice has now become just a creature not a ruler of the earth.In fact, just as I am typing this out; I am getting excited to read it. But, here come the negatives.The weaknesses are few, but very important. Characterization. Stereotypes abound, while the earth abides. Women are merely wombs needed for their matronly duties. Which would be true in this case. But there is no other extrapolation of feelings and thoughts for the women other than a prehistoric regression of their being and worth. All other characterizations are weak. The protagonist grows on in years but not in emotional or intellectual depth.There are other things that I did not like in the book. When things start to break down, our hero does nothing to stop it; even when he has others to help him. On grand scale, when the infrastructure fails, nothing is done. Not even attempted. One man may not be able to save a power plant or water system. But a group could. Well, possibly. After all, they have all the time in the world. Even if the those infrastructure repairs are ignored, what about personal systems? Our hero is a graduate student in Geology, and this book was only written 50 years ago. The Cold war is in it's infancy. Bomb shelters, survival gear are not unheard of. Oh well. That's what I don't like.Conclusion: I think if I was a teenager I might have read this book differently. But being in my early 30s and a scientist skews my notion of this type of fiction. Please read this book. You may be able overlook, or not even think what I pointed out were points against it. Personally, I'd suggest reading, &quot;The Stand&quot;, &quot;Warday&quot; or &quot;I am Legend&quot;.","I hate this book. I truly hate it, more than any other novel I've ever read outside of fundamentalist hate-drivel. That's saying a lot for me, given that I love reading and I particularly enjoy sci-fi books and those with apocalyptic themes (morbid, yes, but what can you do).The reason I loathe this book with the burning fire of ten thousand suns is the blobs of useless goo that pass for the main characters. They don't DO anything. Sure, they do the usual things like eating and sleeping and scratching their nether regions, but that's about it. As I read through this train-wreck I wanted to grab a bullhorn and scream into the book for them to do something, ANYTHING, to better their situation or try to learn something new or to show an emotion of any kind. The author has the main characters sitting around and eating out of tin cans and twiddling their thumbs for-get this-forty-two YEARS. Not a few months while they get the hand of harvesting fresh food, not a year or two while they learn new trades or research better ways to go about things, but forty-two freaking years.They don't even bother to teach their kids to read. There's one kid named Joey, whom the main character Ish keeps thinking, \"Garsh, he's the one!\" (repeated often), and ponders the possibility of teaching this precocious seven-year-old how to read, but Joey suddenly dies of illness. Presumably, so does civilization, because the passel of thirty-odd other kids running around at this point are deemed by Ish to be either too stupid or too disinterested for him to bother getting out of his Lay-Z-Boy and teaching them the ABC's. Obviously the author has never been around children. The ONE thing he does teach them, and he refers to this as his \"legacy,\" is to show them how to make a bow and arrows.The basic message of the book is \"Yup. We're screwed, folks, so give up early.\" Frankly, if I had been in the situation that these main characters were in, I'd do my damnedest to rebuild and make use of the remaining human world around me. I'd teach my kids how to read and how to use all the technology around them, and if I didn't know how to use something I'd find out how. I'd learn to farm and how to turn the electricity back on and basic medical care. I sure as hell wouldn't be sitting around for forty-two years staring at the wall.The only thing that kept the first half of the book from being used as toilet paper (don't ask about the other half) is that Stewart drops in the occasional interesting factoid about what would happen in nature if there suddenly were no longer any human beings. These facts are nicely offset from the story, set in their own paragraphs and in italics, so if you're interested in this sort of stuff you can skim through and read them fairly quick.","I was looking for a good \"end of the world\" type novel, and after the amazing reviews, chose this one. Disappointed hardly describes it. This is one that as a quick reader (usually finishing a novel in less than two days) it took me over a week of forcing myself to keep picking this back up. This was so anti-climatic it was boring.The most interesting thing about the story wasn't even told! One day, Ish wakes up to the aftermath of a world stripped of most humanity. Personally, I would have liked to read about the actual acts of the end of days, not the leftover start over.So Ish decides to drive all over the U.S. just observing, meeting some people along the way. Again, pretty dull. It is described well, and the writer is a good writer, but he doesn't seem to have anything to tell. He could have had more conflict, more interesting character, but it lacked this. In fact, until the end of the book, I didn't even know how old Ish was in the beginning. For a book that focuses on this main character, and pretty much the first quarter of the book is all about Ish, there is very little backstory and knowledge of him. Unacceptable.Instead the focus is on everything going on, well not going on, around Ish. The lack of people. The mess. The fires and fallen trees. Where has electricity and where doesn't. The looting.The most interesting thing he actually wrote about was the rise and fall of other species. I would have LOVED to read more about THAT! However, his telling of the ants, which was brilliant, was summed up in a few paragraphs while he took ages to tell the most boring parts.It also was unbelievable to me. Granted, this was written in the forties. But I hardly think for as long as time passed, even in simpler times, that people would live as they did without making more adjustments until they absolutley had to. I suppose some people might be that way, and I guess we'll never know until it happens.Honestly, I would have been more interested in reading about the other survivors than Ish, who was a procrastinator and thought very little of those closest to him.I would not recommend this book. Yes, it does stick with you. But not in a good way.","This book sucks. Cars don't run on 20 year old gas, canned goods go bad after time, You should probably learn how to grow your own food and get your own water before 20 years has passed... This book is not only dated, but just plain stupid in it's aspects of survivalism.","First, let me start off stating that I know this is suppose to be a classic; however, I found little to like in this book. It is a very, very long story where nothing happens...really. After a couple hundred pages I started to skip forward, looking for something to peak my interest. Nothing ever happens in this book...let me sum it up for you. 1) Plague, 2) a few people find one another, 3) they plant plants, 4) they plant more plants, 5) they watch the ants and rats die out, 6) they have kids and scribble on a rock for 20 years, the end.If you want to read a great post-apocalypse book, get One Second After or The Road. Either of these books blows this dull piece out of the water.","Great book. I really enjoy apocalyptic fiction. I have read a lot of it and this one has got to be towards the top of my list.This book takes on more of an human approach to the end of the world. There is not a great deal of action but the pace does not get sluggish. Unlike most end of the world fiction this one has a much broader scope and looks at the future of a \"Tribe\" of survivors instead of just the main character. Plus in most of these type of stories there is one main challenge and once that is defeated the story ends and that is all. Not at all the case with Earth Abides.The best part of the book for me was the 2nd half. There is a heart touching story of the main character and his son. Since I can't give away any spoilers it is hard to say what I like about the end other than the way the book hints at what life has become but only through glimpses of the main character.The reason I didn't give it five stars was the length. While it never drags it could have had some parts cut out and not effected the book at all. In fact, more than once I read something went to the next page and read such a similar page that I went back to make sure I had really turned the page. It only happened three times tops but still you start noticing that there could have been some trimming done.Great book, cheap book, fun read.","One of the origional Apotholyptic tales. Since this is probably how it will all end, it is internesting to see the authors views on environmental \"take back\" from humans. Good read, young or old.","I read this book based on other reviews - having searched for good post-apocalypse novels. After reading Cormac McCarthy's \"The Road\", I was preparing myself for a depressing, yet thought-provoking read. \"Earth Abides\" was a thrill to read, and I kept turning back to remind myself that it was originally published in 1949! I thought the complete absence of any \"modern\" references to today's highly computerized world would make the story instantly outdated, but in fact, the opposite was true, for if we lost power, we would have to revert to very basic skills, just like Ish and his tribe did. This truly is a book that will stay with me for a very long time. Highly recommended!","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it. This maturity is perceptible all along this work.The story is situated in a world devastated by a sudden pestilence that annihilates most of the humankind. Taking into account the last SARS epidemic that jumped abruptly from China to Canada it doesn't look an impossible scenario.Isherwood Williams comes down from an isolate spot in the mountains to discover an empty world. He starts a search all across USA, from California to New York and back again. He finds only isolate human cells, couples or trios, overwhelmed by catastrophe and in a near catatonic state. Returns to his native town and contemplate with a certain scientific detachment the fading world around him.Mr. Stewart intercalate brief vignettes describing what happens to dogs, cats, cattle, plants, roads, dams, bridges, contrasting them with Ish's daily experiences.Little by little the story grip reader's attention and even if action is somehow slow, the book can't be putted down.Human cells began to draw near each other and a rather feeble structure starts to grow up.This is the story.The author approaches universal questions about survival and extinction; civilization and savagery; social structure and anomie. He also examines religious values, ethics and the ultimate sense of life itself.This book gives the reader a lot of stuff to think about. A very enticing read!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","I read this book over and over, loving it more each time. It gives the reader alot to think about because even though it's ficitonal, it is still possible. It is about a man who goes up into the mountains for some time, gets bitten by a snake and becomes very ill. He rests in his mountain cabin for several days, coming close to death, but eventualy regaining his strength. When he left the mountains and headed back home, he noticed the town was dead...literally. Very well written. I bought a new copy because mine was falling apart. Buy this book.","Like some of the other reviewers, I read this book 25-30 years ago. It changed how I viewed the value of the work we do. Stewart makes a strong case that if we can't maintain the infrastructure of our phyical world (roads, bridges, water works, electric plants, etc.), all our knowledge about the rest of the world is for naught.Stewart also explores &quot;events in nature&quot; and how them affect humans. In his book Storm, Stewart quotes Sir Napier Shaw: &quot;Every theory of the course of events in nature is necessarily based on some process of simplification of the phenomena and is to some extent therefore a fairy tale.&quot;In Storm the phenomena is a Siberian wind blowing south; in The Earth Abides, it is a virus. In both cases the earth is fine, but human are worst for wear.By the way, like The Earth Abides, Storm, and a third Stewart book, Fire, are set in Northern California. Everyone familiar with the great Pacific storms or the forest fires, will find these books fascinating.","I enjoyed this book and appreciated the thoughtful way in which the author depicted how the world could be with only a few humans left in it. Stewart covers a lot of topics (religion, education, environment, race, family, marriage, etc.) and how they would evolve or devolve over several decades. He describes a world where random people are left alive and those people may not be the most suitable people to live under the new conditions. The story moves along fairly quickly and generally kept me interested, if not fascinated.Some other reviewers mentioned how the main character, Ish, seems a little devoid of emotion at times. I agree, but I found another trait in main character more annoying. He spends a large amount of brainpower philosophizing and lamenting the lack of intelligence and motivation in the rest of the tribe. While Ish does some teaching, the children never learn reading or basic math skills. They also never work on any improvement projects or learn to recreate any of the basic disposable items they use regularly. My complaint is that Ish doesn't do any of those things either. I blame him for many of their failings. You could say that his shortcomings are realistic, but it drove me a bit crazy.Overall, this was an enjoyable read.","This book makes me want to explore Amazon's return policy for Kindle editions.Barring that, it has made me learn how to delete items from my Kindle.It has also taught me to pay attention to negative reviews.It is simply awful. Why, then, 2 stars?Well, the story - once you get past its one massively huge, incredibly off-putting major flaw - isn't too bad. Many folks have pointed out factual issues (ever volatile gasoline and canned goods that never go bad), and called these fatal flaws. I attribute them to the publication date: maybe, in 194x, when personal automobiles, gasoline, and canned goods were still fairly new, it simply wasn't known that they both spoil? I don't know, but those details weren't killers for me.What ruined the story, then? The protagonist. Our hero. I've read books with villians who were infinitely more likeable than the main character, Ish. He's a contemptible, amoral, elitist sociopath and I feel dirty having inhabited his mind for the past 2 days.I can kind of understand his elitish judgement of the people around him. Again, consider the context of the 1940s. Even today, college degrees are relatively rare (even though I think many of us who have them forget this fact. They are almost universal in the people with whom I associate, but still only 10% of the US population have them.), and in the 40s they were rarer still. So our disgusting hero was part of an elite at the time, and the majority of the population probably did not possess even high school diplomas. Once I realized that, he became slightly less unpalatable.However, our hero, Ish, views the near extinction of humanity with no more emotion than I view an empty of box cereal in the morning. In fact, I think I have more emotion over the cereal. His reaction to learning his parents have died? Effectively, \"eh, so what. What's in the fridge for dinner?\" Similarly, for no reason, he considers simply shooting the dog that accompanies him and, later, decides to shoot two cows just because. Not for survival or meat, really, just because he had a gun and they were there.He has no qualms about simply looting whatever he needs (a viable survival skill, I'll grant you), but views with contempt a group he encounters on his road trip who didn't move into a more palatial home simply because they could - and who are doing a more effective job of adapting to their new situation.He meets a couple in New York who insist on pretending nothing has changed, and looks down upon him. Yet the rest of the book, he exhibits nearly this exact behavior - living off canned food rather than adapting. He constantly disparages his colleagues in the Tribe for lacking imagination and drive, yet for all his superior intellect and thinking and ideas, does exactly nothing to drive change.I thought, eventually, that the author had made him so utterly horrible deliberately and that, over time, we'd see a metamorphosis in Ish, an awakening in him that he was not the paragon of humanity he believed. There are hints, here and there: his admitting that, though she's stupid, his wife was the true strength in the Tribe, etc. But, in the end, this contemptible human is still full of himself, believing his descendent's view him as a 'god', and, sadly, is still the same, utterly obnoxious, foul human that he started as. He takes pride in this, too, which is pathetic: to have survived the death of civilization, to have had even a weak hand in its rebirth, and to believe that the experience has left you utterly unchanged, that you would have been the same person if society had simply carried on, is truly sad.","George Stewart's super-classic is my favorite SciFi sub-genre--the demise of man by one means or another. Stewart uses a pandemic virus which is a bit cliche--oops, wait a minute, he did it first! Everyone _else_ is the cliche. His writing is dark and literary, brought to life by his protagonist, Isherwood Williams', gloomy, introspective personality. Stewart does not develop the science behind the virus, but given that he wrote the story in 1947, I suppose he can be forgiven. On the other hand, H.G. Wells and Jules Verne forcast many technological wonders in their stories, so maybe Stewart could have gone out on a creative limb just a wee bit more than he did. Nevertheless, the real gem of the story is Stewart's portrayal of the demise of mankind--not the virus that reduced his population to a handful--but the demise of his culture, his literature, his creative energy. It seems we humans are what we are because with great numbers of people scarfing up every last spot of ground and every last resource, each individual has to be ever on his toes just to turn a buck. Take away the people, say, overnight, and the detritus of their civilization becomes easy pickings for the surviving few. No need to grow anything to eat--just open up a can. When they ran out of cans, it was almost as easy to hunt for dim-witted, slow-footed domestic cattle, now living in the wild. But the real casualty was culture. Several generations after Ish, people no longer spoke Ish's English, at least not so he could understand it. Culture too appears to be a product of crowds. Stewart set the bar for this SciFi sub-genre. There have been many since 1949, including my own example listed below, but he has yet to be equalled.--Ejner Fulsang, author of \"A Destiny of Fools\", [...] 2007","This is the granddaddy of post apocalyptic novels. Whenever I read this book I see bits of so many post apocalyptic novels in it. Well written, well delivered. If you like post apocalyptic books then read this one. It wasn't until the release of EARTH THE NEW FRONTIER that I read a better end of the world book than Earth Abides. Both of these are classics in the post-apocalyptic genre.","This is a book that rewards close reading--not skimming. Written in 1949, it is still a haunting and poignant read. Those who dismiss this as cliche must remember that this is the book that gave birth to the cliche, the first truly prophetic biological-apocalypse piece of writing, and all who come after must merely stand on its shoulders. Re-released in the &quot;SF Masterpiece&quot; series, and deservedly so.","Earth Abides is a book concerning a plague that kills off most of humanity and the survivors' attempts to reconstruct civilization. The pace of the book is rapid in the beginning and the reader doesn't have to get very far before they realize something terrible has happened. We are initially with one character, Isherwood Williams, who seems emotionally well suited to survive this tragedy in which 99% of everyone has died in the space of two to three weeks. The story continues with Ish traveling across the country looking for survivors and eventually returning to his home in Berkeley, CA where he meets a woman, Em, and they marry each other. Slowly a group of people calling themselves &quot;The Tribe&quot; forms and Ish tries to lead his small group back towards civilization and away from a more &quot;primitive&quot; existence.Strengths are the good character development as well as interesting asides on how the world is readjusting to no longer having man dominate it. It offers some interesting insights on human nature and societies in general and as a disaster book ranks highly on the list. In a sense it is like The Stand except for that this plague is strictly natural, not a tool for a climatic battle between good and evil. The plague simply comes and kills humanity off and that is that.Some of the negatives are found in the style of writing. This book was written in the late 1940's and the language used is rather dry. The author seems to go overboard on his word usage and sometimes seems to be talking down to the audience a bit.Still, if you like disaster stories you should pick up Earth Abides, it is well worth any effort.Robert Merkamp","I liked the book but all the characters were technologically ignorant. Even in the forties they had small portable generators but this was ignored in the book. One part of the book basically said they let all the lights go out. People knew about generators then and if not you would've have soon found out.","I'm not talking about the pandemic itself; I'm talking about the aftermath. I found the lack of progress of the human race, as detailed in this book, to be very unlikely. Even assuming that out of initial group of adults in Ish's group, Ish is the only highly intelligent one, I found it really hard to believe that the adults wouldn't bother to teach the kids how to read and do math, so that they'd be able to use the libraries to learn the skills they'd need to survive. It didn't make sense that there would only be two main characters with any sort of curiosity about *anything*. Why was knowledge of carpentry lost when The Tribe's carpenter died? Didn't he train anyone in his craft? Didn't anyone want to learn?I expected this book to outline some sort of return to the land, which would be much more realistic than having The Tribe live off canned food for forty years. This book spends way too much time expounding on how intelligent Ish is without showing him actually doing anything to help the human race.","I had heard excellent things about Earth Abides. I have always liked post apocolyptic books, and this is often the first recommendation by people. I tried reading it once, but thought the writing was detached and boring after a few pages, so put it down, and gave it away. Then, i saw the audio version on sale on audible.com, and downloaded it.I know this book was written in 1949 or something, and those I've talked to, comment on that as if its an excuse for blatant and rampant sexism and racism. But, I'm sorry, there is not accepatance in me for any of this no matter when it was written.The women are portrayed as either blood sucking, parasitic whores or blank and faceless wombs. Even his dog, a female dog, is described as ungrateful, needy and parasitic, expecting to be taken care of without giving anything in return, and provides in no way useful in the way of dogs, that I can remember. She is named Princess.The first non-whites that are encountered are identified as \"Negros\" and are described as unattractive, nervous, hesitant and lice ridden, living in a cabin with cheap and rickety furniture although there are far nicer houses empty for the taking. Our main character trades a dollar bill for eggs, and the \"negros\" are well pleased. So, they are poor, dirty, and stupid.Then, there is our main character, he is an unappologetic arrogant elitist who deems 99% of those he meets as unworthy of living. He decides that they will all die \"secondary\" die off because they are stupid, crazy without will to live. He drives around in his car, looking for people, but yet finding none, eventhough he infact comes across people. None of them are \"worthy\". He even makes a list of why he will survive were the others will die, and the list includes that he is solitary, and never cared much for people anyway. Which seemed strange to me, since he had found 4 or 5 people in one day's search. Its not like the world is entirely empty.I gave it two stars, because initially, I was interested in the observations of the earth and the cities and how nature is taking over and civilization is breaking down, but with no engaging characters or furthering of a worthwhile plot, I quickly lost interest and had to force myself to go on, looking for even a glimmer of the amazement and awe others seem to view this book. I found nothing of the like.","One-and-a-half stars really. Not much happens in this book.The main character spends most of his time musing over the fate of the earth and observing the effects of erosion on human artifacts, now that most of the world's population has been wiped out. One of the racier sections I recall was his observation of a storm water drain overflowing.It took two or three pages.However, the book is readable enough to fill in a bit of time while trapped in a hospital bed for a few days, and might even have earned as many as three stars from me, were it not for the &quot;hero's&quot; much over-inflated sense of self worth which manifests itself on nearly every page, most often by refering in his thoughts to all of his friends as simple, stolid, dull, or just plain stupid.Not to mention what he thinks of those whom he doesn't count among his friends!Maybe we are not meant to like the &quot;hero&quot;, but I think we are, and I can't help thinking that this story could be written by one of those aneamic, spotty, embittered social outcasts that one often finds lurking in the shadows at science fiction conventions, more at home with his onanistic fantasies than with any human being. I quote:&quot;...he realized that in some ways...he felt a new security and even satisfaction at the contemplation of a solitary life. His worries in the old days had been chiefly about people. The prospect of going to a dance had more than once sent him into a sweat; he had never been a good mixer; no one had asked him to join a fraternity. In the old days, such things were a handicap to a man. Now, he realized, they were actually a great advantage. Because he had sat on the edge of so many social gatherings, not quite able to mingle in the conversation, listening, watching objectively, now he could endure not being able to talk, and again could sit and watch, noting what happened. His weakness had become strength. It was as if there had been a blind man in a world suddenly bereft of light. In that world, those with seeing eyes could only blunder about, but the blind man would be at home, and now, instead of being the one who was guided by others, he might be the one to whom others clung for guidence.&quot;His intellectual snobbery becomes glaringly obvious as he begins to meet other survivors, and is at it's most repellant when he discusses &quot;half-witted&quot; Evie, whom one of the other survivors found &quot;dirty, grovelling, and unkempt, living in filth with merely enough intelligence to open cans to feed herself on whatever they contained, without cooking or preperation.&quot; This doesn't seem too much of a crime, and neither does the only other thing that seems to be &quot;wrong&quot; with her, that she can't hold a conversation. Nevertheless, the &quot;hero&quot; goes on to say:&quot;It would have been better, he had often thought, if they had merely put a can of sweet ant-poison within her reach somewhere.&quot; Of course, we must remember that when this book was published, in in 1949, social policy in the US was still under the sway of brianiac and boffin advocates of eugenics, and many &quot;subnormals&quot; and &quot;moral degenerates&quot; were still being sterilized by court order, despite the widespread revulsion over the results of Nazi social engineering procedures based on the same premises. A good antidote to the attitutudes expressed by this book is to be found in Jonathan Kellerman's excellent thriller &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot;, wherein eugenicists lurk behind a spree of cowardly murders. Kellerman's book is also recommended as a healthy locus for introspection by any readers of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; who find themselves agreeing with the &quot;hero's&quot; attitudes and solutions.","Overall this book didn't impress me enough to ever recommend it to anyone else but it also wasn't horrible. The beginning explanation of the plague and the prehistory of the character are so vague that the rest of the book is ruined. Doesn't stand anywhere near books like The Stand or Swan Song.","I would not recommend this book. UNLESS you are having a hard tiime falling asleep!! The main character, Ish is supposed to be an educated man who survives a deadly world wide virus. He uses his aledged power of observation to observe how the people around him, who are incapable of doing anything without his help survive. Unfortunately for the people around him, Ish seams to be unable to do anything but watch and complain.","Earth Abides is a disaster story where aplague almost wipes out humans. Becausewe grew too prosperous we had to die, according to the author, that is just the way things work. So the few survivors get by never trying to improvetheir lives, having no ambition the human race lapses into hunter gatherers with only superstition as a guide. Thisbook is a waste of a good oportunity. Insted of saying &quot;Hey, we can occomplishthings if we work hard and perservier.&quot; The author tells us &quot;Hey, we're almost as good as cockroaches and if we drop our standards, we too can can eek out ameager existence.&quot;I don't have to pay people to depress me, I can do that all by myself. What awaste of time and money.","I read this book a number of years ago, and forgot about it. Recently, I saw it on the shelf, and decided to re-read it. After forcing myself to read it, I understand why it was easy to forget.The main character, Ish, is highly arrogant and self-righteous. Ish, only Ish, has the power to drive civilization back from a total collapse. Ish has a son, Joey, who worships Ish, and Ish drinks it up. Joey is The Saviour, The One, a child who must be taught the abstract ideas which created Civilization. Nothing else matters.The side-characters are all inferior. These are the people with skills to survive. This includes artistic skills which doesn't include the formal education which _must_ be part of any \"real\" artists training.The most interesting part of it all is the background story of how the Earth really abides without Man trying to impose his will. Structures decay due to natural events; forests and wild-life reclaim the land.It may be a classic book, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a good book!","I have been a fan of PA fiction for over 30 years. My first PA novel was the children's novel \"Beyond the Dark River\" by Monica Hughes - a novel which I read when I was eleven. It hooked me on PA fiction and ever since then I have been trying to find as many novels or movies that I could get my hands on.I had read good things about Earth Abides online and was looking forward to reading it. Can I say how disappointed I was? Perhaps it was the era in which it was written, but all I could think of throughout the book is that the new civilization would have been much better off without the pompous a$$ of the main character Ish. \"They thought of me as a God.\" Good grief!If I could have rated this movie a zero I would have. Take this one out of the library if you must, you'll be glad that you didn't waste your money on it.","Even if Stephen King did base THE STAND on this book, he takes the idea of a world-wide plague and develops it much better than Stewart. I understand that EARTH ABIDES was written in the forties, but the stilted style of writing used and the attitudes and world view of Stewart's main characters are so jarringly anchronistic that I could never forget I was reading a book --- it never transported me into the world that the writer was trying to create. The italized asides within the chapter explaining what was happening elsewhere (i.e., lice, cats, ants, etc.) were interesting but not enough to save the book as a whole. LUCIFER'S HAMMER, WAR DAY, or THE STAND are all much better &quot;end of the world&quot; type books","When I write &quot;one of the most memorable books I've read,&quot; that's saying something, because I've kept up a pace of reading at least four books a week since before entering Kindergarten and am now 67. I borrowed EARTH ABIDES from the library a year after it came out, in 1950, when I was a 14-year-old high school sophomore, reading everything and anything labeled &quot;science fiction.&quot; I didn't own the book until fairly recently, but it stayed vividly in my memory. I could call up characters like fussy Maureen, stolid George, loyal Em and the tragic genius child, Joey. I remembered the fascinating journey across America, the vague frustration I felt (even so young) over Ish's passive character and the generally negative slide of the tribe from scavenging off civilization into what appeared almost to be an Upper Paleolithic lifestyle at the novel's end--not even qualifying as barbarism.But it's Stewart's refusal to tread the usual Golden Age sci-fi path and make Ish a superscience hero that makes the novel very special. Ish may be a scientist, he's academically bright, but like many people he's low in energy, street-smarts, and foresight. By and large his motley clan possesses even lower survival skills. They aren't much different from the Valley Girls in another good story in the end-of-the-world genre, the movie NIGHT OF THE COMET. Both are based on an understanding that if the human race's average IQ is 100, half the people who are likely to survive a major disaster aren't going to be awfully competent. Stewart certainly knew that, and it provided both the uncanny realism and the rather depressing pessimism of this story. It's fascinating to note that the other reviewers have noted both aspects of EARTH ABIDES.","George R. Stewart weaves at once a beautiful and hauntingly believable tale with this novel, one that I've never been able to forget...or wanted to. Once considered dated, with the lessening of global nuclear tensions, the scenario Mr. Stewart envisions for a possible worldwide catastrophe, one brought about not by bombs but disease, has once again come to the forefront and become the most plausible ingredient in mankind's demise. More even than the fact that this is a truly enjoyable read is the deeper message Earth Abides shares with the reader as it reaches down and touches our very hearts, defining what it means to be human in an inhuman environment. The symbolism involved in Isherwood Williams' desire to keep a hammer with him for the future as a tie to the past is obviously an unconscious comment on his personal hope of rebuilding a fallen civilization. A hope that goes unfulfilled in his life time and maybe many lifetimes to follow. The insight into the human psyche that Mr. Stewart demonstates as he carries Isherwood from his youth at the beginning of the book to old age and finally death at the end and Isherwood's subtle change of attitude during that process, rings exceedingly true and speaks volumes about Mr. Stewart's keen and perhaps unique ability to put into words what it really means, or at least should mean, to be human. I've rarely read a book more than once because I just don't have the time, but I've read Earth Abides several times since I was a teen and I know I'll read it several more times before I too reach that stage in my life that Isherwood assures us won't be the calamity our youth oriented culture would have us to believe.","Due to a multitude of rude comments regarding this review I will edit to please. Here goes... NON-SPOILER ALERTI can't expound upon this book as some of the reviewers have. Nor can I recall in exact detail everything in the book.But I can add value in this way.... I read this book 30 years ago, and I still think about it. I can remember the xxxxxx, the xxxxx that xxxx the main character, the waves of xxxxx xxxxxx after the event... the xxxx, the forced xxxx, the eventual shut down of the xxxxx xxxxx as the xxxxxxxxx started to xxxxx. The shift from xxxxxxxxxx( for years) to xxxxxxx for themselves.The last breaths of the xxxxxxx and the xxxxxx for the xxxxxxx, the xxxx which every year the xxxxxxx took up to the xxxxx and xxxxx the time since the xxxxx.30 Years.... and I still think about it. How many books, movies, songs... etc... do you expect to think about 30 years down the road. You probably wouldn't even remember the title let alone a rough outline.Will I read it again? Certainly! I ran into a young lady reading this on the subway a few years back, and we had a wonderful conversation... it's that kind of a book.SPOILAGE AVERTED --- Skol","One thing that disturbs people about Earth Abides is its incredible humbling realism about the human condition. People who read it come away profoundly unnerved by the idea that civilization is not something guaranteed to come into existence if we lose it and that it requires an enormous convergence of many different kinds of stimulus to create the energies needed within a race of men to bring it into being. Even the most gifted races of people on the Earth can barely hold it together in the best of times, George Stewart shows us how easily it can all fall apart and remain in a primeval condition for untold generations.The protagonist Isherwood suffers from the same disease that afflicts even the best of men - he lacks direction, loses initiative, becomes too preoccupied with the daily stresses of living and watches his life trickle away in the post apocalyptic environment without ever seeming to summon the right kinds of ambitions to carry out his grand dreams of rebuilding the old world.Stewart was quite prophetic considering when this book was written because many modern anthropologists have since confirmed that many previous civilizations have died out precisely because of this &quot;critical threshold&quot; of the division of labor and sheer numbers of vanished races being too low to sustain a breeding population and achieve the critical mass that leads to a progress oriented civilization. Stewart was very perceptive too be able to articulate this phenomenon and even narrate its exact trajectory following the loss of so many people who were vital components in the world that Isherwood regrets the demise of.The most disturbing aspect for me was that I see much of the exact decay of western civilization going on right now all around us and we have not even have a catastrophic plague yet. The same loss of purpose, of drive, of a sense of our own individual worth as a nation and a desire to maintain our sovereignty is slowly giving way to the degenerative notion of a world socialist government of faceless consumers who lack any culture beyond the food court and cineplex.The terrifying thing about the book &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that it is the story of our world and the modern era ... even before we suffer the inevitable collapse of our civilization in the physical sense. The reality is that we see it all crumbling around our eyes into the multicultural carnival of formlessness and we often find ourselves as helpless and feckless as Ish himself in doing anything about it.Highest rating, possibly on the top 100 list of best fiction I've ever read. I consider Stewart to be the author of a modern classic in publishing this book. It is so much more than simply speculative fiction, it contains eternal truths.","As I look at the many Amazon customer comments, I see a real split between very favorable and unfavorable reviews. This seems to be because some readers are looking for conventional science fiction/fantasy or adventure. Much as I love those genres, this isn't it, so if that's what you're looking for, save yourself the trouble and don't read Earth Abides. If you do read it, don't expect it to be something it's not.Earth Abides is a book for people with a strong streak of curiosity, who cannot resist thinking and speculating about the human condition. If this is you, few books will satisfy you as well as this one. It first captivated me when I was 14 - yes, there are teens who would be very excited by this book - and I am now on my fourth reading. There is no other novel to which I have returned so regularly. If you are possessed of this curious, speculative streak, then you will appreciate the protagonist, Ish, who himself is driven to understand the horrible event that has overcome the world and to raise and shape a new world. You will also appreciate the realism of the action and characters, and the underlying drama of the situation and tragic heroism of Ish, and you will not for a minute miss the contrived drama and heroism that make for conventional action fiction.","I read this book in '75. Since then I've been pretty much obsessed by it and other eoc novels (End Of Civilisation). I've looked for a book that had similar 'feel' to it. Unfortuntaly 'The Stand', 'Alas, Babylon' or 'Swan Song' don't capture the same magic. The closest I've come to simulate the read experience that was 'Earth Abides' is Alfred Coppel's 'Dark December' or Brian Hodge' 'Dark Advent'.Out of all 300+ eoc novels I've picked up over the last 25 years, 'Earth Abides' STILL ranks as the best. It's probably my all time favorite novel...I think I'm going to go read it again...","First published in 1949, this novel won the 1951 International Fantasy Award in Fiction (the first one awarded) even though this is not a true fantasy novel. The International Fantasy Awards were originated by four British science fiction and fantasy fans (Leslie Flood, John Beynon Harris, G. Ken Chapman, and Frank A. Cooper) for the 1951 British science fiction convention. The awards lasted between 1951 and 1957. George R. Stewart (1895-1980) was a Professor of English at the University of California in Berkeley. This well-read novel is about life after a plague has killed all but a few people on Earth. Isherwood Williams, a graduate student in geography, returns from a trip to the mountains to find everyone dead. He travels throughout the land and finds a female survivor. They settle down in the Bay Area around San Francisco and a small community grows around them. As time goes by, Isherwood tries to teach the children reading and the knowledge of the past. As the decades go by, he discovers that he is the only one who recalls the greatness of the past. Humans have become a band of hunter-gatherers. History has come full circle. &quot;...men go and come, but earth abides.&quot; Carl Sandburg considered it one of the best novels of its time. It is regarded by many as a masterpiece and was a precursor for many later disaster novels (note that one of the voters of the International Fantasy Award was J. B. Harris, whose pseudonym was John Wyndham and author of another classic disaster novel, &quot;The Day of the Triffids.&quot; One of the earlier reviewers suggested that Wyndham was a better disaster writer. But, &quot;Triffids&quot; came out in 1951, and Wyndham still chose &quot;Earth Abides.&quot;). The name &quot;Isherwood&quot; is a direct reference to Ishi, the last surviving member of a California Indian tribe who was brought to the University by Kroeber of the Anthropology Department (many science fiction enthusiasts are very familiar with Kroeber's daughter, Ursula K. Le Guin). Ishi is still quite famous in the study of native American cultures. This book has had such an impact in the development of the science fiction genre that it is now required reading for all serious students of science fiction and speculative literature.","Very rarely do I finish a book and immediately recommend it to other people. Mostly books help pass the time and end up portraying the same plot; another female FBI agent trying to catch a serial killer who ends up stalking her. However, after reading Earth Abides I called up my brother and told him to pick it up. The book, while written some 50 years ago is still topical. The book takes you on a journey of how a person survives after a disaster that wipes out almost the whole population. It then takes you deeper, you find yourself emotionally involved with the character. And you realize that George Stewart has moved from an tale of physical survival into a tale of emotional conflict. The transition is smooth and the two easily complement each other. If you enjoy reading about a world where civilization has been wiped clean and a new world must start over. I highly recommend this book. The writing was engaging and intelligent without confusing you. The storyline was deep and involving. Overall, the main character becomes immediately identifiable. The book ends; but the world created by George Stewart lives on in our imagination. And, I believe that is a definition of a good book.","As of this date there are 158 reviews of George R. Stewart's Earth Abides here in Amazon.com. I'm not sure that writing a 159th will really add any value or if anyone will even make all the way to #159 to see it. But I feel very strongly about this book and to the intrepid reader who gets this far, I hope it helps you to decide to give the book a try.I was 12 years old in 1968 when my Mother gave me this book to read. She was (and still is) a voracious reader. But she has never liked or appreciated science fiction. Then again, she never considered this book to be science fiction. I read the book in one day that summer and have read it at least a half dozen times in the 35 years since then. And I would agree. Although often voted as one of the best science fiction books of all time, I don't really think of it as science fiction. Stewart was not a science fiction writer. Rather he was more of an ecological writer looking at how the planet behaves in relation to specific circumstances. Two of his other novels, Fire and Storm are good examples of this.One area I differ strongly from my Mom is, I do have a good appreciation for science fiction as well as other apocolyptic fiction. Ray Bradbury, Frank Herbert, Robert Heinlein, Philip Jose Farmer and Issac Asimov have thrilled and entertained me for years. But Earth Abides was what got me started and remains my favorite piece of fiction.Earth Abides is a simple \"what if\" story. What if virtually every person on earth died and only a handful were left? Given the book's publication date in 1949, it was groundbreaking. No one had really written a novel on this topic before this. Virtually all the other books in this genre owe a debt of gratitude to Stewart. Books such as The Stand by Stephen King, Alas Babylon by Pat Frank, Malevil by Robert Merle, Lucifer's Hammer by Niven & Pournelle and Swan Song by Robert McCammon included.Stewart must have had his influences, but not from a book or author of this kind. Therefore the story does not focus on war or technology or industry (or science fiction). Instead it is a tale of how the people might behave under the circumstances, the struggles they deal with, the decisions they make and the decisions they fail to make. It is also a tale of how the earth changes and the previous efforts of mankind are so easily erased.Some reviewers here have criticized the main character Ish as being too passive. But this is a part of the novel that rings very true for me. How agressive would one be after living through a time when virtually everyone else dies? Wouldn't most people struggle to survive, never mind thrive?I won't give away the plot for anyone who has gotten this far. Plus if you've made it all the way to this review, you've seen the plot described almost 158 times. In the end the book is both depressing and uplifting. It is depressing in that most of man's advancements appear to be lost by the end of the book. But it is uplifting to realize that the earth heals itself and in the end man will start fresh.The book is both a product and a victim of it's time period, the late 1940's. Some of it will feel a little dated, after all it's over 50 years old and think what has happened in those 50 years. But remarkably, it still comes across as fresh. And with very little update could be brought up to present day and still be a powerful piece of fiction.All in all this is a great read for most people. For those looking for a hard core science fiction look at the end of the world, go watch the Terminator movies.","&quot;Earth Abides&quot; is a wonderful literary work. It's a shame that it's catalogued as a work of &quot;science fiction&quot; because it is so much more than that. I'm sure that many serious literary fans have failed to pick up on this teriffic book because of that &quot;tag&quot;.The book has a tremendous &quot;hook&quot; line - that being, &quot;almost the entire human race is eradicated by a terrible catastrophe&quot;. The plot is very believable and amazing when you consider that the novel was written in 1949. Author George Stewart is a great storyteller and has created some very interesting characters. The hero of this book, &quot;Ish&quot;, is both a &quot;superman&quot; and an &quot;everyman&quot;. He is both the leader of his tribe, but also easily led. His development as a person and as the head of his people is a wonderful progression throughout the book. His wife, &quot;Em&quot; exhibits all the great characteristics of the strong woman behind the &quot;great man&quot;. And, let me say that the symbolism of Ish's hammer was a very interesting facet of the book.My only criticism (and it's a pretty minor one) is that the book did not go into enough detail regarding the disaster and how other people throughout the country were affected. I think that this would have added some rich &quot;body&quot; to the storyline.All things considered though, this indeed is a book for the ages.It belongs with some of the best works of that era, such as &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot;, &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, and later &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. As an educator, I would really urge school officials to add this novel to their list of great American Literary selections for high school students.But, do yourself a favor - go to the library or your local bookstore get a copy of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; and delve into this great classic with its timeless message about the unshakeable human spirit!","I'm not going to defend it; excellence stands the test of time, and this one has been around for decades (1949). I would simply ask you to read it for yourself.\"Ish\" came to be one of my favorite literary characters and an inspiration for my own work.","'Earth Abides' is a classic novel of the end of human civilization and it's rebirth. Unlike other apocalyptic sci-fi fantasy novels in the mold of Mad Max, there are no weapon wielding skin headed cannibals roaming the wasteland. In fact the only violence in this novel is an encounter with a pack of wild dogs and the heart rendering decision the community makes to deal with one of the human survivors. In light of recent research exemplified by books such as 'The World Without Us', 'Earth Abides' is astonishing prophetic and knowledgeable. You might say that this novel is an environmentalist's apocalyptic novel 50 years ahead of its time. The novelist's understanding of modern ecology is amazing considering when it was written. The theme of the novel is stated in the title. Human civilization may disappear but earth will abide. A modern classic that should not be missed.","Isherwood Williams is away in the mountains pursuing his graduate field studies in geology. In our iPhone, instant connectivity world it is hard to imagine the isolation this kind of trip entailed in the 1950's when George Stewart wrote his book. Recovering from a snake bite, Ish stumbles back from the hills to find most of humanity wiped out by disease. We follow Ish through the remainder of his life as he comes to terms with a changing Earth--an Earth on which humanity is a barely noticeable presence.The absence of humanity is not only a stark fact, but is emphasized by the author's writing style. Ish is a clear introvert and we experience much of the Earth's change through his internal monologue. Even when he encounters, interacts with, and teams up with other people, this produces very little dialogue. This style underscores the aloneness of the book's characters. It's not loneliness, in the emotional sense, but a continuing reminder that other people no longer play a significant role in the world.The Earth itself becomes an evolving character in the book. We experience the successive rise and fall in populations of insects, rats, dogs and other species as seasons in the Earth's changing life. The diminishing resources scavenged by human beings from cities and storehouses are important to their survival, but also serve as markers of change as the Earth sheds the thin layers of Man's influence. This change is not progress, nor is it overly mourned as decline. It is thoroughly described and documented as inevitable change. Ish observes it and reacts to it. But neither he nor the other characters influence its path or pace.Read and compare this book with two other classics of post-Apocalyptic fiction:Alas, BabylonandThe Day of the Triffids. These works also follow their characters through crises, scavenging, and attempts to preserve the technology and civilization of the past. They are both more optimistic and more social in narrative style and in the strategies followed by their characters. After reading them, return to Earth Abides and appreciate it for the melancholy and aloneness felt by both its characters and its readers. It is a good story, a moving experience, and a skillful integration of message and writing style.","Yes, this is a must-read. I found it 40 years ago and have never forgotten it. Very realistic, this runs rings around today's fantasy and sword-and-sorcery pseudo-science fiction. Countless derivative novels and movies owe this book a lot.","Earth Abides is not a typical post-apocalyptic novel. It doesn't present a world of mutants, giant cockroaches or bands of marauders. It simply shows the slow and inevitable decay of man and all his works, in the teeth of attempts by the protagonist to restore the old ways of civilization. In that it succeeds beautifully and shows us the grandeur of our world and the majesty of what we have wrought...then compares it to the greater majesty of nature and the eternal gaze of time. The novel works best as a family drama, more Swiss Family Robinson than Mad Max, and has no sensational adventures to offer other than the daily tribulations of life. For man may be a great creature, but he is still small and the world doesn't really need him at all...Earth Abides is the most meditative and serene post-apocalyptic novel I've ever read, and it's recommended for more thoughtful readers who won't be easily bored.","EARTH ABIDES is lauded as one of the most noteworthy post-apocalyptic novels ever written. It was originally published in 1949, and its author, George R. Stewart, was better known as a writer of nonfiction than fiction, but EARTH ABIDES is easily his most recognized work--it has been in print off and on for nearly fifty years.Isherwood (Ish) Williams is a graduate student working on his thesis--\"The Ecology of the Black Creek Area\"--in the wilds of northern California when a virulent virus destroys humanity. When Ish returns to civilization he finds emptiness. There are no bodies littering the streets, no signs of struggle, nothing except the surreal stillness of empty towns, streets, businesses and homes. Everything is gone, and Ish doesn't understand what has happened until he reads the bleak, desperate headlines of the last issue of a newspaper in an abandoned magazine shop.EARTH ABIDES is the story of how Isherwood Williams survives the death of humanity, and with it, modern civilization. He is man of intellect--he mourns the passing of knowledge--and he can visualize the future not as an abstract idea, but as it very well may be. Ish chronicles the remnants of humanity as they form themselves into small tribes. They live off what the \"old ones\" left. They open cans for food; they raid sporting goods stores for firearms and ammunition, and miraculously they survive and grow. Ish begins his journey as an observer, but he quickly finds himself a participant of this new world.EARTH ABIDES is one of the most troublesome novels I have read. It is troublesome for two reasons. The first is the writing--style, narrative, and plotting--drove me batty. In a matter of pages it would cycle from being an immensely powerful and energetic story to a dull, over analytical and tiresome diatribe. One of the reasons for this wild and frequent swing was the frequent, every few pages, interruption of the narrative with an omniscient perspective spoiler: It was italicized and, in a very technical and academic style, told exactly what was going to happen in the next few pages. It interrupted the flow of the prose, and generally annoyed me.Secondly, it was a very unflattering look at just how terrible it would be to survive the death of civilization. There is nothing romantic, or eerie, or wholesome, or evil, as in many other popular post-apocalyptic stories--but rather it showed the difficultly, the loneliness and down right miserable aspects of surviving past modern civilization. It read very realistic--the way it would be if our neighbors suddenly died and one or two of us were left holding the bag: suicides, drugs, alcohol and insanity all the flavor of the day.This aspect of the novel was its strength--Mr. Stewart's visions of desperation were apt and vivid. One example of this is when Ish returns to an empty world, and drives through town after town honking his horn, and then waiting for the answering honk that never comes. Ish's loneliness and desperation is palpable and completely understood by the reader.EARTH ABIDES was a roller coaster ride. I enjoyed it yes, but I also disliked it. It is a novel filled with ideas, but its impact is lessened with the over-evaluation of those ideas. If you enjoy a good post-apocalyptic novel EARTH ABIDES may be the answer, but tread warily, because some of its impact and importance has worn away with the passing years.-Gravetapping","Let me preach: I consider it a crime that _Earth Abides_ is out of print. But I can understand why. It challenges way too many of modern man's notions. It is seditious in the quietest of ways.I had never heard of this book till I wrote a review for _I Am Legend_.Some people compared both books and out of curiosity I picked it up at a used book store.Wow! Why is this book not in the canon of great works of American literature? True, it is a 300 page (in the paperback) _meditation_ by one man on the fall and gradual rise of mankind. I can understand why some reviewers loathe the book. It is an observation, not an adventure. The hero's meditations merely travel through time; through space his travels are almost incidental.Our hero, Ish, is no Odysseus. He is no Don Quijote. He is no Robin Hood or King Arthur or Moses. He is an ordinary scholar, a grief-stricken individual trying to come to terms with post-traumatic stress after witnessing the near-universal death of the human race. All he can do is make heroic attempts to _keep track_ of events and time.His meditations and road trip bring him in contact with stoic people, with depressed people, with defensive people and at one point, his Tribe encounters religious fanatics--all isolated groups of survivors trying to cope and remake society in their image.As _written by Stewart_, Ish's burden and character are not those of a civilization builder but rather of a witness to decay, ruin, and eventual rebirth, in which Ish _realizes_ that hubris and a need to control \"fate/destiny/the future\" drove much human action, human culture, and the human spirit.Ish's insights continually bowled me over as I turned page after page. His meditations on technology, progress, humanity, eugenics, government, economics, religion, philosophy, superstition, anthropology, education, and literacy (all man-made institutions) constantly challenged my views and I began an internal dialogue with Ish's character!Ish/Stewart challenges a lot of notions of what we call progress and culture. Amazing. No wonder some people have hated and, doubtless, will hate this book. Prepare to have your attitudes about culture, and civilization,--and what makes a _great literary character_--challenged.It's not one of those, what-would-you-do-in-this-scenario novels, but rather an exposition of what one man _learns_ from his circumstances. Does he challenge them? Fight back? Does he mold circumstances to his spirit or does he go along with them? Is the \"individual acting upon his circumstance and vice-versa\" _question_ some kind of cosmic constant?There are earthquakes, forest fires, city-wide conflagrations. The daily amenities are gone: water, power, fire/police protection, doctors/medicine, etc. You are on your own. What do you do? Responses are manifold. Ish's response and that of his \"tribe\" is just one. That is the brilliance of this novel. You can understand Ish's actions, but would they be yours? Would any actions make a \"difference?\" What is this \"difference\" and who gauges/judges it? Therein lies the crux of the novel. Those who hate the novel seem to resent this existential/metaphysical point.A harsher critic would say that \"events happen\" in _Earth Abides_ in order for Stewart to make his point. Fair enough. Very few characters are developed with fine detail, but that is not the point of this novel. The novel is _about Ish_, the man, his conundrums and his meditations. Not about what we would have done or written or how we would have developed the \"supporting characters.\"Oh, and the pathos in this book is very real. The human universals occur: love, births, bondings/friendship, weddings, tribalism, leadership-rivalry, loss, death. And even a morally ambiguous, ethics-challenging execution.If a few scenes don't bring you to profound sorrow, well...let's just say _I_ experienced the sorrow and emotion of the scene as the novel unfolded.I will not reveal more, but this sad and haunting novel is worth the read. This is a novel that for some reason reminded me of H.G. Wells's _The Time Machine_. Shelley's \"Ozymandias\" and Yeats's The Second Coming\" come to mind as well. Read it and buy your friends a copy. Be a friend. Be well. The Earth Abides.","In my top 5 Science Fiction Novels Ever.Earth Abides tells the story of one solitary man who survives a global, but short-lived plague by pure chance. The novel chronicles his life from that point until his eventual death and is filled with both adventure and introspection. At times the main character, Ish, is hard to like simply because his reactions are so human it's disturbing. He's no hero, and in the post-Heinlein flood of heroic SciFi novels you could be forgiven for calling this novel slow.Earth Abides reaches the lofty height of my number 3 favorite despite the fact that it DID NOT win either the Hugo or the Nebula Award, in fact it wasn't even nominated. Instead I award it this honor because it is the most brilliant example of the post-holocaust theme I've ever encountered, and that theme is a huge one in the Speculative Fiction genre. This is THE BAR, and no one has raised it in 50 years.Superbly poetic and graceful, Earth Abides is undeniably honest, realistic and human it's long, diary-like journey from start to finish. I could easily see myself as Ish... which is both a revelation and scary thought at the same time.","This is such a great book on so many levels, it's a shame that it's being subjected to negative comments from readers who have totally missed key points about the story. First off, the protagonist, Ish, is a geographer, an informed and detached observer and not meant to be a hero or role model. Please don't ladle 21st-century dramatic or politically-correct expectations onto him. He's more real than that. Second, some reviewers here are complaining that Ish doesn't teach his fellow survivors to read etc. But in fact he tries throughout the second half of the novel to do so. They just won't. Ish gradually accepts that his fellow survivors aren't capable of hard intellectual work, that the torch of civilization is going to be mostly extinguished. Ish theorizes that probably the few, functioning survivors of the global plague are going to be doltish people. The sensitive, intelligent ones that survived went mad and were deemed unfit to join the little tribe of survivors. So Ish has the human clay that he has -- simple, uncurious, habit-driven people. He's constantly frustrated that he can't rouse them to live above the level they quickly sank to -- of hunting and gathering cans from supermarkets, talking about fixing up things but never doing it, etc. The whole novel is about the unstoppable descent of the last survivors into primitivism, despite having all of the knowledge of the world at their fingertips in the library.The stopover in the south at the family of the \"negroes\" deserves to be called passe -- the book was published in 1949 after all.","A young man recovers, from what seems to be snake bite, to find humankind has basically been decimated from a strange disease. That's the way Mr. Stewart's work begins. And where does it go from there? Well, the protagonist procedes to explore the remains of the U.S. Eventually he settles down and begins a new life, in the new world that Earth has become.Even though this book might be classified as a sci-fi piece, it is a little less and more than that:- Earth Abides does not deeply explore the \"sci\" in sci-fi. There are not many explanations for the disease that destroys civilization. And there are not too many explanations either for what comes next in the book.- On the other hand, Earth Abides does a great job in exploring the psychological effects on the survivors of the demise of civilization. Moreover, Mr Stewart stretched his work through time to show us the way the first generations of the world (the survivors' sons, daughters and grandkids) would behave. This is really nice.I enjoyed this book. It really did not make a big difference on me the fact that it was written some 50 years ago (frankly, I'm not really sure if the outcome would have been different if this disease attacked us now).I recommend this book to anyone interested in exploring the possibilities and consequences of a decimation of humankind by disease (not impossible considering the bird flu). Regular sci-fi readers might enjoy it, too.Don't read this if you want a hard-core sci-fi book, if it being 50 years old is an issue for you (no Internet and cable TV here...), or if you don't want to share the protagonist's loneliness.Enjoy!","I just read this book again. I don't know how many times I've read it and I enjoy it each time. I bought it at a used book store in Las Vegas years ago and I'm so glad that I did.","Disappointed. I'm slowly learning to pay more attention to Amazon's negative reviews to get a more calculating grasp of a book's contents.Apparently civilization goes out with a very orderly, civilized whimper. As the police and military forces crumble along with everything else in a matter of months, civil order magically maintains itself with little looting. Perhaps a feasible conclusion to reach, but much more fleshing out was needed to explain the psychosocial motives for such an end to 99%+ of the human race.The author makes no effort to create a story arc--this is a poorly written fictional ethnography, not a novel. The plot mirrors the personality of the plodding, coldly methodical protagonist.Most of the other characters are two-dimensional and cliched, following personality and behavioral stereotypes you'd expect from a 1949 bog standard. While this is feasible /to a certain extent/, the author proceeds with no introspection about it, as though the Leave It to Beaver cast was instantaneously transplanted into a world without people.On the positive side, the author makes distinct efforts to present the ecological side effects of humanity's disappearance. But this saving grace grows old, too, as the novel plods through the decades following the apocalypse.Now that I think of it, I believe that's exactly what the author intended, realism be damned. He imagined a band of primitive hunter-gatherers in the withered skeleton of an American city, and worked backward to see how it would fall into place. Too bad verisimilitude was the first casualty, normally a hallmark of the genre.","I wanted to like this book. I really did...but after getting into it, I had to stop and put it down. The plot is just too unrealistic, and the main character Ish is robotic and boring. As some other reviewers have stated, Ish shows almost no emotion after literally 99.9% of the human race is wiped out. He reacts clinically, robotically, and without apparent emotion after he returns to his parent's house to find everyone dead or missing. \"Hmm, that's interesting. Everyone's dead.\" He takes a freakin' road trip to \"look for survivors\" --yet leaves them all behind--deeming them unsatisfactory companions. This is justified by stating that Ish enjoys solitude. Umm...sorry, I enjoy the outdoors and solitude as much as anyone, and no normal person would react in such a way. Ever hear of the \"mad trapper\" or \"cabin fever\"? That's what really happens to people denied human interaction. Madness. Depression. Paranoia. Suicide. A longing to see another human face.The author, an English professor, must have fancied himself in the role of Ish--a purely logical, Spock-like Vulcan wandering around an empty world. This was a mistake--don't make the protagonist (and hero) of the novel to be a clone of yourself--the savior of the new society, a professor. Gag. I just couldn't buy into that. I also didn't like the author's prose--dry and dull. I can see why some people liked the book, but it just didn't do it for me. I'm thinking things would be a lot more like \"Lord of the Flies\" than \"Earth Abides\"!","The reviews I noticed are fine reports on this fine book. However, one point may have been overlooked. This is the first book I'd read (my first read was back in the 1960s) that used the term ecology. Mentioning this point will deepen the other reviews.","Stewart's books was perfectly creepy and emotional. I identified with the protagonist greatly, and do not feel he was too passive or overly-cerebral. Truth be known, in the few crises I have known, I've often reacted much like him. Okay, I'm a little more attached to things than he is, but I feel this is a plot contrivance to allow the story to go forward.Having read and re-read &quot;The Stand&quot; quite a few times now, I was struck by Stewart's decision (1) not to gather large groups together, (2) not to restart civilization (e.g., electricity, running water, et al), and (3) to cover such a large span of time. &quot;The Stand&quot; covers perhaps up to a year after a plague wipes out 99% of the human race. This book covers over a half-dozen decades. I feel that all three of these decisions demonstrated a far more likely result than King's use of dreams as a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; to gather persons into two camps for the &quot;final conflict&quot; between good and evil.Born in 1976, I am only now becoming aware of these post-apocalyptic classics. I have now finished &quot;On the Beach&quot; by Nevil Shute, &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot; by Pat Frank, and of course this one. The first two dealt with the all-too-real Nuclear Nightmare that even I experienced (though all those younger than me can't even remember there being a USSR). Shute's book was &quot;a stern warning of things to come&quot; and &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot; was more of a man vs. nature story.But this one, it dealt with the nightmare that first captivated me in &quot;The Stand&quot; - a world decimated by plague, leaving the infrastructure intact. While Stewart did not pick up the thread the way I wish he had - that is, some form of civilization being preserved, rather than yet another &quot;Time Machine&quot;-style primitive culture that barely recalls our culture. However, Stewart does spend a great amount of time talking about the decay of this world, and that fascinated me. Storm drains clogging, water seeping into houses and rotting the carpets, termites collapsing houses over the work of decades, dust settling into the corners of the Golden Gate Bridge and grass growing there, and the work of rain and frost on the Northeast roads. All of this riveted me.My biggest complaints are mostly minor, such as (1) how could running water go on for 20 years? (2) why did it take so long for the electricity to run out, and the biggest one (3) why were there no signs of panic (e.g., looting, riots, massive traffic jams as swarms of panicked people ran about in civilization's death throes, et al).My biggest gripe, however, is spiritual. Nobody in this book, even former churchgoers and clergy, feel any need to reach out to God. Admittedly, I'm biased, being a Christian, Biblical scholar, and future University prof. But I am a rational being, and I feel a rational argument can be made for the spiritual side of man, a characteristic that even the protagonist recognizes, even if he can't properly articulate, let alone address, this &quot;God-shaped hole&quot; in each of us.Now, I realize that science fiction, even more than other genres, allow us to paint on a blanked canvas (the devastated world) our worldviews on such things as man's innate goodness or evil, the necessity or redundancy of God (e.g., church, Scriptures, etc.), the expression of our social nature, the necessity (or redundancy) of modern technologically-dependent society, and so forth. I understand that we're not all going to agree; I don't feel it's my job to insist on homogeneity amongs everyone. However, if I wrote a book along these lines, I would make sure to include atheists, skeptics and agnostics, along with members of other religions (at varying degrees of dedication) along with those persons I feel &quot;make sense&quot; from my perspective. While by no means do I feel &quot;all religions lead to God&quot; or that &quot;you just need to be sincere,&quot; I do agree that any description of a post-apocalyptic (or any other) reality, in order to be fair to the multiplicity of human thought and experience, must recognize that &quot;it takes all kinds.&quot;That said, I did find myself chilled by the spiritual apathy evidenced, among other things, by the community's perception of &quot;Evie,&quot; the mentally-challenged pariah. &quot;We don't want no idiot children ruining the gene pool&quot; the protagonist declared in some fashion on numerous occasions. While I may see, in a survival-based world, the necessity of taking precautions, I did feel that the cold and unfeeling attitude (&quot;should we have even let her live?&quot; Ish asks himself repeatedly) was frightfully inhumane. There is no &quot;all are created equal&quot; here, no &quot;all are God's children&quot; here. While I understand expediency, I do not feel it must be carried out heartlessly.However, apart from this one real gripe, I truly do recommend this book to anyone interested by such things, like me. After borrowing this book from a library (copies are hard to find!) I've decided to buy it. I suppose that's the best recommendation I can give...","This novel, Earth Abides, written by George Stewart takes place in San Francisco during present times. A worldwide virus overtakes and wipes out the entire human race, leaving only a select few alive. Of these few is a man named Isherwood who goes in search of other survivors to band with. He meets a woman named Emma and a few other people who start a new civilization. It is not easy, however, and they are constantly hitting head-to-head with nature, fighting for survival. As in any other society, there are some people who challenge the law that was laid down in the beginning. As a result, certain members of the tribe are divided. Unity is essential for survival...will they make it? Only time will tell.The author of this book was probably raised in a Christian environment because there are many Biblical references in this book. For example, one of the characters in this novel is named Ezra, as is an Old Testament prophet. Stewart&#65533;s Christian roots are evident in the way he unravels his novel and the double meanings behind some of his story. For example, a child named Joey is born to Ish and Em that is far more intelligent than any other of the many children. Ish finds hope in this young boy because he knows that Joey&#65533;s outstanding brightness will one day be of great use to future peoples, just as God had much pride in His son Jesus.This novel is a wake up call to the reader in that it brings attention to how weak and vulnerable humans really are. What if mankind were to die today? Would people have their affairs set in order?This novel is a fictional story but has real-life applications. For example, there are real people facing real starvation and shelter needs. Stewart portrays very well the thoughts and feelings of each of the characters, which enhances the story line.Earth Abides is an excellent novel. It is extremely well written and it flows nicely. Anybody thirteen years of age and older should definitely read this book because it captures the reader&#65533;s attention and has the ability to transport the reader to a world no longer inhabited by humans. Younger children may not be able to understand some of the vocabulary in this book and may be easily confused due to the complex plot line. However, I give this book a two thumbs up.","Despite the quality of Stewart's writing, which is elegaic at its best and readable at its worst, this is a very creaky and dated work. Certainly, you have to make some allowances for the culture and time in which books are written, but like John Wyndham, Stewart seems handicapped by an assumption of the rightness of bourgeois values, especially when it comes to women. The book does address this, and in some ways is all about the struggle to maintain these values in a world where they are making less and less sense. But, you get the feeling that, in terms of sociopolitical change (as opposed to the obvious physical change - the old infrastructure has been destroyed), it's a case of 'apocalypse? what apocalypse?'. Stewart's characters are like Hollywood western stereotypes - the men are either upright patriachs or shifty loners; the women are wives and daughters who appear strong but are really just there for breeding and cooking. There are works which do tackle the obvious questions of the use of social roles in a society totally different from that which created them, most notably the vastly under-rated New Zealand film, The Quiet Earth (if I've remembered the name right). Read Stewart by all means: it isn't a bad book, but it isn't the classic it's built up to be.","Many readers will find this book very frustrating. It describes in one lifetime the dissolution of civilization on the planet. We know that if even a handful of humans survive a major disaster they will probably cling to the fundamentals of civilization a bit longer than one generation.In particular we will cling to reading and writing. These are the foundation skills of civilization. Writing systems are one of the foundation stones upon which civilization is built. The notion that we would allow a generation of kids to grow up without teaching them to read and write is tantamount to criminality.But if you stop seeing this as a single generation book, and think of it more as though Ish, the lead character, is able to see through many generations, then the story becomes much more believable.With all the talk of avian flu and the potential for a super virus this book seems eerily relevant to society today. Much more so than when it was written. Throughout the book we have metaphors for the natural balance of nature as we see one rampant population of animals after another expand and then die back to sustainable levels. And the question must always be, is the human population on earth sustainable?The answer is clearly no! And if we don't do something about our population levels and our resource consumption, this book may well represent our future on this planet.","First, I would like to say that just about everything to say about this book has been said. Most reviews are accurate, there are some great characters in this book and Ish does have some intense experiences, however I have mixed emotions as far as this book goes.Ish's long time companion Em, is a reliable and loving character, Ish & The Tribe look to her for strength and wisdom, time & again she delivers. She is loved and respected by all, but when she passes away, her death is all but over in one paragraph. It is similar with old George, he is a lovely character, like a grandfather or old uncle, I would have liked to see a few pages devoted to his passing. This is not the case. This leaves me a little flat.Some parts of the story are deeply moving ie when the boys return after their adventure and a stranger is with them. He is the carrier of desease and when he will not leave when asked, a solution must be found. The elders have to make a decision that chills them all to the bone. Great reading, but when Em & old George die it is almost glossed over.I enjoyed this book, but I would not recommend it as a light read. If you are into PA stories and you like deep intense stories, then I guess this is for you.If you are after action and adventure, stay away.","I know this book was first published in 1949. I can overlook the unlimited shelf life of canned goods and gasoline. It's the main character \"Ish\" who ruined this story for me. He is your typical elitist douche bag who confuses a large vocabulary with intelligence. With a university library at his fingertips, this mental giant could not learn the basics of survival (agriculture, animal husbandry, auto repair, food storage etc...)in his lifetime! I muscled through the book hoping it would redeem it's self in the end, but I ended up losing eight bucks on my kindle and three days of my life. If you want to read this \"classic\" be prepared for constant complaining about the stupidity of others while doing absolutely nothing to better the situation. Hubris abounds with his superior attitude and god complex. He's also a bit of a racist (Not for his use of the word \"Negro\", but for his temptation to use the black people he encounters to make himself king!) and a sexist.","Isherwood Williams is away in the mountains pursuing his graduate field studies in geology. In our iPhone, instant connectivity world it is hard to imagine the isolation this kind of trip entailed in the 1950's when George Stewart wrote his book. Recovering from a snake bite, Ish stumbles back from the hills to find most of humanity wiped out by disease. We follow Ish through the remainder of his life as he comes to terms with a changing Earth--an Earth on which humanity is a barely noticeable presence.The absence of humanity is not only a stark fact, but is emphasized by the author's writing style. Ish is a clear introvert and we experience much of the Earth's change through his internal monologue. Even when he encounters, interacts with, and teams up with other people, this produces very little dialogue. This style underscores the aloneness of the book's characters. It's not loneliness, in the emotional sense, but a continuing reminder that other people no longer play a significant role in the world.The Earth itself becomes an evolving character in the book. We experience the successive rise and fall in populations of insects, rats, dogs and other species as seasons in the Earth's changing life. The diminishing resources scavenged by human beings from cities and storehouses are important to their survival, but also serve as markers of change as the Earth sheds the thin layers of Man's influence. This change is not progress, nor is it overly mourned as decline. It is thoroughly described and documented as inevitable change. Ish observes it and reacts to it. But neither he nor the other characters influence its path or pace.Read and compare this book with two other classics of post-Apocalyptic fiction:Alas, BabylonandThe Day of the Triffids. These works also follow their characters through crises, scavenging, and attempts to preserve the technology and civilization of the past. They are both more optimistic and more social in narrative style and in the strategies followed by their characters. After reading them, return to Earth Abides and appreciate it for the melancholy and aloneness felt by both its characters and its readers. It is a good story, a moving experience, and a skillful integration of message and writing style.","The premise of this story is the elimination of 99% plus of the human race as a result of a world-wide plague. The plague only effects humans. All other species of life continues to live and in some cases, thrive. Does that sound like something you've read before? I don't think so. In this story the plague kills slow enough to allow the living to bury the dead, thus the streets are not full of dead bodies and the freeways are empty. The remaining few gather themselves into small \"tribes\". The leader of the tribe in our story was a history professor at a major university which is very close to the location of the University of California, Berkley. As a professor he observes the progress, or regress, of his tribe as a student might and creates a tale that would be appropriate for an Anthropology class.Equally interesting to the \"student\" is the impact on the ecology as a result of the loss of mankind. It is truly amazing how much control man has and the impact of his sudden removal. To give even examples would be to deprive the reader of experiencing it themselves. Although not a long book it covers a period of around 70 years or more. It does so by summarizing periods of 10-20 years into short chapters. The author does an excellent job of maintaining continuity in this manner.I would recommend this book hold-heartedly to the serious reader, not because it is a difficult read, for it is actually quite an easy read, but because it is not an action adventure story but a serious look at the possible destiny of mankind. A destiny which I for one would hope we would be better than. The story was written in 1949 but would vary little if written today. An \"end of earth story\" with a very modern premise would be \"One Second After\" written in 2009 which was fascinating to read back-to- back with Earth Abides and which I will be reviewing separately.","Earth Abides is well worth the read. It is difficult for me to suggest precisely why that is so, thus very little actually happens through the course of the book.I suppose there may lay its charm. It's simplicity seems to add plausibility. My impression is that there was much more hype than the title deserved, nevertheless, it certainly deserves some.","With nearly 300 reviews of this book at Amazon, I hardly have to give a summation of the story. I was swept along by the narrative, and I identified greatly with Ish, the protagonist of this post-collapse novel, perhaps because of affinity with his personality. However, I do not give it 5 stars because I happen to differ with the kind of fall-back-into-pre-literate-history climax. Ish should have done a lot more than he did to preserve literacy and a connection with tradition. True, the memory of the Iliad and the Odyssey and the real horrors of the Holocaust is not something we could describe as essential for the survival of mankind, but I could not blithely accept the disappearance of the history and the literature of our human species. There is much that is terrible in our history, but much also that is heroic and even sublime.However, I must say this book is one that will stick in my mind for a long time, and it is rare today to find a book that will have that effect. Most of the books today that are lauded as \"good reads\" are just entertainment for a few hours but are quickly forgotten. Not so with \"Earth Abides.\" You may argue with certain aspects of the novel, and/or certain philosophical conclusions of its author, but once you've read it, I doubt that you will be able to dismiss it or pretend you didn't spend a few hours with the survivors of \"the plague.\"","I read this book when I was a freshman in High School, after it was assigned by a cool female sci-fi teacher. At the time I didn't care much for reading, but I read Earth Abides cover to cover. The book changed me, turned me into a reader and then a writer. That was over 30 years ago, and still I so often think about various sections in the book. Now, here I am, ready to purchase another copy and reread the incredible novel, just to see again how it still so deeply affects me. Earth Abides is powerful, memorable, and deeply moving--it is everything a book should be.","This is, if not the best, at least one of the best books of its type ever.The story is told with a grittiness that makes every page crackle with life. I read it first in high school, and have read it several times since. I was so happy to see that Del Rey Books re-issued this timeless classic in 2006.A whole new generation of readers will be able to enjoy Stewart's amazing novel.A. C. Ellisauthor ofIn Pursuit of the Enemy,Worldmaker,Soldier of 'Tween, andSHADOW RUN: Book I of The Ancients' War","Isherwood (Ish) Williams has recently finished grad school and is camping in California when he is bitten by a rattlesnake. At first the injury seems minor, but he rapidly descends into a delirium-filled illness. After several weeks, he gradually regains his senses wondering how a simple snake bite could have affected him so strongly. He heads back into town and find everyone gone. It seems a bit odd at first, but Ish thinks to himself that perhaps it is Sunday (he has lost track of time). He eventually comes across a newspaper that describes a devastating plague that has swept across the country, and he becomes aware of the full magnitude of the catastrophe that has struck the United States and the World. What follows is one of the best stories about post-apocalyptic survival ever written.This book is divided into three sections, the first two taking the lion's share of the space. In the first section, Ish discovers the plague, realizes he is one of the few survivors, and decides to take a cross country trek to see who and what else has survived. In the second section, set 22 years after the first, Ish has settled down with a small number of other survivors who start families in the SF bay area. We see the first and second generations of children born after the plague who have no concept or awareness of what we would term modern civilization (and all that implies for better or worse). We follow the slow decay of the remnants of the earlier civilization, and the construction of a new way of life. In the final section, Ish is an old, dying man reflecting on his life and all that has happened. In between each of the three major sections are brief vignettes that cover the major events of the the chapters that are set decades apart.This is largely an introspective tale about Ish's thoughts and emotions as his world crumbles around him and is rebuilt and transformed. If you're looking for a story about a lone survivor battling mutant zombies or some such thing, you'll be disappointed. In the first section, Ish is just trying to make sense of what happened and figure out what he wants to do. In the second, he tries to teach the children of his small community something about what life was like prior to the plague and maintain some continuity with the past. One of the children ask him what an American was, and Ish finds that it isn't so easy to explain. In the third section, Ish is the only pre-plague survivor left in the community, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren now unrecognizeably changed to cope with their new environment. There is some action in this story, but not much. One of the best aspects of this story (and this genre in general) is that the author explores what would happen to all the trappings of modern life if the machinery just stopped. In some ways, the changes would be immediate and profound, in others, changes would take more time.The bottom line is that this sad, introspective tale woven around some Biblical themes is an all-time classic in my view and definitely recommended. There are some outdated (or just plain different) ideas and ways of thinking in this book (Stewart wrote it in the late '40s I believe), but don't let that stop you from reading the book. Stewart conveys a message and asks some questions that are relevant to people and human nature whatever epoch they happened to be born in. People will be reading this 100 years from now. I read this book (along with Alas Babylon) many years ago as a teen and decided to re-read the pair again. There are many powerful images from this book that I still remember now decades later. My view now has changed a bit as I can understand Stewart's central message better, but no matter what you think about this genre in general, this is a timeless story that you'll never forget.","What happens if mankind is almost wiped out yet the infrastruce remains relatively untarnished? What skills are most valuable in such a situation? Once Maslow's hierarchy of needs has been fulfilled, what comes next? Can a society regress but improve simultaneously? Can extreme preventive measures be moral? I love a Mad Max post apocalyptic tale, but the seemingly pedestrian situations and questions posed in this book continue to haunt me long after reading it.","I read this book 35 years ago while in junior high. It captivated me. I pondered (as only an adolescent can) what I would do if I were Ish. What would I do if I came home from a trip into the mountains and found the world dead of a plague. How would I respond? What would I do? How would I survive? How would I cope?I read it again when I was in high school and the same musing returned. I found it in my box of \"things\" several years later when I was 23, after I was married. I sat down that afternoon and read the entire book. Again it affected me - but in a different, more mature way. After I had children, I gave it to my daughter to read when she was 16. She found it to be a very fascinating read on the sociological impact on man of a devastating plague which leaves only a few scattered survivors. I have lent my copy to several people over the years and everyone who reads it finds the book to create emotion and ponder what they would do in such a situation.The mystery and appeal of the book lies in the writer placing the reader into the conscience of the main character named Isherwood \"Ish\" Williams. There are several undertones within the book - one of which is the role of the reluctant leader, the second the \"sacramental\" image of the hammer. It also shows the tendancy of man to desire religion.This book review, I hope, motivates someone to read a book that they may not have read by simply looking at the cover. You will be mesmerized by this well written classic... I guarantee! (I have been mesmerized by it 5 times now in the past 35 years)","I remember first reading this book in High School almost 30 years ago - the story of Isherwood Williams and his struggle to survive in a world where 99% of the people have perished in a biological holocaust. Well written, it keeps the readers attention pretty much throughout. While the book suffers a tiny bit of \"out-dated-ness\" (no mention of cell phones, or the internet) it is still an excellent and well-thought-out read about the demise of our techno-centric civilization. I especially like the way the book takes you through the passing of years, and eventually decades - to a future that makes you step back and say \"Yeah, I can see that happening...\" Enjoy the book, it's a great read!","If you're manic depressive you definitely don't want to read this book. Normally, I love exploring the delicious idea of an end of the world scenario, then having the opportunity to start over. But, I was amazed at how much I hated this book. The characters simply showed little redeeming value and did little but live off the works of the last surviving generation. God, how I slogged through the entire book, hoping that it would get better, that I was going to learn some valuable life lesson or something. It never came. When I finished the book this morning, after reading it in spurts over a period of a month, I really was depressed!The writing is workman like, which is sad, because there's not a poetic line in the whole book, with the exception of the title itself. Oh well.","Having just finished reading Earth Abides, by George R. Stewart, my mind cannot put it down. When I began the book, I expected an apocalypse type novel, and it is that, but it is very much more. I was drawn into the existence of the main character, Isherwood Williams, in such a profound way that I am quite at a loss without him. He is not a formula hero, in that he has human frailties. He is a ponderer and a worrier, much like me. Perhaps that is why I was able to relate to him so easily. He takes nothing at face value, instead he is always fretting, contemplating, and evaluating. His successes are mitigated and his blessings are mixed, as is often the case in real life. There is nothing about the book that is formula, which is a rarity in this genre. On the contrary, it is a truly original work, replete with both adventure and philosophy. The writing style flows beautifully, without an unnecessary phrase or a word out of place. It is a true work of literature, one of the best books I ever read. I am sure that its effect on me will endure, and I will remember this book and its vivid characters for the rest of my life.","I first read this probably 40 years ago and I've re read it over the years, most recently last week.This is a book that stays with you and I was surprised how much I remembered. But I had forgotten just how emotional it was. Stewart's prose seems simple and utilitarian but has real depth of feeling.It's a terrific book.","Very well written and interesting plot. Kept reader wondering what was next. Could not put the book down. I have it on my e-reader and will read again","A friend let me borrow this book to read and I could not put the book down. I do reccommend anyone reading this book, even to this day I still am thinking about the story. It does make you think of how you would be able to work things out when everything you know has disappeared. Great read, I loved this book so much that I had to get a copy for myself!!","I've read a lot of Science Fiction in the past 35 years and found this just ok. I guess I didn't get the underlying message. There was little action, little adventure and basically a bunch of slackers degenerating back into the middle ages. The main character Ish was an odd duck that I could not relate to. I guess I just don't get it.","I felt that this book is very monotonous in how the main character of the book travels around the country looking for people and answers to what happen to the world. he will go in to extreme detail in minor occurrences like seeing something like a body or a hammer. i think this book is very good and has a good plot and deep thesis but i wouldnt recommend this book because it is a slow pace dragging book.","I first read this novel, borrowed from the library, in 1963 and was intrigued by the by the author's detailed descriptions and unique story line. I purchased it in 1987 and re-read it, then loaned the book to a friend and lost track of it - but it was every bit as enjoyable again. Now, I'm 68 and purchased it thru Amazon and re-re-read every word in detail. It is still a tremendously powerful novel and challenges the readers to place themselves in the past and future. What would you do to rebirth a civilization? How could you cope in those first, empty days. What regrets might you have as you witnessed the demise of literature and art? What, then, the consequences as the \"Earth Abides?\"","I realize this is a 'classic' of science fiction, but I couldn't find it in me to really love it. It''s good, but sooo dated in many respects. And frankly, I never really connected with Ish, the main character. Still I am glad I read it, because of its enduring status.","I read Earth Abides in the sixties as a teenager, and it is one of the few books that stays with me through the years. A beautiful, haunting book.","I first read this book when I was in high school. That would be early '60s. It was one of those stories that was foundational in my own thinking. It was a pleasure to read it again after all these years. It is one of the earliest of the apocalyptic genre and its themes are timeless and the characters unforgettable, as you yourself Ish well know. It is still fresh and engrossing to read.","After having read many apocalyptic scifi novels; this is defenitely utopian. SPOILER: The disappearance of all the victim of the plague is suspiciously clean. Also, the simplification of the breakdown of infrastructure seem a bit too clean. However, having dealt with these questions, Stewart frees the book to deal with the most preponderous question: How do the Survivors of a great diaster rebuild civilization?","After reading this book I can no longer get myself to read anything else. There is just no other fiction novel, I believe, that can possible be as good as this book.It's so incredibly thought provoking and engrossing I can't stop reflecting on it.","This is a classic sci-fi drama with interesting survival and sociological study. Long but entertaining and I can recommend it.","This is an enduring futuristic fantasy novel that is hard to put down. The characters are well developed and sympathetic without being heroic. It is easy to image yourself in the protagonist's position, and contemplate how you would react. It really makes you think about what is important in your personal life and in society. An excellent novel for anyone with an active imagination.","This book is so old I was leary about reading it...I have to tell you..even though this book was written so long ago..this book will stick with me forever...the characters are memorable and you are right there with them..you laugh and cry with them!!! i will always remember this book..i am so glad i read it!!!","this is a very well written sci-fi/apocalyptic thriller. it isn't so much as a thriller but an exploration of the human race (in the POV of Ish, one of the most memorable fictional characters IMHO). I love the line \"between the plan and the fulfillment lies the frailty of human life\". so many quotable and thoughtful quotes. this is not for sci-fi readers who like action-packed plots - this book has depth, it satisfied me as a realistic portrait of life after an apocalypse. in fact, if there really is an apocalypse, i believe those who had read Earth Abides will be more than prepared to deal with it.","Excellent book. Still current though written in late 1940's. It is a novel that sticks with you. I have read many disaster books, end of world stories, but I have to say this one is my very favorite.","George Steward did a great job writing a novel that is timeless in nature. I thought the book was well written and the characters in the book were believable and down to earth. I could not put the book down. The pace of the book was fast and exciting. Each page of the held a new twist or further clarity in the development of each character. I especially enjoyed the development of the relationship between Ish and Em as it spanned over time and life events. George Steward did a great job writing a novel that is timeless in nature George Steward did a great job writing a novel that is timeless in nature.","I'm an avid reader. This is one of the most memorable books I've ever read. Earth Abides is a true masterpiece in every sense.","I love the apocalyptic genre. I had high hopes for this book and it started off good as the main character travels across the country during the aftermath of the disease (which he did not witness first hand while it was happening). After he meets up with a group of fellow survivors, they form a small community and from then on the whole book just seems to be pointless and boring. I got excited when the main character's two sons decided to take a trip across country, but the story line did not follow them on their trip and we found out little of what they saw and experienced when they returned. That infuriated me. Overall, this book was disappointing.","I have been a huge fan of the TEotWaWKI (The End of the World as We Know It) genre for quite some time. In a conversation with a fellow fan, I revealed that I have not heard of this book. After the shouts of shock and consternation died down, I was strongly urged to read it.Boring!Most of the book is taken up by the main character (Isherwood Williams) going on and on about what he or others should do. Then he does nothing! It got to the point that, after an actual interaction with another character (rare though they were), I dread the blah-blah-blah that was about to come.The only reason why I finished this book (and kept this from being a single star review) was the insight it provided on the age in which it was written. These are the things that stand out for me:* Being apologetic for not killing or running off the supposed mentally dificient member of the group.* It seeming to be OK for younger folk to painfully pinch very old people when they don't respond as expected (so much for respecting your elders).* The shame in having to bypass a mountain lion rather than killing it.* Killing a calf only for its liver, and killing its mother just because it was in the way.* Fear that a kid may be too smart and the need to keep it from reading too much.* Purposely not using reference material when trying to do something for which they have no experience.* Seeming lack of desire for good food. Whatever is around is good enough. No need to go out of your way to make something good.* The only time sex is implied is for making babies or cast aspersions upon someone's character.This was an exercise in anti-intellectualism and anti-sensualism. I'd rather be killed in the plague than to have to live with this bunch.","I've read many of the \"apocalyptic\" books. This was a quiet one. Since it was written in 1949, that might explain that. It was a pleasure not to see the F-word at all, and so many of the other obligatory modern slang phrases. It did avoid any positive reference to religion, so it is \"modern\" in that respect. Not exciting at all, and somewhat sad. Probably would appeal to women and those who consider themselves as intellectual or literary critics. Me, I just wanted some action from this book--not.","Why is this kindle book \"not available to kindle customers in Australia\"? SHAME on you Amazon. This was the best book I ever read as a teenager and I so wish to read it again","I read this book years ago (in the early 80's I think). It was my first post-apocalyptic novel and there are pieces of it I still remember. When something kills most of the people in the world, Stewart takes us into middle America. A dog named Bridget (I think), an Irish Setter, sits and waits for her people to come home. Bridget's bewilderment and her mourning is what I remember. The protagonist is a teen-aged boy who struggles to survive. Along the way he meets a housewife in her 30's, and she eventually becomes his wife. She's lost her husband and children and there's something she's hiding--a secret that illustrates how the world has changed since 1949 when Stewart wrote \"Earth Abides.\" Earth Abides ends on a positive note with humanity not quite back to square one. If you like \"everyone dies-but-us\" books and you're sick of flesh-eating zombies and vampires, I recommend it.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005F6569Y/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title","I read this book as a teenager. I've shared it with everyone from siblings to grandchildren and they all agree. It's a thought provoking look at a possible future for the earth. A must read for everyone!","This is a remarkable science fiction novel that has stood the test of time. I read it in the early sixties and recently bought it for my daughter.","What an excellent book! I read this on Vacation in Cancun, and couldn't put it down. I may have missed a couple good vacation days totally engaged with this story. Well worth it.","Earth Abides is a great book in general but among its genre its easily one of the best. If you enjoy post apocalypse fiction then this is a must read. No hesitation at a five star review.","Excellent book! I've owned a copy many years ago, and had to have another since my old copy was lost or stolen!!!","I first read &quot;Earth Abides&quot; in a borrowed copy in the early 1950s ... and many, many times since. My problem then was losing the title --- but never the story. Finally, in the late 1960s, my 15-plus year project of telling the story over and over in search of a title (and a copy of my own) paid off. That copy, well thumbed is well kept. It's on my top shelf, handy for a quick read every couple of years or so. I just finished it again today ... not the first time I've made it through in one sitting and then regretting hitting the last page. In part, the book helped lead me to the East Bay (Clayton) in the 1980s and my time there also makes the story real and special. Now it's back to the top shelf ... the only proper place for this really &quot;great read!!!&quot;","I read this magnificant book over 30 years ago and I still canNOT get it out of my head. I was born and raised in the Berkeley/El Cerrito area. While reading EARTH ABIDES, I could visualize, with extreme clarity, all the areas mentioned in the book. I actually put myself in the possibility of REALITY while: the electricity ran out; the overgrowth of flora/fauna; the animals going wild; seeking tires at dealerships on Shattuck Avenue; seeking other humans in Berkeley, the UC Berkeley library; the creating of another human generation; no racial hostility; etc. I just ordered two more of EARTH ABIDES to give to friends who grew up in the Bay Area. They will be astounded and will love it. Although written in 1949, and what is going on in the world today, was this another prophecy?","Like most of the other reviewers, I too have read this book many times. There is some-thing about this story that stays with you. I can't say I have had the same feeling about any other book.","I read this book over 15 years ago and to this day I still cannot get the story out of my head. I wish I can find another copy so I can read it again and even pass it onto my family and friends.What made this story so remarkable was how logical the story line flowed. Everytime I ponder that faitfull question of being one of few left on Earth, I try to take into account the possibilities of how Earth will &quot;reset&quot; iteslf around me. Would I want to stay in Florida, move back to California, or go on a quest to some distant land and build my own civilization?Anyway, I highly recommend this book for those who have ever pondered the question of being the &quot;last person on Earth.&quot;","I first read this book at 11 yrs old (1965), and have read it 4 more times throughout my life. I continually think about this book and always recomend it to friends. I grew up in the desert with not much to do BUT read,when I finished it the first time I had to start over right away, Ive NEVER done that with ANY other book!!! have fun reading it!!!!!","It was a must read for my Physical Geography class. We were supposed mto read it from a Geographers point of view. My teacher prefaced it with &quot;this book was written in the 40's and it is sexist - so ladies please don't let it irritate you.&quot; I however, didn't find it sexist I found M, the lead female charachter, a strong and wonderful woman. I also liked the fact that there was interracial marriage and poligamy. Forward thinking ideas in the 1940's. All in all it is a good weekend read. But, it is way corny! Especially all the text in italics.","As a long time reader of sci-fi, this novel-EARTH ABIDESs is the single best story ever written. I have read it more than 30 times. From the time Ish begins his relent measures to understand what has happen, the start of rebuiding a social group, the developement years, and the final bridge location with Ishs' final thought of &quot;Men may come and go but Earth abides&quot; stirs thoughts of --how would you perform in a like setting.","What more can be said? Get it and read it!!! I first read it about 35 years ago and it has stayed with me. The book impressed me then and it impresses me now.","When the protagonist entered the Bancroft library at the Univeristy of California, and the author described him handling the books and the care which was taken when he left, was so beautifly described I almost cried. Living in chaos but leaving in such a humanly way left a strong message of the power of books and libraries that needs to be an inhernt value to our culture.","It seems like this book was super-great when I first read it about 40 years ago. I haven't been able to forget it. I am excited to see it is in print again---but why was it ever out of print? It is timely, provocative and just plain great reading for any age.","I found this post-apocalyptic story well written, but a bit slower paced that other titles of this genre. I attribute the pace to the era in which this book was written. I would consider this a must read, especially if you have read On the Beach and Alas, Babylon.","I have read this book several times. Once you start,...it's hard to put down.","I liked this book, though the introduction claiming i would remember the book forever and so on. Well, intro's like that turn me off a bit. It certainly is intriguing in a rather simple way. The later seems to add a certain plausibility which makes it much more believable. It's always a trade off, exchange a little drama for a little more realism. In all, a nice balance. I must say that the book is well written.","An excellent read -- an excellent re-read. The book is both entertaining and thought-provoking. If you like science-fiction with an apocalyptic theme, you will like this work.","great book about the aftermath of humanity and how the world deals with our absence, follows a young grad student from the extinction of man to the establishment of a new human society.","I think this is a post-apocolypse classic because of the unique perspectives the author presents. Rather than focusing on theh flu epidemic that wipes out the majority of humanity, the author focuses on one man's experience of it through the rest of his life as he joins with other survivors and the beginnings of their \"tribe\" come together. There is really less \"action\" than one might expect as the author tells the story of \"post-flu\" life and the subtle, slow changes that emerge as human beings begin living more in balance with the planet. A very beautiful story really as humanity comes to know iteself apart from \"civilization.\"","I did a comparison of this book with Childhood's End for A-level English. Two more different sci-fi books would be difficult to come by and that was the point. Earth Abides is a quiet story, full of the thoughts of Ish and the story of the community he helps found after a plague wipes out most of humanity. There is no scientific details as none of the characters have the expertise to know them. It a human story - not a science one. Some details are given of how the impact of humanity is gradually wiped from the planet and how the survivors - well survive.Don't expect explosive action or tales of daring-do. What you will get is an insightful book - even after all this time - what you will want to read a second and third time. Definitely one to keep - close!!","This was by far the best book I've read in a long time, in terms of pure quality. Coming off a run of John Grisham books before it (and after, I'm reading another Grisham story now), it was amazing how different the quality of the story was, and how much more thought-provoking. Grisham tries for some philosophical stuff in his books, but didn't come close to what you find here.The story itself was Ok...not fascinating alone, though surprising. A few things I certainly didn't expect to happen transpired. But what made it worthwhile was the \"what if\" factor. Imagine living through the apocalypse. Ponder the questions it raises:- What would I do? Seek other people? Focus on survival? How to judge others, and how easily to settle in with them?- How strong are the author's, and lead character's biases in the story? We get their perspective so strongly it's not clear sometimes what the reality is?- What about Charlie? There's no way I'd make the same vote as the characters in the book - so I think. But if I had lived as they had for 22 years, would that change my opinion? How can I know? (answer to that last question - I can't).Is there some deeper answer in the book about what the meaning of life really is? If we strip everything we have today away, we go back to a more primal state where the search for food, water, shelter and safety are paramount in our minds. So how much of what we experience now is a product of civilization and society, rather than our true nature? The memorable line which was something like (I don't have the book for a direct quote) \"I'm happy. Things are as they are and I'm a part of them.\" says a lot doesn't it? Goes back to Buddhist philosophy really - focus on the present. When there's no guarantee of the next meal, when there's no shelter because a fire can burn it all down, when wild animals lurk, how much time do we have to ponder, to worry, to debate? And does that make us happier - meeting our primal drive to just...be?I'd highly recommend this book, my \"top\" recommendation whatever that means. It covers ecology, philosophy, sociaology and so much more...I waited almost two years to read it. It's a shame I waited that long.","Starts off great, slows down too much in the middle but finishes well. If you are looking for a Robinson Crusoe post-apocalyptic type read this is not for you. Nothing like \"The Stand\". All the characters are at best low end of average and manage to accomplish very little over the 42 year span of the book. Somehow, I liked that about the book. The writer gets a little too esoteric though. Still, one of the better reads I have had this year. Written in 1949 and I got a hoot out of picking the small things that dated the book. Everybody smoking is an example.","A thoughtful examination of the slow collapse of civilization in the lives of a small band of survivors brought together by one man who remains their leader until old age. In general, four stars, in science fiction genre alone, five stars.","I've gotta confess I was not very excited to read this book, having obtained on a bargain and postposed its reading for about a year, when I eventually got to it, I was absolutely blown awaythe writting, althought not brilliant, is very polished and takes you throught the wonderful adventure of the end of mankind as we know it, throught the vast territory of a deserted united states, and tells us how it would slowly and rapidly decay in its various facets, until it would stand almost naked, a fertile ground for life anewcoming throught the plagues caused by the broken ecosystems and among the difficulties tapped by the human intervention we give for granted, it sets up a perfect place for the second half of the book, in which civilization begins again, necessarily different of how it came about in the first place, offering us exciting reflections on how we are and how we'd be, on values and life and growth, we age with the original characters, and by the time Ish is an old man we can see this new world throught the eyes af an old man, we understand and are subjected to the same hoplesness as him in the development of the new world, yet the hope of life, free of our cultural bagages and preconceptions, grows and leaves you a great aftertastean incredible novel, terribly underrated, which should be cherished and shared","Several reviews have noted what they call the essential pessimism of the book: Man Has Fallen, Civilization Is No More, etc. Well, yes, that is all there. But what is also there is a profound triumph of the human spirit: Civilization is Dead - Long Live Civilization. I will NOT spoil the ending, but book ends with a rebirth - an obvious societal pregnancy if you will - of a new civilization, one profoundly in keeping with the new conditions of their brave renewed world.One can imagine a sequel, and I wish Stewart ahd written one!I first read this book almost 50 years ago, and have re-read it multiple times. It is one of the best \"transition\" books ever written. I recommend it on several levels.","An astonishing science fiction novel in the apocalyptic vein, written in 1949, and despite a surprisingly few dated references, a story that remains both entertaining and relevant. In the beginning, protagonist Isherwood Williams (with the unfortunate nickname of \"Ish\") is one of the few survivors of a virus that wipes out a majority of the human population. Ish is in his twenties, an over-educated outsider, who stands on the margins of society analyzing and contemplating what he sees. After a solo excursion across the county and returning to the Bay Area, California, he slowly joins up with an assortment of characters, and becomes the de facto leader of \"The Tribe\". The struggles that confront them are meticulously well thought out and explicated by the author while rarely dragging down the narrative. The slow decay of an industrial society with no one left to manage it and the natural environment no longer held at bay serve as the antagonists. There are no sci-fi pulp orientated elements such as giant mutant killer ants (for better or worse). Threatening the Tribe are scourges of rats, wild dogs, and other animals, as various species overpopulate until starvation brings their numbers down again. There are outbreaks of disease to be dealt with and wild brush fires caused by dead trees no longer cleared away. The novel deftly provides details such as what happens to the plumbing when city reservoirs dry up and fall into disrepair. The real strength of the book, however, is how Ish is forced to confront what knowledge and wisdom needs to be passed on to the future generations in order to rebuild society. Hence with his intelligent introspective nature, interwoven into this entertaining story are thoughtful reflections on what purposes societies serve, what they protect us from, and even what they blind us to and cause us to take for granted. This is a timeless classic our own civilization would be mistaken to let slip into the \"out-of-print\" abyss.","Well almost everything has been already written about this book but I have one new curiosity not yet mentioned by anybody. In fact it's this curiosity that caused me to only give it a three star rating. To enjoy this book I had to believe that the handful of survivors world wide all loss basic curiosity. I can understand the total grief, the total denial and complete loss of the few who survive. I cannot understand the total and complete loss of curiosity. All around the survivors they have the tools, the machines and all the books but nobody has any interest in them. The leader of the survivors gives only lip service to the books but does nothing to really grow from them. Nor does he use them to learn the psychology of how to motivate his tribe. He only once attempts to do anything and at that it's only an after thought. He comes up with an idea that sparks the survivors into thinking about rebuilding a jeep but that's all. Aside from this his tribe cares about nothing. His tribe lives only day to day but seem forever lost in the now and blind, uncaring and unwilling to look to the past and what it can offer to help then survive in the future. The author never mentions curiosity or its loss in any of the timeline that the book traverses. It's as if curiosity never was part of humankind. All in all, I could enjoy the book without curiosity but it left me wondering what if it had included it in the story.","This is the 'end of the world as we know it' novel that all others are compared to. Even though it was written in the 1940's (copyright 1949) it is timeless, not aged at all, a great literary work.It all starts when the main character, Ish, is bitten by a rattlesnake and laid up in a remote cabin, unconscious for an extended period of time, while, unknown to him, a plague destroys over 99% of the population. There begins a superb story of the trials and adventures of one man, and eventually a small group of people, as they battle nature and themselves, and attempt to re-establish civilization. This is one of those rare novels where characterization and plot and setting all mesh together into one beautifully written yarn, that after reading it, you will never forget it, it is that powerful. If there ever existed the proverbial page turner, this is it. Of course, being written in the 1940's no mention is made of personal computers, CD players, and the like, but if civilization was gone these most likely would be of little use anyway.The philosophy and human interest angles contained in this book are well done. The scenes and descriptions of the demise of civilization and peoples' reactions to it, depicted by Stewart, seem very realistic. Your heart will be with the characters of this book when you read it.","Earth Abides is a thought provoking look at how the world would go if almost all people were eliminated from the picture. Some very interesting looks at the eco-structure, reformation of small societies and how they would interact from the short term to the long term. The book has some very sad and touching aspects that help you relate to the characters. The technology is a little outdated because of when the book was written but you can get past that. Overall, a very good book. One I would think in a few years I might like to read again.If you liked &quot;The Stand&quot;, and have wondered what would might happen 50 years afterwards. This is the book for you.","I have been looking for this book for a long time. I read this book for an Environmental Science class at Long Beach State about 20 years ago and it made such an impact on my thinking about the environment. Every time I see grass growing up through the cracks in the street or the roots wrapping around pipes I think of the book. While the environment seems quite fragile, it appears that it is not a fragile as we think and we are the fragile ones.","Let's start with the book's obvious problems. First, the author is a creature of his times -- the 1940's, and his views relect those times. He is paternalistic towards African Americans and women, and he feels that people without much formal education are not very smart or capable. Second, his main character, Ish, is not likeable; he is lazy, selfish, unloving (for the most part), rather anti-social, inflexible, and egotistical. (I am not sure that the author intended Ish to be unlikeable, as Ish is also a creature of his times.) Third, the author's view of the post-apocalytic world does not ring true; even given the dolts that the author has chosen to survive this catastrophe, surely more of the modern world would have survived -- at least for a few generations. (Example [MILD SPOILER]: would middle-class Americans ever decide not to teach their children to read? If there ever were a group of people who needed to know how to read, it would be this new generation!) Fourth, I do not find the biology/physics of this new world to be believable. (Example: where did all of the bodies go?) Fifth, the \"mother earth\" motif that runs throughout the book is hackneyed -- though, in fairness, it might have been fresh in the 1940's.Still, I liked the book. It is a book of ideas dressed up as a post-apocalyptic tale. What does it mean to be human? How does one balance the needs of the group against the needs of the individual? What is culture? What aspects of life/culture have value? What is love? What role should religion play in society? What role should education play? How does one go on after a devastating loss? How can people relate across generational lines? Can one generation truly lead another? What is happiness? What skills in life are most important? When is violence justified? What does death mean? How does one motivate and lead others? What does \"fun\" mean? How do small group dynamics play out? What function do rituals and symbols play in life? How do cultures adjust to rapid change?I did not usually agree with the author's answers to these questions (when he provided them), but they did challenge me. I have thought a lot about the book since completing it.","I agree with another reviewer who said it is a measure of this book's greatness that I still think of it now, fifty years after I read it.Fire, by the same author, is also unforgettable.This from a guy who can re-read a mystery he read three years earlier and not remember who done it.","A horrible disease sweeps the planet in days, killing just about everyone. Isherwood Williams is for some reason spared from this plague, and finds himself a survivor in a barren society. The book follows the course of his life, and that of other survivors, as they live out their days in a new world.My opinions ran wild with this book. For reason I will explain further along in the review, I started out very much enjoying the book, then my interest waned, and finally something clicked into place in my pea-sized brain, allowing me to finish the book on a strong note.I found it very easy to step into the mind of Ish. He reacted in a way to his situation that I felt was very natural, while learning how to cope with life alone. I don't want to give much of the plot away, but roughly the first third of the book deals with Ish's life alone. Ish starts out as something of a loner and a worrier, and seems to adjust to the world...for a while. Soon, he becomes desperate for a purpose, and with that notion, sets out to find out \"what happened\".Later, Ish struggles with his own weaknesses while trying to decide how to save the future. Through it all, Stewart keeps the characters consistant. I found it refreshing that he didn't try to thrust someone into the heroic role. For whatever reason, this earned him a good amount of credibility with me.A note on the writing style; I believe this book was written in 1949, so the flow of the book seemed a little odd to me. Some of the conversations just didn't flow well, and I chalked that up to the age of the book. On the other hand, Stewart's timeline fit right in with the world we live in today, and did not really date the book. Except maybe for spraying DDT around like it was air freshener.Around the middle of the book, I started to lose interest. I guess for me the story sort of bogged down with Ish trying, and consistantly failing, to get his people to try to focus on the finer things in life. As I said earlier, when things finally \"clicked\" for me, I found myself appreciating this part of the book more, as it fit in very well with who Ish was and what his purpose was.The ending was just magnificant. I very much felt what Ish was feeling, and clearly saw that he had finally accepted that things were going to work out for his decendants, even if things didn't turn out exactly as he had planned. I can't stress enough how good of a job Stewart did with the ending.This is not an action novel, and at points did become a bit too philosophical for it's own good. For me, it all came together at the end, but it might turn some people off. Also, as mentioned above, the writing style can seem a little strange, but overall this book shot far up my favorites list. This book easily get's five stars from me.","This book Earth Abides by George R. Stewart is about a man who passes by a massive disease which basically obliterates the US. This man, Ish, has to come to realization of this huge crisis and try to find survivors. It goes on and on about his thoughts and shows the struggles that he faces it the horrid situation. He goes around america finding survivors and ends up making a huge family in the end.This book was basically boring and depressing because it was just lagging on and on about how he thought of everything. It made you want to fall fast asleep at times too. (something that i obviously did) I am one of those kind of people who likes adventure and this book had none. It just was one of those books that wanted to show how horrible things could happen to us if we don't watch it. It sort of chilling and makes you depressed to think that it could happen. George R. Stewart was probably giving a good message out when he wrote this, but in the sense that people want to live there lives without this catastrophe, it is not very good.I would not recommend this book to kids under the age of 12 because it probably is too advanced for them. Also because kids do not have to worry about this sort of horror happening to them at that young of an age. People who need to sleep at night and want to fall asleep fast, please read. If you like adventure and mystery in a book, please go find a different book.","The book earth abides was about a man who passes up a massive disease that spreads throughout america and basically obliterates it. It has this man, Ish, come to realization of this huge crisis and shows his struggles to find civilization. As he searches through america he finds out that many other people have survived the catastrophe and he starts to make a family. As the book goes on it shows the will of human survival and the horror of this situation.I thought that the book was a little too slow. I am sort of a adventure book reader and this book had slim to none. It just went on about Ish's thoughts for like 2 chapters at a time. It made you want to just fall asleep everytime u read it. It was dull most of the times, but it does make you think how bad it would be if that sort of thing happened to the country.I would say that this book would not be very appealing to young kids because it is too advanced for them. I would recommend this to people who need to fall asleep at night definately. Also if you like to hear about the deep thoughts of a person who has no one to talk to for weeks, read this book. If you are an adventure or mystery reader who likes action, do not get this book.","\"Men come and go, but Earth abides.\" These chilling words written by George R. Stewart leave the reader feeling bare and stripped in the popular science fiction novel \"Earth Abides.\" A novel I read and still can't decide what to think about it.This book is filled with puzzling situations, frustrating moments, and mind-bending problems that make the reader ask, \"What would I do?\"Plague has struck the world, and people are dying by the millions. A lone survivor, Ish, on a mountain camping trip manages to fend off the disease with snakebite. He returns to a frozen, empty world, and is determined to find civilization and life in the seemingly dead planet. Most of the people he meets are in shock, having seen the horrors of death and destruction of the planet and are stupefied, unable to talk sense or even take care of themselves. One man Ish comes across is drinking himself to death; only eating things out of cans and seems only half-alive. Through his journey's, Ish has a growing urge to settle down and establish life as he knew it again. He alone must save the human race.I thought this book was very interesting, at first. The beginning was intriguing and exciting to think about. But after a while, the idea became old, and boring. Ish just begins to muse over the world's pathetic state, talk about how he's the only intelligent person left, and even starts to become a little snobbish to say the least. The way women were used merely as wombs, though logical in such a situation, got a little annoying also. The detail and wordiness left my mind to wonder away from the book, and I even recall something as simple as a storm drain overflowing taking up two pages to talk about. Ish's endless attempts to get people to think and work for themselves also become a bit momentous and bothersome. It really makes you want to slowly go crazy along with Ish, as you read his \"bible\", page after page of musing nonsense. I really wanted to tell him to start enjoying life and give up on trying to control everyone's thoughts and actions, just to let things go. But there were moments of truly beautiful writing and raw honesty that drew me out of the droning slump. When Ish finds something to believe in, though, it was really disappointing to have it destroyed so suddenly. Ish becomes so obsessed with saving the world, he becomes very self righteous and stuck up, he transforms from a hero into someone you are sick of and increasingly angry with. The author looses his grip on the story and turns the book into a guide of what to do if you find out the world's population has come to an end, and it's up to you, being the only truly sane and intelligent person, to save the planet. The character's personalities fade, and you are left with a bunch of names and occasional dialogue.The novel begins with a bang, and ends with a whimper, which makes the reader want to whine as well. It was not something I'd want loved ones to read, but I would highly recommend the first two hundred pages, and then move on to something else. The people who say they truly enjoyed this book through and through, in my opinion, are liars. It's a thoughtfully written piece, and deserves the recognition it receives, but if you are looking to be entertained, find another book, \"Earth Abides\" will leave you out in the cold.","It's amazing how despite half a century of technological advancement the Earth Abides is largely just an expanded version of the Red Plague by John Steinbeck.","Good story, but a bit unbelievable. Characters reasonably developed.Mostly clean, no gratuitous sex or violence, but some crude language.","Excellent book.. Highly recommend it. Very well written. Takes you through generations. a great read!","Dated but thought provoking aptly describes this novel. Set in post-nuclear holocaust America. excellent.","earth abides may have been original when it came out a zillion years ago but it's dated now and can't compete with stories being written today. the hero is some boob who survives the plague only by stepping on a rattlesnake? wow. and then he can't even teach children to read. why not? there are some good moments here and there, but in the end this book is a yawn.","The idea of an apocalyptic end of our planet and of humankind has always been extremely prevalent in society. From religion to movies, theories of annihilation can be found everywhere. But few books attempt to tackle the subject of life after the end. I think George Stewart wrote this book in the 60's and I wanted to see what his ideas were on that subject. The premise was great, but I was extremely disappointed with Earth Abides because Stewart brings in many themes/ideas but never goes into any of them in any detail whatsoever. There is absolutely no emotional connection with any of the characters,and even less so with Ish, the main character. I felt like I was waiting for something to happen throughout the book, and it never came. The author attempts to tackle way too many &quot;big&quot; subjects at the same time, and in the end,he fails. The only reason I gave this book even one star is because the reader can learn about how the world may deteriorate in the future when man is no longer here.One could say that that is a positive thing.","Some good ideas. Some interesting speculations on the nature of man and society. Some interesting predictions of how the earth would respond to a die-off of humans. Ruined by needless wordiness, 2 dimensional characters and very little to say of a philosophical nature. A bore and a disappointment. Skimmed the last 100 pages.","EARTH ABIDES is such an amazing book. In fact, I happened to keep my high school copy rather than returning it before graduation. Deep down, I think my teacher knew and was happy to take the loss.I have three books that I will not part with - EARTH ABIDES, THE STAND, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. EARTH ABIDES and THE STAND have a lot in common. I am surprised, as were others, by all of those who gave this book such a low rating.The story tells the tale of a college student, Ish, who is working on his thesis up in the mountains. He gets bitten by a rattlesnake and heads to lower ground for help only to discover the human population has been wiped out thanks to some weird plague. The story becomes Ish's quest to live as supposedly the last human on earth.First, I want to clarify that this book was written in the 1940s. Those who complained about the writing being poor, one guy even said the book was written in the 60s and he is wrong, need to look at the times. The world in the 1940s was far different to today. If you cannot adapt to the language differences, skip this book. While I find it rather narrowminded, I also understand the world is full of people who just can't stand something that is different to the norm.In the 1940s, they didn't have the computers, men were working away from their family farms, they'd become used to modern technology, so it isn't surprising that Ish would have allowed so many things to slip by for decades. If the world ended tomorrow how many can honestly say they would know how to irrigate their crops? How many even know how to garden?At heart, EARTH ABIDES needs to be viewed with the consideration of the differences in time. It is and always will be my favorite book.","I am a 62 year old grandmother who has read hundreds of books, but no book ever moved me like this one. It is the story of one thoughtful, intelligent young man spared during a world wide epidemic that wiped out most of the population. While we always expect that the end will come with a bomb that distroys everything, this time, all the infrastructure was left intact. The plants and animals that had evolved to be dependent on humans also succumbed and Mr. Stewart deals with this in a remarkable and sensitive way. Today human beings have brought civilization to the brink, but this book reminds us that no matter what, the Earth Will Abide.","However, if you want Mad Max or his clones go elsewhere. Since I read this book back in grade school it has always been on my shelf, in fact I usually have 2, one personal copy and one copy to give to friends. I read many of the reviews of this book and wonder if some of these people read the same book. To me Earth Abides is one of the most uplifting books ever written. This book shows that no matter what comes, life and happiness will happen. No matter all Ish's failings to teach his people, his Greatgrandchildern are happy, they do not miss what they never knew. He teaches them to survive and they will teach themselves the rest. Again I say if you are looking for an actionpacked end of the world book I would recommend Daybreak-2250 A.D. by Andre Norton. However if you want one of the best books written that will make you think about humanity and all its failings and gifts, READ THIS BOOK! I just wish I could have given it 15 stars instead of just 5.","Ish, a college student, survives a rattlesnake bite and mysterious illness alone on a mountain camping trip. When he recovers, he can't find anyone and slowly realizes a plague has wiped out the human race. He wanders across the country, finding only a few stunned survivors and makes an intelligent and courageous decision to not join the first people he finds. After a period of terrible isolation, he finds Em, a true survivor like himself. They are happy together and attract five other survivors. A tiny little tribe grows around them. Ish devotes his life to trying to bring back civilization as he knew it. He fails at his superficial efforts at farming and at educating the children. He succeeds beyond his deepest dreams at giving his descendants the tools they need to create a healthy, happy way of life. The novel works as a thought-provoking study of what do you do when the world collapses around you. It has some weaknesses. Here and there, the fact it was written in 1949 shows. One can argue that Ish would have been able to get the children to read if only he hadn't been such a boring pedant and he could have been a better farmer if he'd been willing to explore alternate ways and crops. The book's strengths greatly outweigh its weaknesses. For one thing, with not much action, it's a true page turner. This is a fantastic novel to discuss and to argue about and to ponder the fundamental question it raises. What would you do for the rest of your life if you survived the end of the world?","First off, I should state that this novel was written in the late forties, and thus reflects many of the prevailing attitudes of the time. It is rather sexist, and even vaguely racist (although neither element is malicious, just ignorant) so if you think that may ruin the novel for you, then you probably want to skip it. That said, if you can look at \"Earth Abides\" in the context in which it was written, you will find a thoughtful, entertaining novel.\"Earth Abides\" is predicated on a super-virus wiping out the overwhelming majority of the Earth's human population, while leaving the rest of the animal kingdom unaffected (at least directly). The story follows \"Ish\" as he struggles both to survive, and come to grips with the loss of civilization. Over time, a community of survivors gels around him, and they work to scratch an existence out of the ruins of San Francisco.Stewart takes a rather bleak view of the survivors of the holocaust, not to mention their children. Rather than trying to reestablish \"civilization\" they slip into a more or less Stone Age existence, supplemented by the leavings of a culture they are completely alienated from, and that is not understood by the children at all. While I understand that Stewart was seeking to comment on what makes up a \"civilization\", and what the natural human condition is, or should be, I think he introduced an element of wishful thinking into his narrative (strange as that may sound). It is extremely unlikely that things as fundamental as literacy would completely disappear within two generations, and while they might very well fail, I suspect that survivors would at least attempt to maintain electricity, water supplies, etc.Where this novel really shines, and what I found most interesting to read, was Stewart's descriptions of the ecology of a North America largely depopulated of humans. He does a superb job of predicting the fluctuations in various animal populations, and I believe that the long-term balance that he predicts is probably not far from what would actually happen.Ultimately, \"Earth Abides\" is an entertaining novel that leaves one thinking about how they would react in similar situation. While I don't necessarily agree with the way the novel plays out, I was constantly challenged to come up with an explanation as to why I thought things might be different. In the process, I gained a deeper appreciation for the depth of Stewart's characters, and the challenges he pitted them with. If you enjoy \"apocalyptic fiction\" this is definitely a book for you, but even if you have not strong feelings for the genre, I suspect you will enjoy the excellent characterizations, thoughtful story and wonderfully realized world.","This book attempts to answer the age old question, \"what will earth be like without humans?\". In a word, BORING, just like this novel. Don't get me wrong, there are some great parts to this novel with real drama and action and intrigue and heart-wrenching feeling. Unfortunately, those parts are few and far between, and they are between mountains of tedium and monotony. I will give George R. Stewart credit for doing his homework scientifically, historically, culturally, etc, and I have no doubt that if a horrible plague ever wiped out nearly all of the human race, this is probably a really accurate depiction of what would occur. However, and this is why i give this book such a low rating, there is a vast difference between writing an accurate book and an entertaining one. In many ways this book is very similar to other post apocalyptic novels like The Stand, The Road, The Book of Eli, On the Beach, etc etc etc, however, where those novels shine and where this novel falls flat is in the art of story-telling. Basically, this novel has no story other than the mere survival of the last remaining humans. There is no plot, no antagonist (unless you count harsh nature herself), no great task to complete, no long journey to take, and no lesson to be learned. When gone is the human race, the earth and everything on it will still be here, and in the closing words of the author, \"Humans come and go, but the Earth Abides.\"","I really enjoyed this novel from the apocalyptic genre very much. It was not a fantasy good versus evil type of story but rather a speculative look at how civilization might fare if there was a sudden die-off of 99% of the population. In this story there is a sudden plague of such devastating severity that nearly everyone is dead within a couple of weeks of its outset. This book does not focus on the plague or the sufferings of the infected and dying people. No grisly oozing bodies are found in these pages and very little trauma or grief. We enter the picture shortly after the dust has settled, so to speak. The story is not about the plague but about its aftermath. It is told from the perspective of one man who survives and traces his experiences as he goes in search of other survivors and finally settles back in his native California and makes the foundation of a new \"tribe\" of civilized human beings. This book was written in 1949 so it is doubly interesting because it not only gives us a look at the author's speculation about the factors that make up civilization and the interesting trials and successes that might arise, but it also gives us an amazing look at the huge changes that have taken place in our consciousness just in the short period of years since it was written. It has the unexpected bonus of actually confirming some of the points the story originally was designed to suggest. Even though the author seems as though he was an open-minded, perhaps even liberal thinker, the book contains ridiculous racial stereo-types, as well as skewed ideas about the personhood of mentally disabled people and also of women. Women are shown as being entirely domestic and dependent. Cigarette smoking is still very much a happy pastime in this brave new world and is enjoyed by men and their pregnant wives without a care in the world. When a plague of ants becomes a problem the main character, Ish, sprays himself and his pregnant wife down thoroughly with DDT, a substance that is used several times in the surviving world to overcome pests. I found these old-fashioned ideas very interesting when coming from a \"reasonable\" man that no one of his time would have considered to be prejudiced. The book is a thought-provoking page-tuner. I kept imagining that I would have done things in a much different way from the main character but I found the ideas and reasoning to be essentially sound and worth contemplating. This is an interesting look at how the Earth might rid herself of the virus called mankind and is certainly a good look at the power of her self-healing capabilities. I definitely recommend this book.","I first read this book when I was 8 years old. My dad had left it out and I grabbed it up and read it. Even at 8 years old I found this book gripping and thought provoking. As I grew older I would find a copy and read it, and each time I would gain something new from reading this book. I am 45 years old now and I am feeling the urge to read it again. I think the reason why the survivors did not \"rebuild civilization\" was because they were all in shock--their whole world (friends, lovers, children) had been wiped off the face of the earth almost overnight. If you add to this the author's stated premis that the survivors were mostly average to dull, then the story makes more sense. I recommend this book to anyone, it's a sci-fi classic. I also think the movie \"The Omega Man\" might have been inspired by this book.","Many reviewers here expected something different, I think. They are dismayed.They have all the elements properly arranged but do not see how they add up. Ishi characterizes himself as intelligent and the others as inferior to him in cognitive ability, yet he fails in almost all his undertakings.At the first sign of trouble he goes home and sleeps in his boyhood bedroom, then returns there and takes up a permanent residence in the old home place -- this infantile reversion is culture-shock but he can't see it. He is supposedly trained in ecology but is taken by surprise every time the local ecology adjusts itself to mankind's absence -- this emphasizes the futility of a college education in a survival situation. He carries a prejudice against negroes yet marries a mulatto and doesn't even realize it at first -- his blindness extends deeply within him. He tries to educate the youngsters but cannot hold their interest -- he is too disconnected from their reality. He has in front of him all the ingredients for success -- yet fails on his own terms, which are unreal.And yet, he does succeed, doesn't he? In spite of himself he does manage to attract a group which survives and stays together. Gradually over the course of his life he becomes ever-farther removed from reality, while the children take over the lead. They develop the skills they need to live in the new world almost while Ishi is not looking -- they become \"wild Indians\" wearing skins and shooting arrows.Ishi was the name given to the last member of a tribe of California Indians, the Yahi. In 1911 he was brought in by white society and nursed back to health by the Kroebers, with whom he lived. The Kroebers were a university couple, anthropologists. Their daughter Ursula was born in 1929 and grew up with Ishi in the house. Ursula's married name is LeGuin; she has won many awards for her science fiction. (Google 'Ishi' and see.)Ishi also is the short form of Ishmael, a name for the Wandering Jew of legend; Melville's \"Moby Dick\" begins with the sentence, \"Call me Ishmael.\"In short, Ishi is sort of the Dagwood of survivalists. Arnold Schwartzenegger would not star in the film version. Despite his shortcomings and failures, life actually does go on. In fact he is a lot like you and me. How well do we know ourselves? How well do our everyday decisions turn out? Once Ishi says to heck with it and lets things slide, things get better just like in real life.Stewart's genius was to place these things before us and then get out of the way. He has placed hints in the text, the italicized passages which give us objective truth, sandwiched between Ishi's misadventures. What he is saying is, in despite of ourselves, Earth Abides.If you enjoy the subject, try Walter Miller's \"Canticle for Leibowitz\", or Clifford Simak's \"City\" or David Brin's \"The Postman.\"Dave","I enjoyed this one. It is a very good read and certainly gives us some food for thought. We do need to remember when this one was written as to social attitudes, etc., but if we keep this in mind, it is good. I suppose you could read the book for it's social commentary, relate it to unspellable philosophical stances, blah, blah, blah, as one reviewer did, or you can read it for a very nice story to read on a rainy weekend. I enjoyed it, will probably read it again and highly recommend it.","As I write this, negative reviews of this novel (one or two star reviews) are few and far between. However, I am compelled to join the minority. I could not, in good conscience, recommend this book to anyone. Maybe one needs to be an aficionado of the \"End-of-the-World\" genre to appreciate this book, but I found it to be contrived and unrealistic. The idea that most of the population would die off due to disease, but that the book's protagonist would choose to tool around the countryside calmly musing on a variety of generally immaterial and irrelevant matters seems absurd. Also, for quite awhile, he manages to encounter ONLY unsavory or potentially dangerous fellow survivors. The entire un-dramatic tone of the book seems way out of proportion with the incredible tragedy that has befallen the earth.I very, very rarely leave a book unfinished, and will usually force myself to complete any book I start. But, as they say, \"too many books, too little time\". I could not see giving up valuable reading time on a book that offers so very little to the reader, so eventually put this book aside. For me this is the most gravely negative review I could give a book.","This novel is possibly the worst piece of drivel I've ever tried to force myself through, and I didn't make it. I quit, and honestly I almost never do that. Ish is maybe the most detestable figure I have ever had the displeasure of meeting on the page. He's a passive aggressive psycho, a terrible father and leader, and the last man you would want to rebuild civilization. In this type of scenario, anyone with any intelligence that came into contact with him would disengage quickly. I simply might have shot him for being a drain of precious resources. If the whole point centers on the fact that most or any man would fail in this situation, I would have preferred that Stewart kill off Ish in a 20 page short story.","I see many people loved this book, but having just finished it, I just don't get the appeal it has for so many people. I found it incredibly boring and tedious. I do not exaggerate when I say I spent an afternoon struggling with it, nodding off to sleep every two or three paragraphs. To his credit, Stewart raises a number of issues about science and human nature, but it is done in the context of an uneventful story. The first book in years that almost made me abandon it halfway through, but I fought it out to the end. I remained disappointed.","Wow I can't remember the last time I started to hope something bad would happen to the main character in a story. Worst main character in a book ever. Annoying, Lazy, sexist, racist, boring and anti-religionist. Maybe it was the slow story line. Maybe it was the fact that NOTHING happens to the characters after the first 100 pages. I don't know. But I hate this book. I felt like yelling \"Get up and do something!!\" The power goes out and he sits. The streets start to flood and he sits. The water stops running and he sits!! Then he starts to think of himself as a god!! haha. The best part of the book is the end. Why? (spoiler)he dies and you don't have to read anymore.Sorry to ramble but my mind is cloudy now from finishing that \"book\".Do not buy this book. Get it from the library read the first 75 pages then take it back.","This book is dull, slow, and predictable. I read most of it hoping that it would pick up but it never did. I usually like these type of disaster books too. Lucipher's Hammer is ten times better than this one. I really have no idea how this book could have 5 stars.","Having skimmed the other reviews, it seems that one had to read this book as a young person and use those glowing memories to enjoy it. Since I approached the book fresh, the flaws are glaring.The main character, Ish, is pretty dull. There isn't much dialogue in the book, so most speech is communicated through his hearing others and describing what they meant. Since he's not particularly insightful, reading is slow and the pages creep by.Civilization seems completely lost despite the fact that books, machines, etc. remain intact. Ish rules The Tribe, who are a step or so above a Neanderthal group. They even walk from place to place like hunter-gathers. How about using the million and one bicycles laying around if you can't figure out how to get gas for a car?The book is not poorly written, just improbable and boring.","The concept of how civilization slowly succumbs to the forces of nature was an interesting concept. That part of the novel was very good. Ish the main character of the book was the leader of a small community of survivors. He sees himself as the most intelligent of them all and for some reason wants to keep it that way. He locks up a library and only he has access to it. Once children are born and old enough to go to school he cancels it, no children of the new world learn to read. Nobody seems to want to become self-sufficient but relies on the products of a past civilization. A stranger comes to join them and Ish murders him out of jealously that his role might be challenged. From then on he carries the hammer he killed the stranger with, with him all the way to his death. No interest was ever sparked by anyone to learn to read, farm, make things or anything else. Everyone lives off of canned goods for 20+ years. I won't say anything more in case the reader of this has not read the book and would like too. Ultimately I was disappointed but would recommend it anyway.","Earth Abides is a book about no matter what happens to the race of people, Earth will always abide. A Man named Isherwood Williams somehow survives this fatal virus that is going around killing the whole human population. Ish then spends almost the rest of his life driving across the country searching for survivors. When he finally meets a group of survivors he \"marries\" one of them and has about twenty children with her.Ish does find a few survivors, however it was definitely not enough to keep me interested in finishing the book. I thought this book was long, drawn out and sometimes too boring. If George R. Stewart, the author, would have spiced it up a bit with more science fiction things happening. For instance if more abnormal things happening to the humans than just death like it was a flesh eating virus and then something else happened with the virus. The genre of the book is Science Fiction. The plot this author had in mind was a god idea however if it was only about one hundred pages shorter and the ending with the twenty children was cut then it would have been easier to keepinterest.So all in all the book had very few parts that could have beenedited out and still would have made sense. The idea of the book and the plot of the book was good. I like the little reality the book had in it. Again if there were more science fiction, and less pages, it also might have been better. So that is why I gave the book a measly two stars out of five. I think this a reasonable amount and I commend the author on his work. I would recomend this book to someone who loves to read and is interested in books about little science fiction and little reality.","The protagonist is arrogant, lazy and stupid. He likes to sit around smoking cigarettes and thinking about how much smarter he is than all the other survivors while his wife cooks him meals and takes care of his children. He doesn't bother to teach his children to read, and he doesn't bother to learn anything medical or mechanical or any other potentially useful skills in a post-apocalyptic world. At one point he runs across some other survivors who are Black, and he thinks about how he could stay and \"be king\" of them because he is white. The ultimate self-absorbed old white man fantasy.","If almost all the people in the world were dead, and you had to spend your life with an egotistical, chauvanistic, racist white guy with absolutely no redeeming qualities you'll love this. Archie Bunker would have loved this guy. I, did not.Old does not have to be disfunctional.","Though it feels a little dated having been written over four decades ago, &quot;Earth Abides&quot; deserves its place with great 1950s era end-of-the world books like &quot;On the Beach&quot; and &quot;Day of the Triffids.&quot; The scenario is similar to the one Stephen King used in &quot;The Stand&quot; though the plague wipes out a much larger number of people and there is little spiritualism here. What affected me most was the latter part which shows the years passing in the life of the main survisor. I rarely get emotional while reading, but this story did it to me.","Global plague vectored through air travel has beenfeatured in recent films, television specials, andthe news. Set between the European Black Death ofthe late 1600s and this decade's African Ebola,Earth Abides deals with the hope, struggles, andresignation of modern-day plague survivors. Withfewer than one percent of the world's populationsurviving, how would you fare? What wisdom wouldyou pass on to those younger than you? The Centerfor Disease Control intimates that world-wideplague is more a question of When, rather than If.So... how do we begin the day after?Over the years, I've read this provocative bookseveral times, and have enjoyed it more each time.For those who enjoy Crichton's works(Jurassic Park, Congo, or Eaters of the Dead),Earth Abides is a rare find. Kay O'Cullane.","Stewart did an excellent job of putting your hand on thehammer! Classic tale of &quot;What if I were the last man onearth?&quot; Best read out loud at least twice in your lifetime.","I dont write too many reviews any more and I dont want to make this into a flame session but let me get this right Corie (from your review).The book is literally about the last man on earth, and you're indifferent to the character's guarded and self preserving manner. I think you are completely out of sync with the theme, let alone the character. This is a brutally honest portrayal of a human being (with all his short comings) in the wake of oblivion. Not a butterfly in the midst of smoke. It's a reactionary tale, one of struggle and survival. You seem to see it as moment for liberation and righteousness. If anything Corie, you have imposed yourself on this character, in the same vain you speak of.This is the individual, warts and all, and merely hating him does not render this book yucky.As for the racial tone that you claim, as quoted by Powell Timothy \"...its revolutionary (for the time) treatment of racial issues was particularly powerful in the mid-20th century when the book was published, and influenced many contemporary artists, most famously Jimi Hendrix. \"Earth Abides\" was Hendrix's favorite novel, and inspired some of the songs on his first album\"Perhaps, if some of you better relate to decisive characters, you should watch the post apocalyptic TV soap drama, 'Jericho' instead. There you will find your cliche depictions of heroes and villians.","Okay let me tell you how I really feel. WOW!!!I hesitated to buy this book after hearing it did not have much end of the world violence, no undead or lots of dead and has a more clean antiseptic air about it. They were correct but what it lacked in that area was more then made up in the quality and depth of the characters and the uncanny ability of the main character Ish to pull you into the story and carry you along in his experiences. I would compare Earth Abides to a movie from the 30's or 40's where there was more dialog and depth as opposed to many of today's films/books based more on spectacular visual effects and lots of gore but lacking in most every other area and are soon forgotten.(And I like some of those books and movies).Earth Abides has a much stronger human touch or bond as you see Ish from a young man dealing with a plaque that wiped most of humanity away and his final death at old age. What transpired between youth and death for Ish is something I guarantee you will remember for the rest of your life. I have read numerous Sci Fi books and rarely has any reached a level comparable to Earth Abides. This book is a keeper that I will definitely read again in the future.","This book reaches across time and avoids the technology trap. It hits home in many circumstances and is an excellent read. I liked its energy and symbolism. It avoids being grim and actually gives you hope for a disastrous future.","A worldwide virus has killed off nearly all the world's population. Ish starts exploring a world with no rules and few people. He finds some other people and they form &quot;The Tribe&quot; to restart their civilasation. Interesting book, and it actually survives pretty well considering how long ago it was written. There are very few passages in the book that date it significantly.","Earth Abides by George Stewart is one of many post-apocalyptic novels written during the height of the Cold War. However it is quieter and more introspective than most of its peers, something made evident by the manor of disaster that devastates mankind in the novel. Instead of a nuclear inferno, a viral plague almost eradicates humanity. Isherwood &quot;Ish&quot; Williams is trapped in an isolated cabin recovering from a snakebite when the epidemic is unleashed. When he heals and ventures outward, he discovers the near extinction of his species and begins a search for others who immune to the disease.That section is interesting but Earth Abides becomes a truly outstanding novel when Ish discovers others and they found a new society. Stewart takes a sociological approach to this development. He gives a fascinating account of a community completely isolated from other communities and a generation living in a Garden-of-Eden-state, completely isolated from its own past. One of the novel's best moments occurs when an untrustworthy visitor comes to the area and Ish and the other elders must decide what action to take. Their decision will surprise you. Both in the post-apocalyptic genre and the field of science fiction in general, Earth Abides is a gem.","I 1960, I was nine years old, I remember staying up all night during summer vacation to finish it, I still love this book!","I found this book totally by happy accident, and it remains one of my all-time favorites. What is chilling is that the basic premise of the book is quite possible and believable, given diseases like Ebola that are out there. He gave real-life examples of other species that became overpopulated, and then were nearly wiped out by a plague. What is man but another species of animal on this planet, and we are not immune--look at the Black Plague, for example. A truly unique look at what might happen to the earth if we are nearly wiped out, and what might happen to the people left to survive afterward. A great read!","The start of this novel was magical for me - so engrossing and so convincing. But then it descends into the comfortable and the suburban. Is this the fate of all human communities? More disappointing was the ugliness of some decisions made by the community - and for me these were far from inevitable or even justifiable. These were presaged on p132 of the SF Masterworks edition - '... except for Evie, the half-witted one, who should never be allowed to have children.' How attitudes have changed since 1949 when this book was written!","This book is about what is wrong with us as humans. The beginning of the book is very interesting as the main character, drives around the country to see what is left in the aftermath of the disease that has wiped out most of the population. After that the book goes downhill. The characters are not that likable. The children are brats, and the adults lack the conviction to make them better people. The items which are in the story aren't realistic (it is very unlikely that gas would not be usable after 20+ years even if stored well), and overall the story just wasn't very interesting to me.","Was disappointed in this book. Expected there to be more action and survivors to be more aggressive in making a better life for themselves. In my opinion people would not act this way in a disaster. They would try to make things better.","This is one of my favorite books of all time and one of the few books that I can re-read. Oddly enough I almost find at times I want to live in the horrible world that is created in the story. Maybe that says more about me than it does about the book though.","I have read this book several times over the years, I really favor this type of fiction (science?) This book is so well written it has stood up to the test of time, as good as any newer fiction of the same genera. Give this book a chance, you won't be sorry. You don't have to buy it, I saw a couple of copies in my local library, I'll bet most full size librarys have a copy. Happy reading.","I loved this book from front to back. Its a beautiful story with characters you can invest in. I have passed it around to many friends and they agree its moving.","This book stands the test of time! A great survival/end of the world book that entertains as much as WWZ (without zombies). Like \"I Am Legend\", Earth Abides tells a great tale of survival of a lone man on earth (without vampires). Love the progression/deterioration of the man made world described here as well as how society evolves. Epic in scope this book covers an entire lifetime, not just a few months or years. I've read this several times and will again one day I'm sure.","Apparently, Amazon shows when a book was last published in the details section, but not when the work was first published. Earth Abides was written in the 40s or 50s.It's an interesting read, but coming with 21st century sensibilities, with ideas of the horrifying chaos and violence should civilization fall from the likes of 2012 (the movie) or Stephen King's The Stand, Earth Abides seems very pastoral and unrealistic. I won't spoil it with too much detail, but two examples are 1) one character is able to drive from California to New York after 99% of humanity had perished. Wouldn't the roads be full of abandoned cars? 2) There's no horrifying killings, rapes, cannibalism, robbery, diseases among the survivors ... something that we know does happen when authority breaks down from real wars in Africa and elsewhere, but in this novel, the only dangers are from failing electricity and running water.I'm not being fair. Stewart is probably reflecting the more naive era of the 1940s or 50s. The book does flow very nicely and I especially LOVE the very nostalgic and melancholic last few chapters of the book.","One of the handful of true classics in the Apocalyptic genre that are Must reads. This account follows a survivor in a post-pandemic world that decimated the human race as he seeks out other survivors and begins to rebuild. Excellent read from page one!!! Solid and believable story line, great characters, and very entertaining! Includes \"year zero!\"","I love the apocolypse genre - so thought provoking, and Earth Abides is one of the best I've read so far. I was surprised I'd never heard of it before seeing someone on a message board mention it. I decided to give it a try, and am so glad I did. This has now been moved into my books to read again, and that really doesn't happen often.I didn't realize how long ago this had been written until the main character described going into a house and sitting down to rest on the \"davenport\" - how long has it been since we heard that term?Really though, the premise is such that it really doesn't matter when the book was written. The same thought provoking situations occur. Highly recommend.","Long ago, when I was about 12, I read a book by George Stewart called Fire. I remember enjoying this book. When I came across The Earth Abides last year I remembered thinking that I might enjoy this one based on my prior experience with his earlier book. Besides I liked the title. Well my enthusiasm started to wane after reading the first 100 pages or so. I started to think that perhaps my taste had changed in the intervening decades. In Fire, I had found interesting his asides where he described the fire and its growth. Here, when he interrupted the story in an aside describing changes to the world and the decay of mankind's works, I found it distracting and thought it broke the narrative flow. Several times I found myself saying \"that is not the way people would behave\" and second guessing the author- fighting against the direction the author was taking us. I thought that perhaps the story, being written in the late `40's, was dated. However, about two-thirds of the way through the book, right about the time when a couple of the colony members were sent on a cross country trip to see what was going on in the rest of the country, I had a major change of heart. It was like a log jam breaking. I suddenly let go of my preconceptions and opened my mind up to his vision, his story. I found the story suddenly compelling and the characters believable, and the writing, while not on the level of a Saul Bellow, moving and effective. I found his description of civilization slipping backward, and the growth of the colony into a tribal, superstitious society, in contrast to the protagonist's scientific \"modern\" leanings, very powerful and imbued the story with a powerful melancholy. However, the book is not necessarily all depressing. Indeed it makes clear that mankind would survive- and the earth would abide until his eventual return. Looking back, writing in the first person was very effective. The final chapter is a beautiful and fitting ending.","I don't think I've ever read a book where the author has done more research than Stewart has done for this one. Not only did he have to do all that research, but he had to sit down and think things through: the rise and fall of ants, the mountain lions running out of food in the mountains, the sheep being lost. It was truly amazing. It also brought to light several things that would and would not happen if man were gone. Some of them are bad and some are good. Stewart gives a fair, unbiased (and likely acurate) picture of an Earth where most humans have suddenly dissappeared.","I found the premise of the book interesting and, for the most part, it was well executed. However, the characters' passivity and lack of ambition is very frustrating. The people who survived the plague seem to have lost the will to achieve! Stewart seems to deliberately portray all characters except Ish and Joey as somewhat limited, despite the fact that they actually contribute more to the continued survival of the community that the \"smart one\". Ish seems content to just go along and then regret that things haven't advanced. Ish doesn't ever seem to gain any understanding that he could have taken the initiative to broaden the scope of the community. Even in the context of the time the book was written, the women are treated as objects. There is no indication of deep thought or emotion from any of them.","I first read this book when I was a teenager and read it again last week (30 years later.) I was surprised at how much I remembered from it (I have completely forgotten books I read 6 months ago!)Of course the book is dated, it was written over 50 years ago and of course technology and social attitudes have changed. Of course the main character is flawed and of course we think we could all have done better, but wouldn't fiction be boring if every character were perfect?I loved the descriptions (in italics) of the breakdown of civillisation, about how plants and animals evolve when \"man\" dissappears.I've looked at some of the reviews for this book and am not surprised that most enlightened readers have given this book 5 stars. Neither am I surprised to see the occasional reader give it one star and to read their vehement reviews. These show that the book has worked and all its readers have strong opinions about it.","This book is with out a doubt one of the best I have ever read. Stewart portrays the end of our world, as we know it and tells the story of a man's need to survive in a world he no longer knows and trusts. This novel is not one of action and amazing death defying feats, but one of a man's introspective thoughts and of the will to live in a world that has been brought down by it's own ignorance and naivet&eacute;. This book is like a huge juicy red stake, there is almost too much meat to handle. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to think, and think seriously about what it means to be human!","A must read for fans of apocalyptic fiction. Even though it was published in 1949 nothing about the book seems dated. It deserves its ranking (by David Pringle) as one of the 100 best Sci Fi novels of all time.","I read Earth Abides the first time over 35 years ago. It is one of the few books that genuinely presents an &quot;end of civilization&quot; as we know it and does it well without a lot of fanfare. This is a discriptive story that I plan to read again.","A friend lent me this book many years ago. I loved it. But I forgot the title and author and when I recently wanted to reread it no one was able to help me. I searched and searched for it to no avail. Finally someone on a sci fi newsgroup was able to help me. This book is fascinating. It is one of my all time favorites. The author has an incredible imagination and you really believe this is what would happen if civilization were to die off. It is so full of vivid details and really makes you think.","This is a book everyone should read; a book worthy of being read over and over during a lifetime. I've read it twice and will probably read it several more times. The subject of a disastrous plague almost wiping out civilization is written in such a way that it's entirely believable. It's fascinating to see how Mr. Stewart's characters face survival. The very last part of the book is a bit confusing, but then life viewed from the point of a very old person may be very confusing.","I throroughly enjoyed reading The Earth Abides because it compelled me to consider what motivations there are for the individual to continue living. I felt the most interesting part of the book was the notion that the individual must actively define what direction his life is to take, the setting of the story added to the importance of this decision and entertained different options and the validity of those decisions.","I stumbled across this book a few decades ago when living in Japan for over a year. I was hungry for English words in a good book. It surpassed my expectations! The plot is beautifully developed and makes a surreal world believable. The human struggle and resourcesfullness was absolutely heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time. I cared so much about the outcome of the characters, I couldn't put it down! Very few books lure repeat reads like this one did. After misplacing it during my returning to the U.S., I hunted for a another copy everywhere to no avail. Finally, when it appeared in the dark corner of a small used bookstore, you would have thought I struck gold. Years later, at the end of a job interview, I was asked to name my favorite book--probably to ensure that I was cultured reader. Without hesitation, I recommended \"Earth Abides\" in full glory. The irony is that I'm not typically a science-fiction reader, leaning more toward drama and suspense. Well, that's exactly what this book offers as no other! If you have time to read only one book, make it this one!","I like reading older books, and this one certainly fits the bill as it was published in 1949.It was written in an older style with minimal dialogue. It's also written in the first person which makes it very subjective.I found Ish, the main character, at first, bland and uninteresting. But as I read he grew on me.I would recommend the book as one version of how things may evolve after a widespread plague and only a few survivors.It is well written, although in some scenes I found the dialogue a little too 'bible-ish'. I also found some plot developments a bit unrealistic. I believe it is an ingrained characteristic in humans to want to survive, to lash out at fate and try to beat it. I don't think that, as in this book, people would just give up and live off the remnants of the old world forever (or until the next generation picks up the ball). I think people would automatically try to herd cattle and sheep and try to start gardens and orchards.Another weak point is how the author seems to avoid the harder scenes in the book. When something is done about Charlie, when Joey contracts the disease and it's outcome, and when Ish's wife finally dies. All these main moments in Ish's life are avoided by skimming over them.All in all I do recommend this book, but it is not for readers wanting action. It's for readers wanting to think.I'll remember for while the passage in Chapter 2 of the last secion where we discover that Ish did make a impact on the outcome of the tribe. It reminded me that sometimes just by doing what we think is right we affect the outcome of our own immediate environment, our tribe.","Maybe today the plot of \"Earth abides\" is nothing new, but when it was written, in 1949, it surely was. Professor Stewart's only book in science-fiction quickly turned into a milestone concerning apocalyptic themes. William Brinkley's \"The last ship\", Pat Frank's \"Alas, Babylon\", Nevil Shute's \"On the beach\" and Stephen King's \"The stand\" all come to mind as having similar ideas, although each of the five books mentioned have their own characteristics and deal with the subject of \"end of human civilization\" in unique ways.\"Earth abides\" is more like a one-man chronicle. Isherwood Williams, a reclusive geology student, finds himself a survivor of an unnamed \"Great Disaster\" that has wiped out 99% of humankind. During the course of the book, Stewart tells the reader how Ish, as he calls his main character, learned to live again, without all the comforts of civilization, forming a new family, than a new community. Ish thinks of himself as \"the last american\", and Stewart explains very well why that is so.Although not overtly a \"dark\" science-fiction story - like \"On the beach\", for example -, \"Earth abides\" has a subtle way of making the reader very uneasy and impotent as he turns the pages. This book was written almost sixty years ago, but has a very modern feeling about it - not scientifically, of course, but if we think about how Man deal with his peers and with nature, Stewart's book will ring some known bells.Grade 8.7/10","I fully expected to enjoy this book. I've read piles of books in the same genre - The Stand, The Road, Plague Journals, etc. This is notably different in that there is absolutely no faith or hope - there is no striving for better, there is only just getting by.I was very put off my the narrator's belief that no one else possessed any intellect. I've met loads of blue collar workers who would have done a much better job in getting things started. I simply can't imagine a group of people who would settle for canned food instead of growing their own. Who would settle for no electricity? I can't imagine having access to a library and not researching how to start a power plant back up. There was no planning - just living day to day.I guess I have a different belief about the nature of man. And, as others stated, I don't know that the author had children or interacted with them. They are sponges and want to learn. They can be inspired - he was simply ineffective - it was his fault then that he couldn't get them motivated.","After reading Earth Abides (for the second time, in the early 1960's), I was moved to write to GRS, which I had never before done, with any author!My letter was passed on to his address via his Literary Agent in London, and arrived in San Francisco three weeks after his death.I received a treasured return letter from Theodosia Stewart, his widow, and after a few exchanges of letters, she invited me to come to San Francisco to meet her and that she would give me access to all of his notes and work in the archives at The Bancroft Library at Berkeley University.I took up this offer, and in 1985, travelled to California - my first flight!!!I have written an account, with photographs, of the people I met and the places connected with GRS, many of whom I am still in contact with, and will some day publish this account, but the above serves to show what an effect this book had on a young (38 years) englishman, to pull me across the world.The high points of my visit were meeting Theodosia (Ted) Stewart, visiting \"the house on San Lupo Drive\", and standing on the smooth slabs at Indian Rock Park.All of this came from reading \"Earth Abides\".","I hate to add a note of dissent to all the glowing reviews but this book really frustrated me. It`s not that it was badly written though I found the style a little clinical. I guess that is just a reflection of the personality of Ish, through whose eyes we see the unfolding of the years following the devastating plague. Myabe it was his character that annoyed me so much and basically put me off the book. He seemed to consider himself so superior to those about him and become almost unbalanced in his lofty plans for his favourite son. I found it hard to believe that everyone else in the community apart from him was so darn thick. I also found it very sexist, even though i know that only reflects the time it was written. The author`s attitude to race relations was dedfinitely more forward-thinking than towards women, who were mainly portrayed as baby-obsessed brood-mares. Even Em, the main female character was seen as reacting to events on an instinctual rather than intellectual level.The apathy of the community also bothered me - would people really be this unconcerned about their children`s future? Decades later and they hadn`t taught the children to read so they could learn how to do all that stuff they`d eventually need - like how to make candles, when to plant crops, how to weave fabric, etc etc. I can`t believe they were STILL living off tinned food all those years after and hadn`t even bothered to domesticate any horses or grow vegetable gardens! I prefer the English series Survivors, which I feel tackled the practicalities of having to provide and produce absolutely EVERYTHING necessary to life for yourself much better than this did.","First, as a story, the character development is poor and any drama is virtually non-existent. There are a few opportunities for drama, but in each case, the author fails to draw in the reader and make them care. Similarly, there's little to cause the reader to become invested in the characters. You could read abstracts on the characters and get as much out of them as reading the novel.Secondly, the \"hero\" is annoying and a bit contemptible, but perhaps this is the author's goal. Regardless, it made me like the story even less. In short, the hero prefers to sit around and do nothing while he complains inwardly about the dullness and laziness of his \"tribe\". This goes on, and on, and on... In short, I eventually got tired of the hero's endless elitism and hypocrisy.Perhaps the author's message is that the hero didn't understand while the simpletons did. Perhaps his message was that civilization is overrated compared to a simple and primitive life, we should stop worrying, live in the now, leave the rat race, etc, etc. If so, his delivery of that message is painfully boring and repetitive for the reader. At the end of the book, I really didn't care if there was a message or what it was.On a positive note, the prose used to break up chapters was often well-written. It just wasn't enough to make up for the bad execution on the actual story.","Every time the protagonist passes judgement on other characters, have a drink.Every time the protagonist compares himself to a god or demi god, have a drinkEvery time the protagonist says \"Oh! Mother of Nations\" or \"Oh Joey!\" have a drink.Every time the protagonist refers to himself as the last American despite there being evidence that other communities of survivors have formed, likely with their own elders, take a drink.Every time you find an editing error, have a drink.You may want to take it one chapter at a time so you are not utterly intoxicated. The book was most interesting for the interpretation of what post pandemic America could be like. However, the story moves slowly and the dialogue is stilted and awkward. Not as good as I had hoped for.","I know this is the grandfather of post-apocalyptic fiction but some of the attitudes expressed in this book are so dated and unrealistic that they pulled me out of the story. There are lots of poetic passages and lyrical writing but the hero is surprisingly unsympathetic and uncharismatic for my taste.","The premise of the story is interesting, especially in our time of ridiculous overpopulation of this planet and the ability for any virus to move worldwide in a short time, but the story wasn't especially well written. I really can't see so much of current civilization being lost as Mr. Stewart expects. Also, there wasn't very much character development.","An aging story. I liked the book on a whole, but the middle and end dragged into tedium.The first half of the book was very interesting to me, and I enjoyed the writing immensely. The last half of the book, on the other had was very, very slow.By the time the end came I was ready for it to be over, and did not much care what happened to everybody after that. good riddance.","The book must be praised for being quite different from most sci-fi of its time. Much of the narrative is spent taking a look at the details of the slow collapse of man's works after he is gone. If you enjoy \"Life after People\" you will enjoy this. However, Stewart's Apocalypse is a gentle one, with little evidence of panic or struggle as mankind fell.I also love that the timeline spans many years, interspersed with important episodes from the anti-hero's perspective. Having a hero that was not a superman was definitely different for the time, as was his pessimism. I loved the cross country adventure and the gradual expansion of the Ish's tribe as it met others. The book felt a little like Asmimov's foundation, which is a good thing.I thought the ending sequence [minor SPOILER alert] concerning how old age affects one's cognitive abilities was particularly well done.This could have been one of my all time favorites, if not for two things :1) the main character's egotism was hard to swallow. Perhaps the author expected he would be disliked? I doubt it however.2) Dated 40's attitudes. It feels racist AND classist (in the author's/Ish's description of the other survivors).I do highly recommend this novel, but with the grain of salt.","I have just finished reading \"Earth Abides\" for the fourth time. The first time I read it I was in my early twenties after having been lent a copy by a friend. Like so many readers, the story haunted me and many years later I decided to buy a copy of my own to read again. It was out of print in the UK at that time but I did eventually manage to obtain a copy in the States. I read it again and again. I am now 59 and the member of a book club which had \"The Road\", another post-apocalyptic story which has recently been made into a film, as one of its reads. This had a rather mixed reception from members and so I told them about \"Earth Abides\". I am delighted to say that every one of our members has read \"Earth Abides\" and enjoyed it.I notice that, like me, 90% of reviewers are happy to give \"Earth Abides\" 5 stars. Out of curiousity I have read the reviews of the minority who give it less than 3 and I have the following comments to make. Those who say \"what happened to all the dead bodies?\" need to read the book again. There are numerous references to what happened in the final stages of the epidemic, the way that they dealt with the dead and the dying, the emergency centres that were set up and the subsequent places that Ish avoided on his travels because of the smell of rotting corpses etc.Another popular criticism of the book is the apparent inability of Ish and his tribe to be creative, to teach the children to read, or to make any progress in salaging anything of the previous civilisation. I have had about 30 years to think about this one myself and I am not convinced that given the small, random group of survivors that Ish had at his disposal, and the lifestyle that they had gotten used to, that things could have turned out differently. For me the whole point of the story was that in a situation where the population slips below a certain threashold it is not possible to hang onto civilization as we know it and that a new civilization has to be born. The children of the tribe instinctively knew this and taught themselves the skills they would eventually need to survive. Think about what happened to previous so-called civilisations in our history to what happened to them in times of climactic change - they disappeared.The haunting part to this whole story is the question what happened next? For me \"Earth Abides\" will be one of the best books I have ever read or am ever likely to read.","Audible.com recently recorded what I think is the first ever audio version of George R. Stewart's classic novel, Earth Abides, so I decided to give it another read. I've read it before of course, but it's probably been almost 20 years since the last time, so I was excited to get into it again.Written in 1949, Earth Abides, is probably the earliest \"modern\" example of a pandemic post-apocalyptic novel. It follows Isherwood Williams, known as just Ish, for a period of about 50 or 60 years, starting after The Great Disaster, an unknown plague that wipes out all but just a few pockets of survivors. We see The Tribe, as they call themselves, started from just seven survivors, as it develops into a group of over a hundred people in the hills of San Francisco.There are hundreds of reviews of the book around the web, so I'll just stick with a few thoughts. It' definitely a good book (it won several awards and is credited by Stephen King as an inspiration for The Stand), and I really enjoyed it myself, but I can see how if you're not a super-fan of the post-apocalyptic genre, you might think it's a little slow in places. The first third or so feels like watching Tom Hanks in Cast Away; there's basically zero dialog as Ish travels around the country looking for other survivors. Even when a few of them gather to start a community, the writing style is mostly descriptive, without a lot of talk.But the material that's covered is perfect for anyone who wonders about how civilization would fare after an apocalypse. Would the children born into the new world be curious about the old one? Would they care to learn to read or to carry on the knowledge of the \"Old Ones\"? Would they view the Old Ones as people like themselves, or would they look on them as gods who created all the indecipherable wonders they see around them?Ish struggles with the answers to these kinds of questions as he tries to preserve and pass on enough knowledge to keep some semblance of civilization, if not simply his people, alive. They face actual dangers, such as wanderers bearing disease, but the greatest threat to the future of The Tribe is their apathy. The few from Before are comfortable enough in their current existence to not want to bother reclaiming the comforts of the old world, and those born after don't know enough about what they're missing to care either. So they live off the corpse of the old world, eating wild animals or out of cans for decades, not bothering to learn how to plant their own crops or keep their own farms.So, if you're looking for a primer on how to keep a small community alive in an urban environment after the collapse of civilization, this isn't it. This is almost an anthropological study, seen as it's happening, of the recreation of society from scratch, and as it goes on, we're not sure if that society will turn out to be recognizable to those of us left behind or not.So like I said before, if you're not a fan of the genre, or are looking for a more action-oriented story, this might not be for you. But for a true fan, Earth Abides is one of the \"Big Ones\", on most every list of the best post-apocalyptic novels ever written, so if you haven't read it yet, you really should.","I first read this book in the 60's as my husband and I were in university. I carried it for about 20 years and lost it and life took over and I never replaced it. But my mind has continued to reflect on passages, in fact, I will tell someone how racial prejudice starts and I got it from this book. It covers a frightening time but the ingenuity, focus, and just \"I will not die\" leaves in the reader ideas that will live with you forever.This morning, I couldn't stand it and went to look for it and found it here at Amazon. Thank you, thank you.","I haven't read this book in at least 35 years yet I feel like I read it only last week. This story was unique in it's treatment of humanity and it's approach to the end of the world. This is not a Man conquers over all obstacles story. The future is bleak but the characters are real humans faced with the end of their civilization. They abide, after a fashion, but not near the same as the humanity we know. I wonder how this might have been done with man's dependence on technology even greater today. This is a classic and deserves more attention.","While doing research in a remote cabin, Isherwood Williams is bitten by a rattlesnake. Emerging from a short delirium, Ish returns to civilization only to find that a new virus has wiped out 99.9% of the Earth's population. Ish sets out to see if he can find any survivors.The story is told in an irregular fashion, slowly detailing Ish's immediate experiences, then speeding into the future only to slow again for years that are more important. I enjoyed the haphazard narrative, but wished that the author had focused more detail during several essential emotional scenes regarding birth and death.The focus of the story revolves around Ish's struggle to preserve the American society against superstitions that threaten to govern the new society. The author touches on many of the possible earth changes that might happen in such a catastrophe. Some systems immediately fail while some last for many years. Fans of Stephen Kings \"The Stand\" will enjoy this similar, yet simpler tale.","Earth Abides was a great book. It is not what you would call an action-packed sci-fi novel. Rather, it is extremely thought provoking. It makes you think about the meaning of life, human relations with other men and with nature, your place in the world, and the value of what you do. Although written in the forties, it is still very relevant because it also makes you question the value of our increasingly faster and busier lifestyles and constant striving for more advanced technology.Yes, like some reviewers did, you can argue with some details, but if this is your main concern you are taking quite a shallow view of it and not seeing the forest for the trees. The beauty of this book is not so much in the details, but in it's enormous scope and ambition.This was a book that I could not put down and one that I think will long influence me.","Earth Abides is an interesting take on the human condition. Whether you agree or disagree with what the author is trying to say, it is definitely a book that makes you think about the story line and characters.While I disagree with most of Stewart's assumptions, it is well written and thought provoking. Definitely a classic that should be read again and again.","\"Earth Abides\" is NOT a science fiction novel, which is probably why many readers...have been disappointed. It is much more a social commentary, a critical examination of the human race, and a thoughtful analysis of where the human race really rates in the grand scheme of things. Thematically, the novel has more in common with Daniel Quinn's \"Ishmael\" than King's \"The Stand.\" Stewart asks us to consider the true meaning of \"civilization\" -- is it all about electricity, running water, and refrigeration? Or is it more about community and survival? Stewart's main character tries valiently to convince the new race of Americans to work together to reform the kind of civilization that led to world overpopulation in the first place (and that overpopulation, he theorizes -- in very Quinn-like reasoning -- results in a very natural plague that wipes out most of the human race). The lessons learned in this compelling novel are both profound and frightening. Could it be possible that some day our ancestors, generations in the future, will look back on us as odd and strange creatures who depended too much on invention and not enough on ourselves? In some ways, the novel is about the conflict between intellectualism and naturalism. In other ways, it's about learning to deal with change. However you read it, \"Earth Abides\" is a terrific book you won't soon forget.","As always, interesting to see the vast number of five star review for a book deserving of maybe three. Would be quite fascinating to easily see a breakdown of reviewers' ratings showing number of reviews at each star level - would we see most people rate things at 5 stars?I just finished this book, and have been thinking about why it was so bad. It never captured my interest, the characters were cardboard, astoundingly enough the plot was nearly nonexistent and worst of all, no conflict/tension!After the initial collapse, our hero drives across the country, from San Francisco to Manhattan, making trivial contact with a few people apparently for the purpose of seeing an empty New York City. He then returns to California, where he proceeds to settle down for the next 20+ years without doing anything except mosey down to the local abandoned grocery store to snag some canned food.My big insight from reading this book was realizing most people were essentially lazy before television was invented.There are so many other better genre books, including _On The Beach_ and _Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang_.","The book, first written in 1949 tells a story that could be just as true today. A pandemic that sweeps the contenent leaving few survivors. Isherwood (Ish) Williams is the protagonist. His life is the focus of the story, with interaction with a gradual collection of a few other survivors, that results in a slowly growing tribe. Well worth reading and rereading a few years later.","This book is great and I found it on Amazon at a great price. it shipped promptly and arrive in great shape.","Written in the 50s, it talks about ecology when nobody even knew the word. Ish watches the world spasm itself back into equilibrium after man is removed from the equation. Add elements of anthropology and sociology and and you have a truly remarkable book. Read it. NOW!","First published in 1949, Earth Abides is George R. Stewart's take on what would happen if all of the human population of Earth, except a few scattered survivors, were killed by a vicious disease. The tale is presented entirely through the thoughts and experiences one man, i.e., Isherwood Williams. Ish is a graduate student when the \"Great Disaster\" leaves him alone in the Oakland CA area. He eventually finds a few other survivors, including Emma (Em) who becomes his partner and the mother of his children. Ish and Em and their small band of survivors create a fledgling community that struggles with immense hardships to survive. However, they do survive and their community \"The Tribe\" grows slowly. Ish, as the only educated person among the group, becomes a leader and eventually becomes revered almost as a God after many years. Ish remains a thinker throughout his life, and a worrier through most of it. The book is very interesting and presents much credible (at least based on the 1949 knowledge base) information about what the world would be like and how it would change if humans cease to be a significant force. It also presents much logical information about how a very small human community would struggle to adapt and develop a simple but functioning social organization. Much of the book presents Ish's thoughts about how to help his tribe survive and also how to motivate or manipulate them to develop skills and knowledge that might enable them to develop a new civilization in the future. At times, I did not like Ish, but I usually understood the logic of his thoughts and actions. Although things did not work out the way Ish wanted, he finally realized that the tribe and Earth's changing environment would interact to determine the future without his help. I found this book to be a slow but interesting read. It was also intellectually stimulating and engendered much emotion. Reading this science fiction classic is well worth the effort.","I have read this book multiple times and have totally been immersed in WHAT IFS. I have talked more about this book than about any other book that I have read except for The Source by James Michener.. The idea of the world actually existing after most of the people have died from an unknown cause is so thought provoking. Most people I have talked to and let read my book have been as impressed by Earth Abides as I have been but then there are the very few who thought that they could do better if they had been in the same circumstances. I always thought that I would eventually have to go back to cave man status. It is a book that should be read in college. I would totally recommend it.","This book is less about an apocalyptic event that kills most humans and more about the reemergence of society and the influences that geography, history, and personal beliefs have on it. Ishi, the main character, strives to bring back the scholarly lifestyle he values, but is faced with convincing the new generation of its value in a world where his children are free from the society he knew.","One of my favorites that I surely will read more than once. I loved how you got to read about the main character from the age of 18 to his death. The book is amazing at telling the story of how they all survive and how mankind seems to revert back to tribal and superstitious beliefs. I almost wanted to jump in and live this life with them even though their hardships seemed too much to bear.","See this movie and gain a perspective on where we came from. Who we are and where you are going. Buddha jesus all the same guy. Whi knew?","I have read all of Stephenn King's books, so when he wrote that this book was his inspiration for writing The Stand, I knew it would be good. I purchased Earth Abides in a London bookstore a few years ago, but somehow it has gone missing. So I was very surprised and exited when I saw that it was being offered as a kindle book. I have now re-read Earth Abides and it is truly a great work of fiction. It really gets my imagination working, and makes real just how fragile the human race is.","I enjoy Post apocalyptic sic fi but this was not that entertaining after a while.","With so many books available to read, is this one worth your time? Ultimately, you'll have to make that decision, but I hope my review can help in some way.There are some technology issues with the story that clearly show it was written in the late 1940's; however, these don't detract too much from the story.There are also a few typos in the Kindle edition, which I assume is a scanning problem when converting to eBook format.The two main issues I had with the book are:1. Food - It is unrealistic to think that people would be subsisting off canned food for 20+ years, let alone, 40+ years at the end of the book.2. Future generations - Without ruining the ending, the book makes a plot decision on how Ish decides to pass knowledge on to future generations. I liked two aspects of what he did, but I thought the rest was foolish.I liked the book overall, but I didn't necessarily think it was a \"great\" work.","This review is a spoiler! Don't read on if you are intending to read it for the first time!I had heard many times that this was a classic that would haunt me for life. But I was not impressed, partially because there were things that were left unanswered. I may have missed something - what was the significance of the car on the bridge at the end? Modern man's constructions were all around him...the Golden Gate Bridge, for example. Why the car? Why did they want him to die there, instead of with their tribe? I thought it weird, too, and unlikely, that he saw so few bodies in the aftermath. I liked the hammer symbol a lot - and the fact that he passed it on to the young man he'd chosen - and why. I liked that his gift of leadership helped humanity live on. I also liked the way that he changed his desperate struggle from lecturing - to action...his building of the simple bow and arrows. I loved that he continued to describe the inevitable and looming corrosion of the modern world. That did make him the last American - his final months spent with his oldest friend. Those things saddened me a great deal.I have read another holocaust book that WILL haunt me for life...perhaps because it was on such a massive scale, and yet confined to only one remaining group of characters. The book is The Last Ship, by William Brinkley. I've read it 3 times, as has my oldest son.","This is an extraordinary novel, wider appreciation of which has probably been hampered by categorization as science fiction. While there are some slight anachronisms (the book appeared in 1949) the ideas, and the narrative, are disturbingly fresh. To me the most stunning - and frighteningly plausible - theme was how fragile &quot;civilization&quot; is, and how quickly everything could collapse even though the material and intellectual basis for &quot;civil society&quot; remained intact and available.","In short, I liked the first half of this book - the plot is intriguing and you don't want to put the book down! But after reading 2/3 of the story you expect something more to happen but the tempo goes down, the main character gets more introspective and the flow of the narration starts to falter. The book starts to get boring and you just want to get through to the end to see what the end will be like. With a better pace all the way through, I would rate this book higher.","Chris FitzgeraldEnglish 10Mrs. Cruces5-20-02Earth Abides Evaluative EssayThe novel Earth Abides, written by George Stewart, took place in San Francisco,California. This science fiction novel focuses on a plague that has spread across the NorthAmerican continent and is threatening the human species. The novel contains the life thatan individual survivor, Isherwood Philips (Ish), lives. A majority of the population hasseized to exist. Ish is an important part of the Plague because he is a biologist. Ish goesthrough his life in this novel by bringing other characters into his life. Ish is one of thesurvivors that has the intelligence to form a tribe and become the leader of this tribe. Ishhas a compassionate soul and struggles to help other survivors find their way.Earth Abides is a very interesting novel. This novel is easily enjoyable because ofits connection that it gives of the key characters who are intertwined in a drama that isdealing with a cataclysmic event of a Plague. This makes the novel a good read. Thiskind of event is very possible considering the times that we live in now. This novel doesnot only relate with people coming together to struggle for survival. It also deals with anevent that could very well take place.This novel is great for anyone over the age of about 12 years old, because of theway that this novel is set up to involve thinking and real life experience to understand thetrue meaning of the novel. Anybody who is looking for a good science fiction novel willlike the great novel Earth Abides.","I bought this book based on the overall good ratings.I speed read through most of it, hoping it would pick up. I can't stand the idea that these people weren't a little more intelligent and chose to preserve what they had and plan for the future without technology. They had a whole freakin' University Libary for pete's sake!Out of the whole book I got that Ish was the only inteliigent one but didn't have the teaching skills to subsequently teach the next generations.If you like post-apolcolytipic books, then I highly recommend \"One Second Later\" by Fortschen. The spelling may be off slighly....I don't have the book here. There is a line-up at work to read it. This book scared the hell out of me. And as a professional health care worker I could see the devastating domino effect happening like this book portrayed. Like the book \"One Second Later\" says, \"Its not IF, but WHEN.\"","If they did an audiotape of \"Earth Abides\", only Ben Stein would be up to the task of delivering the text into spoken words. The novel wastes no time getting into its subject matter. Within the opening pages, an unknown plague wipes out the vast majority of humanity, leaving the remnants to either rebuild civilization or bear witness to its final collapse. It sounds promising, but the delivery never comes.The story is narrated in the first person by \"Ish\", a young college student whose circumstances enable him to survive the disaster. Very early on, the reader gets the first inklings that this novel will serve as a sounding board for George Stewart's various preoccupations. The first hint is the dominant theme that nature has some innate sense of population control that strikes suddenly and absolutely on all levels, and this is explored not just in discovering what happened to humanity but also in a number of situations as the story advances.In fact, Ish seems to be merely a mouthpiece for a number of observations, ideas, and insights postulated by Stewart. For a work of fiction, \"Earth Abides\" reads more like an apocalyptic version of \"Future Shock\", the landmark Alvin Toffler sociological study. Unfortunately, it reads as dryly as \"Future Shock\" as well. All of Stewart's ideas are presented in a dry, impersonal manner, which precludes any emotional connection with the story itself and thus lessens the impact of these insights in the end. Recommended only for the most voracious of sci-fi readers.","\"Earth Abides\" is one of the best books I have ever read. Even though it was written in 1949, it seems to me like it could have been written yesterday. Very thought-provoking and memorable. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who desires a good read. I couldn't put it down. I finished it several days ago and it still stays in my mind. I bought this book for my Kindle, but I think I am going to order a hard copy too - it was that good.","Even at 60 years old this book still resonates as to the plight of man and his insignificance in the universe. Told as a simple story of survival of the species it gives the reader pause for thought about many issues. Well written without much superflous wording. Great detail on the impact of man and what his loss would mean to the planet.","Hello,The main character, Ish, manages to spend over 20 years mostly clutching his worry beads and freting. By the end of the book you just want to slap him and ask, \"What the hell is wrong with you\". His character is indecisive, and whiny. Over 20 years and the most productive thing he did was teach the kids how to make crappy bows and dig a well. If the characters in this book are supposed to be examples of the best way humanity could cope post SHTF we are probably all doomed. The only thing I can think of is that among the characters all had IQ's of 95 and Ish had an IQ of 100. This is more a human drama story (written in a most boring way) written around an apocalypse than it is anything else. If your interested in realistic post SHTF stories don't waist your time here. If your interested on how a small community could waste +20 years post SHTF in blissful denial with only one character recognizing the denial but doing nothing but hand-wringing about it than this is the book for you.","I found this book sitting on my mother's shelf, and after reading the description, couldn't wait to begin delving into it. The description of the book makes it seem like it's going to be very intriguing and exciting. It failed in that area. (And it's rare for me to dislike a book)In general, I really dislike the character. He shows no real or genuine emotion and is very full of himself. He is a geographer, but thinks of himself as a philospher. Which in his book, I guess that means spending a lot of time thinking about how unintelligent and hopeless everyone is. Including his wife and children. In fact, he had around five children, but you only learn about three of their names, and he spends his time only liking one of them. Since this book was written in the 40s, there are some racist and misogynistic undertones.The first two-thirds were mostly boring to me. He spends the majority of his time traveling across America and describing the scenery. When he's not doing that, he's judging people.Overall, I only like the last third of book, and that had nothing to do with the character. Instead, I enjoyed the process that could happen if civilization were lost, and the reforming of it.","I first read this book when I was 19 years old in 1974. At that time, most novels in this genre were post-nuclear where the United States and the Soviet Union were foolish enough to unleash their hellfire. This one takes a different approach. There are no mutants, no zombies, no cannibals. The end comes, as it has for so many human civilisations, from a disease that was not created in a lab but evolved from an earlier less virulent agent. Think avian influenza.It is based on the premise that any species that becomes so very numerous and lives in such dense number is vulnerable to a sweeping pandemic that kills many or almost all of the species. In this case, humans have skated by since the Black Death hit Europe and killed one third of the humans in Europe. A disease appears, but owing to the mobility of our species with rapid global transport, it manages to sweep the planet before anyone is really aware it is there.As with all pandemics, there are generally some individuals who survive either by peculiar circumstance, slight differences in genetics, or just pure luck. In Ish's case, it was more a combination of circumstance and luck. He has gone to a cabin to rest from the stresses of life and is not even aware at first that a new disease is abroad in the world. He just happens to be hiking and suffers a snake bite. The story suggests that he became ill with the disease at the same time and that venom and the disease basically worked against each other; thus, sparing his life. Once he recovers, he discovers a world empty of people. He takes a trip across the country from his starting point in California to New York City then down through the South and back to Los Angeles. This is where the first clear difference appears between this book and most all others. In this story, there are small numbers of survivors, but most are too shell-shocked and skittish to approach. So North America and presumably the rest of the planet is beginning to restore its natural balance, and the marks of humans are slowly being swallowed up.The second difference is that this story demonstrates what I think is the most realistic outcome for the survivors. Most do not have the skills to survive from nature and starve or die from injury, but some begin learning to survive. Ish is one who does. It follows him through the remainder of his life and the one or two generations that are borne from the small collection of survivors who collect around him. Unusual intelligence is not something that results from all matings. Mostly it is average intelligence sufficient to learn survival skills from the parents. Ish will make efforts to ensure some civilisation survives such as reading and writing, but even with that humans change. Domesticated animals survive in feral forms or die out. Predator and prey balance is gradually reestablished. Suburbs gradually revert to forest or grasslands. Natural fires become part of the norm, again.This book is an adventure but not in the same way of a story such as Alas Babylon or the movie 2012 (abominable science in that one). This is an adventure in that the world returns to a form that produced humans in the first place. This is a book for mind and heart more than the thrill. It has stood without becoming as dated as most of these books do. The words 'computer', 'radiation', and 'desperate' do not appear. I think more than anything, the survivors take a while to realise that their lives are not going to return to the way they were. I give this novel all the stars allowed and would give it more if I could.","I really enjoyed this book, George Stewart uses an interesting writing devise to describe time passing without you as the reader feeling as if he is grasping for ideas.Right from when people start dieing and the world changes the whole pace of life changes and this is captured really well and I feel is conveyed very effectively.I also loved the insights into what happens over time to various things that we are accosted to, cats, dogs, corn and cars. I know, I know I sound a little weird but it works !At only 337 pages this is not a taxing read, its definitely worth throwing at your younger readers in the home wanting something that is a little more challenging","I would like to say that in reading other reviews here that dislike this book, the people in this book remind me greatly of many people I have known. Yes, they didn't seem to try very hard to continue civilization, but then he explains that and ponders that at great length. Yes, the main characters were annoying and all too real. All the people that say, \"I would have done this!\" or \"they should have done that!\" are just getting what the author wanted you to do, think about it.They characters in the book, the few rag tag remnants of civilization, fail to even prepare for the inevitable illness that befalls them, typhoid. Just like all of humanity in 1949 failed to prepare for the pandemic that wipes them out. And just like we have still failed to prepare for the coming pandemic of today.This is a cautionary tale that is enjoyable to read. What I would say the the people who don't like it is, And what exactely have you done lately to prepare civilization for what the World Health Organization has recently stated is \"inevitiable\"?","&#8216;Earth Abides&#8217; by George R. Stewart comes with a considerable reputation. First Published in 1949, It was the first winner of the International Fantasy Award although it is clearly science fiction of the world catastrophe kind. That said the book isn&#8217;t extra-speculative in approach, it is set in much the same time as it was written, in an America of that late 1940s early 1950s. The main character, and narrator, of this disaster novel is Isherwood Williams a post grad geography student, Ish is one of the few survivors of a plague which has decimated the USA (and by inference the world). The book tells the tale of what happens to civilisation after the fall and describes Ish&#8217;s attempts to preserve some of it into the future. The story is told and progressed in a series of accounts, the exploration of the USA, the founding of a community, the growth of that community etc. It is written in a straight forward narrative style, with an occasional aside to speculate on the ecology, and traces the life of Ish from the time of the plague to his death. Through this journey Ish will face loneliness and find love, the small community he gathers about him will both flourish and suffer tragedy, and all along Ish chronicles things with his eye on history and ecology.For me, one of the main strengths of this book is that Ish is one of the most relatable protagonists of just about any book I&#8217;ve read. Ish is the sort of person who we&#8217;d like to think we would be in this situation. This is not to say Ish is perfect and he&#8217;s certainly no hero. He has a methodical and intellectual outlook to tackling situations, but he suffers as many failures as triumphs. This gives the book an emotional depth uncommon in a lot of SF and it is this humanity within the characters and their simple plight which drags you into the story. I think this is the book&#8217;s secret, it has the ring of truth. The characters send you through a gamut of emotions from nostalgia to anger, we care about them and are emotionally invested in there future.I don&#8217;t often read disaster novels and it took me some time to build up to read it, I wanted to read it because of its reputation but somehow I always seemed to find another book I needed to read first. Finally biting the bullet I found after only a few pages it had become compulsive and it ended much too soon. Whilst I have read some high enjoyable and great books both before and since, it is this book I find that sticks in my mind and the one that I contemplate upon. This book deserves all the praise it has received, and it has widely been proclaimed a masterwork. That it isn&#8217;t more widely known today is a shame. This book has probably become, even against my will, my favorite SF novel.","The premise of this novel is that mankind suddenly experiences a biological holocaust in the form of a new disease--a form of super-measles that wipes out all but a tiny remnant of mankind. The author explains that &quot;mankind had too long been rolling an endless succession of sevens&quot; and that like all animals that had multiplied out of turn, the sudden catastrophe was inevitable to set the balance back to what nature intended. This novel tells the story of a very small group of survivors, and suggests what life would be like under in the aftermath, and perhaps, more profoundly, what such a scenario might mean for mankind.The author's premise is that little or nothing of civilization would survive such an event. In the story **very minor spoiler** although the survivors make attempts at preserving the skills and lessons of civilization, this eventually becomes impossible against the tide of events sweeping mankind back not just to barbarism (in which some skills and beliefs might have survived) but to downright savagery and superstition. The most profound thought that the author successfully imparts is that all of the traditions, skills, and manifestations of our civilization could--and would--be lost in a single generation. Unforgettable is when one of the characters in the story looks out at the ruins of the San Francisco Bay Bridge (before it too passes away) and asks--&quot;who built this.&quot; The protagonist thinks for a second and answers: &quot;the Americans built it.&quot; The next question is &quot;who were the Americans?&quot; I have never forgotten this exchange, which I felt illustrated brilliantly how important it is for one generation to impart the best ideas of civilization to the next, and how easily all our achievements and successes might be lost in the face of a global catastrophe.The reader need not and probably will not agree with all of the author's conclusions about what would happen in this scenario. Would we really lose the skill of a written language? Would we really fall all the way back almost to the Old Stone Age? The author will challenge the reader's own thoughts on this subject, and that is fine. One need not agree with all of the conclusions that the novel contains to enjoy this story.Although written many years ago, upon re-reading this novel recently I found that it had lost little or none of its impact or relevance. It features a bit more prudishness than a modern novel might contain, but in my opinion is none the worse for this. The story is well-told, the prose is quite good, and the storyline moves along all the while capturing and retaining the reader's interest. This is a novel that I would recommend to everyone.","I could almost feel the age of this book when I read it. It is slow, the main character is an idiot (in my eyes), and he spends most of his time thinking about single-handedly saving (well, rebuilding) civilisation. Delusions of Grandeur. No critical thoughts about civilisation as realized in 1940/50 America, either: \"Modern civilisation is good. We need to rebuild it at once. End of argument.\"I took two things from this book - first, sheep are the most stupid animals on this planet. And second, people may come and go, but Earth Abides. The Author managed very well to show me that, by having his protagonist realize a few pages before the end that he isn't the center of the world. Wow. Finally. I was waiting for this for about 200 pages.This could have been done with a much shorter and faster-paced book. Still, the book poses some interesting questions, and it's vastly better than what you get today when being shown post-apocalypse worlds (I'm thinking along the lines of the Mad Max movies, or Waterworld, etc - the book never sells out this cheaply). So, all in all, Earth Abides earns it's place on my SF bookshelf. A serious book that tries to seriously investigate the end of civilisation as we know it, and guide us into the new world that rises out of it.","I could not put this book down. It challenged me, it entertained me, it made me cry.When I run across a copy, I buy it and give it to friends.","Perhaps because I've read several recently published books that deal with life after \"the end of the world as we know it,\" I found this book to be slow moving and even boring at times. However, I enjoyed moments of nostalgia when presented with phrases like \"tourist court\" and \"I pressed the starter button on the car.\" Brought back memories. Sadly, the world as we knew it then has already ended.","Anyone who has read Alas, Babylon or Lucifer's Hammer needs to read this also. The premise is a panepedimic wipes out almost the entire population of the earth. Earth abides, but Man is almost extint. The turning point comes when the main character realizes that civilization as he knew it is over. He then turns his energies into teaching the Tribe to be self sufficient.A very good read, very on point and topical for today's world.","This book was hard for me to read simply because the pain of the main character became my pain while I read. In the aftermath of the end of the world You experience fear, loneliness, pitty, love, hope and finally resolution through the narrator Ish's observations.This is no adventure novel but it is a hard hitting look at just how much we truly rely on the trappings of the industrialized world to get by and how naked we would be without them. Although the book ends on a bit of a hopeful note you can't help but mourn for all that's been lost as well as watching the rest of the world's knowledge die slowly over the generations.This book made me ask what if it were me? A mark of a good thought provoking book.","Earth Abides by George Stewart is an incredible book. It follows the main character, Ish, as he tries to make sense of a world where humans are nearly wiped out by disease. What makes this book special, is that it's protagonist is a deliberate, thoughtful man that brings the story a sense of realism that is rarely seen in this kind of fiction. It is very interesting to see how and if civilization can survive such a \"Great Disaster\". The story benefits by being completely plausible, and even though the book was written over 50 years ago, it is still fascinating today. I highly recommend this reading.","A grossly interesting book, perhaps the actual first, to explore the thought of \"what to do to survive in post-apocalyptic America with little skills and a hammer\" - all avenues are skillfully probed and prosed.The first quarter of the book captivated my imagination with the wandering, scavaging and, ultimately, surviving. The middle half was deeply interesting to see how one man could restructure his life so that Americans could live after the plague. The last quarter was filled with expectation and anxiety, seeing how the family has turned out and whether or not the new Americans will prosper as they had before.","At the beginning of Earth Abides, Isherwood Williams, a graduate student alone in the wilderness and working on his thesis, is bitten by a poisonous snake. For several days, he drifts in and out of consciousness. When he is at last able to drag himself to civilization, he finds that a virus not unlike the common flu has mutated into a deadly strain, and the world is suddenly devoid of people. The rest of the book follows Isherwood as he discovers the strange freedom of the empty world, struggles to find other survivors, and works to rebuild civilization.Earth Abides is a sweeping saga, stretching across decades and roaming across North America. Most of the story takes place from inside the head of its protagonist, at a range so close that it takes us several pages to learn his name, as he simply does not think of his name that often. Stewart infuses the story with concrete details and scientific observations, giving it a strong sense of authenticity. Caught up in and believing the action, we are completely absorbed in the efforts of Isherwood Williams to survive and thrive in this strange new world.One trap lurking for any story, but particularly a science fiction story like this, is that of becoming quickly dated. Things change daily, and what is fascinating and new today will soon be old fashioned. Stewart has given his story a certain timelessness, at least so far, and I think he achieves this effect by incorporating very little medium-range technology. By this I mean that things are either seen close up, as in hands working with tools that change slowly, such as hammers, or are seen at a distance, such as the lights of San Francisco. In the middle distance, very little attention is paid to devices that evolve quickly, such as televisions, radios, and automobiles (other than the venerable Jeep). The result is that Earth Abides does not suffer from a feeling of being out of date, and it could easily be imagined to be a present-day story.One interesting feature to me as a writer was the use of interstitial chapters called Quick Years between each of the three major sections. These bridge the time gaps between the primary sections of the book, recalling the primary events in the passing years through Isherwood's eyes. This device lets the author tell a sweeping story while keeping the bulk of the detail in the activity at the turning points. On first glance, this sudden shift in gears seems likely to distance the reader, but Stewart handles the narrative so deftly that the reader finds the story as engaging viewed at this speed as when it is slowed down.Ultimately, Earth Abides is a masterful work. The author gives us enough detail and character to connect deeply with the story, then stays out of the way, allowing the story to unfold with its own power. The result is a riveting and deeply moving tale about all of us, how strong and resilient we are, but also about how fragile we are, how tenuous our grip on the world is, and how little it needs us.Do not miss this story. But do not, however, try to finish it without a generous supply of tissues. You will need them.","I heard about \"Earth Abides\" from someone reviewing \"The Stand\". In their review, they indicated \"The Stand\" was a one for one rip off of \"Earth Abides\". I decided to investigate this accusation and started reading an old edition of George Stewart's book. This book investigates what could potentially happen to human civilization if most people died from a highly contagious disease. The decay of civilization is seen through the eyes of the main character, Isherwood Williams.First, what was my impression of the book? I enjoy reading sci-fi and have read my share of \"end of the world\" books including \"Alas Babylon\", \"The Stand\", \"War Day\", \"The White Plague\", and most recently \"The Road\". I did not enjoy the writing style of this author. It was not fluid and was archaic. However, the subject matter was interesting as was the thought the author put into the story. Ultimately, the author kept my attention.How does this book compare to \"The Stand\"? They are two entirely different books. \"The Stand\" is more realistic in depicting the immediate aftermath of a plague. However afterwards, it becomes more of a \"good versus evil\" tale whereas \"Earth Abides\" seriously contemplates the state of civilization years after the plague. All in all, both books are worthy reads.\"Earth Abides\" is at times is an awkward read. However, the story is interesting and well thought out. All in all, I recommend the book.","I swear it seems that all the reviewers of this book seem desperate to convince people that they've been able to read for a really long time.\"I first read this book back in Vietnam...\"\"I first read this book about thirty years ago...\"\"When I first read this book, I was only twelve years old, and...\"Great, we get it, you're old, and you can read.Ahhh... Anyway, despite my grumbling, I do agree with the essential point that these reviewers made--that this is a book that pulls you in, that surrounds you with a \"world entire,\" that creates a place that you inhabit completely from page 1 to page 317 (in the edition I have, anyway), that creates a world that you'll find hard to forget.The book, \"Earth Abides,\" tells the story of a man who emerges from a long period of solitude to discover that more than 99% of the planet's humans have been killed by a powerful virus, the man himself having likely survived only because of having been bitten by a snake around the same time.The book's descriptions of the abandoned world are awesome, enlivening and atmospheric, and for some of us no doubt a secret dream come true. It gets even cooler whent the man decides to take a road trip across the newly desolate America--from California to New York City. That's the book's first section, and was probably my favorite part of the book, but the book remains interesting and engaging throughout. The man meets a woman, they have children, they meet others, they form a community, and then--this seemed a bit hard for me to swallow--they basically let all of civilization go, and three generations later they're basically a tribe of primitives who are happy and functional, but who can't read, can't use any of the technologies created by mankind, and believe the sun revolves around the Earth. Yeah, that happened kind of quick....Set your disbelief aside though, and read this. It's well-written, nicely paced, and enjoyable, and the depictions of the man when he's really old seem totally accurate in their depiction of the sort of fuzzy and uncertain warmth of old age, though I'd need to have this book's other reviewers confirm that to be absolutely sure.One of my only complaints about the book would be the 1940s mentality that saturates the main character's logic: at one point he says in a sort of wistful tone that maybe one day they might be able to care about such things as race again, he contemplates making himself king of two frightened black people that he meets, and he laments that the his community's lack of law has made it impossible for them to require that an insane girl be \"put out of her misery.\" At first these comments were kind of amusing in a kitschy way, but then they really started piling up, and didn't make his character more endearing to me.Overall though, this was a great book, and like almost everyone else who's read it, I'm sure I'll be thinking about it for years.","This novel did more than entertain, it made me think. Everything that we hold of value weakens when weighted against what is essential in continuing our existence after such a catastrophe. The main character \"Isherwood\" had such a difficult time with the notion of the \"Old\" world being forgotten. What impressed me was that their continued existence was not dependant on the \"Old\" structure of things. If all the demands of our everyday life are absent what is left?I am pleased to have read this book. I'll be honest I was reticent about reading a sci-fi from 1947. This was well worth it.","This is a great read, but before you spend the $50 for this paperback, go check your local used book stores and thrift stores like Goodwill, I got my copy of the 1962 version for 69 cents and it is in great shape at a Goodwill store.","Several reviews have noted what they call the essential pessimism of the book: Man Has Fallen, Civilization Is No More, etc. Well, yes, that is all there. But what is also there is a profound triumph of the human spirit: Civilization is Dead - Long Live Civilization. I will NOT spoil the ending, but book ends with a rebirth - an obvious societal pregnancy if you will - of a new civilization, one profoundly in keeping with the new conditions of their brave renewed world.One can imagine a sequel, and I wish Stewart ahd written one!I first read this book almost 50 years ago, and have re-read it multiple times. It is one of the best \"transition\" books ever written. I recommend it on several levels.","I have been searching for this book for the past 35 years. It was a story I have never forgotten since reading it in my teens. I applaude the publisher who has reissued it. Can't wait to read it again and share it with my friends.","Misinterpretations abide, it seems, when it comes to this book. This &quot;disaster&quot; novel merely uses the disease plague scenario as a backdrop to explore human nature. There are many subtle examples here of how individuals develop as adults, how everything people know and believe is dependent on their own life experience and frame of reference. Most of all this is about the myriad of seemingly small things that people take for granted every day and do not even notice, seemingly unimportant things which are really the foundation of society and culture. Here the characters are stripped of all their artificial interests, and are left with only that foundation. The genius of this story is that it will leave you wondering just how independent your own thoughts and views are. There might be many reasons people go in the various directions they go in life, the least of which have to do with independent choices. This book is much more than a disaster novel, it is a fascinating look at sociology in action. And always in the background, amidst all the human trials and tribulations, Earth and non-human life continue as they always have, oblivious to human superiority. Hence the title, and the ultimate humbling message.","One of the better disaster novels to come out in this century, Stewart essentially takes the Robinson Crusoe point of view and applies it to (then) contemporary America, having a plague wipe out most people, even though the rationale that it's because people are too numerous is a little on the shaky side, he should have just taken the Solaris route and said he didn't know. Would have made things more interesting. However, in itself the novel is an excellent and very realistic portrayal of people struggling to live after everyone else is gone. Nobody has any real need for ambition since everything they could ever want is right there. The main character is the only one who can think ahead far enough to see that the children have to be taught so that civilization can come back but when the book ends it's unclear if that will ever happen. The point I think is to show that we're not better than the animals when it comes to civilization and that our intelligence doesn't necessarily make us better, an old point, to say the least but one that should be stated often. Evolutionarily the human race just got lucky and as quick as we rose (a million years isn't that long really when you figure the age of the planet) we can fall just as fast. And the thing that makes Earth Abides so more real is that civilization isn't restarted, to have that happen would seem unreal, a small group of people does not a civilization make and to have them turn into some sort of super-community to go across the US and return society to what it was before would just seem unrealistic and that would have ruined the point of the book. The way it's written now is much more interesting because even though it's so depressing, it feels that much more likely and thus in the end is more satisfying.","I don't think that any of the reviewers have mentioned this, but I think that there are important details in understanding the book. George R Stewart was an English professor (at UC Berkeley), but he has a real strong feeling for the land, landscape, weather and nature. He wrote about storms, the Donner Party, and other geographical subjects, especially relevant to California.The story is set in the East Bay, and has many identifiable locations and views .that add a certain warmth and familiarity to the story, even after six decades. The tribe lived in easily identifiable Oakland/Berkeley hills of the late 1949's.Ish is initially bitten by a rattlesnake in the Sierra, which would have been familiar to many in Berkeley (then and now)-the mountains, not the rattlesnake. He has respectful and loving depictions of the UC Berkeley Library, which Ish needs to break into- Stewart would have used the library regularly. He described the natural changes in animals and plants that would be expected in the hills. He describes a fire which occurs across the Bay, in San Francisco and the northern Peninsula. Finally, the last scene has the tribe walking across the Bay Bridge. That is the same bridge that exists today (although it will be replaced in a few years).BUT the most important thing is his name. Ish (\"Isherwood\") really stands for Ishi., the famous Indian survivor studied by Kroeber at Berkeley in the early 1900's. That is a well-known piece of Berkeley lore, and Stewart was certainly familiar with it. ... Ish, the last survivor of a dead tribe....","A virus wipes out most of humanity within a couple of days. I've read many scifi novels that begin this way, and most of them spend the majority of the subsequent pages describing the ensuing social chaos in dystopian detail. Earth Abides takes a completely different tack. There is no swaggering little Napoleon lording it over a tiny flock of survivors--there are simply too few people left. There is very little deprivation--people can comfortably survive for years on the leftover canned goods in every corner store. Indeed, there is very little drama of any kind.This is more of a character study of two entities. One is the protagonist, Ish, an anthropologist by training who sees his role primarily as that of an observer of the slow, inevitable decay of civilization. He makes half-hearted attempts to save vestiges of knowledge but is mostly content to watch what happens to the environment around him. The question of what would happen to the planet itself--along with all the plants and animals--without its human caretakers, is the true core of this novel. I heard Octavia Butler recommend this book as one that inspired her, and now that I have read it, I can see why. Thoughtful and surprisingly gentle, it highlights the gifts possessed even by apparently unremarkable people to make a life out of what they are given, supported always by the ultimate Mother: Earth.","Being a fan of apocalyptic SF (among other things), I ordered this after seeing it on several peoples's lists of the greatest end-of-the-world/post-apocalyptic novels. It tells the story, of Ish Williams, who is one of a handful of survivors of a sudden plague that kills off something like 99.99% of the world's primate poulation. Earth Abides describes, in linear chronological fashion, the subsequent 50 years or so, following Ish who becomes the leader of a small band of survivoirs and eventually the shaman-like last survivior of the pre-plague people.The book was written in 1949 and feels very dated, in terms of dialog, ideas and socio-political themes. There are distinctly (although thinly veneered) anti-technology, elitist and generic christian motifs running rather crudely throughout, all of which turned me off. In a couple of places, the author's science is arguable or just plain wrong, and some of his plot devices (cars that still work after sitting on a lot for decades) feel contrived. All this aside, the writing itself just isn't that good.The main character, Ish is a neurotic misanthrope. No genius himself, Ish is nonetheless an incredible intellectual snob, judging everyone around him including his loving wife, to be of lower intelligence than he. A young (already lonely and alone) graduate student at the beginning of the novel, this remarkably unlikeable character goes on to comment negatively about the intellectual capacities of everyone who comes along in his life, except for one grandson that he deems worthy to become his successor.There is very little action, and many descriptive passages about changes in the earth and its flora and fauna following the disaster. The latter are fairly interesting, but not as interesting or well-researched as more recent works (e.g., After Man: A Zoology of the Future). The novel is unfortunately, not particularly well written. I guess, being written in 1949, one has to award points for originality, but compared to dozens of novels and a number of non-fiction works published since then concerned with the fate of the earth after man is gone, there is not much here that warrants this novel's amazing longevity.I understand how this novel could have been very popular when it was published. I am, however, at a loss to explain this novel's huge popularity and staying power today. That it remains in print 61 years after first publication is astounding to me, as are all the 5-star reviews. Virtually all of the ideas and themes visited have been done better by others who are much better, and more interesting writers. One particularly acute contrast is with James Van Pelt's \"Summer of the Apocalypse\", that I read immediately after \"Earth Abides\". It is far superior in every respect, although a superficial description of each makes them sound very similar. Nevertheless, they could not be more different.I was very disappointed by this \"classic\" and would not recommend it on any level.JM Tepper","A plague wipes out most of humanity, and one man (Isherwood Williams) tries desperately to save a piece of civilization to pass on to the generations of survivors. The first part of the story deals with his survival of the plague, and his journey around the country looking for signs of survivors.He returns to his home (in the Bay area of California) where he finally meets a woman (Emma) whose courage convinces him to start a family, which becomes a 'tribe' as a few other survivors come to join them. He tries to pass on as much knowledge as he can to the children of the tribe, but his efforts are largely in vain as civilization continues to regress. Ultimately he realizes a way to pass on some very basic knowledge to help his descendants in the future.The author does an excellent job of dealing with the plague, the after effects of such a plague on nature, as well as the slow decay of the cities and infrastructure of our civilization. He also describes well drop into a primitive society that would result from the plague. There is also an interesting moral dilemma when the tribe has to deal with a potential threatening outsider who tries to join them.The flaws of this story are few. There are a few sections which clearly take place at roughly the time when the story was published (1949). As a result, some of the references to technology and personalities make those sections of the story feel a bit dated. This only happens a few times though, and doesn't really hurt the story.This book won the first science fiction award given when it won the International Fantasy Award in 1951. In 1987, it rated 28th on the Locus All-Time Poll of All-Time SF Novels, and in 1998 it tied for 41st on the Locus poll of SF Novels written before 1990.","I read Earth Abides and was stunned with what a great book it was. Its attention to detail was unparalleled, its character development was exceptional, and its plot never got dull. Every part of the book was breath-taking, from the opening sentence to the closing words.Stewart wrote Earth Abides in third person and includes italicized background information which helps the book play before the reader much like a movie. Stewart doesn't just tell the reader the story; it is like they can see it for themselves. The reader is left to ponder many comments made by characters, and is allowed to reach conclusions for themselves. The thought provoking way in which Earth Abides is written was my favorite attribute of the book.Some books can be read and enjoyed, but do not really leave a mark on the reader. This one reshaped the way that I view the world. I have read hundreds of books, and consider this perhaps the best I have ever read. In one word, it was &quot;awesome.&quot;","Do you know the joyous feeling you get when you just happen upon a book quite by accident, read just a few chapters of it, and realize that it will be of great signifiance to you? Well, that was my experience with this book! I can't believe that I was not introduced to this book before now. It is with some sadness that I just completed reading it.My degree of connection with the main character, Isherwood Williams (Ish), astounded me; therefore, I must admit that my reaction to this book is quite subjective. It as is though the author looked into my mind and wrote a book about me in a post-apocalyptic world, including my greatest virtues and worst vices. The descriptions of the thoughts, triumphs, failings, joys, and frustrations experienced by the main character are poignantly honest and real. Metaphorically, this story seems to describe, with regard to many things, my existence in this, our so-far non-apocalyptic, world. For example, I find that I constantly struggle to define what I think to be the appropriate balance of individuality and community/state in our world. If you are one who consciously ponders such things or pursues a study of philosophy, I believe that you will view this book as a masterpiece. It just made my top 10, that is sure.I feel that I have gained much in my reading of this book. Mostly, I come away from this reading experience with a renewed feeling of peace and a reassurance in myself and the human spirit. I will no longer, I think, become quite so frustrated with regard to certain things or people in this world.&quot;Am I happy? Yes, I am happy. Things are as they are, and I am part of them.&quot; - Jack, great grandson of Isherwood Williams (Ish), the Last American.","That about sums it up for me. All others on this theme (with the honourable exception of John Wyndham's \"The Day of the Triffids\") are just cheap imitations. Earth Abides is the real thingCivilisation, and some 99.99% of the human race, is gone. The few survivors, all traumatised by what has happened to them (some more obviously than others, but they all are) either just commit suicide, drink themselves to death, live out their lonely lives in some familiar spot, or, as with Ish and his companions, get together into little \"tribes\".Having already read a few reviews, I get the impression that there are few neutrals on this one. You either love it (the majority, including me) or hate it. For me, Earth Abides' big virtue is precisely what some people seem to dislike about it. Its characters are just dead ordinary. Even Ish, the nearest thing to a brain among them, is too passive and contemplative to be more than a titular head. There are no survivalists who have long been waiting for the day; no jacks of all trades, conveniently endowed with all the needed skills, and above all no \"natural leaders\" (aka bullies and control freaks) out to remake the world in their own image. (Perhaps Charlie had some ambitions that way, but fortunately he is bumped off before the question can arise). They are in fact just a bunch of very average or even below-average people, trying to make a life for themselves amidst the ruins of the world. That, I suspect, is pretty much how such an aftermath would really be.Indeed, on considering the matter, I feel Stewart did a really good job of making his characters internally consistent. They are, essentially, the ones who come through the end of the world - and just react with a shrug. \"The human race is almost entirely wiped out, civilisation's gone and we're all back in the Dark Ages. Now what do I do about breakfast?\" Well, to be fair, Ish does throw up in the sink when it finally \"sinks\" in that his parents won't ever be coming home, but that's where it ends. If he ever considers the matter again, we aren't told about it. The other characters take a largely similar attitude. Em apparently had a family pre-Disaster, but never talks about them, while Ezra and the others have even less to say. They just write off their losses and \"move on\".Well, fair enough. That is probably exactly how they need to be in the situation. This attitude is probably what allows them to come through without being driven into insanity and/or suicide. But of course it has consequences. First off, it implies a decided lack of empathy toward fellow beings. Unlike some reviewers, I'm not particularly disturbed at their willingness to hang Charlie, and to at least consider \"mercy killing\" of the retarded Evie. Given such personalities, this is exactly how they would be. Indeed, it says much for their basic decency that they agonise as much as they do over the first decision, and never take the second one at all. Stewart has made his characters act \"in character\", as an author should.Secondly, however helpful this attitude was in seeing them through the immediate aftermath, it is far less so when it's time to think of rebuilding. Having taken the Disaster itself almost in their stride, they are likewise accepting of its aftermath, and generally take only such action as is forced on them by circumstances. The \"Lewis and Clark\" expedition in Year 22 is distinctly exceptional. And Ish's basically solitary disposition stultifies his attempt to educate the children. The only one he can \"reach\" is an academic loner exactly like himself, after whose death he essentially gives up. Stewart has wonderfully portrayed how the virtues which were such a help at the start of the book have now turned into vices.Loooking back on it (I first read the book at age ten) I have some minor gripes. In particular, the Great Disaster itself seems more than a little \"sanitised\", with mankind dying and all the bodies neatly tidied away, during Ish's two-week absence. Somehow, that does not quite carry conviction. Apart from that, however, my only real complaint is that Stewart was content with a single book, when the theme deserved a trilogy at least.Read and enjoy","First of all, I think D.D. Shade's analysis of today's society on Earth Abides is unsubstantiated. This book is still a great book today because it is a classic. A classic, by definition, relates to all time. The assination of JFK or MLK would not have had any greater impact on this book. This book, like Ish, will continue to stand the test of time because of it's overall classical themes. That man is the complicating variable on the planet earth. Regardless of if a man or men die, the earth abides.","I read this book in High School in the 70's in Saratoga Ca. I have a teenage daughter and I can't fathom that she is not required to read these types of books anymore. My mind constantly wandered with Ish. I dreamt of what I would do in that situation, of how I would react. Needless to say I finished the book in one weekend well ahead of my classmates, and decided to just start it all over. I recomended the book to my Mom, and she also fell in love with it. Ever since we are both on the lookout for others like it. I have read most of them (The stand, postman, alas babylon, on the beach, SWAN SONG (the best), plus mony other forgetable tales), and thank Earth Abides for my passion for these books. I wish someone would write another that is as good as this.","I have only read 2 books more than once - &quot;Earth Abides&quot; by George R Stewart, and &quot;The Quest of Aah&quot; by Alexan Farelane. If you read one book a week for 70 years, you would only have read 3,640 books in your lifetime. There are millions of books you will never be able to read - even with the Reader's Digest versions! Life is way too short to read the same book twice - except for books which can change your life. These 2 books are &quot;Life Changing&quot; books. The thing which most appeals to me with &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that our hero is just an ordinary guy and his failures are at least as impressive as his successes. He starts off with the best of intentions, becomes an unwilling leader by default, and is unable to persuade the other survivors of the need to maintain and/or restore the facilities and civilization we have come to take for granted. I KNOW that this is exactly how it would happen for me, if I was in his place! I know what I'd want to have happen, but circumstances would prevent me from being able to make it all happen.&quot;The Quest of Aah&quot; is a fantasy about the seven levels, the seven valleys, higher planes of existence, stages on the journey from Earth to Heaven, some of which any spiritual person can relate to, and anyone on a secular plane can be entertained by. The novel is presented as a memory, and is the way we hope it will be when we reach the end of our lives. It is completely different from &quot;Earth Abides&quot;, but if you like speculative fiction, then it is worth a read (or TWO!)","This is a story of the first years and the ensuing decades in the lives of the very few survivors of a natural plague. At first, there is a detailed overview of one survivor's (the main character and often narrator per se) actions in the first several months after the plague. This account of the &quot;short-term&quot; impact of a plague has been seen in other SF stories and might seem repetitous. But where this story is different, and where this novel is in a class of its own, is where the plot goes when this survivor meets others and small families begin and a community develops. The challenges which are faced by and met with by this group are detailed, yet are those involving environment and illness which are perhaps expected. But more interesting is what new moral values that arise and what &quot;holdover&quot; values (school, religion) which are attempted to be maintained, but are not or can't be embraced by the new generations which follow. The book follows the community though several decades, jumping years and stopping to go into detail about an event or time period -- but giving several pages in between as a summary to provide a good junction between sections...thus keeping the story flowing. The book ends with the natural death of the main character and seeing that the new generations have embraced a &quot;new and different&quot; value, knowledge, and societal system which is suprisingly similar to another culture -- and perhaps quietly challenging the reader to ask whether or not such the result is good or bad; and, whether or not the result was destiny, or the result of proper or improper actions of the original group of survivors. For a book written in the late 1940's, it was very, very far ahead of it's time.","After reading Earth Abides in 1968 as a 10th grader, I have read it six more times, getting a new insight of the book each time. My son (11yrs of age) has now read it twice with the same enjoyment as I have. It is a book that makes the mind think, wonder and dream the &quot; WHAT IF&quot; and &quot;COULD IT REALLY HAPPEN&quot; questions. Read it, sit back and think it. After the hair on the back of your neck sits down. Then read again next year.","I first read this book when I was 14, having borrowed it from the school library. I read it twice more in the following year. It affected me deeply and since then it has quite often crossed my mind to find the book again and re-read it. How surprised and happy I am after idly checking this website to see if that title would come up! I plan on ordering the book so I may savour every word of it all over again!","When my teacher first informed our class that we were going to read a science fiction book, my heart sank; I hated science fiction books! However, when I started to read Earth Abides, I found myself becoming engrossed in this book. The plot and the characters were something new and fresh to me in this age of quick storytelling. This was actually the first book I didn't skip to the end to read the final chapter because I was bored. It held my attention the whole time, and I was disappointed when it ended. This book reminds me of the movie &quot;Deep Impact&quot; because of the armageddon plots. I hope this is turned into a movie because it will probably be just as good as the book!","Of the novels written on this subject, I think I have read them all, this is by far the best. Most interesting is the authors attempt to regenerate civilization. Methodically covers natures reaction to the demise of man, fascinating! &quot;The Stand&quot;, &quot;Alas Babylon&quot;, &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; are all outstanding; &quot;Earth Abides&quot; stands alone!!!","I have read this book at least 6 times over the years. It ranks in my judgement with Jules Verne's, &quot;Mysterious Island&quot;, and Johann Wyss', &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot;. I have also read these books at least 7 times as well. I feel the three books could be invaluable in a survival library. They all teach survival in different circumstances!","Typical? maybe today, an age where every scenerio of doom has been played over and over again like some bad rock song. Fear not! This book is good. It was fresh once. . .now it reminds us of what fiction use to be written like. Like a good Doyle or Burroughs. I liked it.","Earth Abides was written by George Stewart and released in 1949. The story follows the main character Ish, short for Isherwood, as he is one of the few people to survive a pandemic that kills the majority of the human population. Ish has an interesting perspective on the incident as he has an academic background and tends to view events through in a very historical, geographical way. Ecology and population dynamics are frequently discussed throughout the story. Stewart explores population fluctuations in nature in comparison to the die off of humans. Much of the story takes place in California, near San Francisco and follows Ish through most of his life following the outbreak. On a practical level, this book contains more generalized preparation information such as the durability of canned food, hunting and gathering methods and the continuation of life without public water and electricity. While Earth Abides is certainly entertaining, it also provides a very unique perspective on the end of civilization and it will leave you with some very interesting ideas for your consideration.","I read Earth Abides months ago, and I still find myself thinking about it often. Some of the reviews I read before I read the book mentioned the book remaining with the reader for years and years; I didn't expect that to be the case for me, but now I think it will. We take so much for granted, both things and people, but what would we do if life as we know it basically vanished? How would we manage alone? What abilities would we need which we don't have now? So much to think about!","This book is not so much about the end of the world itself; instead, it uses the end of the world - the end of most of mankind, anyway - as a plot device to explore how a new, small, totally contained society would develop out of the leavings of the old one. This task it accomplishes quite well; the growth of the Tribe in San Francisco and their mythological beliefs, traditions, and practices is fascinating, if a little slow-moving in several parts. But because societal development is the primary concern of the novel, the little details are simply glossed over, and there are so many technical errors or things left unexplained that it had a tendency to lift me out of the story and re-engage my disbelief. For instance, most of mankind is wiped out by a mysterious, very viral disease, but it's never explained what the disease is, where it came from, or why some people are immune. In fact, the main character of the book comes down out of the hills after it's all over, having no idea what was going on the \"civilized\" world, but he shows a total lack of curiosity about what happened to everybody that I found unbelievable. And when several survivors get together, they never discuss where they were or what happened to them when the Great Disaster (as it's called in the book) went down, which I think goes totally against human nature. And the survivors continue to live off the leavings for forty or more years afterward, eating canned food that must have long since gone bad and even smoking cigarettes that had to have been unsmokeable after at least a year. They never bother to start even a rudimentary garden - an idea which I think would have occurred to just about anybody - but somehow manage to live in nearly perfect health until old age without eating any fresh fruits or vegetables. Again, I understand that these details weren't important to the author, but they were important to me, and so these little problems served to disrupt what was otherwise a well-written, intriguing take on the old end-of-the-world plot.","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it.

The internal debate and conflict and the final resolution are wonderful. The characters are personable and easy to relate to. More importantly, in the time of the H1N1 virus and other diseases, a harsh and jolting wake-up call to humanity and civilization. Worth every cent.","This book is amazing in that it was written so long ago (1949). I have had dreams for as long as I can remember that resemble this story, but I only read it this year. It's a quick read but one must pay attention to keep up. Some things that were not accomplished by the people are disappointing, but since technology has changed the way we live in the last 60 years so greatly, who's to say what he would rewrite today. Overall I really liked it. I started reading this at a friend's house and just had to buy to reread again.","One of the best realistic future novels I have read, I enjoyed reading it many years ago,and reading it again was just as enjoyable, couldn't put it down, its not the usual science fiction story, but a realistic account of how ordinary people would react in these conditions, I highly recommend it I.M.J.","read it in Jr. High and it is still just as great today at age 67.","I first read this book back in 1967. At that time I was a kid and the whole story seemed to be nothing but \"science fiction.\" I read about the way Ish went through his life, with a disbelief that it could ever happen here and now.However, today I look at the possibility that civilization could be shattered by the loss of what we have come to consider the essential necessities of life - electricity, water, gas, gasoline, telephone, computers, drug stores and grocery stores. Now when I read Earth Abides, I realize that this story could actually happen to us. The problems that Ish had to deal with are now possible. As I read this story, I found myself wondering how I would handle dwindling supplies, the threats of animals and disease, the decreasing availability of items that spoil or evaporate, the social interaction with people, both good and bad. I wondered how I would deal with the lack of food, water, and medicine? Would I be able to survive in a deserted city with no electricity? With terrorists threatening to destroy our way of life, this book could be a survival guide for the modern man.I especially found the greatest distress in this book was the way knowledge was lost. First Ish wanted to read and then it became less important and then the books fell apart. Ish became an antique with knowledge of things that meant nothing to the younger generation that was growing up around him. This book should be used to teach us all a lesson - that we must keep the flame of knowledge burning all the time or we could lose it so very fast.","This 1949 novel is one of the earliest explorations of the theme of a doomsday plague. Our hero, named Ish, is a young college student who returns from the mountains to find out that an airborne virus has wiped out over 99.99 percent of the population in remarkably tidy fashion, leaving behind only a handful of survivors.It is hard to rate a book like this. On the one hand, it is well written, and, despite a few implausible suppositions, manages to explores a number of interesting ideas and insights.But there is a big problem: Our hero, Ish, is completely wicked -- an amoral, self-worshiping, arrogant, elitist monster; and the author seems to be on his side. I understand that books of this type tend to be misanthropic fantasies, and even understand the appeal. But I cannot stomach Ish.Ish is not particularly upset by the tragedy, since he never had much use for his fellow man. Still, his first reaction is to contemplate suicide. He can think of no reason to live. How this differs from his outlook before the tragedy is unclear, but he apparently bemoans the loss of superior human specimens who are mirror images of himself -- detached, scientific, rational, and essentially amoral. He ultimately rejects suicide, only because he decides it might be scientifically interesting to observe the continuing downfall of humanity. That he might try HELPING his fellow survivors never occurs to him.It immediately occurs to him that there must be other survivors, but just as quickly concludes that the shock of the tragedy will soon destroy most of them as well, because of their difficulty adapting. He calls this theory \"secondary kill\". On his first day of searching, he finds no less than 5 survivors, but immediately writes them off as not worth saving, according to his quasi-darwinian \"secondary kill\" theory. He then drives entirely from the west coast to the east coast and back, without ever finding a single human being who he thinks deserves life. No matter how many survivors he finds, he persists in regarding himself as the last surviving human. Only Ish counts. (Again, how this differs from his outlook before the tragedy is unclear).He then returns to his California home and sits around eating out of cans and reading books. While reading the New Testament, he ponders the fact that Judeo-Christian morals are obsolete, since he has no neighbors to love. My jaw dropped. What about all those traumatized survivors he abandoned to die according to his detached and rational \"secondary kill\" theory?But then he starts reading the Song of Solomon, and realizes he wants a woman. Almost immediately, a beautiful woman, a fellow elitist, drops out of the blue and into his bed. Soon a handful of survivors, who Ish persists on regarding as inferior beings, gather around them and form a sort of a tribe. This is one of the more implausible aspects of the novel. Ish a leader? He may have all of Hitler's faults, but he has none of his virtues.Happily for Ish, all of the other characters (except for one man whom Ish murders) have personalities even less forceful than his own. He arranges to marry off all the tribe's children, including his own daughters, at the far-too-young and not-entirely-willing age of 13, without a peep of protest from his own wife or anyone else. (Incidentally, this is a terrible scheme if you want to preserve a high level of culture, which Ish claims is his goal). Nor does anyone protest his scheme to murder a newcomer for the crime of having a venereal disease. The only person he has any regard for is one of his many sons, who he thinks of as a mirror image of himself. But then tragedy strikes, dashing Ish's hopes for the preservation of Ish-manity.Very early on, Ish remarks, almost out of the blue, that he does not want to become a god. This is such a strange thought that I think he doth protest too much. In any event, it is virtually all he achieves. For instance, his efforts as schoolmaster, though failing to teach, succeed in instilling superstitious reverence for himself in his pupils.","Unlike all contagious diseases before this one that traveled over time, this contagion sprung up globally at about the same time. For practical purposes the human race is extinct. Isherwood \"Ish\" Williams survives the pandemic, but wonders if he is the last man on earth.In what was once called California, Ish eventually meets up with a small rag tag band of shocked survivors. As his cohorts just try to live, they turn to Ish, more an introspective loner, as the leader. Reluctantly he takes charge not knowing what the future will bring or even if there is even going to be a future.This is a reprint of a highly regarded post apocalypse tale first released in 1949. The story is actually told over a period of years broken into five major parts of which the above only briefly touches on the first two sections. Ish is a terrific protagonist whose belief in survival changes over time as he observes his little colony mature. Thriller fans will enjoy this strong after the doomsday tale that in some ways shows its pre-information age initial publication, but remains a strong cautionary story.Harriet Klausner","This review will be short and simple as there are tons of detailed reviews already available.Earth Abides is great. It turns over and over in your head for days, weeks, months, & years.. just as a great book should. Not only does it provide a glimpse into the possible future, it also shows what it was like back in mid-1900s America. Definitely a thinker's book. I'd recommend it to anyone, ESPECIALLY if you like post-apocalyptic/last man on earth type tales.","Many of the previous reviewers state that they originally read this book a long time ago, and how it stuck with them over the years. For me, the pleasure of reading Earth Abides is a very recent event, but I do know that like those other reviewers, this will be a book that will stay with me for a long time.Originally published in 1949, Earth Abides still reads fresh. It describes the life journey of the graduate student \"Ish,\" a more intelligent that average, bookish, slightly passive young man who is one of the few human survivors of a catastrophic virus outbreak. Early on, he travels from one side of the former United States of America to the other, and back again. Living in the home of his parents, he slowly meets other survivors: some are compatible and eventually group together to become members of The Tribe, others who are not, and do not. Earth Abides is a tale of the survival of a man, of a group, and of a planet without the continuing influence and domination of human civilization.This is fundamentally a book of journeys: a travel across post-apocalyptic America, within the remnants of the surviving San Francisco Bay area, of some of the Tribe's offspring attempting another cross-country journey, but most powerfully, it is the journey of Ish, as a survivor and young man, as a reluctant leader, as a torch-bearer of the hope of the re-establishment of the former Civilization, as a semi-god and The Last American, and finally as an old man who accepts that man will survive in new ways, not in the old ways, and that no matter what, that the Earth itself will abide.","A few days ago I listened to a lecture by renown geneticist Francisco Ayala. He discussed a simple experiment demonstrating Darwin's concept of natural selection. If you take a test tube holding 10 cc of the bacterium E. coli, it will hold approximately 20 billion organisms. Adding a drop of a modern antibiotic like gentamicin into the tube will result in the survival of some 200 cells (out of the original 20,000,000,000). However, since those cells are now gentamicin resistant, in only a few days the tube will again hold 20 billion (now gentamicin resistant) E. coli cells. The only E. coli cells that made additional copies of themselves were the ones with the mutation for gentamicin resistance. Evolution has occurred.What happens when the human race is hit with a viral \"antibiotic\"? What happens when a population of 6 billion humans is suddenly, within a week, turned into a population of 600, scattered across the planet?One thing is for sure... the population won't rebound in a few days.College student Ish Williams is one of the survivors. Although he thinks it is because he suffered a rattlesnake bite during the plague, unless all the other survivors also had a similar snakebite (even in places rattlesnakes don't exist), he probably already possessed whatever mutation that made him plague resistant.From his home in the San Francisco Bay region, he drives across country, looking for survivors while seeing first hand the beginnings of civilization's decay. As for survivors, they are rare indeed. But some people, like Ish, did survive.Back in the San Francisco Bay area, Ish and a few companions begin to rebuild civilization. But when the survivors don't include an engineer, a physician, a teacher, a scientist, or even a farmer, our \"survival knowledge\" is limited indeed.Author George Stewart wrote this book in 1949, so a number of the technological issues are quite dated. Nevertheless, survival isn't easy. Ish and others have to deal with exploding populations of wild cattle, and rats, and dogs. They have to find something besides canned food. They have to ensure water is still available. And they have to teach the children, so they don't forget.\"Yes, [Ish] reluctantly concluded, this matter of the children's beliefs was extremely serious. In the Old Times [pre-plague] the beliefs held by the children of any family or small group of families might be momentous enough, but still those children on growing up would come into contact with other beliefs and make adjustments. Besides, there had been a great, even overwhelming, mass of tradition - the tradition of Christianity, or of Western civilization, or of Indo-European folkways, or of Anglo-American culture. Call it what you wished, it was still so tremendous that you might say it was omnipotent, for good or bad absorbing the individual.But now their little community had lost much of the tradition. Part of it had been lost because no seven survivors... could preserve and transmit all of it. Part had been lost because for so long a time there had been no big children to pass on the tradition to the small ones. The oldest of the younger generation had been taught games by their parents, not by older comrades. The community should therefore be plastic to an unprecedented degree. This was an opportunity, but also a responsibility - and a danger....Now, more certainly even than before, he knew that he had the opportunity to be the founder of a religion for a whole people. What he told the children in school, they would probably believe. He could insure their memory of it by mere insistence and iteration. He could tell them that the Lord God created the earth in six days, and found it good. They would believe. He could tell them a local Indian legend that the world was the work of Old Man Coyote. They would believe\" (p. 222-223).Sobering, and interesting. Stewart ends by writing, \"Men go and come, but earth abides\" (p. 345).","I first read this novel over 20 years ago in a college history course. It's a story that has stayed with me, and I recently wanted to discover if the book was a good as I remembered it to be. Well, in one sense, it was: Stewart's style is still powerful, the plot timely, and the characters all too human in how they react to the end of the world as they've known it. What I also discovered was how dated this novel is, for some of the same reasons it's still a good story: 'Ish', the main character, is right out of the Cold War era, as he's chauvinistic, detatched, and more than a little pompous at times. The plot is all too familiar to our post-modern world (and King's 'The Stand' has some similarities): some kind of plague wipes out most of the world's population; Ish, bitten by a rattlesnake right before this happens, survives. The first part of the book really puts the reader into a world where Ish fears he is the last survivor. Even when he encounters others, he feels no connection to them. On his cross country trip, he sees no reason to stay with even the kind people he meets; instead, he returns to his parents' house, where he begins to plan for some kind of rebuilding of the former society. Eventually, he meets 'Em', a mixed race older woman, and they collect a small group of survivors who try to continue life as they knew it, children are born, and 'The Tribe' grows. Inserted in the narrative is Stewart's description of the title: as mankind and his works diminish, animals, native plants, nature itself transform and overtake 'civilization'...\"Men come and go, but earth abides\" (345). At times, Stewart and Ish overdo it with the dramtic language. Ish is not always the most sympathetic character, pompous and seeing himself superior to most of The Tribe. The Tribe doesn't seem to really have the energy to truly rebuild -- or even build anew -- another existence; the incident when the water system breaks down is the best example: even Ish realizes that the survivors and their children don't have either the desire or the knowledge to fix the problem and continue to enjoy indoor plumbing. Even the digging of latrines is never really finished, as no one seems to care when the work gets too hard. One does feel for Ish when he finally realizes that no one cares about the old education; The Tribe essentially regresses to hunting and small farming, but also seems happier than the 'modern' man ever was. Stewart had a good idea of modern man's virtues and foibles, and also provides a thought-provoking study which makes the reader ask \"what would I do in this same situation?\" You can also see, historically, where this novel fits into the US Cold War fears of complete annihilation of our 'great' way of life, and the land of plenty that the US was in this era: how do the survivors eat? They plunder the cans in the supermarkets for decades. The Tribe simply forages off of what's left behind, and at no time does it seem that the leftovers will ever end. It's an interesting comment on the world Stewart knew, and a compliment to the abundance in the US in the late 1940s, when the novel was first written.","George R. Stewart's main character isn't as helpless as a quick glance at the first page reviews may imply. He is a character that is able to do significant hands-on tasks such as auto mechanics, hunting, lead a small surviving group of humanity, and teach and school children. He is just not an expert in these fields, which isn't too surprising for a random person, but in many cases his knowledge and aptitude turned out quite useful. It's just that when one is dealing with what could be the last of humanity, a lot is needed for the human race to go on. Written in 1949, Stewart's Earth Abides makes one reminiscent of that time and of what was available then. Stewart takes some time to describe what happens to the other mammals, although I'm not sure if the prey vs. predator equilibrium was a new idea at that time since he does elaborate on it quite a bit. His visions of primitive and/or overly religious societies in humanity's backslide in certain areas will be quite well known to those that follow more modern writings and films of `the end of the world' genre.The setting takes place in three time eras, one right after the disease that wipes out most of humanity, one 22 years later, and the last at over 42 years later-probably 50+ years. The first takes place more or less in the time the book was published, 1949. The other one has to realize would then be taking place in what would then be 1971. Now Stewart makes the 22 years go by fairly quickly, but thinking about what happened in the real world between 1949 and 1971, the James Dean era, the hippy movement, Vietnam War, the start of the oil crunch, makes one realize a lot can happen in 22 years as opposed to what Stewart writes. What Stewart seems more to be writing about, isn't the end of the world, but the laziness of man, which eventually becomes a downfall for some and something that needs to be overcome. Now I don't know if he was writing about something he saw in his workplace or in the armed forces if he was in WWII, but he does take it to an extreme. Sure some people may just be tired of an 8 hour workday, when there's so many aspects of life out there, but it's hard to believe one would maintain an utterly lazy lifestyle for 22 years, when there wasn't any need to worry about food for the short term, or how one's retirement plans were going, and instead, without these shackles on one's mind in terms of worrying about the future, not feel free or have interest about how to rebuild society. There are some groups of people in the real world that if you get two of them together, they'll come up with three visions for the future as opposed to almost no visions by the characters of the novel.The book is also a bit too ideal. Maybe it really was like this in 1949, but the world as I've seen it would have the character's in marital disputes, the usual utterances of \"you suck,\" some saying to get rid of old man Ish, let's move our group, this in no good, that is no good, and so on. However, what makes this novel different from, say the usual post-nuclear-war book, isn't just healthy young men surviving, but a random group of people surviving that somehow have immunity to the disease (although one could say those that have built an immunity by being bitten by a snake represents a certain group of people and that would skew the randomness that Stewart tried to set up in the survivors), so his vision of the type of characters that survive may have some credibility.Overall it was a fun book to read. Stewart has a flowing, easygoing style that makes you want to keep reading to see how things turn out. It does get a little slow around the 200 page mark, so, as in other books, you just have to plow through it to get to the end. I'd recommend this book. It's one of the better post-apocalyptic novels that came out in the 40's and 50's, and is a compelling read.","I read this book in the 60s, just over a decade after it came out. When I read some of the reviews here, I decided to skim through it again. What had surprised me were the negative reviews. I remembered the story as a very interesting one, with characters I could appreciate, if not like.What I found different was the fiction that has come along in the past 40 years. In \"the old days\" fiction often was more thoughtful with less action and more introspection. Characters did not always solve the problems with which they were confronted (although I must admit that this was not the case as often in science fiction). Stewart in Earth Abides gives us a world in which nearly the entire population of the earth has died from a pandemic. Ish, the main character, spends much time alone in the beginning. As the few survivors begin to gather together, they look to him for leadership, something he's not certain he is qualified to do. The exception is that he is well read, and his greatest passion is to preserve the library in the area in which he lives.(spoiler lieth here) Some of the reviewers here seem surprised at the deterioration of civilization amongst the group. Were they as surprised if they read Lord of the Flies? True, those characters were all children, but many of Stewart's characters are uneducated or unsophisticated, who never understand Ish's preoccupation with the knowledge housed in that library. They are too busy learning to survive with none of the trappings of modern life, and without the tools to re-create that life. The story is depressing as one reads the slide into savagery. But what is represented is one possible outcome should such a holocaust occur in the world.For different outcomes, try reading Day of the Triffids (there be monsters), or Malevil. Or see the old b&w; film Things to Come. This was once a very popular sub-genre of science fiction and many possible outcomes have been depicted.","Wow, just wow. I can see that a lot of better reviewers have already had their say, but I've never been this moved and impressed.I was concerned about getting a book that was so old, but there really weren't many references that took me out of Ish's shoes: The lack of TVs, the attitude of and towards the African Americans (to avoid using his words), and to entertainers of whom I only recognized Bob Hope. Other than that it could have easily happened today.I'm pleased by how the book was ordered, with most of the chapters covering only a year in detail with a chapter about the intervening years between sections. It probably would've been easy to pad out those years rather than summarizing them, but it would've been too much.Most of all I like the short sections in the middle of chapters, largely in the first section, that help to break it up and provide a omniscient viewpoint and a break from Ish's lesser understanding and awareness. The portions relating to how the different plants and animals were affected interested me greatly.I'm very happy with the ending as well. Overall the book has several good thinking points. Definitely one I would suggest to others.","Glowing reviews, word of mouth praise and the subject matter all left me eager to read Earth Abides. Unfortunately this book fell far short of my expectations. The premise of a global plague is truly fascinating (and frightening), especially in light of recent world events, but the story drags on in such a depressing and mundane fashion that reading the book became a chore rather than an adventure. The lead character's over inflated opinion of himself is so prevalent through out the book that it prevents any character development on the part of any other survivors. Over 300 pages and you barely get to know any of them. That would not have mattered so much if the author had done a better job of portraying the aftermath of the plague. Too little attention was paid to what would happen to the local environment. Impacts are generally glossed over in short, simplistic passages. Survival was no more difficult than raiding the local grocery store and opening a can of beans, even after 20 years. I never felt the horror and struggle for survival that one would expect with such a global catstrophe. The technology in the book is certainly dated but I didn't find that a distraction. This is not an enjoyable read. Better classics on man wiping himself out include \"On the Beach\" and \"Alas, Babylon\". For a more up to date adventure try \"Ill Wind\" by Anderson & Beason.","I love to read, so there are very few books I don't finish. I usually slog through even the bad ones. Here's my take on this book. I was looking for a novel about how people came up with creative ideas about how to survive in a world after civilization is wiped out. This book dealt with that facet somewhat in the first hundred pages. After that most of the book deals with moral issues. \"What are the moral or ethical responsibilities of survivors\" is the main theme of the rest of the book. After an ok start, the whole rest of the book seemed preachy and a little like the author was trying to coerce me into agreeing with his point of view. Three-quarters of the way through the book I quit reading, because there were no characters I was interested in enough to care what happened to them.","Written by a self-righteous professor of English Lit from Berkeley. The authors preconceived notions about the ignorance of rest of us comes across pretty clearly, as his protagonist constantly judges everyone based on his perception of their intelligence. Book was very poorly researched....the protagonist and his children live mostly off of 20-30 year old canned food for most of the book (something that would probably kill you). He fixes up a jeep and then fills it with 20 year old gasoline (which is unusable a year or two after its refined). He raises his offspring in total ignorance...his greatest achievement being to teach them how to make a bow and start a fire (teaching them to read was apparently not important). Worse end of the world book I've ever read.","The plot in Earth Abides is very simple. It is basically the ongoing struggle one would face in creating a perfect society. The setting is in San Francisco, California after a great disease has struck and wiped out 99% of the human population. The main character is a survivor named Ish. He survived the disease an interesting way, and then sets out to build a new society. Through his trials and errors you find out the complexity to people and modern society. You understand the restraints that society has on a person, even if it is not present. For example alcohol is a big part in the novel. Without anyone to stop them, people begin to drink themselves to death.Earth Abides' plot is thin, and dragged to eternity and back. The author spends the majority of the second half of the book reasoning about worthless issues. They were worthless because they do not apply to the main theme of survival. This makes you very confused, as the book is already hard to follow. He also spends a good deal of pages with Ish's inner thoughts, which are basically a bunch of complex nonsense. It is very hard to put your self in his place, and understand his thoughts. He becomes so paranoid with every decision he makes, that he becomes overly analytical.This book could possibly be amusing to very patient adults. It has close to zero action, and does not keep you turning pages. In reality it is the exact opposite, it puts you to sleep. Anyone who likes a book that keeps you interested, Earth Abides is not for you. The only person I would recommend this book to, would be an insomniac who needs to find a way to get to sleep.","Not really SiFi. Fiction and Apocalyptic yes, but after a very few chapters to grab your interest, author drifts off into non-related daydreaming, repetition and his personal philosophy on various character's lives. I'm betting that he was a self proclaimed authority and certainly a pipe smoker.No science, little innovation, but it goes on and on. You keep hoping it will get better, but unfortunately, it doesn't. How it won any award remains a mystery to me. If you are looking for an exciting science fiction work, sorry, but this isn't it.","Having loved this story 20 years ago as a teenager, it pains me now to find that it is surely the worst novel on my bookshelves. All the characters are two-dimensional. The dialogue is uniformly stiff and amateurish. The story's hero is arrogant, aloof and dismissive of anyone he perceives as inferior. Since he actually perceives *everyone* as inferior, the book quickly becomes very tiresome. Perhaps the saddest aspect of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that the story is clearly and shockingly the fantasy of someone who dreamed of existing in a world without people, or at most with just a thin sprinkling of simple folks over whom he could rule as their intellectual master. &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is a truly awful book.","I love a good post-apoc book, but this one just wasn't that great. Other than the narrator, the male characters aren't very well developed and the female characters were even worse. The jumps in time threw me off and the overall plot just didn't grab me.","I'm surprised so many people rated this book so highly. It's hideously dated, both in language, and in writing style. Not even in the same ballpark as something like The Stand. It was interesting to think about what path civilization would take without a unifying threat after an apocalypse, but the writing just ruined it for me. No great character development at any point, a lot of cliches and brushed over details. It kept me reading, barely, mostly to see if it went anywhere. Pretty disappointing though.","I am a fan of similar themed books. But this one just does nothing for me. The only interesting aspect is the (almost consuming) focus on how other animals in the biosphere react to the human population crashing down.But that doesn't make up for these huge flaws:1) The interpersonal aspects are awful.People just don't relate to each other the way the author describes.2) Dominated bi sudo-Christian bible verse that gets added in to say something meaningful is happening3) The storyline takes place so long ago that it is hard to see it as anything but a time-piece.4) Racist, sexist views embedded very deep in the assumptions5) Overall a very boring story line. No emotional growth in the characters and no growth in the community or plot. Just terrible, really.","My hobby is reading . I enjoy reading stories. all kinds of stories by bestselling authors or never heard of authors. always looking for a good story. In my search I have read some great stories, some not so great and just plain awful. but only three times have I ever disliked a story where I could not finish it. This story was so bad not only could I not finish it I would like a refund. the story line could of been interesting. The writing was horrible. I hope it is a long time before I come across a book this bad again.","I read this book when I was in my early teens during a time when I read many sci-fi books. This one stuck with me. I won't repeat what others have said, but this book struck me as a beautifully told story about a horrible, if remote, possibility. I'm happy to stumble over it here and see that it's still in print and people are still reading it. I guess it's become somewhat of a classic, and it deserves to be.","This story is as contemporary as it was when it was first published in 1949. Except for a few references to the availability of hand cranked phonographs, there is no indication that this disaster and it's aftermath didn't take place in the present. The story is told entirely in the third person. This would generally seem to be tedious, however is simply does not loose its hold on you. The writing is careful, the author is economical in the use of words that describe concepts. The premise of the story is simple: a deadly virus sweeps the earth and within a few weeks all of mankind is gone. There remains only isolated individuals who eventually find each other and begin life again in the altered world.I first read this book in my early thirties. It impacted my life to the point that I always referred to the reading of this book as one of the turning points in my life. I have now reread it with the perspective of 20 additional years and it has the same impact. I was so struck with the understanding Stewart conveys of the emptiness of contemporary life. This emptiness is not to be construed as useless. The grand civilization we have constructed is great, is a monumental, exciting and dynamic achievement. But if you put all these achievements against the needs of a group of people that will eventually have no access to prepared foods, electricity on demand, water and heat or cooling, instant access to far away members of their family, by telephone, car, plane, fax, etc., you soon see what the hero saw: What the emerging generations needed was a basic knowledge of hunting and gathering. Laws become obsolete, customs change to suit the need of the group, language changes and a thought that resonates within me, is the idea of the God of the Bible. Because the Bible refers specifically to groups of people and their interaction, what is there to refer to, when the groups and the interaction are gone? For me, the consummate fundamental Christian, this is very thought provoking and brings me into another dimension: to examine my faith and trust and what it is I have faith and trust in and for. This book should be required reading for Sociology, Anthropology and Psychology students. Absolutely wonderful!!","This was one of the first books I read as a kid. I was enthralled back then with the idea of a plague wiping out the vast majority of people so my father suggested \"Earth Abides\" as a suitable read. I enjoyed rereading the book as an adult recalling the same fascination with the storyline as I did over 25 years ago. The author tells the survival story of Isherwood Williams, a man who evades a plague due to a counteraction to a snake bite.The author peppers the pages with intricate details such as Isherwood's realization that he is a good candidate to survive the aftermath since he was young and fit and had his appendix removed. Even so, he took care while descending a flight of stairs, concerned that even the slightest injury could be fatal in a post-pandemic world. At one point, Isherwood sees a Coke-a-Cola sign in the distance flashing on and off (like they used to do in the 70's) and wonders how long the power will stay on without people maintaining the infrastructure. Later as children are born to the survivors, he feels no need to correct their improper English since there was no longer a basis for proper spoken word.An interesting point about this storyline is that presumably those that did survive the epidemic would have had a natural immunity to the disease, but those like Isherwood, surviving by a counter reaction, could pass on the susceptibility to the disease to future generations.Throughout the book Isherwood possesses a hammer that first is a mere tool, but later comes to symbolize his authority and a new justice. Along the way, many difficult decisions are faced by the people of the new society. The author assembles an extensive expanse of possibilities all logically facing the survivors of a new world. I highly recommend this book as I have for many years.","I recently re-read this book after twenty five years. The story drives with a unique force as the naturally detached observer-protagonist Isherwood witnesses the Earth and Mankind's remnants slowly re-establish a new balance. This reacquaintence also served as a reflection on myself.As a teenager, I was drawn to Ish's character, much like my own at the time: quiet, reflective, socially uncomfortable. I took great delight in identifying that the book took place in my own neighborhood: The rock where they carved the years is a perfect description of Indian Rock in Berkeley, where I climbed countless times as a kid. For years after, wherever I went I liked to see how unkept gardens took over their yards, how abandoned houses returned slowly to Nature's way, how unused roads returned to the soil at a relentless if geologic pace.As a man in my 40s I find the tale retains its fascinating hold. I still like to see how Man's works change in their own way when left alone, just as any other object in nature. Much of Stewart's description of that change rings true and is well visualized. But most striking to me was that the nature of the characters had changed in my mind. No longer were they just people like myself, making the best out of this extraordinary circumstance. The second time around, the characters were very unsatisfying. Ish is the only one with any ambition at all, and he is unable to make anything of it. This is due entirely to his personal failings: the social stiffness he never outgrew, his lack of focus, his increasingly insular view of his place in the surrounding world. I was particularly offended by a scene of &quot;crime&quot; and punishment. Yet these are not failings of the author nor of the book. Stewart was simply taking the opportunity to show that, barring the survival of some remarkably talented and organized people, civilization is not by any means guaranteed to carry on. Though &quot;The Stand&quot; is more entertaining, &quot;Earth Abides&quot; remains much more satisfying.","I first came across this book while stationed in Vietnam in 1971. The story is about the life and times of a young geologist who escapes a catastrophe that causes the deaths of almost all of the population of the world. As you read, you see how this young man copes with loneliness and then love after finding another survivor.These two begin a life together and eventually establish friendship with other survivors and then form a \"tribe\". As chapters pass by, they are named for significant events in the tribe's lives during the year.I have read and re-read this book to the point that I will need to purchase another copy in the near future.","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it. This maturity is perceptible all along this work.The story is situated in a world devastated by a sudden pestilence that annihilates most of humankind. Taking into account the last SARS epidemic that jumped abruptly from China to Canada it doesn't look an impossible scenario.This is the story.Isherwood Williams comes down from an isolate spot in the mountains to discover an empty world. He starts searching for survivors all across USA, from California to New York and back again. He finds only isolate human cells, couples or trios, overwhelmed by catastrophe and in a near catatonic state.Returns to his native town and contemplate with a certain scientific detachment the fading world around him.Mr. Stewart intercalate brief vignettes describing what happens to dogs, cats, cattle, plants, roads, dams and bridges, contrasting them with Ish's daily experiences.Little by little the story grip reader's attention and even if action is somehow slow, the book can't be put down.Human cells began to draw near each other and a rather feeble structure starts growing up.The author approaches universal questions about survival and extinction; civilization and savagery; social structure and anomie. He also examines religious values, ethics and life's ultimate sense.This book gives the reader a lot of stuff to think about. A very enticing read!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","Reading Earth Abides what struck me most was not the story, though this was certainly well told and presented, but how bravely the book took an unusual tack on its chosen topic: the survival factor of our civilisation and man himself when measured against geologic or cosmic time as represented by the planet Earth. Normally we are reasured that the embers of civilisation and man will never go out, and that we will always triumph as a species. Almost every film, book or play impresses this perception upon it's audience. And at first, as Isherwood works to rebuild, it seems Earth Abides will follow the same route. Then things start to change, and the reader begins to feel an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of their stomach; Isherwood's attempts start to fail, and the flickering ember of 20th century civilisation begins to dim. At the last, time takes its own course, and our ability to outlast even our own planet, never mind spread to the Universe as many SF books believe, is brought into question. And it is with this that the book triumphs. We are asked to question our entire society, and its true prospects for survival. One of the few books I've read that made me question the daily trip to the office, not from the point of view of myself, but my entire species, and to wonder what on Earth we are doing to ensure the real future of our species.","I did not notice the year until the second reading. The story plays out today as well as it did in the forties.Profound and thought inspiring. My wife is a lit major and had little experience with SF. This book opened a new world for her. It is unfortunate more of Stewart's work is not available.I was originally intrigued by the location. San Lupo Drive is San Luis Drive in the hills of Berkeley, CA. The rocks are Indian Rock Park. Everthing fits. Stewart talks of walking down to to a shopping district, Solano Avenue.The cleanliness of society's destruction was an interseting twist. No mess and madness. Imagine suddenly being a surviver on the planet.A good series to read is Earth Abides, Lucifer's Hammer, and Into the Woods. Throw in The Children of Men.","Earth Abides will no doubt remain one of the classic post-apocalyptic books of our era. The characters are well-developed and easy to like and the setting is as familiar as the Golden Gate bridge and the Oakland hills (where most of the story takes place). When I first read Earth Abides at the age of twelve, I thought it a fascinating and engaging tale that kept me turning pages well into the night. Now, at forty-five, I find it somewhat quirky, ethically questionable, and rather unrealistic in it's study of human nature. Despite the great effort George R. Stewart puts into developing well-rounded characters, most of their attitudes and beliefs would be more suited to the 19th century than the 21st. Racism and sexism are both a noticeable undercurrent and the academic elitism of the main character starts out annoying then rapidly becomes nauseating.Although a powerfully thought-provoking read at the age of 12, at the age of 45 I find it strongly dated and woefully inadequate. Still, it is a classic and is well worth reading for anyone with an interest in post-apocalyptic fiction, anthropology, or the foundations of social order.","This was a great book, but not an action-filled book. It is a book to generate ideas, not to get the adrenaline flowing. If it ever comes to a survival situation as posited in the book, life won't be glamorous. It will be mundane, a matter of getting food and having a dry place to sleep. Stewart gives us good reasons for why this is so.I wrote the following this morning, trying to sort out why Ish is the leader for the group:In reading the complaints of those who don't like Earth Abides, it seemed to me that many were disappointed that George R. Stewart did not create a group of super-humans to rebuild society. Why didn't they plan better? Why didn't they show more interest, more creativity? The author chose a group of ordinary people, who were used to living in a civilization doing everything for them, from providing their food, to thinking and planning.One of the points that is frequently missed for those reading \"Earth Abides\" is the way humans behave. As long as their needs are taken care of, many people tend to let the rest of life come as it will. Making plans takes mental effort, and that is where only Ish has any experience. The energy to think ahead, and to make others see what is coming, that is what makes a leader great.Ish is a scholar--he's well on the way to becoming a professor. That path makes him a professional thinker and ponderer and not a man of action. His career makes him one who watches from the sidelines without getting involved, and even if that were not the case, his personality pushes him in that direction. He is not a people person--he's a loner, uncomfortable in the company of others. He's a geek, more interested in privacy and private pursuits than in being a leader. Ish has half of the great leader equation; he has the energy to think ahead. What he lacks is the ability to convey what he sees to others.When he thinks of himself as a leader by default, he is being realistic; of his band of seven adults, no other shows any sign of talent for leading. The one person in the group with strong social abilities, Ezra, defers to Ish. George is \"dull,\" a man of craft who's job as plumber involves rushing to fix broken things; he is accustomed to reacting, not to making plans. George's wife's main concern is domestic tasks, and in this, she is a product of her age. Of Ezra's two wives, neither shows any signs of interest in planning for the group. Of all of the group, only Em leads when Ish cannot. Where he is the geek, timid and unable to marshal people, she is the one with backbone, who gets people moving when she sees a need. She lets Ish plan, perhaps, because she lives in the here and now, and only leads when she sees a clear cut need or threat in the immediate future. She doesn't worry about the future, because for the present, all the needs are taken care of.This is the group that survived the Great Disaster in Berkeley; seven ordinary people, products of a country that has professional leaders, so that the people don't have to think.There are also a number of complaints about the main character, Ish. People who disliked the book tended to write negative comments about him. In fairness, Ish is not a leader; he is a geek, one interested in private pursuits. He is introverted. Unfortunately for his social tastes, he is the sole person left in the Berkeley area who was accustomed to thinking and judging on a daily basis. This makes him the one who others turn to for ideas, the leader. As the leader, his decisions come out of his non-charismatic, introverted self. He is not a natural teacher (and in spite of this he is the only one to attempt to teach). These social weaknesses, however, are tied to his intellectual strengths. A different main character could have had different strengths, but then the reader would not have been treated to Ish's unique views as to what happened to the world after the fall of civilization.About Ish's attitude: Reviewers have accused him of acting as if others are too emotional, too black)--I think these opinions about how Ish interacts with his world ignore Ish's nature. He isn't judgmental, he is professionally distanced. In a state resembling shock, he turns a scientific eye upon the world, as if the world means nothing to him. He's lost his country and family and everything but his life's work (which was ecologist, one studying the interactions of living things and environment). If he hides behind his life's work in a time of crisis and shock, he isn't the first. Journalists do this all the time. Work now, think about yourself later.About the racist elements: Ish never really shows signs of being racist (but he was living in a racist society--segregation was the law of the land in 1949. And mixed marriages were illegal in many states). He is a product of that society. But in looking at the rural black people, his tone is almost admiration--THEY will survive when all the rest can't.","I read this book when I was in my early teens during a time when I read many sci-fi books.

This is due entirely to his personal failings: the social stiffness he never outgrew, his lack of focus, his increasingly insular view of his place in the surrounding world. I was particularly offended by a scene of &quot;crime&quot; and punishment. Yet these are not failings of the author nor of the book. Stewart was simply taking the opportunity to show that, barring the survival of some remarkably talented and organized people, civilization is not by any means guaranteed to carry on. Though &quot;The Stand&quot; is more entertaining, &quot;Earth Abides&quot; remains much more satisfying.","I first came across this book while stationed in Vietnam in 1971. The story is about the life and times of a young geologist who escapes a catastrophe that causes the deaths of almost all of the population of the world. As you read, you see how this young man copes with loneliness and then love after finding another survivor.These two begin a life together and eventually establish friendship with other survivors and then form a \"tribe\". As chapters pass by, they are named for significant events in the tribe's lives during the year.I have read and re-read this book to the point that I will need to purchase another copy in the near future.","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it. This maturity is perceptible all along this work.The story is situated in a world devastated by a sudden pestilence that annihilates most of humankind. Taking into account the last SARS epidemic that jumped abruptly from China to Canada it doesn't look an impossible scenario.This is the story.Isherwood Williams comes down from an isolate spot in the mountains to discover an empty world. He starts searching for survivors all across USA, from California to New York and back again. He finds only isolate human cells, couples or trios, overwhelmed by catastrophe and in a near catatonic state.Returns to his native town and contemplate with a certain scientific detachment the fading world around him.Mr. Stewart intercalate brief vignettes describing what happens to dogs, cats, cattle, plants, roads, dams and bridges, contrasting them with Ish's daily experiences.Little by little the story grip reader's attention and even if action is somehow slow, the book can't be put down.Human cells began to draw near each other and a rather feeble structure starts growing up.The author approaches universal questions about survival and extinction; civilization and savagery; social structure and anomie. He also examines religious values, ethics and life's ultimate sense.This book gives the reader a lot of stuff to think about. A very enticing read!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","Reading Earth Abides what struck me most was not the story, though this was certainly well told and presented, but how bravely the book took an unusual tack on its chosen topic: the survival factor of our civilisation and man himself when measured against geologic or cosmic time as represented by the planet Earth. Normally we are reasured that the embers of civilisation and man will never go out, and that we will always triumph as a species. Almost every film, book or play impresses this perception upon it's audience. And at first, as Isherwood works to rebuild, it seems Earth Abides will follow the same route. Then things start to change, and the reader begins to feel an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of their stomach; Isherwood's attempts start to fail, and the flickering ember of 20th century civilisation begins to dim. At the last, time takes its own course, and our ability to outlast even our own planet, never mind spread to the Universe as many SF books believe, is brought into question. And it is with this that the book triumphs. We are asked to question our entire society, and its true prospects for survival. One of the few books I've read that made me question the daily trip to the office, not from the point of view of myself, but my entire species, and to wonder what on Earth we are doing to ensure the real future of our species.","I did not notice the year until the second reading. The story plays out today as well as it did in the forties.Profound and thought inspiring. My wife is a lit major and had little experience with SF. This book opened a new world for her. It is unfortunate more of Stewart's work is not available.I was originally intrigued by the location. San Lupo Drive is San Luis Drive in the hills of Berkeley, CA. The rocks are Indian Rock Park. Everthing fits. Stewart talks of walking down to to a shopping district, Solano Avenue.The cleanliness of society's destruction was an interseting twist. No mess and madness. Imagine suddenly being a surviver on the planet.A good series to read is Earth Abides, Lucifer's Hammer, and Into the Woods. Throw in The Children of Men.","Earth Abides will no doubt remain one of the classic post-apocalyptic books of our era. The characters are well-developed and easy to like and the setting is as familiar as the Golden Gate bridge and the Oakland hills (where most of the story takes place). When I first read Earth Abides at the age of twelve, I thought it a fascinating and engaging tale that kept me turning pages well into the night. Now, at forty-five, I find it somewhat quirky, ethically questionable, and rather unrealistic in it's study of human nature. Despite the great effort George R. Stewart puts into developing well-rounded characters, most of their attitudes and beliefs would be more suited to the 19th century than the 21st. Racism and sexism are both a noticeable undercurrent and the academic elitism of the main character starts out annoying then rapidly becomes nauseating.Although a powerfully thought-provoking read at the age of 12, at the age of 45 I find it strongly dated and woefully inadequate. Still, it is a classic and is well worth reading for anyone with an interest in post-apocalyptic fiction, anthropology, or the foundations of social order.","This was a great book, but not an action-filled book. It is a book to generate ideas, not to get the adrenaline flowing. If it ever comes to a survival situation as posited in the book, life won't be glamorous. It will be mundane, a matter of getting food and having a dry place to sleep. Stewart gives us good reasons for why this is so.I wrote the following this morning, trying to sort out why Ish is the leader for the group:In reading the complaints of those who don't like Earth Abides, it seemed to me that many were disappointed that George R. Stewart did not create a group of super-humans to rebuild society. Why didn't they plan better? Why didn't they show more interest, more creativity? The author chose a group of ordinary people, who were used to living in a civilization doing everything for them, from providing their food, to thinking and planning.One of the points that is frequently missed for those reading \"Earth Abides\" is the way humans behave. As long as their needs are taken care of, many people tend to let the rest of life come as it will. Making plans takes mental effort, and that is where only Ish has any experience. The energy to think ahead, and to make others see what is coming, that is what makes a leader great.Ish is a scholar--he's well on the way to becoming a professor. That path makes him a professional thinker and ponderer and not a man of action. His career makes him one who watches from the sidelines without getting involved, and even if that were not the case, his personality pushes him in that direction. He is not a people person--he's a loner, uncomfortable in the company of others. He's a geek, more interested in privacy and private pursuits than in being a leader. Ish has half of the great leader equation; he has the energy to think ahead. What he lacks is the ability to convey what he sees to others.When he thinks of himself as a leader by default, he is being realistic; of his band of seven adults, no other shows any sign of talent for leading. The one person in the group with strong social abilities, Ezra, defers to Ish. George is \"dull,\" a man of craft who's job as plumber involves rushing to fix broken things; he is accustomed to reacting, not to making plans. George's wife's main concern is domestic tasks, and in this, she is a product of her age. Of Ezra's two wives, neither shows any signs of interest in planning for the group. Of all of the group, only Em leads when Ish cannot. Where he is the geek, timid and unable to marshal people, she is the one with backbone, who gets people moving when she sees a need. She lets Ish plan, perhaps, because she lives in the here and now, and only leads when she sees a clear cut need or threat in the immediate future. She doesn't worry about the future, because for the present, all the needs are taken care of.This is the group that survived the Great Disaster in Berkeley; seven ordinary people, products of a country that has professional leaders, so that the people don't have to think.There are also a number of complaints about the main character, Ish. People who disliked the book tended to write negative comments about him. In fairness, Ish is not a leader; he is a geek, one interested in private pursuits. He is introverted. Unfortunately for his social tastes, he is the sole person left in the Berkeley area who was accustomed to thinking and judging on a daily basis. This makes him the one who others turn to for ideas, the leader. As the leader, his decisions come out of his non-charismatic, introverted self. He is not a natural teacher (and in spite of this he is the only one to attempt to teach). These social weaknesses, however, are tied to his intellectual strengths. A different main character could have had different strengths, but then the reader would not have been treated to Ish's unique views as to what happened to the world after the fall of civilization.About Ish's attitude: Reviewers have accused him of acting as if others are too emotional, too black)--I think these opinions about how Ish interacts with his world ignore Ish's nature. He isn't judgmental, he is professionally distanced. In a state resembling shock, he turns a scientific eye upon the world, as if the world means nothing to him. He's lost his country and family and everything but his life's work (which was ecologist, one studying the interactions of living things and environment). If he hides behind his life's work in a time of crisis and shock, he isn't the first. Journalists do this all the time. Work now, think about yourself later.About the racist elements: Ish never really shows signs of being racist (but he was living in a racist society--segregation was the law of the land in 1949. And mixed marriages were illegal in many states). He is a product of that society. But in looking at the rural black people, his tone is almost admiration--THEY will survive when all the rest can't.","I first read this book back in 1967. At that time I was a kid and the whole story seemed to be nothing but \"science fiction.\" I read about the way Ish went through his life, with a disbelief that it could ever happen here and now.However, today I look at the possibility that civilization could be shattered by the loss of what we have come to consider the essential necessities of life - electricity, water, gas, gasoline, telephone, computers, drug stores and grocery stores. Now when I read Earth Abides, I realize that this story could actually happen to us. The problems that Ish had to deal with are now possible. As I read this story, I found myself wondering how I would handle dwindling supplies, the threats of animals and disease, the decreasing availability of items that spoil or evaporate, the social interaction with people, both good and bad. I wondered how I would deal with the lack of food, water, and medicine? Would I be able to survive in a deserted city with no electricity? With terrorists threatening to destroy our way of life, this book could be a survival guide for the modern man.I especially found the greatest distress in this book was the way knowledge was lost. First Ish wanted to read and then it became less important and then the books fell apart. Ish became an antique with knowledge of things that meant nothing to the younger generation that was growing up around him. This book should be used to teach us all a lesson - that we must keep the flame of knowledge burning all the time or we could lose it so very fast.","This 1949 novel is one of the earliest explorations of the theme of a doomsday plague. Our hero, named Ish, is a young college student who returns from the mountains to find out that an airborne virus has wiped out over 99.99 percent of the population in remarkably tidy fashion, leaving behind only a handful of survivors.It is hard to rate a book like this. On the one hand, it is well written, and, despite a few implausible suppositions, manages to explores a number of interesting ideas and insights.But there is a big problem: Our hero, Ish, is completely wicked -- an amoral, self-worshiping, arrogant, elitist monster; and the author seems to be on his side. I understand that books of this type tend to be misanthropic fantasies, and even understand the appeal. But I cannot stomach Ish.Ish is not particularly upset by the tragedy, since he never had much use for his fellow man. Still, his first reaction is to contemplate suicide. He can think of no reason to live. How this differs from his outlook before the tragedy is unclear, but he apparently bemoans the loss of superior human specimens who are mirror images of himself -- detached, scientific, rational, and essentially amoral. He ultimately rejects suicide, only because he decides it might be scientifically interesting to observe the continuing downfall of humanity. That he might try HELPING his fellow survivors never occurs to him.It immediately occurs to him that there must be other survivors, but just as quickly concludes that the shock of the tragedy will soon destroy most of them as well, because of their difficulty adapting. He calls this theory \"secondary kill\". On his first day of searching, he finds no less than 5 survivors, but immediately writes them off as not worth saving, according to his quasi-darwinian \"secondary kill\" theory. He then drives entirely from the west coast to the east coast and back, without ever finding a single human being who he thinks deserves life. No matter how many survivors he finds, he persists in regarding himself as the last surviving human. Only Ish counts. (Again, how this differs from his outlook before the tragedy is unclear).He then returns to his California home and sits around eating out of cans and reading books. While reading the New Testament, he ponders the fact that Judeo-Christian morals are obsolete, since he has no neighbors to love. My jaw dropped. What about all those traumatized survivors he abandoned to die according to his detached and rational \"secondary kill\" theory?But then he starts reading the Song of Solomon, and realizes he wants a woman. Almost immediately, a beautiful woman, a fellow elitist, drops out of the blue and into his bed. Soon a handful of survivors, who Ish persists on regarding as inferior beings, gather around them and form a sort of a tribe. This is one of the more implausible aspects of the novel. Ish a leader? He may have all of Hitler's faults, but he has none of his virtues.Happily for Ish, all of the other characters (except for one man whom Ish murders) have personalities even less forceful than his own. He arranges to marry off all the tribe's children, including his own daughters, at the far-too-young and not-entirely-willing age of 13, without a peep of protest from his own wife or anyone else. (Incidentally, this is a terrible scheme if you want to preserve a high level of culture, which Ish claims is his goal). Nor does anyone protest his scheme to murder a newcomer for the crime of having a venereal disease. The only person he has any regard for is one of his many sons, who he thinks of as a mirror image of himself. But then tragedy strikes, dashing Ish's hopes for the preservation of Ish-manity.Very early on, Ish remarks, almost out of the blue, that he does not want to become a god. This is such a strange thought that I think he doth protest too much. In any event, it is virtually all he achieves. For instance, his efforts as schoolmaster, though failing to teach, succeed in instilling superstitious reverence for himself in his pupils.","Unlike all contagious diseases before this one that traveled over time, this contagion sprung up globally at about the same time. For practical purposes the human race is extinct. Isherwood \"Ish\" Williams survives the pandemic, but wonders if he is the last man on earth.In what was once called California, Ish eventually meets up with a small rag tag band of shocked survivors. As his cohorts just try to live, they turn to Ish, more an introspective loner, as the leader. Reluctantly he takes charge not knowing what the future will bring or even if there is even going to be a future.This is a reprint of a highly regarded post apocalypse tale first released in 1949. The story is actually told over a period of years broken into five major parts of which the above only briefly touches on the first two sections. Ish is a terrific protagonist whose belief in survival changes over time as he observes his little colony mature. Thriller fans will enjoy this strong after the doomsday tale that in some ways shows its pre-information age initial publication, but remains a strong cautionary story.Harriet Klausner","This review will be short and simple as there are tons of detailed reviews already available.Earth Abides is great. It turns over and over in your head for days, weeks, months, & years.. just as a great book should. Not only does it provide a glimpse into the possible future, it also shows what it was like back in mid-1900s America. Definitely a thinker's book. I'd recommend it to anyone, ESPECIALLY if you like post-apocalyptic/last man on earth type tales.","Many of the previous reviewers state that they originally read this book a long time ago, and how it stuck with them over the years. For me, the pleasure of reading Earth Abides is a very recent event, but I do know that like those other reviewers, this will be a book that will stay with me for a long time.Originally published in 1949, Earth Abides still reads fresh. It describes the life journey of the graduate student \"Ish,\" a more intelligent that average, bookish, slightly passive young man who is one of the few human survivors of a catastrophic virus outbreak. Early on, he travels from one side of the former United States of America to the other, and back again. Living in the home of his parents, he slowly meets other survivors: some are compatible and eventually group together to become members of The Tribe, others who are not, and do not. Earth Abides is a tale of the survival of a man, of a group, and of a planet without the continuing influence and domination of human civilization.This is fundamentally a book of journeys: a travel across post-apocalyptic America, within the remnants of the surviving San Francisco Bay area, of some of the Tribe's offspring attempting another cross-country journey, but most powerfully, it is the journey of Ish, as a survivor and young man, as a reluctant leader, as a torch-bearer of the hope of the re-establishment of the former Civilization, as a semi-god and The Last American, and finally as an old man who accepts that man will survive in new ways, not in the old ways, and that no matter what, that the Earth itself will abide.","A few days ago I listened to a lecture by renown geneticist Francisco Ayala. He discussed a simple experiment demonstrating Darwin's concept of natural selection. If you take a test tube holding 10 cc of the bacterium E. coli, it will hold approximately 20 billion organisms. Adding a drop of a modern antibiotic like gentamicin into the tube will result in the survival of some 200 cells (out of the original 20,000,000,000). However, since those cells are now gentamicin resistant, in only a few days the tube will again hold 20 billion (now gentamicin resistant) E. coli cells. The only E. coli cells that made additional copies of themselves were the ones with the mutation for gentamicin resistance. Evolution has occurred.What happens when the human race is hit with a viral \"antibiotic\"? What happens when a population of 6 billion humans is suddenly, within a week, turned into a population of 600, scattered across the planet?One thing is for sure... the population won't rebound in a few days.College student Ish Williams is one of the survivors. Although he thinks it is because he suffered a rattlesnake bite during the plague, unless all the other survivors also had a similar snakebite (even in places rattlesnakes don't exist), he probably already possessed whatever mutation that made him plague resistant.From his home in the San Francisco Bay region, he drives across country, looking for survivors while seeing first hand the beginnings of civilization's decay. As for survivors, they are rare indeed. But some people, like Ish, did survive.Back in the San Francisco Bay area, Ish and a few companions begin to rebuild civilization. But when the survivors don't include an engineer, a physician, a teacher, a scientist, or even a farmer, our \"survival knowledge\" is limited indeed.Author George Stewart wrote this book in 1949, so a number of the technological issues are quite dated. Nevertheless, survival isn't easy. Ish and others have to deal with exploding populations of wild cattle, and rats, and dogs. They have to find something besides canned food. They have to ensure water is still available. And they have to teach the children, so they don't forget.\"Yes, [Ish] reluctantly concluded, this matter of the children's beliefs was extremely serious. In the Old Times [pre-plague] the beliefs held by the children of any family or small group of families might be momentous enough, but still those children on growing up would come into contact with other beliefs and make adjustments. Besides, there had been a great, even overwhelming, mass of tradition - the tradition of Christianity, or of Western civilization, or of Indo-European folkways, or of Anglo-American culture. Call it what you wished, it was still so tremendous that you might say it was omnipotent, for good or bad absorbing the individual.But now their little community had lost much of the tradition. Part of it had been lost because no seven survivors... could preserve and transmit all of it. Part had been lost because for so long a time there had been no big children to pass on the tradition to the small ones. The oldest of the younger generation had been taught games by their parents, not by older comrades. The community should therefore be plastic to an unprecedented degree. This was an opportunity, but also a responsibility - and a danger....Now, more certainly even than before, he knew that he had the opportunity to be the founder of a religion for a whole people. What he told the children in school, they would probably believe. He could insure their memory of it by mere insistence and iteration. He could tell them that the Lord God created the earth in six days, and found it good. They would believe. He could tell them a local Indian legend that the world was the work of Old Man Coyote. They would believe\" (p. 222-223).Sobering, and interesting. Stewart ends by writing, \"Men go and come, but earth abides\" (p. 345).","I first read this novel over 20 years ago in a college history course. It's a story that has stayed with me, and I recently wanted to discover if the book was a good as I remembered it to be. Well, in one sense, it was: Stewart's style is still powerful, the plot timely, and the characters all too human in how they react to the end of the world as they've known it. What I also discovered was how dated this novel is, for some of the same reasons it's still a good story: 'Ish', the main character, is right out of the Cold War era, as he's chauvinistic, detatched, and more than a little pompous at times. The plot is all too familiar to our post-modern world (and King's 'The Stand' has some similarities): some kind of plague wipes out most of the world's population; Ish, bitten by a rattlesnake right before this happens, survives. The first part of the book really puts the reader into a world where Ish fears he is the last survivor. Even when he encounters others, he feels no connection to them. On his cross country trip, he sees no reason to stay with even the kind people he meets; instead, he returns to his parents' house, where he begins to plan for some kind of rebuilding of the former society. Eventually, he meets 'Em', a mixed race older woman, and they collect a small group of survivors who try to continue life as they knew it, children are born, and 'The Tribe' grows. Inserted in the narrative is Stewart's description of the title: as mankind and his works diminish, animals, native plants, nature itself transform and overtake 'civilization'...\"Men come and go, but earth abides\" (345). At times, Stewart and Ish overdo it with the dramtic language. Ish is not always the most sympathetic character, pompous and seeing himself superior to most of The Tribe. The Tribe doesn't seem to really have the energy to truly rebuild -- or even build anew -- another existence; the incident when the water system breaks down is the best example: even Ish realizes that the survivors and their children don't have either the desire or the knowledge to fix the problem and continue to enjoy indoor plumbing. Even the digging of latrines is never really finished, as no one seems to care when the work gets too hard. One does feel for Ish when he finally realizes that no one cares about the old education; The Tribe essentially regresses to hunting and small farming, but also seems happier than the 'modern' man ever was. Stewart had a good idea of modern man's virtues and foibles, and also provides a thought-provoking study which makes the reader ask \"what would I do in this same situation?\" You can also see, historically, where this novel fits into the US Cold War fears of complete annihilation of our 'great' way of life, and the land of plenty that the US was in this era: how do the survivors eat? They plunder the cans in the supermarkets for decades. The Tribe simply forages off of what's left behind, and at no time does it seem that the leftovers will ever end. It's an interesting comment on the world Stewart knew, and a compliment to the abundance in the US in the late 1940s, when the novel was first written.","George R. Stewart's main character isn't as helpless as a quick glance at the first page reviews may imply. He is a character that is able to do significant hands-on tasks such as auto mechanics, hunting, lead a small surviving group of humanity, and teach and school children. He is just not an expert in these fields, which isn't too surprising for a random person, but in many cases his knowledge and aptitude turned out quite useful. It's just that when one is dealing with what could be the last of humanity, a lot is needed for the human race to go on. Written in 1949, Stewart's Earth Abides makes one reminiscent of that time and of what was available then. Stewart takes some time to describe what happens to the other mammals, although I'm not sure if the prey vs. predator equilibrium was a new idea at that time since he does elaborate on it quite a bit. His visions of primitive and/or overly religious societies in humanity's backslide in certain areas will be quite well known to those that follow more modern writings and films of `the end of the world' genre.The setting takes place in three time eras, one right after the disease that wipes out most of humanity, one 22 years later, and the last at over 42 years later-probably 50+ years. The first takes place more or less in the time the book was published, 1949. The other one has to realize would then be taking place in what would then be 1971. Now Stewart makes the 22 years go by fairly quickly, but thinking about what happened in the real world between 1949 and 1971, the James Dean era, the hippy movement, Vietnam War, the start of the oil crunch, makes one realize a lot can happen in 22 years as opposed to what Stewart writes. What Stewart seems more to be writing about, isn't the end of the world, but the laziness of man, which eventually becomes a downfall for some and something that needs to be overcome. Now I don't know if he was writing about something he saw in his workplace or in the armed forces if he was in WWII, but he does take it to an extreme. Sure some people may just be tired of an 8 hour workday, when there's so many aspects of life out there, but it's hard to believe one would maintain an utterly lazy lifestyle for 22 years, when there wasn't any need to worry about food for the short term, or how one's retirement plans were going, and instead, without these shackles on one's mind in terms of worrying about the future, not feel free or have interest about how to rebuild society. There are some groups of people in the real world that if you get two of them together, they'll come up with three visions for the future as opposed to almost no visions by the characters of the novel.The book is also a bit too ideal. Maybe it really was like this in 1949, but the world as I've seen it would have the character's in marital disputes, the usual utterances of \"you suck,\" some saying to get rid of old man Ish, let's move our group, this in no good, that is no good, and so on. However, what makes this novel different from, say the usual post-nuclear-war book, isn't just healthy young men surviving, but a random group of people surviving that somehow have immunity to the disease (although one could say those that have built an immunity by being bitten by a snake represents a certain group of people and that would skew the randomness that Stewart tried to set up in the survivors), so his vision of the type of characters that survive may have some credibility.Overall it was a fun book to read. Stewart has a flowing, easygoing style that makes you want to keep reading to see how things turn out. It does get a little slow around the 200 page mark, so, as in other books, you just have to plow through it to get to the end. I'd recommend this book. It's one of the better post-apocalyptic novels that came out in the 40's and 50's, and is a compelling read.","I read this book in the 60s, just over a decade after it came out. When I read some of the reviews here, I decided to skim through it again. What had surprised me were the negative reviews. I remembered the story as a very interesting one, with characters I could appreciate, if not like.What I found different was the fiction that has come along in the past 40 years. In \"the old days\" fiction often was more thoughtful with less action and more introspection. Characters did not always solve the problems with which they were confronted (although I must admit that this was not the case as often in science fiction). Stewart in Earth Abides gives us a world in which nearly the entire population of the earth has died from a pandemic. Ish, the main character, spends much time alone in the beginning. As the few survivors begin to gather together, they look to him for leadership, something he's not certain he is qualified to do. The exception is that he is well read, and his greatest passion is to preserve the library in the area in which he lives.(spoiler lieth here) Some of the reviewers here seem surprised at the deterioration of civilization amongst the group. Were they as surprised if they read Lord of the Flies? True, those characters were all children, but many of Stewart's characters are uneducated or unsophisticated, who never understand Ish's preoccupation with the knowledge housed in that library. They are too busy learning to survive with none of the trappings of modern life, and without the tools to re-create that life. The story is depressing as one reads the slide into savagery. But what is represented is one possible outcome should such a holocaust occur in the world.For different outcomes, try reading Day of the Triffids (there be monsters), or Malevil. Or see the old b&w; film Things to Come. This was once a very popular sub-genre of science fiction and many possible outcomes have been depicted.","Wow, just wow. I can see that a lot of better reviewers have already had their say, but I've never been this moved and impressed.I was concerned about getting a book that was so old, but there really weren't many references that took me out of Ish's shoes: The lack of TVs, the attitude of and towards the African Americans (to avoid using his words), and to entertainers of whom I only recognized Bob Hope. Other than that it could have easily happened today.I'm pleased by how the book was ordered, with most of the chapters covering only a year in detail with a chapter about the intervening years between sections. It probably would've been easy to pad out those years rather than summarizing them, but it would've been too much.Most of all I like the short sections in the middle of chapters, largely in the first section, that help to break it up and provide a omniscient viewpoint and a break from Ish's lesser understanding and awareness. The portions relating to how the different plants and animals were affected interested me greatly.I'm very happy with the ending as well. Overall the book has several good thinking points. Definitely one I would suggest to others.","George Steward did a great job writing a novel that is timeless in nature. I thought the book was well written and the characters in the book were believable and down to earth. I could not put the book down. The pace of the book was fast and exciting. Each page of the held a new twist or further clarity in the development of each character. I especially enjoyed the development of the relationship between Ish and Em as it spanned over time and life events.

Written from a naturalist's viewpoint, the novel recounts the fall of man following a sweeping measles-like pandemic. The author deftly informs us that the unknown disease is sirborne, that it hits only higher primates, and that the death toll is so all-encompassing that society simply vanishes. Mr Stewart also notes that the bulk of the few survivors are so devastated by the event that they become incapacitated. He also recounts nature's way of restoring an upset ecological balance and how the remaining animals cope with their new-found freedom.Ish Williams, the main character, himself goes through a period of psychological angst, but as with some persons in any crisis, recovers his equilibrium. He sees and meets others who cannot, but eventually meets an equally resolute woman. The book then briefly, but viably, notes how mores change when society disintegrates.In a section entitled \"Quick Years\", the couple meet certain other adjusted persons who have adjusted to the \"Great Disaster\", as they call it, and a rudimentary \"tribe\", so-called, comes into being. A tight, fascinating study leaves the way clear for \"The Year 22\", the next chapter.It is interesting to note how the members retain traditional taboos, remember dates and holidays, and yet slowly return to a hunter-gatherer society. Organized learning is a natural casualty, to be replaced by superstition. Obviously, the ability to conjugate verbs becomes surplusage at such a time.The tribe learns to face disease, criminality, and tragedy. Religious tenets alter in each such society. One is left with the belief that man hasn't really learned very much by all of it. You learn that the most important thing to primitive man was the bow and arrow, and fire-making. Ish preserves these for future generations, along with a less credible democratic tradition. Even the language begins to change, as history marches on.I won't spoil it by giving the ending, but you won't forget it, any more than you will forget any of the details of this incredibly well thought out, impeccably written book.Even if, as with some reviewers, you cannot accept Stewart's approach or result, you will be forced to concede that, in addition to being a great storyteller, he is an incomparable, almost lyrical, wordsmith.I hated to see the book end.","Even Stephen King admits he based THE STAND on this interesting novel. I also recommend Doherty's AREA 51 series.","Considering all the raves, I was disappointed by Earth Abides. Although the premise was interesting, it never really went any place and kind of left me hanging. I thought the discussion of how man's departure from Earth affected other species was thought provoking and well done, but the rather dry writing style and lack of depth in the characters left me underwhelmed.","All i have to say is this book is sooooo gooood!","Allow me to digress for a minute. Has anyone ever seen the Bruce Willis movie The 12 Monkeys? Anyone besides me that is? I didn't think so. Back to the subject hand. The plot of Earth Abides is similar to that movie. A biological plague devastates the United States and the rest of the world. Isherwood, &quot;Ish&quot; Brown, comes across a dying man named Barlow. After Barlow's death, Brown's the last man on Earth. If I may digress again, it's also similar to the 1971 Charlton Heston movie &quot;The Omega Man.&quot; Ish sets out on a cross-country trek to preserve our culture. In Arkansas, he finds roads in disrepair, and forests reclaiming everything. That's all I'm telling you. If you want to find out &quot;the rest of the story,&quot; READ THIS BOOK!!!","I realize this is a 'classic' of science fiction, but I couldn't find it in me to really love it. It''s good, but sooo dated in many respects. And frankly, I never really connected with Ish, the main character. Still I am glad I read it, because of its enduring status.","I read Earth Abides in the sixties as a teenager, and it is one of the few books that stays with me through the years. A beautiful, haunting book.","Every fan of post-apocalyptic stories has his own reason for following the genre. Mine is, that I like to see what the author considers most important to life in this world. When civilization and human society collapse; when food, medicine, and basic comforts become scarce; when friends are few and family is imperiled, what values will prevail? Most of the classic novels of calamity portray survivors determined to carry on, forming communities which are insular and self-reliant; learning and developing the skills and collecting the resources essential to living in a new world. Earth Abides paints a somewhat different picture.Ish is much like the heroes of the other popular disaster stories, in that he is determined to carry on; and to recover, as much as possible, the advances of civilization which are in danger of disappearing with the loss of most of the human race. Ish finds himself the head of a community and extended family; and though he is strong, educated, and resourceful, he finds nothing but frustration in his efforts to pass on his values to the next generation. His children and grandchildren have little desire to produce goods for themselves, having become dependent on the things left behind by those who died from the plague. He is unable to inspire them with his vision for keeping the great accomplishments of humanity alive.Something unique about this story is the occasional vignette describing what happens to the world around Ish, now that the human race has essentially become an endangered species. If you've ever watched the History Channel's \"Life After People\", you'll get a sense of that here - and see how these things directly affect Ish and the other survivors.I'm discovering that those classic novels which I can read many times throughout my life, and which say something new to me each time (see my reviews of \"1984\" and \"Fahrenheit 451\"), are those in which I recognize the signs of true works of genius. This is only my first time reading \"Earth Abides\", but I already wonder what it will say to me in five years, or ten, as I raise my children, or lead kids in my community, and try to impart my own values and experience to them. Will I be able to pass on those things they need to survive, or will I find myself, like Ish, disappointed, or having to realign my expectations?An engaging read, with all the hallmarks of a true classic.","I have read and reread this novel many times over the years, and this was just one of many copies I have bought to share with friends. It is the easiest reading but most thought provoking apocalyptic novel I have ever had the pleasure of reading.","This book is an interesting read about the end of civilization and rebuilding...but honestly nothing really happened in this book. The whole book seems like a huge buildup to some epic conflict/event that is going to happen, but never does.Maybe it's just a sign of the times that today's reader expects action, I always have a hard time with books written in the 50's.","This great book addresses one of the age-old curiousities so many of us have: What would I do if one day suddenly I was all alone in a world wiped clean of almost every other person?Ish, the main character, is a non-descript every-day Joe who finds himself in just this scenario. There are a few other survivors along the way, eventually forming a \"tribe.\" They all have their flaws and eccentricities which makes the story all the more believable. If you plucked a random selection of humanity and put them on a desert island they wouldn't all be super heroes! They would bumble along and learn how to survive as best they could within their limited capabilities.It was the way in which the author wrote the book that made it so great for me. The little interjections within chapters describing the changes in the Earth away from the human plot were great, and they provided context and realism to the human story. The progression through the 60 some-odd years was expertly crafted by singling out the years with momentous turning points for more detail, and speeding through the fascinating \"quick years\" in between. The descent back to a stone-age type existance twists the emotions. Sad for one who is familiar with the conveniences and comforts of modernity, but understandably necessary for the new human condition.A great novel that is considered a classic of post AP for very good reason.","I thought it started a bit slow, but in time I was certainly hooked. The writing style seemed a bit formal but I grew used to it. I found it easy to forget while reading that the setting was decades ago, as I could easily envision it happening in these times.By the middle of the book I was considering it \"required reading\" and thinking of family members I could loan it to. It definitely gains steam as the story evolves. Loved the ending, both powerful and moving.I can see that Stephen King must have been inspired by several different portions of this book to write the Stand. I consider this one better. I would have liked maybe to see it longer, with more character development of the younger generations. I suppose 900 page novels were uncommon in the time it was written, so we are left with what it is. A great, and thought provoking novel.","This book should be considered right up there with the classics of the genre. It's a wonderful and complex narrative that pulls you in and slowly pulls you along. It's not action packed but it is a very realistic look at a future where mankind has suffered a terrible tragedy. Highly recommended!","In 10th grade we read a story that dealt with the end of the world in our English class. I was intrigued. As i spoke again of this story a year later my 11th grade english teacher suggested that i read \"Earth Abides\". I shrugged off the suggestion being as though it was from my teacher (one of the lesser evils in my life) and it wasn't untill later that year when i found it on the library shelf that i finnally picked it up and began to read. I managed to rack up over 30 dollars in library fines because i litterally refused to return the book to its rightfull home. After reading it straight through three times in a row, I began to keep it under my pillow. I would pull it out at night and open it up and read randomly wherever the pages led me. Earth Abides may just be the most inspiring book I have ever read. I am now a Senior in Highschool. I since have bought a copy of Earth abides to replace the library's copy so that i could keep the copy that i had grown so close to. It is not so much the story or the people in it that i have attached myself to. The understanding of human nature and the way we react to crisis, and the way we move through life never ceases to amaze me. As I prepare myself to go into a career in Pyschology Stewart continues to be a constant inspiration in my search towards understanding of human behavior and human emotions. Also I am inspired as a writer. I can only dream that someday i will be able to write as well as Stewart. To be able to convey my thoughts or create and develope a character as well as he does would be beyond my imagination. Earth Abides leaves one person in awe and leaves them dying to read more but afraid to turn over the last page, for fear of ending the story. A wise person once said that finishing a good book is like losing a close friend. This holds true in Earth Abides. Whenever i read that last page my best friend dies with a simple punctuation mark. But as the book continues to remind us, Men go and come, BUT, earth abides.","The characters in George R. Stewart's Earth Abides symbolize many biblical people.Isherwood, the main character, is referred to as Ish throughout the novel. \"Ish,\" however, can also be a shortened form of the name Ishmael. Ishmael was a biblical wanderer who allegedly founded the Islamic religion. In the first half of the book, Ish is a wanderer, venturing all over post-apocalyptic America, eventually settling down and founding a tribe.One of Ish and Em's children, Joseph (who is referred to as Joey), is representative of the biblical Joseph. He is very gifted intellectually, and has the ability to see the deeper meaning in any situation, much like the biblical Joseph's ability to interpret drams; unlike the biblical Joseph, however, his talent is squelched, when he is stricken with typhoid fever, and dies as a result.The mentally-handicapped Evie has a name similar to the Eve, and is nave, much like her biblical predecessor. Eve is targeted by the evil serpent, and is expelled from the Garden of Eden when she partakes of fruit from a forbidden tree. Similarly, Evie is targeted by Charlie, a greasy character who lusts after her and plans to take advantage of her innocence. Before actually seducing Evie, however, he is executed by the others in Ish's Tribe, for Evie's well-being. Likewise, the serpent from the Bible receives his comeuppance in the form of expulsion from Eden and being made to walk on his belly for the rest of eternity.Ish's wife, \"Emma,\" is referred to as Em throughout the novel. This also ties in biblically, for \"Em\" can be short for \"Emet,\" a name meaning \"Truth.\" Emma is characterized throughout the novel as a strong-willed individual who helps hold the Tribe together. After Joey's death from typhoid fever, Ish asks Em if there might be a God taking vengence for Charlie's execution. Em responds, \"If there is a God who made us and we did something wrong before his eyes... at least we did wrong only because we were as god made us, and I do not think that He should set traps.\" (258) She speaks her mind, and she speaks the truth.Ezra was a biblical prophet who chronicled the return of the Jews to Jerusalem after their expulsion by the Babylonians sixty years prior. Likewise, in the novel, Ezra speaks with great foresight-much like a prophet-and lives to observe the Tribe's rebuilding of civilization.These and other biblical parallels make Earth Abides one of the most symbolic modern-day books.","Earth Abides is a great book in general but among its genre its easily one of the best. If you enjoy post apocalypse fiction then this is a must read. No hesitation at a five star review.","Excellent book! I've owned a copy many years ago, and had to have another since my old copy was lost or stolen!!!","I, too, read this book 30-something years ago. What I remember most is the boy. I think he is Ish's son. He is the only one of the new generation to wonder how that dark box (the television) once worked. And he dies! I so wanted him to start figuring things out.","i have read the last ship alas babylon year zero footfall lucifers hammer this book was the best even though it was written long ago that is the most epic story MEN COME AND GO BUT EARTH ABIDES i read it 20 years ago and several times since","One of the most interesting books I've ever read. I wish he'd focused a little more on what happened in the rest of the world than the Tribe, but an amazing book all the same.","EARTH ABIDES by George R. Stewart is one of many books that take as its theme the destruction of mankind, leaving the Last Man on Earth as a narrator. THE PURPLE CLOUD by M.P. Sheil did much the same but Sheil's book was marred by excessive racism. Stewart's book is saved not only by the logical working out of the plot by its narrator-survivor, Isherwood, but also by Stewart's clever though subtle use of using Isherwood's slowly failing senses over many decades of post-apocalyptic adventures as a metaphor for the slow destruction of the American ideal of life.As the novel opens, the reader is told that the United States has been hit by a super-plague that has spread with lightning rapidity with near one hundred percent fatality. Ish, one of the very few survivors, passes by a abandoned car on the San Francisco bridge. This car is registered to a James P Robson of Oregon. This seemingly innocuous narration is later seen as the central metaphor of the book. Years later, Ish has several opportunities to pass the car in and out of San Francisco. Each time he does so, the car becomes somehow less distinct, a fuzziness that resonates first in his mind, then in the reader's mind. As the decades pass, Ish meets isolated pockets of survivors who have forgotten their American heritage. To these barbaric Mad Max types, Ish is the Last of the Americans. They tease him, they pinch him, they see him as a failed god type who could not deliver on the promises of the fabled technology of their legends. By the novel's end, he sees them pinching him, but he cannot feel them doing so. His senses have failed him just as America's technology had earlier failed to protect its population from the plague. Just before his death, Ish remembers the car on the bridge. Was it red? blue? green? Owned by Robson? Robinson? Robertson? He does not remember. But he feels sure that America has died, its technology has long since died, but its people live on, possibly learning from the mistakes of their predecessors, or maybe not. Stewart concludes his otherwise depressing work with a hint of optimism: \"Man may come and go, but earth abides.\"","I would have given this book fewer stars if I had been able to put it down. In spite of the stilted prose, odd inaccuracies, and generally bleak view of human nature, Earth Abides' end of the world scenario is completely gripping. There's none of the pseudo-mysticism of The Stand, just pure mid 20th century sci-fi goodness. Some of the scenarios Stewart presents aren't very subtle, and his views of women and blacks are what you might expect from 1949, but if you're at all interested in the &quot;what happens after a mysterious virus wipes out most of humanity&quot; scenario, Earth Abides is worth a read.","I bought this book and read it with the hope that it would be at least as good as Alas Babylon, one of my all time favorites. It was not. Earth Abides may have been the prototype of the collapse of civilization genre of Science Fiction but it has been outdone by so many other later books I hardly know where to start.To begin with, even the main character is very shallowly drawn and it goes downhill from there. You don't really care what happens to any of these people because the author does such a sketchy job of portraying them as having any of the qualities that we need to see in a literary figure in order to identify with them. This book is a science fiction version of The Grapes of Wrath without the character development. Be prepared for sexism, elitism, stupidity, lemming like fatalism and lack of preparation for any kind of civilized future. Also the author totally fails in most respects to know and understand how long canned food will last and how quickly you might be killed by scurvy living the lifestyle described in this book. Add in unrealistic pretexts for the characters doing what they do and you have a book that drags you into editor mode thinking how you could make it better.If you why I gave this book three stars when I disliked it so much, here is why It gets one of them for concept, the second for being the prototype of the genre and the third for having an interesting beginning. Where is really falls down is the ability to deliver on the initial promise. Books and movies for the most part succeed when they take an initial premise, however, far-fetched and then elaborate on that initial premise in a logical manner. After the initial suspension of disbelief this is how they suck you in. This book doesn't suck you in but actually loses you in contradictions, flimsy pretexts, and poor research with an ending that tails off in a whimper and left me whipping through the last several pages to get to the ending only to find that there was really no \"there\" there. Earth Abides gets credit for illustrating very convincingly the complex web of technical knowledge and individual job skills as well as motivations that keep our industrial society afloat but loses all the previous credit when it fails in a primal manner to explain why rational people who didn't really want to do a lot of work would makes life choices that initially and in the long run would mean a lot more work than the alternative choice that they didn't make. A low-tech lifestyle is a bundle of work compared to learning about and maintaining some of the elements of civilization. This is where I really fault the author as I believe that a lot of things including; the shelf life of canned goods, the back breaking labor of a hunter gatherer existence without even any horses, human craving for fresh food, and basic human emotions are ignored or glossed over in order to reach a contrived conclusion.","This a truly great book that everyone should read. Now to my experience with getting. I was looking for a reasonably priced hard back edition. This one said very good condition, in a price range I could live with. When I got the book I was happy with the condition until I found a bar code on the back cover which tore the cover getting it off. They should have specified that there was this sticker on the back cover. I like to keep my books and that is why I buy hard back. I was disappointed. Not only that but there was a sticker on side that read salvation army, $2.99. I really didn't care about the price difference but it showed me lack of concern by the seller which I do not appreciate. ruscolombo","I was really looking forward to reading this book as I have lately been going through a post-apocalyptic literature jag. After thoroughly enjoying \"On the Beach\", I purchased \"Earth Abides\". While \"On the Beach\" centers on humanity's ability to stay hopeful while facing the inevitable, I was confused by the intended message of \"Earth Abides\". The book's protagonist, Ish, likes to think of himself as the forward-thinking leader of a new civilization, but he comes across as more of an apathetic dreamer. In the twenty-plus years following a devastating plague, Ish and his companions evolve from foraging through supermarkets for food to....foraging through supermarkets for even older food. And I guess that is the really frustrating element of this book- in all that time no one has the foresight or gumption to make more than half-hearted attempts at creating some sort of self-sustaining community. The 'Gilligan's Island' crew did more in two years to create a society than this motley crew does in thirty!Kidding aside, I am sure that the author is making a statement about mankind that others have picked up on and that has apparently gone way over my head. I actually look forward to reading more learned reviews of the book to figure out what I missed.","I don't think I've never read another book like this, so I'm not sure how to describe it. Very slow paced, not a lot of character development. Not a lot of explanation about where everyone went, I just didn't think enough how and why questions were answered early on. Interesting, but I really found it easy to put down. I also found some of the main character Ish's point of view about non-whites curious, yet somewhat disturbing. As if that was the way people viewed each other in the late 40s, and quite obvious lack of communication/knowledge about each other. There are some very interesting plot twists in here, none of them gory where they could be. Seems as if Stewart withheld gruesome details to focus on Ish's response to a completely changed world (no complaints here). I just find this book hard to recommend, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading this either.","I read this book years ago, lost my copy and when I heard the old time radio adaptation I got another copy. My first reading I was waiting for the clashes with other survivers, the cannabiles trying to eat them, you name it. Now after many years and another reading I understand Ish and the other survivers better. People cling to what they know, what is familiar. So did Ish. He was a bookworm, maybe even a geekish type. He loved the Hills, being solitary, studying. He was even in a profession that may have regarded less educated people as stupid (highly skilled science/engineering types come to mind) He was the last person to be chosen to kickstart humanity, to lead it back to greatness. He had the courage to drive cross country,alone, but not to keep the children in school or to take the books from the library.I liken the little colony to an office load of people who have never had to face a deadline, a change of upper management, or a takeover. They plodded along doing things the way they always did until circumstance forced an issue- the water, the visitor, there own need to bring in new blood. Ish knew what needed to be done but he lacked the wherewithall to motivate the others. He was not the charasmatic leader found in later novels. Those by S.M. Sirling come to mind, or Alas Babylon! Ish held the colony together and prevented their complete loss of civilization. He enforced rule of law when necessary, and made hard decisions.As others have pointed out, this book will continue to be debated as long as there are two people who have read it and thought about it.","I read this book aeons ago when I was in high school - of course back then it was a lot heavier (chisled in stone). It's a great book - though a bit antiquated and an interesting twist on the post-apocalyptic genre. The symbol of the single jack hammer has stuck with me through the years to the point that I never pick up my one handed sledge in the garage without thinking of the story. If you've never read it, you are missing a real treat.","I first read this in college for an English class and it really caught my imagination. Overall, the basic plot line of the book is very interesting and thought provoking, though the writing is not what I would call first rate. I like the fact that the book focuses on the fate of civilization in the wake of an overwhelming catastrophe without resorting to the seemingly inevitable appearance of zombies or other un-dead as is the case in so many other post-apocalyptic stories. I also like that the story balances optimism and pessimism, rather than going totally pessimistic a la 'The Road'.","I won't quibble with the author about such things as the shelf life of gasoline. I found this novel an intriguing insight into the era in which I was born. The author draws conclusions about post-apocalyptic civilization that, while I find them disturbing, are certainly possible. He casts the role of the antagonist not as the greed, lechery, or lust for power among others outside his tribe. Rather, the antagonist is the lethargy of a group of survivors who live by scavenging and whose creative urges never develop as a result.Personally, I find that a depressing scenario...perhaps because I also see it as a possibility. The main character, even though the tribe considers him their leader, is cast as one who stands outside the group. Instead of directing their energy toward creativity, he continues to see himself as an academic...an observer. Inevitably, the \"tribe\" is reduced to being a combination of scavengers and hunter/gatherers. Mr. Stewart does a good job of chronicling this decline. I simply think he (and his protagonist) accept this fate too easily.This is a book review, however. It is not a social commentary. The novel, itself, is well written and very effective in its' message. It's a worthwhile read, even if only undertaken as a study of the Amercan culture during the time period in which it was written.","So good. The good beginning and the good ending more than make up for the sometimes-boring middle. The whole, of course, is poetic. The author intended that and he succeeded. And he succeeded in making a post-apocalyptic story that is not dystopian, as so many of these contemporary stories are, and moreover is actually hopeful and, in the end, optimistic. And Stewart is to be thanked for that, as much as for anything else he has done here. As others have said, the novel certainly is worth reading again and I will do so.","At first, I found it hard to get past what I considered the author's naivete. Afterall, 99% plus of the world's population dies out, but there are few bodies...a plague of rats with the same result...the streets, even within the population centers, are virtually clear of stranded vehicles, etc. But, then I realized, this book was not about personal survival, it was about the survival of knowledge. Armed with the world's knowledge and a fine brain, Ish is only able to bequeath to his survivors a hammer, archery skills and the ability to make fire without modern means...despite his best efforts. This scenario of lost knowledge is even more probable today with Wikipedia taking the place of public libraries for many of our youth. An anthropological masterpiece! A must read for those planning to rebuild civilization after its collapse. (It's hard to believe this was written in 1949)","Earth Abides is a 1949 science fiction novel by George R. Stewart. When a plague all but wipes out the human race, a young introverted intellectual decides to observe the way the world responds to the sudden removal of humans, and, later, works to reconstruct certain aspects of civilization while battling to keep education alive.This is a thoughtful book: one of Stewart's primary themes here is a philosophical take on civilization: its pros and cons, what is gained and lost through starting over, and whether parts or the whole are worth rebuilding. Stewart, with the world's last scholar as his main character, does a wonderful job with this.But while Earth Abides is all about ideas, Stewart mostly punts on the moral and theological ramifications, as his characters move on quickly when these themes present challenges. In a world where people can't help but focus on death, that's a missed opportunity.In addition to the book's philosophical emphasis, Stewart's post-apocalyptic world is generally free of unrest and violence. While this allows Stewart to focus on his themes of rebuilding, his characters are rarely in much peril, and there's never much suspense. Yet as Stewart charts the life of his protagonist through the years and decades, the reader becomes invested in and attached to the character, passive and powerless though he may be, and this is why the novel is compelling, and why the reader will not mind the book's many philosophical detours.On the whole, Earth Abides is an intelligent, poignant and melancholy novel, and one of the finer and more influential works in the genre. Bonus points for an interracial relationship during a hostile era.","\"At the funeral of Homo sapiens there will be few mourners.\"I loved this book. So many end-of-the-world tales center on violence, war, superhuman heroes and unrealistic resolutions. Earth Abides is unique. It follows the story of \"Ish\", a biologist who was busy doing research alone in the mountains of California when a virus swept around the planet wiping out all but a few members of the human species. Immune to the virus, possibly because of a well-timed snakebite, Ish proceeds to explore the empty world. He travels across the United States, returns to the west coast, and helps establish a small community with a handful of survivors.Earth Abides is special because it all seems so real and down-to-earth. Ish is a scientist who makes keen observations and comes up with brilliant solutions to problems. But he is always very human. The character never drifts in a formulaic larger-than-life hero who can save the day. I also like the realistic mix of survivors. No, they aren't all Mohawk-wearing rapists and murderers. No, they aren't all highly intelligent saviors of civilization. They are an assortment of people one might see walking down any sidewalk in any city. Some smart, some dumb; some nice, some not so nice.Earth Abides covers a lot of ground, stretching out many years beyond the disaster. It is fascinating to read the author's description of crumbling cities and vanishing highways. It reminded me of the fine nonfiction book, The Earth Without Us.This book was a pleasure to read and I highly recommend it.\"At least,\" he thought, \"life is quieter.\"\"Yes, a tribe is like a child. You can show it the way by which it should grow up, and perhaps you can direct it a little, but in the end the child will go his own way, and so will the tribe.\"\"Men go and come, but Earth abides.\"","Earth Abides is a great book. It has always been one of my favorites. George Steward makes it easy to put yourself in the situation of being the last man on earth. This is the kind of book that you will read over and over through the years.","After reading this book in a college Sci Fi class at Berkeley almost 20 years ago, it remains one of my all-time favorites of any genre. It is positively amazing that it is almost 50 years old because it reads so thoroughly modern and relevant. The story grabs you right from the outset and doesn't let up. What makes &quot;Earth Abides&quot; so special is that it can be read on many different levels. While reading it for the first time, I often had to peer out the window to make sure there were still people around! Don't miss this sure bet","As a fan of non-alien, post apocalyptic novels, I sometimes struggle to find truly good books to read. Well, Earth Abides is a truly GREAT book, and you will not regret this choice. The book is well-written and unforgettable. It was written in 1949, but wears its age well. I was even able to enjoy its social perspectives toward women and race. George Stewart, like Mark Twain in Huckleberry Finn, really struggles with the social beliefs of his time, and questions both racism and sexism without overpowering his remarkable story of survival.I'm an avid reader. I especially like realistic science fiction, but don't limit myself to the genre. I rank Earth Abides in the top 5 of ALL the books I have ever read.","Earth Abides, written in 1949, tells the story of the fall of civilization from deadly disease and its \"rebirth\". It is actually three books in one: the disintegration of the world, the establishment of a new collective culture, and the moral weights of leadership. I initially read it as a post-apocalyptic novel and was rewarded with a philosophical treatise on the loss of a way of life and the dangers of man oversimplifying himself. The development of the tiny band's subsequent generations is more terrifying than a plague wiping out the planet. It is a story of 'what man wrought' but not in the way one anticipates. Originally classified a \"science fiction\" novel, now, with time, it must be categorized as literature.","\"Between the plan and the fulfillment lies always the hazard. Between the plan and the fulfillment stands always the frail barrier of a human life\" - George R. StewartIsherwood \"Ish\" Williams is one of the last people on Earth! How will he survive, how can he go on?\"Earth Abides\" is a book that I have owned for quite awhile & a book that I have always planned to read next, but never did. Finally I read the book and I was not only thoroughly impressed, I was in awe of George R. Stewart's ideas about how it would all end and how we could possibly go on.I'm amazed at the amount of the poor reviews for this book, I think most people are expecting moreI Am Legendtype material. This book is not that at all, there is some violence, not alot, there are no zombies, only people & animals. Many reviewers state that Ish should have done this, he shouldn't have done that, forgetting that this masterpiece was written in 1949. The book is so far ahead of it's time, it's baffling to me how George R. Stewart came up with some of these things. Would it be much different it this novel was written today, well obviously yes.Stewart's theory of how each animal will thrive before it's numbers level off really made me think. The everyday things that you never give a second thought, Stewart brings them to the front and makes you think, what do we do now, how do we get past this?If you like to read post-apocalyptic novels, if you've readThe Roadand enjoyed it, read \"Earth Abides\"This is the road that no man finishes traveling. Men come and go, but Earth abides!Enjoy~","How anyone could rate this book poorly is beyond comprehension. This is a well written, fascinating study on human thought and action. As much a intellectual simulation as a study of the time and attitudes of that time in which it was written.","George Stewart's \"Earth Abides\" is a tale of the end of the world by way of a plague that handles the subject in a way much different that similar tales. More thoughtful, deliberate and slow than I expected. More than anything it is a look at how man's conquering of mother nature is temporary at best. Take away man, and the Earth's memory of man will be soon forgotten. At the same time, it deals with civilization - what are the fundamentals of civilization, what keeps people together, and what prompted the creation of tribes, religion, superstition, and war.Without question, I enjoyed this a lot. One of the better takes on a post-apocalyptic scenario I have read to date. No Mad Max BS, no metaphysical The Stand mumbo jumbo, no b-grade nonsense ala The Postman, just pure introspection regarding how mankind would move on, and more importantly, how the Earth would move along as if we were never thereMandatory reading.","Some interesting ideas explored in this novel, such as the true worth, or otherwise of what we today term 'education'. Stewart asks the reader to question the validity of many of our modern values upon which today's civilization is based as well as pointing out how swiftly these would erode in the aftermath of some holocast. I am not sure if Ish made the correct decision when he completely abandoned the school for the children. There was only the one chance to pass on the knowledge of reading and the communication value it holds, and once lost it would be gone for ever. Also, the future survival of 'The Tribe' would have benefited enormously if future generations had access to much of the knowledge contained in the library.Another interesting point was how &quot;The Tribe', or rather 4 of its members, so quickly decided on the death penalty for Charlie.There appeared to be a complete lack of any real emotions in any of the characters. This was particularly noticable at the start of the novel when Ish looses not only all his friends, but his family also. There seemed no grieving process, and although he was certainly sad at the loss of Joey and Em, I did not feel his pain.Stewart could have written a far longer novel without loosing my interest and much more could have been included. The 'Quick Years' passed too quickly for me and I could have handled a few more hundred pages without loosing interest.Altogether an excellent read. We are asked to question so much of what we today hold as important. He questions our complacency, which is always a good thing.","Do you know the joyous feeling you get when you just happen upon a book quite by accident, read just a few chapters of it, and realize that it will be of great signifiance to you? Well, that was my experience with this book! I can't believe that I was not introduced to this book before now. It is with some sadness that I just completed reading it.My degree of connection with the main character, Isherwood Williams (Ish), astounded me; therefore, I must admit that my reaction to this book is quite subjective. It as is though the author looked into my mind and wrote a book about me in a post-apocalyptic world, including my greatest virtues and worst vices. The descriptions of the thoughts, triumphs, failings, joys, and frustrations experienced by the main character are poignantly honest and real. Metaphorically, this story seems to describe, with regard to many things, my existence in this, our so-far non-apocalyptic, world. For example, I find that I constantly struggle to define what I think to be the appropriate balance of individuality and community/state in our world. If you are one who consciously ponders such things or pursues a study of philosophy, I believe that you will view this book as a masterpiece. It just made my top 10, that is sure.I feel that I have gained much in my reading of this book. Mostly, I come away from this reading experience with a renewed feeling of peace and a reassurance in myself and the human spirit. I will no longer, I think, become quite so frustrated with regard to certain things or people in this world.&quot;Am I happy? Yes, I am happy. Things are as they are, and I am part of them.&quot; - Jack, great grandson of Isherwood Williams (Ish), the Last American.","This really great fictional accounting, by G.R. Stewart, of what our future might be, remains my favorite of the genre. I've just reread it for perhaps the third or fourth time - with some years in between. And although just a little dated it retains the vitality of adventure, promise and hope within a story of global tragedy. Considering current media hype about a possible Bird Flu pandemic this is an enlightening and enjoyable reading experience.","George R. Stewart's &quot;Earth Abides&quot; was written in 1949, so of course there are some anachronisms that occasionally jolt the reader. The Giants play at the Polo Grounds and the Dodgers at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. There are no interstate highways and radios all have vacuum tubes.These minor historical curiosities aside, what truly amazes is the timeless of Stewart's story. How many science fiction novels from 1949 still rate the glowing reviews of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; you will find here? By comparison so many modern sci-fi stories are formulaic, written with short, choppy sentences, shallow characters, and action sequences ready made for transfer to the screen.Stewart's vision of the future, where education and especially reading, slowly fad away after an apocalypse applies more to today's world than that of his own. His characters have little ability to bring back the technological remnants of the dead world, and truly, if 99% of the people on the planet were to disappear how many of us have the skills to keep the power going, the water flowing, and automobiles running decades after the disaster? His characters adapt to their environment in the most natural way.In the nearly four decades I have been reading books this is one of a handful that has made a memorable impression and which I consistently continue to recommend.","When the protagonist entered the Bancroft library at the Univeristy of California, and the author described him handling the books and the care which was taken when he left, was so beautifly described I almost cried. Living in chaos but leaving in such a humanly way left a strong message of the power of books and libraries that needs to be an inhernt value to our culture.","It seems like this book was super-great when I first read it about 40 years ago. I haven't been able to forget it. I am excited to see it is in print again---but why was it ever out of print? It is timely, provocative and just plain great reading for any age.","I read the Earth Abides, after listening to a friend describe this story as one of the most impactful he had ever known. Several years later in the early 1980's, I stumbled across a slightly used copy in a bookstore. George Stewart tells a fascinating tale of a post apocolyptic vision staged in the East Bay section of the San Francisco Bay area. This story has stayed with me and endures as a valued set of images. The struggle to make sense of the horrific and nonsensical was intuitively accurate. The story revealed in human terms the everyday efforts of a small group of survivors, suddenly stranded and adrift. The beneficiaries of a hulking but hollow industrial infrastructure that no longer served those who remained and their succeeding generations. The unfolding &quot;descent&quot; of industriatized society as well as the marginalization of technology was at once fascinating and frightening. The ending left me stunned, yet wisened.","My 12 year old daughter is reading Alas, Babylon right now and was discussing the plot with me. I immediately remembered reading Earth Abides over 10 years ago and was wondering if it could still be found. Obviously, there are lots of fans. What a compelling story about the potential future of mankind. Should be required reading in school","I read this book when I was 12 or 13 years old (more than 30 years ago) and it had a lasting impact on me. I have long since forgotten most of the &quot;classics&quot; I have read but this story has stayed with me through the years. Friends think I'm nuts when I say things like &quot; as you yourself, Ish, well know!&quot; right out of the blue. I just stumbled across it at Amazon and immediately ordered it. I can't wait to read it again!","I first read this book about 20 years ago, it caught my eye because the opening date used in the book is my birthdate 12/22/47. Have read it many times since and it never fails to make me re evaluate my current situation and really look at what is important and what is not. This is a must read book for me at least once evey 18 months.","I read this book 10 or 20 years ago, and I still think about it nearly every week. Where would I choose to live? What would I try to save? I have even thought of making my own screenplay adaptation based on the book. If the author needs help or motivation, then please e-mail me!","Read this book when you're really depressed. You will realize that things are not all that bad. Earth Abides provides hope. Even if everything we hold dear, everything we assume to be permanent, everything human disappears, the dream will survive.This is not the metaphysical good v. evil crap of Stephen King, nor the bang-bang rootin' shootin' end of the world of the pulps, but a quiet look at what the world would be like if mankind silently slipped away.","This book was captivating, and exciting. It makes you think abou the fragility of life, and how quick things change. This should be read at least once in your life. Stewart was 40 years ahead of his time when he wrote this and you don't want to miss out on it.","To read this book for the first time, at 10 years of age, is to enter suddenly into the reality of the fragility of the material society into which we are submerged.How could everyone really die off like that? This was MY town! MY Bay Area! MY UC Berkeley campus playground! A major metropolis! Fascinated, I couldn't put the book down. Living in Oakland, Ca. in the late 60's, I avidly looked out the windows when traveling through the East Bay, striving to see that little pony, running and running and running.It was beyond my comprehension that a thing so large as the Bay Bridge, which my grandfather had had a hand in building, could fall apart! I had thought such a thing would take ages and ages to break, not just a generation.All it takes is an earthquake, a dash of sea salt and a virulent bug.","Despite its age and archaic language, Stewart's practical knowledge of nature makes this one of the best epoch-ending books ever written. Other stories reveal this knowledge but unfortunately, are out of print (Storm and Fire). You've probably read enough reviews to know what the story is about, but be prepared for some radical thinking compared to today's social standards. This was written when many words were compounded by hyphens. When you read of the tail-gate on the station-wagon, don't be shocked. We really wrote that way back in the late forties and fifties. His story reflects the way things were then, not now, so you'll likely find this story as alien as many future fiction stories. We really have evolved that much. Enjoy one of the great SF stories of all time. It certainly is my favorite.","This book is a &quot;must read&quot; for those of us living in Northern and Central California. His descripitons bring the story home. I have assigned this book to students for extra reading. I believe it should be assigned reading in our local high schools.","While the first half of the book is OK, the second half drags. There were lots of places in the second half where more detail would have helped, instead the narrative became choppy and incomplete.","This review is only of the Kindle edition not the book. There are too many typos and editing problems in the Kindle version. Stick with a hard copy.","After I picked this up I realized I read this book a long time ago. Because the time setting is over 60 years ago some of the language and terminology has passed into disuse but, what would you expect? Entertaining and thought provoking.","I read this book about 35 years ago as a paperback and just decided to read it again as a Kindle edition. I liked it much more when I read it as a teen, now in my 50's it seemed kind of slow. It's not one of those books you read over and over again.","I first read this book as a senior in high school, and it's stayed with me all this time. Some typos and poor editing in this edition, but the story is worth reading and sharing with friends.","From start to finish, the book was entertaining if not thought provoking. I enjoyed the the perspective of the main character throughout the book and each encounter. He was much more relatable than most protagonists in the genre. I recommend this book to anyone looking in the survival / post-apocalyptic genre.","For the year written, it seemed ahead of it's time. It does not compare to &#34;Alas, Babylon&#34;. At one point I put it aside and read another book. Though, as the principal aged, his thought's and actions, were first class.","Warning before you read, no cannibals or massacres are devices used in this novel. It is a thinking man's teotwawki! I totally enjoyed sharing the thoughts of this quiet man who watched his world rebuild. Great balance for all the survivalist info I glean from all my other beloved shtf reads!","Starts off great, slows down too much in the middle but finishes well. If you are looking for a Robinson Crusoe post-apocalyptic type read this is not for you. Nothing like \"The Stand\". All the characters are at best low end of average and manage to accomplish very little over the 42 year span of the book. Somehow, I liked that about the book. The writer gets a little too esoteric though. Still, one of the better reads I have had this year. Written in 1949 and I got a hoot out of picking the small things that dated the book. Everybody smoking is an example.","A thoughtful examination of the slow collapse of civilization in the lives of a small band of survivors brought together by one man who remains their leader until old age. In general, four stars, in science fiction genre alone, five stars.","George Stewart has crafted a science fiction tale that stands up fairly well to the test of time. Although it was first published in 1949, the language and ideas are still immediately relevant today. What would happen to you if civilization fell apart? How would you survive? How would people treat each other?The tale unfolds gradually, without suspense. For me, this was not quite the memorable novel that the highlighted reviewers described. I read the whole thing, but I could have easily put it down halfway through, since I did not develop a deep emotional attachment to the story or its characters. The novel is told in the third person, but through the eyes of Ish, the main character. This unusual point of view puts the reader at a distance. I didn't feel that I really knew any of the characters in the book, except for Ish.Ish has a bland personality. He is one who accepts his lot in life, even his lot in death. As the workings of civilization fail, he notes their passing. In the end, he does little to oppose his tribe's drift back into the stone age. This engendered my main disappointment with the novel. Why did the author make the protagonist so weak? There have been great novels fashioned out of weak characters, but ultimately I did not find greatness in this book. It is well written, but it did not fulfill my expectations.","This isn't badly written but, it didn't hold my interest like a really good Sci-fi book will do. It has a good story line but, the characters lack personality. It is interesting to read a book that was written as Science Fiction years ago.Earth Abides","Given a copy of \"Earth Abides\" in 1976 while stationed in Atsugi JA. This novel takes a single premise and projects the \"what if\" to a very logical and believable conclusion. I have read this novel three times since, each time obtaining a different prespective on the way human nature molds our life's decisions. Ranks with 20,000 leagues u/sea, The Time Machine and other SF stories that will stay within your mind years after the final page has been turned. One of the very few works of fiction that I recommend to friends - if you're searching for a believable work of science fiction \"Earth Abides\" will exceed your expectations.","I liked this book, its a very good view on what things could be like for the few survivors of a near species-ending pandemic. Written some time ago it does tend to be dated, but not annoyingly so. I knocked off a star due to the fact that it is somewhat navel-gazing in its execution. There's alot of deep thinking going on by the main character. Given all of this, its still worth a read and will IMO promote some thinking of your own.","The story of a world decimated by a fast-moving plague, Earth Abides follows the life of Isherwood, a 29-year-old loner who, while camping, suffers a rattlesnake bite that saves his life. After recovering from the snakebite (and other symptoms), he makes his way back to the San Francisco Bay area, where he finds his parents gone and the city deserted. Indeed, only a few people remain after the scourge that killed millions.Written in 1949, Earth Abides is a philosophical sci fi classic--it takes place before rock and roll, before microwaves, and way before computers. As Ish bands together with a few survivors to found a new civilization, he must decide what is important to keep from the Old Times, and what can be abandoned. The charm of Earth Abides is that it is as much a portrait of the mid-20th century as it is a futuristic fiction. It is the story of the last Americans.","The first scifi i ever read. Published , i believe, in 1949,the language is still current and still moving. Love a book that makes me think about the end of the world...","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it. This maturity is perceptible all along this work.The story is situated in a world devastated by a sudden pestilence that annihilates most of humankind. Taking into account the last SARS epidemic that jumped abruptly from China to Canada it doesn't look an impossible scenario.This is the story.Isherwood Williams comes down from an isolate spot in the mountains to discover an empty world. He starts searching for survivors all across USA, from California to New York and back again. He finds only isolate human cells, couples or trios, overwhelmed by catastrophe and in a near catatonic state.Returns to his native town and contemplate with a certain scientific detachment the fading world around him.Mr. Stewart intercalate brief vignettes describing what happens to dogs, cats, cattle, plants, roads, dams and bridges, contrasting them with Ish's daily experiences.Little by little the story grip reader's attention and even if action is somehow slow, the book can't be put down.As the story goes on human cells began to draw near each other, grouping and interacting again. A rather feeble structure starts growing up.The author approaches universal questions about survival and extinction; civilization and savagery; social structure and anomie. He also examines religious values, ethics and life's ultimate sense.This book gives the reader a lot of stuff to think about. A very enticing read!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","In this profound ecological fable, a mysterious plague has destroyed the vast majority of the human race. Isherwood Williams, one of the few survivors, returns from a wilderness field trip to discover that civilization has vanished during his absence. Eventually he returns to San Francisco and encounters a female survivor who becomes his wife. Around them and their children a small community develops, living like their pioneer ancestors and gradually returning to a simpler way of life. It may seem odd to say that a book in which the majority of the world's inhabitants die is life-affirming and spiritual, but I'm going to say it anyway. I have read this book again and again over the years, and each time I come away from it with a deep feeling of peacefulness and confidence in the power of Mother Earth.","I have been a fan of PA fiction for over 30 years. My first PA novel was the children's novel \"Beyond the Dark River\" by Monica Hughes - a novel which I read when I was eleven. It hooked me on PA fiction and ever since then I have been trying to find as many novels or movies that I could get my hands on.I had read good things about Earth Abides online and was looking forward to reading it. Can I say how disappointed I was? Perhaps it was the era in which it was written, but all I could think of throughout the book is that the new civilization would have been much better off without the pompous a$$ of the main character Ish. \"They thought of me as a God.\" Good grief!If I could have rated this movie a zero I would have. Take this one out of the library if you must, you'll be glad that you didn't waste your money on it.","Even if Stephen King did base THE STAND on this book, he takes the idea of a world-wide plague and develops it much better than Stewart. I understand that EARTH ABIDES was written in the forties, but the stilted style of writing used and the attitudes and world view of Stewart's main characters are so jarringly anchronistic that I could never forget I was reading a book --- it never transported me into the world that the writer was trying to create. The italized asides within the chapter explaining what was happening elsewhere (i.e., lice, cats, ants, etc.) were interesting but not enough to save the book as a whole. LUCIFER'S HAMMER, WAR DAY, or THE STAND are all much better &quot;end of the world&quot; type books","It's been awhile since I read this book, but what I remember about this book is that it insults you and basically says that if you haven't gone to college and grad school that you cannot be intelligent or sire intelligent children. The author writes this book about the one truly intellegent person left alive. He portrays the rest of the survivors, who are average non-college educated, blue collar types, as little more than simpletons. The main character and the author doesn't even try to have the survivors learn to use the left over technology to help better their situation because they are too dumb. When they reproduce only Ish sires an intellegent child. The rest of the chilren are all dumb like their parents. Bah, that's it. My hatred for this book is off my chest. I don't reccommend it.","Having loved this story 20 years ago as a teenager, it pains me now to find that it is surely the most badly written book on my bookshelves. All the characters are two-dimensional. The dialogue is uniformly stiff and amateurish. Worse, there's a faintly fascist tone running throughout the entire story that I failed to notice as a callow youth, but that now reveals itself on almost every page. Perhaps the saddest aspect of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that the story is clearly and shockingly the fantasy of an author who was very probably an insecure misfit who dreamed of existing in a world without people, or at least with just a handful of simple folks over whom he could rule as their intellectual master. If Stewart had spent some time in analysis, &quot;Earth Abides&quot; might never have been written. It is a truly awful book.","Plot Kernel - A deadly virus has nearly annihilated the human race, leaving all other life untouched. Civilization has ended. A survivor searches for others and eventually joins with a woman who lost her family in the epidemic. In time, he becomes the leader of a few families who have intermarried and who together live off the abundant supply source of the otherwise uninhabited city.","I love post-apocalypse fiction, but I can't figure out why everyone likes this one. The first 1/3rd of the book is great, as the main character experiences what becomes of his world after everyone else dies. Then it's as if the last half of the book was written by a female. It's mostly introspective, about how the character feels, and nothing really happens. If you want a page turner from front to back, read 'Alas Babylon','One Second After', or 'Without Warning'. I would donate this book to my local library, but I would feel guilty knowing some poor guy might pick this up and waste as much time on it as I did.","Great story of what would happen if a lazy / self proclaimed intellect survived the human apocalypse. Ish may have let thousands of years of basic knowledge disappear without getting off his highchair for a second. But, in the end at least \"Jingle Bells \" survived his incompetence and carried on.","I was very excited when I received this book, because I had read great reviews about it. However, it did not hold up to my expectations. The first two thirds of the story consist of the main character driving back and forth across the country looking for survivors (that is as far as I made it- leisure reading should not have to be a chore). When he does encounter survivors, he only stays for a brief time to visit with them and moves on. That is it. There are no conflicts. There is no tension or threat from others or nature. No plot. He simply drives back and forth looking for people, discovers them, and then moves on. I have never read anything more boring, not even required readings for courses I have taken. Perhaps this book was the first of its kind when it came out, and that may be why it has such acclaim, but the storyline is nonexistent. On the up side it does have some very well written descriptions of the land and animals (that is the only good thing I can say about this book).","Wordy, verbose, unrealistic. Meeting around a table with the woman who eventually gives him children, written like a bad female romance novel.Emotionally mature hunter-gatherers evolve from his haphazardly raised progeny. Unrealistic ending, which was a slog to get to.","If you are easily depressed or get melancholy, do not read this book. If the thought of the human race dying out and mother earth thriving gives you the warm fuzzies, then this book is for you. After the major opening disease-kill tragedy there's *some* hope for man... then less hope for man... then a little more hope for man... then a *lot* less hope, and on, and on. It's an emotional roller coaster that, on average, only looses altitude. In the end, earth wins, man looses. I had 100 pages remaining to read and finally had to flip to the last page so. I. could. just. &quot;end it&quot;. Yuk. Two weeks later I still have a bitter taste in my mind. If you like sci-fi's such as &quot;ender's game&quot; I predict you'll hate this book too. My hope here is that I've saved somebody else the pain.","Great book. I really enjoy apocalyptic fiction. I have read a lot of it and this one has got to be towards the top of my list.This book takes on more of an human approach to the end of the world. There is not a great deal of action but the pace does not get sluggish. Unlike most end of the world fiction this one has a much broader scope and looks at the future of a \"Tribe\" of survivors instead of just the main character. Plus in most of these type of stories there is one main challenge and once that is defeated the story ends and that is all. Not at all the case with Earth Abides.The best part of the book for me was the 2nd half. There is a heart touching story of the main character and his son. Since I can't give away any spoilers it is hard to say what I like about the end other than the way the book hints at what life has become but only through glimpses of the main character.The reason I didn't give it five stars was the length. While it never drags it could have had some parts cut out and not effected the book at all. In fact, more than once I read something went to the next page and read such a similar page that I went back to make sure I had really turned the page. It only happened three times tops but still you start noticing that there could have been some trimming done.Great book, cheap book, fun read.","One of the origional Apotholyptic tales. Since this is probably how it will all end, it is internesting to see the authors views on environmental \"take back\" from humans. Good read, young or old.","I read some of the rave reviews by others which made me decide to order this book. Of the end of the world genre, I would say this rates near the bottom.I guess what annoyed me the most was how far off the author was to guessing how the world would decay... I'll list a few examples and let you decide for yourselves.1. The rate of decay of everything was grossly exagerated. Rail lines reduced to nothing but a pile of rusty chips in only 30-40 years? Entire houses rotting away and completely gone in just 10-15 years? Huge dams rotting and breaking after only 5 years? Very silly scientific assumptions.2. The lack of doing anything worthwhile for a so called smart man. He can only teach just one child to read? Doing basically nothing to improve his life over the course of 40 years?3. He comletely underestimated human will. The children in the tribe lacked any kind of basic intelligence. The author probably never had kids and assumed they are stupid without a formal education.You know what, this isn't even worth my time to continue listing all the flaws. Trust me, spend your time watching one of the recent Discovery Channel episodes on the end of the world without man, it would be much more compelling then this book.","I just finished this book, and I have to say it was interesting but nothing really special. I read The Stand many years ago, and loved it, although it was extremely unrealistic. Earth Abides has the realism, but it overdoes realism, without too much excitement. Basically if you have some time and want a quick read, pick this novel up, but if you are looking for a spectacular sci-fi or post apocolyptic book you are better off picking up another novel.","This tale of the apocalyse is very thorough in its examination of all of the changes in the ecosystem if man were to disappear from the earth. The first half of this book is a real page turner as the main character travels the countryside to discover what has become of the great cities of the U.S. after most of the human race has been wiped out by a deadly disease. Unfortunately, the second half of the book sinks into mediocrity as Ish's small band of survivors shun the \"old ways\" in favor of a return to illiteracy and primative life, which makes the second half kind of not belieavable. Christians [should] be offended that the author has absolutely no respect for and even argues against the existence of God in this book. Nevertheless this is a great book and worth the time and money.","The Greatest Book I've Ever ReadIn the book Earth Abide, By George R. Stewart thesubject at hand throughout the book is the survival of man. Thisbook takes place in San Francisco California where a vast plaguehas almost wiped out all of the Homo-Sapiens. This book followsthe life and times of one man (Isherwood)and his struggles to rrebuild his past American life. This is very heart warming thatour culture would last to the breaking point of our species. Ihope you all feel the same.Isherwood starts out in the mountains on a school studytrip. This is when he became sick from a rattle snake bite. Hereeven before the plague he had to struggle for his life. \"I justhave to cut the bite holes and extract the poison,(Stewart 12).This characteristic shows that he is a survivor and foreshadowshis success aaginst the plague.He also in many other ways begins to stabilize hissurvival iin this book. He ensures safety by meeting othersurvivors and creating a tribe. He tries to edjucate their youthwith their past culture, but loses the young ones to moreexciting activities. He even tries to better the adults, but hefaces complete anguish because not a single person cares. \"Nothanks, were going to play with the bulls, and go dodgin,(Stewart 44).Isherwood thorugh much heart ache and disappointment,goes for one last hurrah to save his people. He teaches his twomiddle aged boys to drive, and sends them in a cross countrysearch of survivors. When they return, it was to no avail. Theygave up and found no one worth finding. Ish is lost agian tothis new world.This is a reamarkable book that is one so captivating iscauses internal turmoil in yourself. By reading of a quitepossible tradgedy, it makes life much sweeter. Also by seeinganother man struggle so hard for all that we stand for isinspiring. Even though Ish couldn't accomplish what he wantedit's good to see he had a moment of clarity at the end of hislife. For then he realized how the only constant is change, andthat Earth Abides.","This book Earth Abides by George R. Stewart is about a man who passes by a massive disease which basically obliterates the US. This man, Ish, has to come to realization of this huge crisis and try to find survivors. It goes on and on about his thoughts and shows the struggles that he faces it the horrid situation. He goes around america finding survivors and ends up making a huge family in the end.This book was basically boring and depressing because it was just lagging on and on about how he thought of everything. It made you want to fall fast asleep at times too. (something that i obviously did) I am one of those kind of people who likes adventure and this book had none. It just was one of those books that wanted to show how horrible things could happen to us if we don't watch it. It sort of chilling and makes you depressed to think that it could happen. George R. Stewart was probably giving a good message out when he wrote this, but in the sense that people want to live there lives without this catastrophe, it is not very good.I would not recommend this book to kids under the age of 12 because it probably is too advanced for them. Also because kids do not have to worry about this sort of horror happening to them at that young of an age. People who need to sleep at night and want to fall asleep fast, please read. If you like adventure and mystery in a book, please go find a different book.","The book held great promise in the first few dozen pages... a believable plague and a believable reason for the protagonist to have survived. It goes rapidly downhill from there. The lead character, Ish, is pompous, self-absorbed, grating, and oh so very tedious. Even giving credit to the fact that the book was written in 1949, there are some very basic errors. Canned goods don't remain safe after 20 years, nor does gasoline remain usable. I kept reading hoping that the book would go somewhere, but it really never did. If you must download this book to your Kindle, do yourself a favor and pull down the sample. Read it, enjoy it, and move on. There's NOTHING more there. If you persist, don't say that I didn't warn you.","2 stars for the \"human\" emotional experience but the book lacked excitement and was mostly dull and depressing. The year of the rats, grasshoppers, etc. How original - not. The only thing the people did was marry more than one wife and breed. No one learned from \"George\" on how to keep the plumbing and houses in good order. No formal schools were set up so everyone learned to read so civilization could rebuild itself. They talked and made plans but never followed though.Ironic their small group refused to breed with a pretty but dim witted female because they didn't want dim witted children yet in terms of learning, each successive generation became dumber anyway. The author must like caveman because his little \"tribe\" is rapidly devolving into that era.","Many of the rave reviews for Stewart's post-apocalyptic novel are by readers who first read it many years ago. After prodding from a trusted reader-friend, I read it last month for the first time. Our hero, Ish, is uninspiring, and the other characters are wooden. Although the premise is a clever one, and many of the events that occur are unexpected and therefore interesting, it's difficult to get caught up in this story of mankind's fate after a disease wipes out most of humanity.Everything in the novel occurs within one man's lifespan, and it is therefore not surprising that Stewart exaggerates character traits so that mankind will swiftly evolve. But the characters are so unenlightened - Ish is the only one interested in teaching children to read, and he gives up after a while - that it's hard to take seriously Ish's assurance (to himself?) that these are average Americans.In short, an interesting concept but flawed in the execution.","This classic book reminds us how greatly our civilization affects our surroundings yet how temporary and insignificant we are in this world.Mr. Stewart has written a book that keeps pressure on the reader to think introspectively. The style is easy to read and allows such personal thoughts to mingle with the words being read.","If seen only as an example of early writing in this genre - mankind after the apocalypse - this should be taken as an acceptable novel as compared to later attempts in the same vein. The characters don't really develop and just seem to stumble along without learning how to cope beyond what they knew &#34;before&#34;, which makes for a somewhat plodding read.","There are plenty of other reviews that go more in-depth as to why this book is amazing at the top of the list, but i just wanted to contribute to its stats, and give you my .02$Its memorable to the core, i read it almost a year ago now, and have read a decent handful of post-apocalyptic fiction between now and then, and this one really stands out in my mind.From the very beginning it was gripping, and only got better. It didn't focus on the die-off, but on the aftermath, and how it affected the environment, wildlife, and the anthropological ramifications.Once he does meet up with fellow survivors, there's no great battles with cannibals, not even starvation, but just life. The book really gets down to the core of what it is to be human, and what is important, and how different types of people have different priorities, and how these different ways of thinking would affect the rebuilding of human society in a near extinction level event.It both gives you hope, then rips it away, and makes you question what is really important in life. It makes you wonder if the way of life we are living in our modern world is natural, or a freak coinsurance. perhaps it would happen again if somebody hit the &#34;reset&#34; switch.","A bit dated, but a good read nontheless. Some parts are very wrong (such as gasoline, tires, and batteries for a jeep keeping so long, or that all of the stores of weapons and ammunition back when it was written (M1 garands, M1 carbines, 1911s, and all of the civilian models) not being available after the military and most people are gone. But still very imaginative and well written.","This was a real change for me, which I was looking for in a book at the moment. Not an &#34;action&#34; book, but still holds you spellbound at times, and often I couldn't put it down. It had it's slow areas, but not enough to distract from the total experience. A thought provoking story from the 40's I believe - but you will find yourself thinking about things in every day life a little differently. Definitely a good read!","I found this book to be amazing. It is a very detailed -- at times almost too realistic -- depiction of life after an apocalypse. I found Stewart's handling of societal changes quite believable, and more sophisticated than many more modern works. He also does a great job drawing characters that we can believe.I read somewhere that the author was shocked that this is still on the top of many \"The Best of Science Fiction\" lists. Since he set out to write a literary adventure story, and not science fiction. So be it.Whatever you call it, though, it is riveting.","It led the way for so many great apocalyptic yarns, and was influential in literature and in creating an awareness if the fragility of society. Isherwood was a paradigm for most civilized men. He was content to observe life, and was only dragged into life by his wife. When society fell, he calmly observed the fall of civilization, along with it. He dreamt of rescuing civilization...but settled for surviving on it's leftovers.I wonder how many preppers read this in their formative years.","I have read this book several times and it is a timeless classic. It leaves you feeling what the main character would feel under the scenario that this book was created.The World Without Us","The latest post-apocalyptic fiction seems to focus on dealing with deadly infected persons. What if they just all died and a small group had to start over. This book focuses on a main character who is more human than the supermen of modern apocalypse, he's not an ex-special forces operative with pre-med and a welders certificate who grew up on a farm. He's a little lazy, has some relationship issues, a mediocre teacher and in the end is just a normal guy dealing with population events.","A very original and unique plot, particularly given that it was written in 1949, makes this book a great read and not to be missed for fans of the post-apocalyptic sci-fi genre. Most every book since written in this genre borrows elements from this book. The pace of the story moves well and there are many sub-plots which are interesting (in particular, the main character makes frequent introspective observations that are thought-provoking about humankind). Of particular note is how relevant the book is today, over 60 years after it was written.My main negative critique is the general prose and writing style. It is impossible to believe that the author was an English professor... very basic sentence structures, little in the way of character development, and a ridiculous over-usage of exclamatory statements from the novel's characters (literally hundreds of exclamation marks throughout the book). The Kindle version had a number of typos as well.Still a worthy four-star book given its deep and compelling observations on humankind and a very clever and original plot.","I read this book about 15 years ago and had completely forgotten its name, but this book kept coming back to my mind over the years and I had to search and rediscover this book. What made this book to stay alive in my mind were my own thoughts and ideas that I have developed during the years about how civilizations grow and develop trends like religions, life styles etc.The central character of this story, Ish was an ordinary man before the plague that wiped out the whole world. In the new civilization, he, oblivious to himself, started assuming the role of a leader. The civilization, against his own wishes, started looking up at him as their spiritual leader.Most of the story is made up of his reflections and ambitions for the new civilization. He intended the new civilization to be based on the old one, taking advantage of the technological developments already in place. But, the civilization chooses to follow its natural progression and he found everyone around him to be very comfortable with the barbarian way of life.It is a thought provoking book. Must read for anyone who is a thinker !","This was one of the early end of the world novels where the survivors try to restart society. Though there is a lot of scientific inaccuracies, what makes this book great are the characters. If you liked Stephen King's The Stand which also had great characters, then you should like this one.The main character is Ish. Ish seems to be someone that we all strive to be. Caring and smart. Ish also, has the son that we all wish our children would be like. Ish's son is the smartest of all the children and he simply idolizes Ish.Ish uses a hammer (a basic, I guess Stanely model) as his symbol of power (or his sceptre) over the survivors. Undoubtedly, the hammer is to pass to Ish's son when Ish dies.The big project for the survivors is to get an old automobilie repaired enough to explore other lands and try to find other bands of survivors and get civilization back on its feet. I don't want to give the rest of the plot away only to say that this project turns out to be a big mistake.","A brilliatnly written socio-sic-fi. Though the book is a bit austere for the scope fo the catastrophe, it is truly a wonderful tome! Like the later work of Stpehn King's The Stand, Earth Abides explores the questions and illustrates the harrowing reality that might be if a \"super\" disease were to kill most of man-kind.Thought provking and beautifully crafted.","Earth Abides, a novel by George R. Stewart, is an excellent novel that depicts a possible scenario for a post-apocalyptic world. It provides people with a fantasy realm with questions of what could happen and what will happen all through the eyes of the novel's main character, Ish. He joins up with a couple of survivors in what he sees fit for the new world and they create a society that tries to cope with it. George Stewart further enriches the story with character chemistry and strong elements of theme.Themes of survival and love are strongly present throughout the novel. Ish's strong will to contain the community he had once known pushes him to survive so he can teach the next generation of what good can become of it. His relation to Em also draws out the love and caring in Ish.George Stewart uses chemical equations between characters to draw an exact importance of each person in their society. He chooses a man named George who is a carpenter to build and repair homes. He has a friend named Ezra, who acts as an advisor to Ish. They all piece together to form Ish's envision of a good society.The topic that concerns Ish the most is the community he had once known. Ish, who is trying to inflict positive change in society, is cursed with the inability to change himself.Throughout the book, he learns to trust his society and the future, which is dependent on him to lead them. He learns of the differences between the two generations and tries to blend in. He goes through many experiments, which has led in to some disaster and many good.Earth Abides is a great novel about the fantasy and high possibility of a post apocalyptic world. The characters and themes in the novel are beautifully inscribed drawing an essence of drama and suspense into an already stone set feeling of both feelings. Reprising themes of love, survival and many other themes are present to enrich the story. Earth Abides, a novel by George R. Stewart, is a novel I'd recommend to anyone who is interested in character chemistry and the post-apocalyptic ideology of George R. Stewart.","Societies Rise and Decline but the Earth Abides In the classic apocalyptic novel Earth Abides George R. Stewart creates a nightmare on earth that could occur tomorrow when a massive unknown epidemic obliterates almost all of society. A young man named Ish is forced to search for companions on this barren, naked earth void of human life. He searches for sensible people to aid him in his quest for survival and mental sanity. Em is the person who keeps Ish sane and through her love and courage helps him to face the future. Together they find a group of companions, and together they establish a tribe in the Berkeley Hills in the Bay Area. George Stewart1s powerful and realistic writing captivates the reader and makes one imagine how each of us would react in Ish1s situation. Even though his novel gets rather slow in the middle with few dramatic events adding to the plot, Stewart demonstrates the harsh situations and triumphs of life this small nucleus of mankind must face without modern society. Stewart1s writing fascinates the reader by exploring the actions of the offspring of the original seven tribe members and shows how people develops without modern society and all its conveniences. Stewart shows how all-human societies have come about, by tracing the development of this small tribe that survives a cataclysmic disaster. In the novel Stewart puts Ish and the tribe through many difficult trials as they struggle to survive. He is able to create an almost unimaginable situation and turn it into a reality. Each character is developed so well that the reader is able to experience the events. Ish1s leadership is strengthened by Em1s courage and Ezra1s loyal friendship. Because the reader can relate to these believable characters in this unbelievable situation, it is easier for the author to relate his point. Stewart fascinates the reader by showing how man develops with all his customs and superstitions and without a modern society. While reading about the tribe1s triumphs and failures we are able to step back from the modern world and see how civilization perhaps developed. The author examines the growth and characteristics of individual characters. What each of them bring to enable this tribe to survive, show how a society begins and flourishes. Em brings her courage, Ish brings his knowledge and his leadership, George is the carpenter and so on. Each member of the tribe contributed to the betterment of the whole society. Then at that point we are able to see the growth of society again, as if it was cut out from man1s actual past history, when ancient tribes started to develop. . At first the challenges are just simple, to fulfil the basic necessities of survival like shelter, water and food. Once these needs have been fulfilled, the tribe progresses to larger concerns such as education of the younger generations, keeping records and calendars, rules and exploration. Eventually the tribe integrates with outside members sometimes successfully, sometimes not. For instance when Charley comes back with the Robert and Richard he brings disease and chaos to the tribe. The tribe had the difficult decision of banishing him or killing him to protect their way of life. Many of them, including Joey who was the hope for the future as a leader because of his intelligence, die because of this outside influence. Later however the tribe successfully mingles with another tribe, which helps their society grow because there are more possibilities for men and women to find mates in a larger society.All through the novel Stewart accurately demonstrates the development of a simplistic society with all its triumphs and failures, to symbolize the history of human development. He is able to show that future societies would develop as past societies have as long as basic human needs are met. When people have food, shelter and more importantly significant human relationships then a society can begin. The society that Stewart creates starts with two people who found each other in the midst of chaos. They unite with others with whom they are compatible and from this small group a multi generation society formed. In his lifetime Ish saw a society develop. He saw his children and grand children and great grand children living happily. Through Ish1s eyes, the author masterfully shows all of us how societies rise and decline but how through it all the earth itself abides. Stewart in this famous apocalyptic novel captures the reader and artfully demonstrates the nature of human societies.","This book is one of the most moving and realistic surival novels that I have ever read, the suceive plauges of Domsicated animals and pests for one, and the point that the most brilliant minds of of western, and Gobal Civilization would break under the strain of the end of civilization seems all to true. Though the very end of the book was depressing(as San Fransico burns, and the Part about the new Human tribes) but even though civilization is pushed under, it is suggested that it will rise again in the far future though as we watch civilization unravil as Isherwood tries to pick up the peices is heart breaking, his attempt at a school is sad and the way that he finally breaks under the strain of being remembered as a god. This is a great classic of Sf Read this book!!","It really made me think about the sensativity of the planet and society of every day life.","Earth Abides is a great book for the reader new to the science fiction genre. Isherwood and Em are strong characters. The building of a new society is intriguing. I read this book over 25 years ago and I still remember it fondly as my introduction into science fiction books.","I have read and re-read this book over the years. It is riveting, entertaining and more than likely prophetic. The bomb that may destroy us all is the one we can not defend against, the incurable, quick-acting and all powerful virus. A nuclear Dooms-Day could not be more horrifying.","The well conceived story captures the imagination from the start. That's why we buy books like this...right? The intellectual and forward looking main character reminded me of the captain in &quot;The Last Ship&quot;. Read it!","This book is way ahead of it's time in exploring the way mankind can be taken down by virtue of the adaptabiliy of micro-organisms exploiting the large population of world ranging individuals. This book is scary that way, not to mention the writing is incredibly good. George Steward shows a love and understanding of ecosystems and how culture can be shaken and lost by the loss of the majority of constituant members. How Isherwood Williams copes with his deminishing expectations for the next generation is realistic and shows how most of us adapt to the whims and caprice of what life can throw at us. This book could be a world shaker if given a good rewrite updating the 1940s slant. With what we know now that Steward seemed to predict would come about intuitively, this work would be very popular today. Don't let that stop you from reading this great, great book.","I wandered in here and was suprised to see that the book was still in print, and how many people had read and loved the book. This was recommended to me about ten years ago by the author's grandson, and I agree with many other readers. It is a timeless and thought-provoking end-of-world scenario. It is a strong argument for compulsory education as well. Very enjoyable.","A half-century ago, Stewart saw too clearly a future which could, indeed may yet, come to pass. He, and only a few others, survive a world-wide plague. How he attempts to preserve his society - how he prioritizes, what agonizing choices he and his 'flock' make, the compromises they have to accept - makes for among the finest end-of-the-world books ever written. Ish, the main character, is no less uncertain, no less fascinating, than Macbeth. Ish is clearly the everyman each of us could see in him/herself after a catastrophe impossible to imagine. A long book - it could be no less - by its end, one hopes for a sequel. It is not clear whether Stewart is optimistic about this future - and that too is appropriate. For every reader will probably come to a different conclusion as to where the 'tribe' is headed based on his/her own perceptions of what Ish did correctly or otherwise and what the reader might have done differently. No modern home library is complete without Earth Abides.","George Stewart provides a compelling &quot;thumbnail&quot; picture of mankind and how adversity can bring out the best and worst in people. This mini-saga is so well written and loaded with such a rich mix of characters and situations that the reader cannot help but wonder what tomorrow might bring. If you enjoyed Sarum you will love this","I was introduced to this book at a time when the world was beginning to fully envelope the &quot;benefits of technology.&quot; As part of the computer generation, for whom the desires of the world could be acquired at the click of a mouse, Earth Abides awoke in me a deep appreciation for the distance we have come and the importance of the most basic lessons in life. For more than 15 years I have been looking to recapture the insights I discovered in reading the book as an impresionable teenager. How ironic that is technology that now presents me with the opportunity to read it again","I have spent twenty years &quot;selling&quot; this book to friends and acquaintances as a must read. Some &quot;got it&quot;. Others didn't. Read it. If you &quot;get it&quot;, you will re-read it many times again! If you &quot;don't&quot;, hey, it takes all kinds","This magnificent book tells the story of one man's struggleto recreate and rebuild society in a world where societyhas abruptly ceased to exist. Set in the Bay Area and rifewith haunting moral and ethical questions. Every student -heck, every HUMAN - should read this one at least once. I'vebeen through it more than ten times since I read it incollege. TIMELESS.","As the lead character copes with the demise of civilization, we find an elegant creativity that challenges the mind and helps us see the world in new ways. This is one of the greatest books I've ever read and certainly one of the most haunting. I strongly recommend it to anyone. Another along the same lines is Malevil","This in one of the finest &quot;Last Plague&quot; genre I have ever read. Fascinating from beginning to end. It is the ACKNOWLEDGED inspiration for THE STAND by Stephen King !!","Facinating concept. It's far ahead of it's time. Written in 1949 it could easily be updated to any time. It must have caused quite the controversy when originally published. Each time I've read it, I've found something new. A perfect book for discussion groups","I am a fan of similar themed books. But this one just does nothing for me. The only interesting aspect is the (almost consuming) focus on how other animals in the biosphere react to the human population crashing down.But that doesn't make up for these huge flaws:1) The interpersonal aspects are awful.People just don't relate to each other the way the author describes.2) Dominated bi sudo-Christian bible verse that gets added in to say something meaningful is happening3) The storyline takes place so long ago that it is hard to see it as anything but a time-piece.4) Racist, sexist views embedded very deep in the assumptions5) Overall a very boring story line. No emotional growth in the characters and no growth in the community or plot. Just terrible, really.","My hobby is reading . I enjoy reading stories. all kinds of stories by bestselling authors or never heard of authors. always looking for a good story. In my search I have read some great stories, some not so great and just plain awful. but only three times have I ever disliked a story where I could not finish it. This story was so bad not only could I not finish it I would like a refund. the story line could of been interesting. The writing was horrible. I hope it is a long time before I come across a book this bad again.","I liked the book but all the characters were technologically ignorant. Even in the forties they had small portable generators but this was ignored in the book. One part of the book basically said they let all the lights go out. People knew about generators then and if not you would've have soon found out.","I'm not talking about the pandemic itself; I'm talking about the aftermath. I found the lack of progress of the human race, as detailed in this book, to be very unlikely. Even assuming that out of initial group of adults in Ish's group, Ish is the only highly intelligent one, I found it really hard to believe that the adults wouldn't bother to teach the kids how to read and do math, so that they'd be able to use the libraries to learn the skills they'd need to survive. It didn't make sense that there would only be two main characters with any sort of curiosity about *anything*. Why was knowledge of carpentry lost when The Tribe's carpenter died? Didn't he train anyone in his craft? Didn't anyone want to learn?I expected this book to outline some sort of return to the land, which would be much more realistic than having The Tribe live off canned food for forty years. This book spends way too much time expounding on how intelligent Ish is without showing him actually doing anything to help the human race.","I had heard excellent things about Earth Abides. I have always liked post apocolyptic books, and this is often the first recommendation by people. I tried reading it once, but thought the writing was detached and boring after a few pages, so put it down, and gave it away. Then, i saw the audio version on sale on audible.com, and downloaded it.I know this book was written in 1949 or something, and those I've talked to, comment on that as if its an excuse for blatant and rampant sexism and racism. But, I'm sorry, there is not accepatance in me for any of this no matter when it was written.The women are portrayed as either blood sucking, parasitic whores or blank and faceless wombs. Even his dog, a female dog, is described as ungrateful, needy and parasitic, expecting to be taken care of without giving anything in return, and provides in no way useful in the way of dogs, that I can remember. She is named Princess.The first non-whites that are encountered are identified as \"Negros\" and are described as unattractive, nervous, hesitant and lice ridden, living in a cabin with cheap and rickety furniture although there are far nicer houses empty for the taking. Our main character trades a dollar bill for eggs, and the \"negros\" are well pleased. So, they are poor, dirty, and stupid.Then, there is our main character, he is an unappologetic arrogant elitist who deems 99% of those he meets as unworthy of living. He decides that they will all die \"secondary\" die off because they are stupid, crazy without will to live. He drives around in his car, looking for people, but yet finding none, eventhough he infact comes across people. None of them are \"worthy\". He even makes a list of why he will survive were the others will die, and the list includes that he is solitary, and never cared much for people anyway. Which seemed strange to me, since he had found 4 or 5 people in one day's search. Its not like the world is entirely empty.I gave it two stars, because initially, I was interested in the observations of the earth and the cities and how nature is taking over and civilization is breaking down, but with no engaging characters or furthering of a worthwhile plot, I quickly lost interest and had to force myself to go on, looking for even a glimmer of the amazement and awe others seem to view this book. I found nothing of the like.","One-and-a-half stars really. Not much happens in this book.The main character spends most of his time musing over the fate of the earth and observing the effects of erosion on human artifacts, now that most of the world's population has been wiped out. One of the racier sections I recall was his observation of a storm water drain overflowing.It took two or three pages.However, the book is readable enough to fill in a bit of time while trapped in a hospital bed for a few days, and might even have earned as many as three stars from me, were it not for the &quot;hero's&quot; much over-inflated sense of self worth which manifests itself on nearly every page, most often by refering in his thoughts to all of his friends as simple, stolid, dull, or just plain stupid.Not to mention what he thinks of those whom he doesn't count among his friends!Maybe we are not meant to like the &quot;hero&quot;, but I think we are, and I can't help thinking that this story could be written by one of those aneamic, spotty, embittered social outcasts that one often finds lurking in the shadows at science fiction conventions, more at home with his onanistic fantasies than with any human being. I quote:&quot;...he realized that in some ways...he felt a new security and even satisfaction at the contemplation of a solitary life. His worries in the old days had been chiefly about people. The prospect of going to a dance had more than once sent him into a sweat; he had never been a good mixer; no one had asked him to join a fraternity. In the old days, such things were a handicap to a man. Now, he realized, they were actually a great advantage. Because he had sat on the edge of so many social gatherings, not quite able to mingle in the conversation, listening, watching objectively, now he could endure not being able to talk, and again could sit and watch, noting what happened. His weakness had become strength. It was as if there had been a blind man in a world suddenly bereft of light. In that world, those with seeing eyes could only blunder about, but the blind man would be at home, and now, instead of being the one who was guided by others, he might be the one to whom others clung for guidence.&quot;His intellectual snobbery becomes glaringly obvious as he begins to meet other survivors, and is at it's most repellant when he discusses &quot;half-witted&quot; Evie, whom one of the other survivors found &quot;dirty, grovelling, and unkempt, living in filth with merely enough intelligence to open cans to feed herself on whatever they contained, without cooking or preperation.&quot; This doesn't seem too much of a crime, and neither does the only other thing that seems to be &quot;wrong&quot; with her, that she can't hold a conversation. Nevertheless, the &quot;hero&quot; goes on to say:&quot;It would have been better, he had often thought, if they had merely put a can of sweet ant-poison within her reach somewhere.&quot; Of course, we must remember that when this book was published, in in 1949, social policy in the US was still under the sway of brianiac and boffin advocates of eugenics, and many &quot;subnormals&quot; and &quot;moral degenerates&quot; were still being sterilized by court order, despite the widespread revulsion over the results of Nazi social engineering procedures based on the same premises. A good antidote to the attitutudes expressed by this book is to be found in Jonathan Kellerman's excellent thriller &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot;, wherein eugenicists lurk behind a spree of cowardly murders. Kellerman's book is also recommended as a healthy locus for introspection by any readers of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; who find themselves agreeing with the &quot;hero's&quot; attitudes and solutions.","Overall this book didn't impress me enough to ever recommend it to anyone else but it also wasn't horrible. The beginning explanation of the plague and the prehistory of the character are so vague that the rest of the book is ruined. Doesn't stand anywhere near books like The Stand or Swan Song.","I would not recommend this book. UNLESS you are having a hard tiime falling asleep!! The main character, Ish is supposed to be an educated man who survives a deadly world wide virus. He uses his aledged power of observation to observe how the people around him, who are incapable of doing anything without his help survive. Unfortunately for the people around him, Ish seams to be unable to do anything but watch and complain.","Earth Abides is a disaster story where aplague almost wipes out humans. Becausewe grew too prosperous we had to die, according to the author, that is just the way things work. So the few survivors get by never trying to improvetheir lives, having no ambition the human race lapses into hunter gatherers with only superstition as a guide. Thisbook is a waste of a good oportunity. Insted of saying &quot;Hey, we can occomplishthings if we work hard and perservier.&quot; The author tells us &quot;Hey, we're almost as good as cockroaches and if we drop our standards, we too can can eek out ameager existence.&quot;I don't have to pay people to depress me, I can do that all by myself. What awaste of time and money.","I read this book a number of years ago, and forgot about it. Recently, I saw it on the shelf, and decided to re-read it. After forcing myself to read it, I understand why it was easy to forget.The main character, Ish, is highly arrogant and self-righteous. Ish, only Ish, has the power to drive civilization back from a total collapse. Ish has a son, Joey, who worships Ish, and Ish drinks it up. Joey is The Saviour, The One, a child who must be taught the abstract ideas which created Civilization. Nothing else matters.The side-characters are all inferior. These are the people with skills to survive. This includes artistic skills which doesn't include the formal education which _must_ be part of any \"real\" artists training.The most interesting part of it all is the background story of how the Earth really abides without Man trying to impose his will. Structures decay due to natural events; forests and wild-life reclaim the land.It may be a classic book, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a good book!","Can't believe the negative reviews of this extraordinary novel. Read it for yourself. Then, you will appreciate life as we know it today. You will sleep well, adore more your family and friends, and rest assured that Earth abides.","I read this book about half way in sophmore year, and quit reading it. Now I'm 20 and I decided I'd give it another try. I have about 60 pages left, and I gotta say, this book is one of the slowest I have read, up there with the lord of the rings fellowship. I know it's a classic, but man, I can't even read this book for more than 30 min. at a time. Usually I blaze through books within a few days, but I'm probably on a month and a half with this book. I work a lot, so I dont usually have much time for reading except while I'm going to the bathroom and before bed, but wow. I mean the book is ok, it's not bad, it's just not a pageturner, which is what I usually go for. The main character Ish is very paranoid, thinks to far into detail over everything, and is in my opinion is a coward. I also feel like there is too much side tracking in this book. It's also very repetuous. I feel like there is too much thinking and too little action about anything. In some ways I relate to the main character, because I overthink a lot of things, I'm not the biggest strongest guy, nor the most handy, but that doesn't make it any more interesting of a read. It kind of defeats the purpose of me reading a book. I read to meet interesting characters, be engrossed in a story that is not mine, and to entertain my mind. I don't want to read about a character thinking. If i did want to read about that, I would read a philosophy book and do the thinking myself, or better yet, I'd read nothing and just think. When I think of books taking place in a post apocalyptic world, I think of a little bit more than this gives you. There could have been a lot more interesting scenarios in the depicted world than the one focused on in this book.I will say though that this book does use an interesting vocabulary, and I've learned a few new words. And the part's in Itallics are by far the best parts of the book. These parts do truly make an impression in your mind, and I would rate these as 5 star. Some of the itallicized parts are very deep and meaningful. I love this quote out of one of those parts \"Between the plan and fulfillment stands always the frail barrier of a human life\"Overall: Id say it's worth reading, but it's by far not the best book ever like some of the other reviewers are saying. I liked Cormick Mcarthy's \"The Road\" as a post apocalyptic story better, it seemed more real, and it moved at a quicker pace.","I read this book when I was in middle school, probably 1982, and it's impressive that it seemed futuristic even at that time when it had been written decades earlier. With the imminent release of \"I Am Legend\" I was reminded of this book again as a different take on post-apocalyptic literature.I said it was memorable but flawed because it gave an interesting early look at the idea of a pandemic, and the aftermath of such, but didn't seem to give a realistic take on the survivors' civilization. Why would people suddenly give up their institutes of religion, for example? Historically, when has this happened? He has black people in the south growing cotton \"just because\" and worshipping crocodiles (I don't know if this was a racist component or not.)In the end, his view was rather too cynical and unrealistic about the way people react to the loss of technology. Technology isn't what makes people great, it is their values. I think he didn't realize that.","I first read this book in high school -- 1964! And, loved it soo much I &quot;forgot&quot; to return it to the library &lt;blush&gt;. I've re-read it numerous times over the years and enjoyed it every time. I hope you enjoy it, too. It's a tremendous read.","If you like post-apocalyptic sci-fi, as I do, you'll probably enjoy this book. The book starts out strongly but peters out toward the middle after the narrator settles down and becomes embarrassingly introspective about how himself and what it takes to build a civilization. Parts of the book are clumsily written and pretentious. If you want better apocalyptic fiction, try John Wyndham or John Christopher.","I love end-of-the-world fiction. Call me a gourmand of it, if you will. Well, one story I had missed was, &quot;Earth Abides&quot;. So, I read a lot of reviews here at Amazon and I decided to buy it.I gave it three stars because I did not finish it. Usually, I can read anything. Even bad fiction becomes a challenge to conclude; disappointing fiction is a different story. It's just isn't my type. Though, I can appreciate what others see in it.Summary: A fellow goes off hiking and is bit by a rattlesnake. After his near-death experience and recovery (lasting about 2 weeks), he comes back to society to find no one home. The book follows his life as he: travels, struggles, meets other survivors, starts a fledgling society.The strengths of this book encompass one man's struggle to survive an unthinkable situation. It is wonderful at explaining some the effects of a global disaster in which only the people are gone. Our ordinance remains. But all eventually decays. The next generation of human society loses it cerebralness, but gains an innate link to the earth. Man exterminated by a virus with extreme prejuidice has now become just a creature not a ruler of the earth.In fact, just as I am typing this out; I am getting excited to read it. But, here come the negatives.The weaknesses are few, but very important. Characterization. Stereotypes abound, while the earth abides. Women are merely wombs needed for their matronly duties. Which would be true in this case. But there is no other extrapolation of feelings and thoughts for the women other than a prehistoric regression of their being and worth. All other characterizations are weak. The protagonist grows on in years but not in emotional or intellectual depth.There are other things that I did not like in the book. When things start to break down, our hero does nothing to stop it; even when he has others to help him. On grand scale, when the infrastructure fails, nothing is done. Not even attempted. One man may not be able to save a power plant or water system. But a group could. Well, possibly. After all, they have all the time in the world. Even if the those infrastructure repairs are ignored, what about personal systems? Our hero is a graduate student in Geology, and this book was only written 50 years ago. The Cold war is in it's infancy. Bomb shelters, survival gear are not unheard of. Oh well. That's what I don't like.Conclusion: I think if I was a teenager I might have read this book differently. But being in my early 30s and a scientist skews my notion of this type of fiction. Please read this book. You may be able overlook, or not even think what I pointed out were points against it. Personally, I'd suggest reading, &quot;The Stand&quot;, &quot;Warday&quot; or &quot;I am Legend&quot;.","I hate this book. I truly hate it, more than any other novel I've ever read outside of fundamentalist hate-drivel. That's saying a lot for me, given that I love reading and I particularly enjoy sci-fi books and those with apocalyptic themes (morbid, yes, but what can you do).The reason I loathe this book with the burning fire of ten thousand suns is the blobs of useless goo that pass for the main characters. They don't DO anything. Sure, they do the usual things like eating and sleeping and scratching their nether regions, but that's about it. As I read through this train-wreck I wanted to grab a bullhorn and scream into the book for them to do something, ANYTHING, to better their situation or try to learn something new or to show an emotion of any kind. The author has the main characters sitting around and eating out of tin cans and twiddling their thumbs for-get this-forty-two YEARS. Not a few months while they get the hand of harvesting fresh food, not a year or two while they learn new trades or research better ways to go about things, but forty-two freaking years.They don't even bother to teach their kids to read. There's one kid named Joey, whom the main character Ish keeps thinking, \"Garsh, he's the one!\" (repeated often), and ponders the possibility of teaching this precocious seven-year-old how to read, but Joey suddenly dies of illness. Presumably, so does civilization, because the passel of thirty-odd other kids running around at this point are deemed by Ish to be either too stupid or too disinterested for him to bother getting out of his Lay-Z-Boy and teaching them the ABC's. Obviously the author has never been around children. The ONE thing he does teach them, and he refers to this as his \"legacy,\" is to show them how to make a bow and arrows.The basic message of the book is \"Yup. We're screwed, folks, so give up early.\" Frankly, if I had been in the situation that these main characters were in, I'd do my damnedest to rebuild and make use of the remaining human world around me. I'd teach my kids how to read and how to use all the technology around them, and if I didn't know how to use something I'd find out how. I'd learn to farm and how to turn the electricity back on and basic medical care. I sure as hell wouldn't be sitting around for forty-two years staring at the wall.The only thing that kept the first half of the book from being used as toilet paper (don't ask about the other half) is that Stewart drops in the occasional interesting factoid about what would happen in nature if there suddenly were no longer any human beings. These facts are nicely offset from the story, set in their own paragraphs and in italics, so if you're interested in this sort of stuff you can skim through and read them fairly quick.","I was looking for a good \"end of the world\" type novel, and after the amazing reviews, chose this one. Disappointed hardly describes it. This is one that as a quick reader (usually finishing a novel in less than two days) it took me over a week of forcing myself to keep picking this back up. This was so anti-climatic it was boring.The most interesting thing about the story wasn't even told! One day, Ish wakes up to the aftermath of a world stripped of most humanity. Personally, I would have liked to read about the actual acts of the end of days, not the leftover start over.So Ish decides to drive all over the U.S. just observing, meeting some people along the way. Again, pretty dull. It is described well, and the writer is a good writer, but he doesn't seem to have anything to tell. He could have had more conflict, more interesting character, but it lacked this. In fact, until the end of the book, I didn't even know how old Ish was in the beginning. For a book that focuses on this main character, and pretty much the first quarter of the book is all about Ish, there is very little backstory and knowledge of him. Unacceptable.Instead the focus is on everything going on, well not going on, around Ish. The lack of people. The mess. The fires and fallen trees. Where has electricity and where doesn't. The looting.The most interesting thing he actually wrote about was the rise and fall of other species. I would have LOVED to read more about THAT! However, his telling of the ants, which was brilliant, was summed up in a few paragraphs while he took ages to tell the most boring parts.It also was unbelievable to me. Granted, this was written in the forties. But I hardly think for as long as time passed, even in simpler times, that people would live as they did without making more adjustments until they absolutley had to. I suppose some people might be that way, and I guess we'll never know until it happens.Honestly, I would have been more interested in reading about the other survivors than Ish, who was a procrastinator and thought very little of those closest to him.I would not recommend this book. Yes, it does stick with you. But not in a good way.","This book sucks. Cars don't run on 20 year old gas, canned goods go bad after time, You should probably learn how to grow your own food and get your own water before 20 years has passed... This book is not only dated, but just plain stupid in it's aspects of survivalism.","First, let me start off stating that I know this is suppose to be a classic; however, I found little to like in this book. It is a very, very long story where nothing happens...really. After a couple hundred pages I started to skip forward, looking for something to peak my interest. Nothing ever happens in this book...let me sum it up for you. 1) Plague, 2) a few people find one another, 3) they plant plants, 4) they plant more plants, 5) they watch the ants and rats die out, 6) they have kids and scribble on a rock for 20 years, the end.If you want to read a great post-apocalypse book, get One Second After or The Road. Either of these books blows this dull piece out of the water.","EARTH ABIDES is such an amazing book. In fact, I happened to keep my high school copy rather than returning it before graduation. Deep down, I think my teacher knew and was happy to take the loss.I have three books that I will not part with - EARTH ABIDES, THE STAND, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. EARTH ABIDES and THE STAND have a lot in common. I am surprised, as were others, by all of those who gave this book such a low rating.The story tells the tale of a college student, Ish, who is working on his thesis up in the mountains. He gets bitten by a rattlesnake and heads to lower ground for help only to discover the human population has been wiped out thanks to some weird plague. The story becomes Ish's quest to live as supposedly the last human on earth.First, I want to clarify that this book was written in the 1940s. Those who complained about the writing being poor, one guy even said the book was written in the 60s and he is wrong, need to look at the times. The world in the 1940s was far different to today. If you cannot adapt to the language differences, skip this book. While I find it rather narrowminded, I also understand the world is full of people who just can't stand something that is different to the norm.In the 1940s, they didn't have the computers, men were working away from their family farms, they'd become used to modern technology, so it isn't surprising that Ish would have allowed so many things to slip by for decades. If the world ended tomorrow how many can honestly say they would know how to irrigate their crops? How many even know how to garden?At heart, EARTH ABIDES needs to be viewed with the consideration of the differences in time. It is and always will be my favorite book.","I am a 62 year old grandmother who has read hundreds of books, but no book ever moved me like this one. It is the story of one thoughtful, intelligent young man spared during a world wide epidemic that wiped out most of the population. While we always expect that the end will come with a bomb that distroys everything, this time, all the infrastructure was left intact. The plants and animals that had evolved to be dependent on humans also succumbed and Mr. Stewart deals with this in a remarkable and sensitive way. Today human beings have brought civilization to the brink, but this book reminds us that no matter what, the Earth Will Abide.","However, if you want Mad Max or his clones go elsewhere. Since I read this book back in grade school it has always been on my shelf, in fact I usually have 2, one personal copy and one copy to give to friends. I read many of the reviews of this book and wonder if some of these people read the same book. To me Earth Abides is one of the most uplifting books ever written. This book shows that no matter what comes, life and happiness will happen. No matter all Ish's failings to teach his people, his Greatgrandchildern are happy, they do not miss what they never knew. He teaches them to survive and they will teach themselves the rest. Again I say if you are looking for an actionpacked end of the world book I would recommend Daybreak-2250 A.D. by Andre Norton. However if you want one of the best books written that will make you think about humanity and all its failings and gifts, READ THIS BOOK! I just wish I could have given it 15 stars instead of just 5.","Ish, a college student, survives a rattlesnake bite and mysterious illness alone on a mountain camping trip. When he recovers, he can't find anyone and slowly realizes a plague has wiped out the human race. He wanders across the country, finding only a few stunned survivors and makes an intelligent and courageous decision to not join the first people he finds. After a period of terrible isolation, he finds Em, a true survivor like himself. They are happy together and attract five other survivors. A tiny little tribe grows around them. Ish devotes his life to trying to bring back civilization as he knew it. He fails at his superficial efforts at farming and at educating the children. He succeeds beyond his deepest dreams at giving his descendants the tools they need to create a healthy, happy way of life. The novel works as a thought-provoking study of what do you do when the world collapses around you. It has some weaknesses. Here and there, the fact it was written in 1949 shows. One can argue that Ish would have been able to get the children to read if only he hadn't been such a boring pedant and he could have been a better farmer if he'd been willing to explore alternate ways and crops. The book's strengths greatly outweigh its weaknesses. For one thing, with not much action, it's a true page turner. This is a fantastic novel to discuss and to argue about and to ponder the fundamental question it raises. What would you do for the rest of your life if you survived the end of the world?","First off, I should state that this novel was written in the late forties, and thus reflects many of the prevailing attitudes of the time. It is rather sexist, and even vaguely racist (although neither element is malicious, just ignorant) so if you think that may ruin the novel for you, then you probably want to skip it. That said, if you can look at \"Earth Abides\" in the context in which it was written, you will find a thoughtful, entertaining novel.\"Earth Abides\" is predicated on a super-virus wiping out the overwhelming majority of the Earth's human population, while leaving the rest of the animal kingdom unaffected (at least directly). The story follows \"Ish\" as he struggles both to survive, and come to grips with the loss of civilization. Over time, a community of survivors gels around him, and they work to scratch an existence out of the ruins of San Francisco.Stewart takes a rather bleak view of the survivors of the holocaust, not to mention their children. Rather than trying to reestablish \"civilization\" they slip into a more or less Stone Age existence, supplemented by the leavings of a culture they are completely alienated from, and that is not understood by the children at all. While I understand that Stewart was seeking to comment on what makes up a \"civilization\", and what the natural human condition is, or should be, I think he introduced an element of wishful thinking into his narrative (strange as that may sound). It is extremely unlikely that things as fundamental as literacy would completely disappear within two generations, and while they might very well fail, I suspect that survivors would at least attempt to maintain electricity, water supplies, etc.Where this novel really shines, and what I found most interesting to read, was Stewart's descriptions of the ecology of a North America largely depopulated of humans. He does a superb job of predicting the fluctuations in various animal populations, and I believe that the long-term balance that he predicts is probably not far from what would actually happen.Ultimately, \"Earth Abides\" is an entertaining novel that leaves one thinking about how they would react in similar situation. While I don't necessarily agree with the way the novel plays out, I was constantly challenged to come up with an explanation as to why I thought things might be different. In the process, I gained a deeper appreciation for the depth of Stewart's characters, and the challenges he pitted them with. If you enjoy \"apocalyptic fiction\" this is definitely a book for you, but even if you have not strong feelings for the genre, I suspect you will enjoy the excellent characterizations, thoughtful story and wonderfully realized world.","This book attempts to answer the age old question, \"what will earth be like without humans?\". In a word, BORING, just like this novel. Don't get me wrong, there are some great parts to this novel with real drama and action and intrigue and heart-wrenching feeling. Unfortunately, those parts are few and far between, and they are between mountains of tedium and monotony. I will give George R. Stewart credit for doing his homework scientifically, historically, culturally, etc, and I have no doubt that if a horrible plague ever wiped out nearly all of the human race, this is probably a really accurate depiction of what would occur. However, and this is why i give this book such a low rating, there is a vast difference between writing an accurate book and an entertaining one. In many ways this book is very similar to other post apocalyptic novels like The Stand, The Road, The Book of Eli, On the Beach, etc etc etc, however, where those novels shine and where this novel falls flat is in the art of story-telling. Basically, this novel has no story other than the mere survival of the last remaining humans. There is no plot, no antagonist (unless you count harsh nature herself), no great task to complete, no long journey to take, and no lesson to be learned. When gone is the human race, the earth and everything on it will still be here, and in the closing words of the author, \"Humans come and go, but the Earth Abides.\"","I really enjoyed this novel from the apocalyptic genre very much. It was not a fantasy good versus evil type of story but rather a speculative look at how civilization might fare if there was a sudden die-off of 99% of the population. In this story there is a sudden plague of such devastating severity that nearly everyone is dead within a couple of weeks of its outset. This book does not focus on the plague or the sufferings of the infected and dying people. No grisly oozing bodies are found in these pages and very little trauma or grief. We enter the picture shortly after the dust has settled, so to speak. The story is not about the plague but about its aftermath. It is told from the perspective of one man who survives and traces his experiences as he goes in search of other survivors and finally settles back in his native California and makes the foundation of a new \"tribe\" of civilized human beings. This book was written in 1949 so it is doubly interesting because it not only gives us a look at the author's speculation about the factors that make up civilization and the interesting trials and successes that might arise, but it also gives us an amazing look at the huge changes that have taken place in our consciousness just in the short period of years since it was written. It has the unexpected bonus of actually confirming some of the points the story originally was designed to suggest. Even though the author seems as though he was an open-minded, perhaps even liberal thinker, the book contains ridiculous racial stereo-types, as well as skewed ideas about the personhood of mentally disabled people and also of women. Women are shown as being entirely domestic and dependent. Cigarette smoking is still very much a happy pastime in this brave new world and is enjoyed by men and their pregnant wives without a care in the world. When a plague of ants becomes a problem the main character, Ish, sprays himself and his pregnant wife down thoroughly with DDT, a substance that is used several times in the surviving world to overcome pests. I found these old-fashioned ideas very interesting when coming from a \"reasonable\" man that no one of his time would have considered to be prejudiced. The book is a thought-provoking page-tuner. I kept imagining that I would have done things in a much different way from the main character but I found the ideas and reasoning to be essentially sound and worth contemplating. This is an interesting look at how the Earth might rid herself of the virus called mankind and is certainly a good look at the power of her self-healing capabilities. I definitely recommend this book.","I first read this book when I was 8 years old. My dad had left it out and I grabbed it up and read it. Even at 8 years old I found this book gripping and thought provoking. As I grew older I would find a copy and read it, and each time I would gain something new from reading this book. I am 45 years old now and I am feeling the urge to read it again. I think the reason why the survivors did not \"rebuild civilization\" was because they were all in shock--their whole world (friends, lovers, children) had been wiped off the face of the earth almost overnight. If you add to this the author's stated premis that the survivors were mostly average to dull, then the story makes more sense. I recommend this book to anyone, it's a sci-fi classic. I also think the movie \"The Omega Man\" might have been inspired by this book.","Many reviewers here expected something different, I think. They are dismayed.They have all the elements properly arranged but do not see how they add up. Ishi characterizes himself as intelligent and the others as inferior to him in cognitive ability, yet he fails in almost all his undertakings.At the first sign of trouble he goes home and sleeps in his boyhood bedroom, then returns there and takes up a permanent residence in the old home place -- this infantile reversion is culture-shock but he can't see it. He is supposedly trained in ecology but is taken by surprise every time the local ecology adjusts itself to mankind's absence -- this emphasizes the futility of a college education in a survival situation. He carries a prejudice against negroes yet marries a mulatto and doesn't even realize it at first -- his blindness extends deeply within him. He tries to educate the youngsters but cannot hold their interest -- he is too disconnected from their reality. He has in front of him all the ingredients for success -- yet fails on his own terms, which are unreal.And yet, he does succeed, doesn't he? In spite of himself he does manage to attract a group which survives and stays together. Gradually over the course of his life he becomes ever-farther removed from reality, while the children take over the lead. They develop the skills they need to live in the new world almost while Ishi is not looking -- they become \"wild Indians\" wearing skins and shooting arrows.Ishi was the name given to the last member of a tribe of California Indians, the Yahi. In 1911 he was brought in by white society and nursed back to health by the Kroebers, with whom he lived. The Kroebers were a university couple, anthropologists. Their daughter Ursula was born in 1929 and grew up with Ishi in the house. Ursula's married name is LeGuin; she has won many awards for her science fiction. (Google 'Ishi' and see.)Ishi also is the short form of Ishmael, a name for the Wandering Jew of legend; Melville's \"Moby Dick\" begins with the sentence, \"Call me Ishmael.\"In short, Ishi is sort of the Dagwood of survivalists. Arnold Schwartzenegger would not star in the film version. Despite his shortcomings and failures, life actually does go on. In fact he is a lot like you and me. How well do we know ourselves? How well do our everyday decisions turn out? Once Ishi says to heck with it and lets things slide, things get better just like in real life.Stewart's genius was to place these things before us and then get out of the way. He has placed hints in the text, the italicized passages which give us objective truth, sandwiched between Ishi's misadventures. What he is saying is, in despite of ourselves, Earth Abides.If you enjoy the subject, try Walter Miller's \"Canticle for Leibowitz\", or Clifford Simak's \"City\" or David Brin's \"The Postman.\"Dave","I enjoyed this one. It is a very good read and certainly gives us some food for thought. We do need to remember when this one was written as to social attitudes, etc., but if we keep this in mind, it is good. I suppose you could read the book for it's social commentary, relate it to unspellable philosophical stances, blah, blah, blah, as one reviewer did, or you can read it for a very nice story to read on a rainy weekend. I enjoyed it, will probably read it again and highly recommend it.","I've gotta confess I was not very excited to read this book, having obtained on a bargain and postposed its reading for about a year, when I eventually got to it, I was absolutely blown awaythe writting, althought not brilliant, is very polished and takes you throught the wonderful adventure of the end of mankind as we know it, throught the vast territory of a deserted united states, and tells us how it would slowly and rapidly decay in its various facets, until it would stand almost naked, a fertile ground for life anewcoming throught the plagues caused by the broken ecosystems and among the difficulties tapped by the human intervention we give for granted, it sets up a perfect place for the second half of the book, in which civilization begins again, necessarily different of how it came about in the first place, offering us exciting reflections on how we are and how we'd be, on values and life and growth, we age with the original characters, and by the time Ish is an old man we can see this new world throught the eyes af an old man, we understand and are subjected to the same hoplesness as him in the development of the new world, yet the hope of life, free of our cultural bagages and preconceptions, grows and leaves you a great aftertastean incredible novel, terribly underrated, which should be cherished and shared","Several reviews have noted what they call the essential pessimism of the book: Man Has Fallen, Civilization Is No More, etc. Well, yes, that is all there. But what is also there is a profound triumph of the human spirit: Civilization is Dead - Long Live Civilization. I will NOT spoil the ending, but book ends with a rebirth - an obvious societal pregnancy if you will - of a new civilization, one profoundly in keeping with the new conditions of their brave renewed world.One can imagine a sequel, and I wish Stewart ahd written one!I first read this book almost 50 years ago, and have re-read it multiple times. It is one of the best \"transition\" books ever written. I recommend it on several levels.","An astonishing science fiction novel in the apocalyptic vein, written in 1949, and despite a surprisingly few dated references, a story that remains both entertaining and relevant. In the beginning, protagonist Isherwood Williams (with the unfortunate nickname of \"Ish\") is one of the few survivors of a virus that wipes out a majority of the human population. Ish is in his twenties, an over-educated outsider, who stands on the margins of society analyzing and contemplating what he sees. After a solo excursion across the county and returning to the Bay Area, California, he slowly joins up with an assortment of characters, and becomes the de facto leader of \"The Tribe\". The struggles that confront them are meticulously well thought out and explicated by the author while rarely dragging down the narrative. The slow decay of an industrial society with no one left to manage it and the natural environment no longer held at bay serve as the antagonists. There are no sci-fi pulp orientated elements such as giant mutant killer ants (for better or worse). Threatening the Tribe are scourges of rats, wild dogs, and other animals, as various species overpopulate until starvation brings their numbers down again. There are outbreaks of disease to be dealt with and wild brush fires caused by dead trees no longer cleared away. The novel deftly provides details such as what happens to the plumbing when city reservoirs dry up and fall into disrepair. The real strength of the book, however, is how Ish is forced to confront what knowledge and wisdom needs to be passed on to the future generations in order to rebuild society. Hence with his intelligent introspective nature, interwoven into this entertaining story are thoughtful reflections on what purposes societies serve, what they protect us from, and even what they blind us to and cause us to take for granted. This is a timeless classic our own civilization would be mistaken to let slip into the \"out-of-print\" abyss.","Well almost everything has been already written about this book but I have one new curiosity not yet mentioned by anybody. In fact it's this curiosity that caused me to only give it a three star rating. To enjoy this book I had to believe that the handful of survivors world wide all loss basic curiosity. I can understand the total grief, the total denial and complete loss of the few who survive. I cannot understand the total and complete loss of curiosity. All around the survivors they have the tools, the machines and all the books but nobody has any interest in them. The leader of the survivors gives only lip service to the books but does nothing to really grow from them. Nor does he use them to learn the psychology of how to motivate his tribe. He only once attempts to do anything and at that it's only an after thought. He comes up with an idea that sparks the survivors into thinking about rebuilding a jeep but that's all. Aside from this his tribe cares about nothing. His tribe lives only day to day but seem forever lost in the now and blind, uncaring and unwilling to look to the past and what it can offer to help then survive in the future. The author never mentions curiosity or its loss in any of the timeline that the book traverses. It's as if curiosity never was part of humankind. All in all, I could enjoy the book without curiosity but it left me wondering what if it had included it in the story.","This is the 'end of the world as we know it' novel that all others are compared to. Even though it was written in the 1940's (copyright 1949) it is timeless, not aged at all, a great literary work.It all starts when the main character, Ish, is bitten by a rattlesnake and laid up in a remote cabin, unconscious for an extended period of time, while, unknown to him, a plague destroys over 99% of the population. There begins a superb story of the trials and adventures of one man, and eventually a small group of people, as they battle nature and themselves, and attempt to re-establish civilization. This is one of those rare novels where characterization and plot and setting all mesh together into one beautifully written yarn, that after reading it, you will never forget it, it is that powerful. If there ever existed the proverbial page turner, this is it. Of course, being written in the 1940's no mention is made of personal computers, CD players, and the like, but if civilization was gone these most likely would be of little use anyway.The philosophy and human interest angles contained in this book are well done. The scenes and descriptions of the demise of civilization and peoples' reactions to it, depicted by Stewart, seem very realistic. Your heart will be with the characters of this book when you read it.","Earth Abides is a thought provoking look at how the world would go if almost all people were eliminated from the picture. Some very interesting looks at the eco-structure, reformation of small societies and how they would interact from the short term to the long term. The book has some very sad and touching aspects that help you relate to the characters. The technology is a little outdated because of when the book was written but you can get past that. Overall, a very good book. One I would think in a few years I might like to read again.If you liked &quot;The Stand&quot;, and have wondered what would might happen 50 years afterwards. This is the book for you.","I have been looking for this book for a long time. I read this book for an Environmental Science class at Long Beach State about 20 years ago and it made such an impact on my thinking about the environment. Every time I see grass growing up through the cracks in the street or the roots wrapping around pipes I think of the book. While the environment seems quite fragile, it appears that it is not a fragile as we think and we are the fragile ones.","Let's start with the book's obvious problems. First, the author is a creature of his times -- the 1940's, and his views relect those times. He is paternalistic towards African Americans and women, and he feels that people without much formal education are not very smart or capable. Second, his main character, Ish, is not likeable; he is lazy, selfish, unloving (for the most part), rather anti-social, inflexible, and egotistical. (I am not sure that the author intended Ish to be unlikeable, as Ish is also a creature of his times.) Third, the author's view of the post-apocalytic world does not ring true; even given the dolts that the author has chosen to survive this catastrophe, surely more of the modern world would have survived -- at least for a few generations. (Example [MILD SPOILER]: would middle-class Americans ever decide not to teach their children to read? If there ever were a group of people who needed to know how to read, it would be this new generation!) Fourth, I do not find the biology/physics of this new world to be believable. (Example: where did all of the bodies go?) Fifth, the \"mother earth\" motif that runs throughout the book is hackneyed -- though, in fairness, it might have been fresh in the 1940's.Still, I liked the book. It is a book of ideas dressed up as a post-apocalyptic tale. What does it mean to be human? How does one balance the needs of the group against the needs of the individual? What is culture? What aspects of life/culture have value? What is love? What role should religion play in society? What role should education play? How does one go on after a devastating loss? How can people relate across generational lines? Can one generation truly lead another? What is happiness? What skills in life are most important? When is violence justified? What does death mean? How does one motivate and lead others? What does \"fun\" mean? How do small group dynamics play out? What function do rituals and symbols play in life? How do cultures adjust to rapid change?I did not usually agree with the author's answers to these questions (when he provided them), but they did challenge me. I have thought a lot about the book since completing it.","I agree with another reviewer who said it is a measure of this book's greatness that I still think of it now, fifty years after I read it.Fire, by the same author, is also unforgettable.This from a guy who can re-read a mystery he read three years earlier and not remember who done it.","A horrible disease sweeps the planet in days, killing just about everyone. Isherwood Williams is for some reason spared from this plague, and finds himself a survivor in a barren society. The book follows the course of his life, and that of other survivors, as they live out their days in a new world.My opinions ran wild with this book. For reason I will explain further along in the review, I started out very much enjoying the book, then my interest waned, and finally something clicked into place in my pea-sized brain, allowing me to finish the book on a strong note.I found it very easy to step into the mind of Ish. He reacted in a way to his situation that I felt was very natural, while learning how to cope with life alone. I don't want to give much of the plot away, but roughly the first third of the book deals with Ish's life alone. Ish starts out as something of a loner and a worrier, and seems to adjust to the world...for a while. Soon, he becomes desperate for a purpose, and with that notion, sets out to find out \"what happened\".Later, Ish struggles with his own weaknesses while trying to decide how to save the future. Through it all, Stewart keeps the characters consistant. I found it refreshing that he didn't try to thrust someone into the heroic role. For whatever reason, this earned him a good amount of credibility with me.A note on the writing style; I believe this book was written in 1949, so the flow of the book seemed a little odd to me. Some of the conversations just didn't flow well, and I chalked that up to the age of the book. On the other hand, Stewart's timeline fit right in with the world we live in today, and did not really date the book. Except maybe for spraying DDT around like it was air freshener.Around the middle of the book, I started to lose interest. I guess for me the story sort of bogged down with Ish trying, and consistantly failing, to get his people to try to focus on the finer things in life. As I said earlier, when things finally \"clicked\" for me, I found myself appreciating this part of the book more, as it fit in very well with who Ish was and what his purpose was.The ending was just magnificant. I very much felt what Ish was feeling, and clearly saw that he had finally accepted that things were going to work out for his decendants, even if things didn't turn out exactly as he had planned. I can't stress enough how good of a job Stewart did with the ending.This is not an action novel, and at points did become a bit too philosophical for it's own good. For me, it all came together at the end, but it might turn some people off. Also, as mentioned above, the writing style can seem a little strange, but overall this book shot far up my favorites list. This book easily get's five stars from me.","\"Earth Abides\" is one of the best books I have ever read. Even though it was written in 1949, it seems to me like it could have been written yesterday. Very thought-provoking and memorable. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who desires a good read. I couldn't put it down. I finished it several days ago and it still stays in my mind. I bought this book for my Kindle, but I think I am going to order a hard copy too - it was that good.","Even at 60 years old this book still resonates as to the plight of man and his insignificance in the universe. Told as a simple story of survival of the species it gives the reader pause for thought about many issues. Well written without much superflous wording. Great detail on the impact of man and what his loss would mean to the planet.","I love the apocalyptic genre. I had high hopes for this book and it started off good as the main character travels across the country during the aftermath of the disease (which he did not witness first hand while it was happening). After he meets up with a group of fellow survivors, they form a small community and from then on the whole book just seems to be pointless and boring. I got excited when the main character's two sons decided to take a trip across country, but the story line did not follow them on their trip and we found out little of what they saw and experienced when they returned. That infuriated me. Overall, this book was disappointing.","I have been a huge fan of the TEotWaWKI (The End of the World as We Know It) genre for quite some time. In a conversation with a fellow fan, I revealed that I have not heard of this book. After the shouts of shock and consternation died down, I was strongly urged to read it.Boring!Most of the book is taken up by the main character (Isherwood Williams) going on and on about what he or others should do. Then he does nothing! It got to the point that, after an actual interaction with another character (rare though they were), I dread the blah-blah-blah that was about to come.The only reason why I finished this book (and kept this from being a single star review) was the insight it provided on the age in which it was written. These are the things that stand out for me:* Being apologetic for not killing or running off the supposed mentally dificient member of the group.* It seeming to be OK for younger folk to painfully pinch very old people when they don't respond as expected (so much for respecting your elders).* The shame in having to bypass a mountain lion rather than killing it.* Killing a calf only for its liver, and killing its mother just because it was in the way.* Fear that a kid may be too smart and the need to keep it from reading too much.* Purposely not using reference material when trying to do something for which they have no experience.* Seeming lack of desire for good food. Whatever is around is good enough. No need to go out of your way to make something good.* The only time sex is implied is for making babies or cast aspersions upon someone's character.This was an exercise in anti-intellectualism and anti-sensualism. I'd rather be killed in the plague than to have to live with this bunch.","I've read many of the \"apocalyptic\" books. This was a quiet one. Since it was written in 1949, that might explain that. It was a pleasure not to see the F-word at all, and so many of the other obligatory modern slang phrases. It did avoid any positive reference to religion, so it is \"modern\" in that respect. Not exciting at all, and somewhat sad. Probably would appeal to women and those who consider themselves as intellectual or literary critics. Me, I just wanted some action from this book--not.","Why is this kindle book \"not available to kindle customers in Australia\"? SHAME on you Amazon. This was the best book I ever read as a teenager and I so wish to read it again","I read this book years ago (in the early 80's I think). It was my first post-apocalyptic novel and there are pieces of it I still remember. When something kills most of the people in the world, Stewart takes us into middle America. A dog named Bridget (I think), an Irish Setter, sits and waits for her people to come home. Bridget's bewilderment and her mourning is what I remember. The protagonist is a teen-aged boy who struggles to survive. Along the way he meets a housewife in her 30's, and she eventually becomes his wife. She's lost her husband and children and there's something she's hiding--a secret that illustrates how the world has changed since 1949 when Stewart wrote \"Earth Abides.\" Earth Abides ends on a positive note with humanity not quite back to square one. If you like \"everyone dies-but-us\" books and you're sick of flesh-eating zombies and vampires, I recommend it.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005F6569Y/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title","I read this book as a teenager. I've shared it with everyone from siblings to grandchildren and they all agree. It's a thought provoking look at a possible future for the earth. A must read for everyone!","This is a remarkable science fiction novel that has stood the test of time. I read it in the early sixties and recently bought it for my daughter.","What an excellent book! I read this on Vacation in Cancun, and couldn't put it down. I may have missed a couple good vacation days totally engaged with this story. Well worth it.","See this movie and gain a perspective on where we came from. Who we are and where you are going. Buddha jesus all the same guy. Whi knew?","I have read all of Stephenn King's books, so when he wrote that this book was his inspiration for writing The Stand, I knew it would be good. I purchased Earth Abides in a London bookstore a few years ago, but somehow it has gone missing. So I was very surprised and exited when I saw that it was being offered as a kindle book. I have now re-read Earth Abides and it is truly a great work of fiction. It really gets my imagination working, and makes real just how fragile the human race is.","I first read this book when I was in high school. That would be early '60s. It was one of those stories that was foundational in my own thinking. It was a pleasure to read it again after all these years. It is one of the earliest of the apocalyptic genre and its themes are timeless and the characters unforgettable, as you yourself Ish well know. It is still fresh and engrossing to read.","After having read many apocalyptic scifi novels; this is defenitely utopian. SPOILER: The disappearance of all the victim of the plague is suspiciously clean. Also, the simplification of the breakdown of infrastructure seem a bit too clean. However, having dealt with these questions, Stewart frees the book to deal with the most preponderous question: How do the Survivors of a great diaster rebuild civilization?","After reading this book I can no longer get myself to read anything else. There is just no other fiction novel, I believe, that can possible be as good as this book.It's so incredibly thought provoking and engrossing I can't stop reflecting on it.","This is a classic sci-fi drama with interesting survival and sociological study. Long but entertaining and I can recommend it.","This is an enduring futuristic fantasy novel that is hard to put down. The characters are well developed and sympathetic without being heroic. It is easy to image yourself in the protagonist's position, and contemplate how you would react. It really makes you think about what is important in your personal life and in society. An excellent novel for anyone with an active imagination.","This book is so old I was leary about reading it...I have to tell you..even though this book was written so long ago..this book will stick with me forever...the characters are memorable and you are right there with them..you laugh and cry with them!!! i will always remember this book..i am so glad i read it!!!","this is a very well written sci-fi/apocalyptic thriller. it isn't so much as a thriller but an exploration of the human race (in the POV of Ish, one of the most memorable fictional characters IMHO). I love the line \"between the plan and the fulfillment lies the frailty of human life\". so many quotable and thoughtful quotes. this is not for sci-fi readers who like action-packed plots - this book has depth, it satisfied me as a realistic portrait of life after an apocalypse. in fact, if there really is an apocalypse, i believe those who had read Earth Abides will be more than prepared to deal with it.","Excellent book. Still current though written in late 1940's. It is a novel that sticks with you. I have read many disaster books, end of world stories, but I have to say this one is my very favorite.","Lost Books -- Review Number 1 Earth Abides by George R. Stewart D. D. Shade 6/11/98Had Isherwood Williams lived to see our day, with it's social and political decay, he might not have worried so much about &quot;preserving&quot; our culture. As it happens in George R. Stewart's book, the devastating viral plague that cleanses the earth of nearly all human life occurred approximately 50 years ago. Long before the assination of John or Robert Kennedy or Martin Luther King, Jr. Long before the war with Vietnam. Before we put a man on the moon and then cut the space program. Before the pervasion of television and the computer revolution. Before the escalation of the cold war, AIDS, or most of the great serial killers. In other words, Earth Abides takes place in a time that many Americans with gray hair look back upon with nostalgia. The post World War Two years, when those of us between forty and fifty were born. The boomer years. A time of great prosperity. A decade that saw the birth of rock-n-roll, hamburgers, and Oreo cookies. Yet it was a time of great poverty for some. When restrooms, restaurants, and the seats in public transportation were separated by the color of ones skin. When equal pay for equal work was unheard of and a woman's place was in the home. A time when the word 'communist' was the dirtiest and deadliest thing one could call another. An altogether strange time, know as the fifties. It is into this world that Isherwood suddenly finds himself alone. Victim of a freak snakebite while out in the wilderness working on his graduate thesis and survivor of an even more freak accident, the development of a viral plague that wipes out humankind in a matter of weeks. It is altogether fitting that someone named Ish, this is how he signed his name to a hand scrawled will while delirious from the snake bite, should find himself alone in the world. Ish, David Pringle tells us , is a direct reference to the historic Ishi, a California Indian who became famous as the last living representativ! e of his tribe. Ish spends at least a quarter of the book searching for others. He finds a few, lucky people with great immune systems, and in the process stumbles upon the woman with whom he shares the remainder of his years. Together they try to build a community and at the same time rebuild civilization as they had know it. You will have to read the book to learn of Ish's heroic triumphs and failures as he tries to make sure the future has a heritage. Although following the traditional post-apocalyptic formula, that of the earth being cleansed by some means and leaving a few to rebuild civilization, Earth Abides offers some interesting commentary on some central moral questions of our/that time. One of those is racial unrest. Given the nature of European and African American relations in this nation in 1949, Stewart was taking a quite a risk when he developed one particular central character, Em. Ish chooses a strong willed, able, out-spoken, African American woman to be his mate. She was not the first female Ish found, nor was she the best looking, but she had within her the strength to become the mother of a new civilization. Ish recognized this and fell in love with her quickly. And Ish was right-Em alone had the strength and courage to bear the first child in the small community that had grown around them. There was no one who knew how to deliver a baby, and that was frightful enough, but the greatest fear was not knowing if children born into the world would inherit their parents immunity to the plague. Earth Abides is considered a classic by several sources but to my way of thinking, it deserves that exalted position in speculative fiction for having been a forerunner is demonstrating that black and white can live together. Stewart further shows us how important is the relationship between past and future. He does this symbolically through the vehicle of a 4-pound, single-jack hammer. At the beginning of the book, just before the snake bite, Ish is exploring a cave and finds this hammer. It is the! kind miners used in the old days when rock-drills were placed by hand. It is called a single-jack because it can be used with one hand. Ish notes the pleasure he feels when he finds the hammer because of its tie to the past. Even delierous from snake bit, he remembers to take the hammer with him. He keeps it with him throughout the book. As the community grows around Ish and Em, the hammer is used each year to chisel the numbers of the year on a big rock in the hills above where they live. It is always present on the mantel in Ish's living room. And at the end of the book, when Ish has grown old and the younger men, his and other's children, sense that he is ready to pick a new leader for the community, they wait in a circle at his feet for Ish to pick the next leader by giving them the hammer. The importance of tradition to the family and the community is symbolized in the single-jack. John Clute and Peter Nicholls feel that post-apocalyptic or disaster stories are so popular because they appeal to secret desires we all share: a depopulated world, escape from the constraints of a highly organized industrial society, and the opportunity to prove one's ability to survive. I choose the latter of the three. Post-apocalyptic speculative fiction provides a window from which to view the &quot;stuff&quot; of which humankind is made. The writer of a disaster or holocaust story can pit humans against the worst possible odds. The post-holocaust novel gives us the ability to perform an experiment that in reality would be unethical-to put a group of people in hell and record their progress getting out. Earth Abides is a moving, triumpal story of just such a group. No single character in Earth Abides has the stereotypic appeal of Bruce Willis or Nicolas Cage, and yet I came to love them all and worry about their conditions because they were real people. People with many of the same problems and weaknesses I have. People whose actions made me stop and wonder what I would do in the same situation.","I had been really looking forward to this book. Sadly, it really didn't deliver. I found the story telling very linear, the main character Ish, lacking in any real depth and the logic of how he and his small band of people survived, very questionable.I found the first 1/3 of the book interesting. The main character Ish, travels the US in search of other survivers of the deadly plague that ravenged the world. It read more as a travel logue than an sci-fi book, but never the less, was still interesting. However, one would be better served reasing the book, \"A world without us\".Ish, seems nonplused by the vanishing of humanity. The character uses \"logic\" to deal with the situation, but calls those who are enotional or \"crazy\" as being in shock. Frankly, it appeared to me that Ish was in shock, due to his lack of emotion over the loss of basically everyone. It was as if he rationalized it this way, \"wow, everyones gone, oh well, I'm lonely, but that's the breaks\".Finally, gathering enough other stragglers together to form \"the tribe\", they seem to live solely on old can goods from local markers for...22 years!!. I don't know about you, but the last thing I would eat was a can of food that was 22 years old.It appears as if everyone in the \"tribe\" was hit with the stupid stick. Any normal parent would teach their kids the basics of reading and writing, not these folks, it's as if they all just gave up. Plus there is a point in the story where it's highlighted that none of the children even know numbers! WTF? Any normal parent teaches their kids how to count their freaking fingers and toes!Also, the book was written in 1947, yet no one in the book knows a thing about gardening! No one had victory gardens during the war? No one lived on ration cards?It's like all these people dropped out of the sky.There are some many other things wrong with this book, I could go on for pages.Why did I give it 3 stars? 1 for it was a post apocolypic story, the second for the first 1/3 was okay, and lastly, the 3rd star because there were some mildly interesting moments.Beyond that, it's like a group of morons running around in a dark room trying to find the switch.","If you're manic depressive you definitely don't want to read this book. Normally, I love exploring the delicious idea of an end of the world scenario, then having the opportunity to start over. But, I was amazed at how much I hated this book. The characters simply showed little redeeming value and did little but live off the works of the last surviving generation. God, how I slogged through the entire book, hoping that it would get better, that I was going to learn some valuable life lesson or something. It never came. When I finished the book this morning, after reading it in spurts over a period of a month, I really was depressed!The writing is workman like, which is sad, because there's not a poetic line in the whole book, with the exception of the title itself. Oh well.","Having just finished reading Earth Abides, by George R. Stewart, my mind cannot put it down. When I began the book, I expected an apocalypse type novel, and it is that, but it is very much more. I was drawn into the existence of the main character, Isherwood Williams, in such a profound way that I am quite at a loss without him. He is not a formula hero, in that he has human frailties. He is a ponderer and a worrier, much like me. Perhaps that is why I was able to relate to him so easily. He takes nothing at face value, instead he is always fretting, contemplating, and evaluating. His successes are mitigated and his blessings are mixed, as is often the case in real life. There is nothing about the book that is formula, which is a rarity in this genre. On the contrary, it is a truly original work, replete with both adventure and philosophy. The writing style flows beautifully, without an unnecessary phrase or a word out of place. It is a true work of literature, one of the best books I ever read. I am sure that its effect on me will endure, and I will remember this book and its vivid characters for the rest of my life.","I first read this probably 40 years ago and I've re read it over the years, most recently last week.This is a book that stays with you and I was surprised how much I remembered. But I had forgotten just how emotional it was. Stewart's prose seems simple and utilitarian but has real depth of feeling.It's a terrific book.","Very well written and interesting plot. Kept reader wondering what was next. Could not put the book down. I have it on my e-reader and will read again","A friend let me borrow this book to read and I could not put the book down. I do reccommend anyone reading this book, even to this day I still am thinking about the story. It does make you think of how you would be able to work things out when everything you know has disappeared. Great read, I loved this book so much that I had to get a copy for myself!!","I've read a lot of Science Fiction in the past 35 years and found this just ok. I guess I didn't get the underlying message. There was little action, little adventure and basically a bunch of slackers degenerating back into the middle ages. The main character Ish was an odd duck that I could not relate to. I guess I just don't get it.","I felt that this book is very monotonous in how the main character of the book travels around the country looking for people and answers to what happen to the world. he will go in to extreme detail in minor occurrences like seeing something like a body or a hammer. i think this book is very good and has a good plot and deep thesis but i wouldnt recommend this book because it is a slow pace dragging book.","I first read this novel, borrowed from the library, in 1963 and was intrigued by the by the author's detailed descriptions and unique story line. I purchased it in 1987 and re-read it, then loaned the book to a friend and lost track of it - but it was every bit as enjoyable again. Now, I'm 68 and purchased it thru Amazon and re-re-read every word in detail. It is still a tremendously powerful novel and challenges the readers to place themselves in the past and future. What would you do to rebirth a civilization? How could you cope in those first, empty days. What regrets might you have as you witnessed the demise of literature and art? What, then, the consequences as the \"Earth Abides?\"","Isherwood Williams is away in the mountains pursuing his graduate field studies in geology. In our iPhone, instant connectivity world it is hard to imagine the isolation this kind of trip entailed in the 1950's when George Stewart wrote his book. Recovering from a snake bite, Ish stumbles back from the hills to find most of humanity wiped out by disease. We follow Ish through the remainder of his life as he comes to terms with a changing Earth--an Earth on which humanity is a barely noticeable presence.The absence of humanity is not only a stark fact, but is emphasized by the author's writing style. Ish is a clear introvert and we experience much of the Earth's change through his internal monologue. Even when he encounters, interacts with, and teams up with other people, this produces very little dialogue. This style underscores the aloneness of the book's characters. It's not loneliness, in the emotional sense, but a continuing reminder that other people no longer play a significant role in the world.The Earth itself becomes an evolving character in the book. We experience the successive rise and fall in populations of insects, rats, dogs and other species as seasons in the Earth's changing life. The diminishing resources scavenged by human beings from cities and storehouses are important to their survival, but also serve as markers of change as the Earth sheds the thin layers of Man's influence. This change is not progress, nor is it overly mourned as decline. It is thoroughly described and documented as inevitable change. Ish observes it and reacts to it. But neither he nor the other characters influence its path or pace.Read and compare this book with two other classics of post-Apocalyptic fiction:Alas, BabylonandThe Day of the Triffids. These works also follow their characters through crises, scavenging, and attempts to preserve the technology and civilization of the past. They are both more optimistic and more social in narrative style and in the strategies followed by their characters. After reading them, return to Earth Abides and appreciate it for the melancholy and aloneness felt by both its characters and its readers. It is a good story, a moving experience, and a skillful integration of message and writing style.","The premise of this story is the elimination of 99% plus of the human race as a result of a world-wide plague. The plague only effects humans. All other species of life continues to live and in some cases, thrive. Does that sound like something you've read before? I don't think so. In this story the plague kills slow enough to allow the living to bury the dead, thus the streets are not full of dead bodies and the freeways are empty. The remaining few gather themselves into small \"tribes\". The leader of the tribe in our story was a history professor at a major university which is very close to the location of the University of California, Berkley. As a professor he observes the progress, or regress, of his tribe as a student might and creates a tale that would be appropriate for an Anthropology class.Equally interesting to the \"student\" is the impact on the ecology as a result of the loss of mankind. It is truly amazing how much control man has and the impact of his sudden removal. To give even examples would be to deprive the reader of experiencing it themselves. Although not a long book it covers a period of around 70 years or more. It does so by summarizing periods of 10-20 years into short chapters. The author does an excellent job of maintaining continuity in this manner.I would recommend this book hold-heartedly to the serious reader, not because it is a difficult read, for it is actually quite an easy read, but because it is not an action adventure story but a serious look at the possible destiny of mankind. A destiny which I for one would hope we would be better than. The story was written in 1949 but would vary little if written today. An \"end of earth story\" with a very modern premise would be \"One Second After\" written in 2009 which was fascinating to read back-to- back with Earth Abides and which I will be reviewing separately.","Earth Abides is well worth the read. It is difficult for me to suggest precisely why that is so, thus very little actually happens through the course of the book.I suppose there may lay its charm. It's simplicity seems to add plausibility. My impression is that there was much more hype than the title deserved, nevertheless, it certainly deserves some.","With nearly 300 reviews of this book at Amazon, I hardly have to give a summation of the story. I was swept along by the narrative, and I identified greatly with Ish, the protagonist of this post-collapse novel, perhaps because of affinity with his personality. However, I do not give it 5 stars because I happen to differ with the kind of fall-back-into-pre-literate-history climax. Ish should have done a lot more than he did to preserve literacy and a connection with tradition. True, the memory of the Iliad and the Odyssey and the real horrors of the Holocaust is not something we could describe as essential for the survival of mankind, but I could not blithely accept the disappearance of the history and the literature of our human species. There is much that is terrible in our history, but much also that is heroic and even sublime.However, I must say this book is one that will stick in my mind for a long time, and it is rare today to find a book that will have that effect. Most of the books today that are lauded as \"good reads\" are just entertainment for a few hours but are quickly forgotten. Not so with \"Earth Abides.\" You may argue with certain aspects of the novel, and/or certain philosophical conclusions of its author, but once you've read it, I doubt that you will be able to dismiss it or pretend you didn't spend a few hours with the survivors of \"the plague.\"","I read this book when I was a freshman in High School, after it was assigned by a cool female sci-fi teacher. At the time I didn't care much for reading, but I read Earth Abides cover to cover. The book changed me, turned me into a reader and then a writer. That was over 30 years ago, and still I so often think about various sections in the book. Now, here I am, ready to purchase another copy and reread the incredible novel, just to see again how it still so deeply affects me. Earth Abides is powerful, memorable, and deeply moving--it is everything a book should be.","This is, if not the best, at least one of the best books of its type ever.The story is told with a grittiness that makes every page crackle with life. I read it first in high school, and have read it several times since. I was so happy to see that Del Rey Books re-issued this timeless classic in 2006.A whole new generation of readers will be able to enjoy Stewart's amazing novel.A. C.

At first the injury seems minor, but he rapidly descends into a delirium-filled illness. After several weeks, he gradually regains his senses wondering how a simple snake bite could have affected him so strongly. He heads back into town and find everyone gone. It seems a bit odd at first, but Ish thinks to himself that perhaps it is Sunday (he has lost track of time). He eventually comes across a newspaper that describes a devastating plague that has swept across the country, and he becomes aware of the full magnitude of the catastrophe that has struck the United States and the World. What follows is one of the best stories about post-apocalyptic survival ever written.This book is divided into three sections, the first two taking the lion's share of the space. In the first section, Ish discovers the plague, realizes he is one of the few survivors, and decides to take a cross country trek to see who and what else has survived. In the second section, set 22 years after the first, Ish has settled down with a small number of other survivors who start families in the SF bay area. We see the first and second generations of children born after the plague who have no concept or awareness of what we would term modern civilization (and all that implies for better or worse). We follow the slow decay of the remnants of the earlier civilization, and the construction of a new way of life. In the final section, Ish is an old, dying man reflecting on his life and all that has happened. In between each of the three major sections are brief vignettes that cover the major events of the the chapters that are set decades apart.This is largely an introspective tale about Ish's thoughts and emotions as his world crumbles around him and is rebuilt and transformed. If you're looking for a story about a lone survivor battling mutant zombies or some such thing, you'll be disappointed. In the first section, Ish is just trying to make sense of what happened and figure out what he wants to do. In the second, he tries to teach the children of his small community something about what life was like prior to the plague and maintain some continuity with the past. One of the children ask him what an American was, and Ish finds that it isn't so easy to explain. In the third section, Ish is the only pre-plague survivor left in the community, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren now unrecognizeably changed to cope with their new environment. There is some action in this story, but not much. One of the best aspects of this story (and this genre in general) is that the author explores what would happen to all the trappings of modern life if the machinery just stopped. In some ways, the changes would be immediate and profound, in others, changes would take more time.The bottom line is that this sad, introspective tale woven around some Biblical themes is an all-time classic in my view and definitely recommended. There are some outdated (or just plain different) ideas and ways of thinking in this book (Stewart wrote it in the late '40s I believe), but don't let that stop you from reading the book. Stewart conveys a message and asks some questions that are relevant to people and human nature whatever epoch they happened to be born in. People will be reading this 100 years from now. I read this book (along with Alas Babylon) many years ago as a teen and decided to re-read the pair again. There are many powerful images from this book that I still remember now decades later. My view now has changed a bit as I can understand Stewart's central message better, but no matter what you think about this genre in general, this is a timeless story that you'll never forget.","What happens if mankind is almost wiped out yet the infrastruce remains relatively untarnished? What skills are most valuable in such a situation? Once Maslow's hierarchy of needs has been fulfilled, what comes next? Can a society regress but improve simultaneously? Can extreme preventive measures be moral? I love a Mad Max post apocalyptic tale, but the seemingly pedestrian situations and questions posed in this book continue to haunt me long after reading it.","I read this book 35 years ago while in junior high. It captivated me. I pondered (as only an adolescent can) what I would do if I were Ish. What would I do if I came home from a trip into the mountains and found the world dead of a plague. How would I respond? What would I do? How would I survive? How would I cope?I read it again when I was in high school and the same musing returned. I found it in my box of \"things\" several years later when I was 23, after I was married. I sat down that afternoon and read the entire book. Again it affected me - but in a different, more mature way. After I had children, I gave it to my daughter to read when she was 16. She found it to be a very fascinating read on the sociological impact on man of a devastating plague which leaves only a few scattered survivors. I have lent my copy to several people over the years and everyone who reads it finds the book to create emotion and ponder what they would do in such a situation.The mystery and appeal of the book lies in the writer placing the reader into the conscience of the main character named Isherwood \"Ish\" Williams. There are several undertones within the book - one of which is the role of the reluctant leader, the second the \"sacramental\" image of the hammer. It also shows the tendancy of man to desire religion.This book review, I hope, motivates someone to read a book that they may not have read by simply looking at the cover. You will be mesmerized by this well written classic... I guarantee! (I have been mesmerized by it 5 times now in the past 35 years)","I remember first reading this book in High School almost 30 years ago - the story of Isherwood Williams and his struggle to survive in a world where 99% of the people have perished in a biological holocaust. Well written, it keeps the readers attention pretty much throughout. While the book suffers a tiny bit of \"out-dated-ness\" (no mention of cell phones, or the internet) it is still an excellent and well-thought-out read about the demise of our techno-centric civilization. I especially like the way the book takes you through the passing of years, and eventually decades - to a future that makes you step back and say \"Yeah, I can see that happening...\" Enjoy the book, it's a great read!","I just read this book again. I don't know how many times I've read it and I enjoy it each time. I bought it at a used book store in Las Vegas years ago and I'm so glad that I did.","Disappointed. I'm slowly learning to pay more attention to Amazon's negative reviews to get a more calculating grasp of a book's contents.Apparently civilization goes out with a very orderly, civilized whimper. As the police and military forces crumble along with everything else in a matter of months, civil order magically maintains itself with little looting. Perhaps a feasible conclusion to reach, but much more fleshing out was needed to explain the psychosocial motives for such an end to 99%+ of the human race.The author makes no effort to create a story arc--this is a poorly written fictional ethnography, not a novel. The plot mirrors the personality of the plodding, coldly methodical protagonist.Most of the other characters are two-dimensional and cliched, following personality and behavioral stereotypes you'd expect from a 1949 bog standard. While this is feasible /to a certain extent/, the author proceeds with no introspection about it, as though the Leave It to Beaver cast was instantaneously transplanted into a world without people.On the positive side, the author makes distinct efforts to present the ecological side effects of humanity's disappearance. But this saving grace grows old, too, as the novel plods through the decades following the apocalypse.Now that I think of it, I believe that's exactly what the author intended, realism be damned. He imagined a band of primitive hunter-gatherers in the withered skeleton of an American city, and worked backward to see how it would fall into place. Too bad verisimilitude was the first casualty, normally a hallmark of the genre.","I wanted to like this book. I really did...but after getting into it, I had to stop and put it down. The plot is just too unrealistic, and the main character Ish is robotic and boring. As some other reviewers have stated, Ish shows almost no emotion after literally 99.9% of the human race is wiped out. He reacts clinically, robotically, and without apparent emotion after he returns to his parent's house to find everyone dead or missing. \"Hmm, that's interesting. Everyone's dead.\" He takes a freakin' road trip to \"look for survivors\" --yet leaves them all behind--deeming them unsatisfactory companions. This is justified by stating that Ish enjoys solitude. Umm...sorry, I enjoy the outdoors and solitude as much as anyone, and no normal person would react in such a way. Ever hear of the \"mad trapper\" or \"cabin fever\"? That's what really happens to people denied human interaction. Madness. Depression. Paranoia. Suicide. A longing to see another human face.The author, an English professor, must have fancied himself in the role of Ish--a purely logical, Spock-like Vulcan wandering around an empty world. This was a mistake--don't make the protagonist (and hero) of the novel to be a clone of yourself--the savior of the new society, a professor. Gag. I just couldn't buy into that. I also didn't like the author's prose--dry and dull. I can see why some people liked the book, but it just didn't do it for me. I'm thinking things would be a lot more like \"Lord of the Flies\" than \"Earth Abides\"!","The reviews I noticed are fine reports on this fine book. However, one point may have been overlooked. This is the first book I'd read (my first read was back in the 1960s) that used the term ecology. Mentioning this point will deepen the other reviews.","Stewart's books was perfectly creepy and emotional. I identified with the protagonist greatly, and do not feel he was too passive or overly-cerebral. Truth be known, in the few crises I have known, I've often reacted much like him. Okay, I'm a little more attached to things than he is, but I feel this is a plot contrivance to allow the story to go forward.Having read and re-read &quot;The Stand&quot; quite a few times now, I was struck by Stewart's decision (1) not to gather large groups together, (2) not to restart civilization (e.g., electricity, running water, et al), and (3) to cover such a large span of time. &quot;The Stand&quot; covers perhaps up to a year after a plague wipes out 99% of the human race. This book covers over a half-dozen decades. I feel that all three of these decisions demonstrated a far more likely result than King's use of dreams as a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; to gather persons into two camps for the &quot;final conflict&quot; between good and evil.Born in 1976, I am only now becoming aware of these post-apocalyptic classics. I have now finished &quot;On the Beach&quot; by Nevil Shute, &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot; by Pat Frank, and of course this one. The first two dealt with the all-too-real Nuclear Nightmare that even I experienced (though all those younger than me can't even remember there being a USSR). Shute's book was &quot;a stern warning of things to come&quot; and &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot; was more of a man vs. nature story.But this one, it dealt with the nightmare that first captivated me in &quot;The Stand&quot; - a world decimated by plague, leaving the infrastructure intact. While Stewart did not pick up the thread the way I wish he had - that is, some form of civilization being preserved, rather than yet another &quot;Time Machine&quot;-style primitive culture that barely recalls our culture. However, Stewart does spend a great amount of time talking about the decay of this world, and that fascinated me. Storm drains clogging, water seeping into houses and rotting the carpets, termites collapsing houses over the work of decades, dust settling into the corners of the Golden Gate Bridge and grass growing there, and the work of rain and frost on the Northeast roads. All of this riveted me.My biggest complaints are mostly minor, such as (1) how could running water go on for 20 years? (2) why did it take so long for the electricity to run out, and the biggest one (3) why were there no signs of panic (e.g., looting, riots, massive traffic jams as swarms of panicked people ran about in civilization's death throes, et al).My biggest gripe, however, is spiritual. Nobody in this book, even former churchgoers and clergy, feel any need to reach out to God. Admittedly, I'm biased, being a Christian, Biblical scholar, and future University prof. But I am a rational being, and I feel a rational argument can be made for the spiritual side of man, a characteristic that even the protagonist recognizes, even if he can't properly articulate, let alone address, this &quot;God-shaped hole&quot; in each of us.Now, I realize that science fiction, even more than other genres, allow us to paint on a blanked canvas (the devastated world) our worldviews on such things as man's innate goodness or evil, the necessity or redundancy of God (e.g., church, Scriptures, etc.), the expression of our social nature, the necessity (or redundancy) of modern technologically-dependent society, and so forth. I understand that we're not all going to agree; I don't feel it's my job to insist on homogeneity amongs everyone. However, if I wrote a book along these lines, I would make sure to include atheists, skeptics and agnostics, along with members of other religions (at varying degrees of dedication) along with those persons I feel &quot;make sense&quot; from my perspective. While by no means do I feel &quot;all religions lead to God&quot; or that &quot;you just need to be sincere,&quot; I do agree that any description of a post-apocalyptic (or any other) reality, in order to be fair to the multiplicity of human thought and experience, must recognize that &quot;it takes all kinds.&quot;That said, I did find myself chilled by the spiritual apathy evidenced, among other things, by the community's perception of &quot;Evie,&quot; the mentally-challenged pariah. &quot;We don't want no idiot children ruining the gene pool&quot; the protagonist declared in some fashion on numerous occasions. While I may see, in a survival-based world, the necessity of taking precautions, I did feel that the cold and unfeeling attitude (&quot;should we have even let her live?&quot; Ish asks himself repeatedly) was frightfully inhumane. There is no &quot;all are created equal&quot; here, no &quot;all are God's children&quot; here. While I understand expediency, I do not feel it must be carried out heartlessly.However, apart from this one real gripe, I truly do recommend this book to anyone interested by such things, like me. After borrowing this book from a library (copies are hard to find!) I've decided to buy it. I suppose that's the best recommendation I can give...","This novel, Earth Abides, written by George Stewart takes place in San Francisco during present times. A worldwide virus overtakes and wipes out the entire human race, leaving only a select few alive. Of these few is a man named Isherwood who goes in search of other survivors to band with. He meets a woman named Emma and a few other people who start a new civilization. It is not easy, however, and they are constantly hitting head-to-head with nature, fighting for survival. As in any other society, there are some people who challenge the law that was laid down in the beginning. As a result, certain members of the tribe are divided. Unity is essential for survival...will they make it? Only time will tell.The author of this book was probably raised in a Christian environment because there are many Biblical references in this book. For example, one of the characters in this novel is named Ezra, as is an Old Testament prophet. Stewart&#65533;s Christian roots are evident in the way he unravels his novel and the double meanings behind some of his story. For example, a child named Joey is born to Ish and Em that is far more intelligent than any other of the many children. Ish finds hope in this young boy because he knows that Joey&#65533;s outstanding brightness will one day be of great use to future peoples, just as God had much pride in His son Jesus.This novel is a wake up call to the reader in that it brings attention to how weak and vulnerable humans really are. What if mankind were to die today? Would people have their affairs set in order?This novel is a fictional story but has real-life applications. For example, there are real people facing real starvation and shelter needs. Stewart portrays very well the thoughts and feelings of each of the characters, which enhances the story line.Earth Abides is an excellent novel. It is extremely well written and it flows nicely. Anybody thirteen years of age and older should definitely read this book because it captures the reader&#65533;s attention and has the ability to transport the reader to a world no longer inhabited by humans. Younger children may not be able to understand some of the vocabulary in this book and may be easily confused due to the complex plot line. However, I give this book a two thumbs up.","Despite the quality of Stewart's writing, which is elegaic at its best and readable at its worst, this is a very creaky and dated work. Certainly, you have to make some allowances for the culture and time in which books are written, but like John Wyndham, Stewart seems handicapped by an assumption of the rightness of bourgeois values, especially when it comes to women. The book does address this, and in some ways is all about the struggle to maintain these values in a world where they are making less and less sense. But, you get the feeling that, in terms of sociopolitical change (as opposed to the obvious physical change - the old infrastructure has been destroyed), it's a case of 'apocalypse? what apocalypse?'. Stewart's characters are like Hollywood western stereotypes - the men are either upright patriachs or shifty loners; the women are wives and daughters who appear strong but are really just there for breeding and cooking. There are works which do tackle the obvious questions of the use of social roles in a society totally different from that which created them, most notably the vastly under-rated New Zealand film, The Quiet Earth (if I've remembered the name right). Read Stewart by all means: it isn't a bad book, but it isn't the classic it's built up to be.","Many readers will find this book very frustrating. It describes in one lifetime the dissolution of civilization on the planet. We know that if even a handful of humans survive a major disaster they will probably cling to the fundamentals of civilization a bit longer than one generation.In particular we will cling to reading and writing. These are the foundation skills of civilization. Writing systems are one of the foundation stones upon which civilization is built. The notion that we would allow a generation of kids to grow up without teaching them to read and write is tantamount to criminality.But if you stop seeing this as a single generation book, and think of it more as though Ish, the lead character, is able to see through many generations, then the story becomes much more believable.With all the talk of avian flu and the potential for a super virus this book seems eerily relevant to society today. Much more so than when it was written. Throughout the book we have metaphors for the natural balance of nature as we see one rampant population of animals after another expand and then die back to sustainable levels. And the question must always be, is the human population on earth sustainable?The answer is clearly no! And if we don't do something about our population levels and our resource consumption, this book may well represent our future on this planet.","First, I would like to say that just about everything to say about this book has been said. Most reviews are accurate, there are some great characters in this book and Ish does have some intense experiences, however I have mixed emotions as far as this book goes.Ish's long time companion Em, is a reliable and loving character, Ish & The Tribe look to her for strength and wisdom, time & again she delivers. She is loved and respected by all, but when she passes away, her death is all but over in one paragraph. It is similar with old George, he is a lovely character, like a grandfather or old uncle, I would have liked to see a few pages devoted to his passing. This is not the case. This leaves me a little flat.Some parts of the story are deeply moving ie when the boys return after their adventure and a stranger is with them. He is the carrier of desease and when he will not leave when asked, a solution must be found. The elders have to make a decision that chills them all to the bone. Great reading, but when Em & old George die it is almost glossed over.I enjoyed this book, but I would not recommend it as a light read. If you are into PA stories and you like deep intense stories, then I guess this is for you.If you are after action and adventure, stay away.","I know this book was first published in 1949. I can overlook the unlimited shelf life of canned goods and gasoline. It's the main character \"Ish\" who ruined this story for me. He is your typical elitist douche bag who confuses a large vocabulary with intelligence. With a university library at his fingertips, this mental giant could not learn the basics of survival (agriculture, animal husbandry, auto repair, food storage etc...)in his lifetime! I muscled through the book hoping it would redeem it's self in the end, but I ended up losing eight bucks on my kindle and three days of my life. If you want to read this \"classic\" be prepared for constant complaining about the stupidity of others while doing absolutely nothing to better the situation. Hubris abounds with his superior attitude and god complex. He's also a bit of a racist (Not for his use of the word \"Negro\", but for his temptation to use the black people he encounters to make himself king!) and a sexist.","One of the best realistic future novels I have read, I enjoyed reading it many years ago,and reading it again was just as enjoyable, couldn't put it down, its not the usual science fiction story, but a realistic account of how ordinary people would react in these conditions, I highly recommend it I.M.J.","read it in Jr. High and it is still just as great today at age 67.","I found this post-apocalyptic story well written, but a bit slower paced that other titles of this genre. I attribute the pace to the era in which this book was written. I would consider this a must read, especially if you have read On the Beach and Alas, Babylon.","I have read this book several times. Once you start,...it's hard to put down.","I liked this book, though the introduction claiming i would remember the book forever and so on. Well, intro's like that turn me off a bit. It certainly is intriguing in a rather simple way. The later seems to add a certain plausibility which makes it much more believable. It's always a trade off, exchange a little drama for a little more realism. In all, a nice balance. I must say that the book is well written.","An excellent read -- an excellent re-read. The book is both entertaining and thought-provoking. If you like science-fiction with an apocalyptic theme, you will like this work.","great book about the aftermath of humanity and how the world deals with our absence, follows a young grad student from the extinction of man to the establishment of a new human society.","I think this is a post-apocolypse classic because of the unique perspectives the author presents. Rather than focusing on theh flu epidemic that wipes out the majority of humanity, the author focuses on one man's experience of it through the rest of his life as he joins with other survivors and the beginnings of their \"tribe\" come together. There is really less \"action\" than one might expect as the author tells the story of \"post-flu\" life and the subtle, slow changes that emerge as human beings begin living more in balance with the planet. A very beautiful story really as humanity comes to know iteself apart from \"civilization.\"","I did a comparison of this book with Childhood's End for A-level English. Two more different sci-fi books would be difficult to come by and that was the point. Earth Abides is a quiet story, full of the thoughts of Ish and the story of the community he helps found after a plague wipes out most of humanity. There is no scientific details as none of the characters have the expertise to know them. It a human story - not a science one. Some details are given of how the impact of humanity is gradually wiped from the planet and how the survivors - well survive.Don't expect explosive action or tales of daring-do. What you will get is an insightful book - even after all this time - what you will want to read a second and third time. Definitely one to keep - close!!","This was by far the best book I've read in a long time, in terms of pure quality. Coming off a run of John Grisham books before it (and after, I'm reading another Grisham story now), it was amazing how different the quality of the story was, and how much more thought-provoking. Grisham tries for some philosophical stuff in his books, but didn't come close to what you find here.The story itself was Ok...not fascinating alone, though surprising. A few things I certainly didn't expect to happen transpired. But what made it worthwhile was the \"what if\" factor. Imagine living through the apocalypse. Ponder the questions it raises:- What would I do? Seek other people? Focus on survival? How to judge others, and how easily to settle in with them?- How strong are the author's, and lead character's biases in the story? We get their perspective so strongly it's not clear sometimes what the reality is?- What about Charlie? There's no way I'd make the same vote as the characters in the book - so I think. But if I had lived as they had for 22 years, would that change my opinion? How can I know? (answer to that last question - I can't).Is there some deeper answer in the book about what the meaning of life really is? If we strip everything we have today away, we go back to a more primal state where the search for food, water, shelter and safety are paramount in our minds. So how much of what we experience now is a product of civilization and society, rather than our true nature? The memorable line which was something like (I don't have the book for a direct quote) \"I'm happy. Things are as they are and I'm a part of them.\" says a lot doesn't it? Goes back to Buddhist philosophy really - focus on the present. When there's no guarantee of the next meal, when there's no shelter because a fire can burn it all down, when wild animals lurk, how much time do we have to ponder, to worry, to debate? And does that make us happier - meeting our primal drive to just...be?I'd highly recommend this book, my \"top\" recommendation whatever that means. It covers ecology, philosophy, sociaology and so much more...I waited almost two years to read it. It's a shame I waited that long.","I have read this book at least 6 times over the years. It ranks in my judgement with Jules Verne's, &quot;Mysterious Island&quot;, and Johann Wyss', &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot;. I have also read these books at least 7 times as well. I feel the three books could be invaluable in a survival library. They all teach survival in different circumstances!","Typical? maybe today, an age where every scenerio of doom has been played over and over again like some bad rock song. Fear not! This book is good. It was fresh once. . .now it reminds us of what fiction use to be written like. Like a good Doyle or Burroughs. I liked it.","I first read &quot;Earth Abides&quot; in a borrowed copy in the early 1950s ... and many, many times since. My problem then was losing the title --- but never the story. Finally, in the late 1960s, my 15-plus year project of telling the story over and over in search of a title (and a copy of my own) paid off. That copy, well thumbed is well kept. It's on my top shelf, handy for a quick read every couple of years or so. I just finished it again today ... not the first time I've made it through in one sitting and then regretting hitting the last page. In part, the book helped lead me to the East Bay (Clayton) in the 1980s and my time there also makes the story real and special. Now it's back to the top shelf ... the only proper place for this really &quot;great read!!!&quot;","I read this magnificant book over 30 years ago and I still canNOT get it out of my head. I was born and raised in the Berkeley/El Cerrito area. While reading EARTH ABIDES, I could visualize, with extreme clarity, all the areas mentioned in the book. I actually put myself in the possibility of REALITY while: the electricity ran out; the overgrowth of flora/fauna; the animals going wild; seeking tires at dealerships on Shattuck Avenue; seeking other humans in Berkeley, the UC Berkeley library; the creating of another human generation; no racial hostility; etc. I just ordered two more of EARTH ABIDES to give to friends who grew up in the Bay Area. They will be astounded and will love it. Although written in 1949, and what is going on in the world today, was this another prophecy?","Like most of the other reviewers, I too have read this book many times. There is some-thing about this story that stays with you. I can't say I have had the same feeling about any other book.","I read this book over 15 years ago and to this day I still cannot get the story out of my head. I wish I can find another copy so I can read it again and even pass it onto my family and friends.What made this story so remarkable was how logical the story line flowed. Everytime I ponder that faitfull question of being one of few left on Earth, I try to take into account the possibilities of how Earth will &quot;reset&quot; iteslf around me. Would I want to stay in Florida, move back to California, or go on a quest to some distant land and build my own civilization?Anyway, I highly recommend this book for those who have ever pondered the question of being the &quot;last person on Earth.&quot;","I first read this book at 11 yrs old (1965), and have read it 4 more times throughout my life. I continually think about this book and always recomend it to friends. I grew up in the desert with not much to do BUT read,when I finished it the first time I had to start over right away, Ive NEVER done that with ANY other book!!! have fun reading it!!!!!","It was a must read for my Physical Geography class. We were supposed mto read it from a Geographers point of view. My teacher prefaced it with &quot;this book was written in the 40's and it is sexist - so ladies please don't let it irritate you.&quot; I however, didn't find it sexist I found M, the lead female charachter, a strong and wonderful woman. I also liked the fact that there was interracial marriage and poligamy. Forward thinking ideas in the 1940's. All in all it is a good weekend read. But, it is way corny! Especially all the text in italics.","As a long time reader of sci-fi, this novel-EARTH ABIDESs is the single best story ever written. I have read it more than 30 times. From the time Ish begins his relent measures to understand what has happen, the start of rebuiding a social group, the developement years, and the final bridge location with Ishs' final thought of &quot;Men may come and go but Earth abides&quot; stirs thoughts of --how would you perform in a like setting.","What more can be said? Get it and read it!!! I first read it about 35 years ago and it has stayed with me. The book impressed me then and it impresses me now.","I started becoming interested in the post-apocalyptic genre after watching a few episodes of the TV show \"Jericho\" (which is quite interesting in Season 1). While searching this category on Amazon, \"Earth Abides\" popped up a few times along with several other titles. I picked up a copy and read it last weekend. The plot and the characters are mildly interesting and I guess I should cut it some slack having been printed back in 1949. However, I have to say as you get more than halfway through the book, the story line just seems to drag on and on and is generally pretty boring. As I neared the end I found myself skimming from page to page and just praying it would finally end. The copy I bought was used and I threw it away when I was done to prevent someone else from wasting their time with it.By comparison, I also bought a used copy of \"Alas Babylon\" (also printed in the 1950s time frame) and I can safely say it is a far more interesting read after only being about 100 pages into it.","I was very disappointed in this book. It was slow, boring, filled with uninteresting characters, and the writing was extremely stilted. And I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to accept that automobiles would still operate after sitting around with gasoline in their tanks for thirty years. I skimmed through most of the book hoping something interesting would happen, but I was utterly dissappointed. There are better books in this genre, don't waste your time with this one.","As I write this, negative reviews of this novel (one or two star reviews) are few and far between. However, I am compelled to join the minority. I could not, in good conscience, recommend this book to anyone. Maybe one needs to be an aficionado of the \"End-of-the-World\" genre to appreciate this book, but I found it to be contrived and unrealistic. The idea that most of the population would die off due to disease, but that the book's protagonist would choose to tool around the countryside calmly musing on a variety of generally immaterial and irrelevant matters seems absurd. Also, for quite awhile, he manages to encounter ONLY unsavory or potentially dangerous fellow survivors. The entire un-dramatic tone of the book seems way out of proportion with the incredible tragedy that has befallen the earth.I very, very rarely leave a book unfinished, and will usually force myself to complete any book I start. But, as they say, \"too many books, too little time\". I could not see giving up valuable reading time on a book that offers so very little to the reader, so eventually put this book aside. For me this is the most gravely negative review I could give a book.","This novel is possibly the worst piece of drivel I've ever tried to force myself through, and I didn't make it. I quit, and honestly I almost never do that. Ish is maybe the most detestable figure I have ever had the displeasure of meeting on the page. He's a passive aggressive psycho, a terrible father and leader, and the last man you would want to rebuild civilization. In this type of scenario, anyone with any intelligence that came into contact with him would disengage quickly. I simply might have shot him for being a drain of precious resources. If the whole point centers on the fact that most or any man would fail in this situation, I would have preferred that Stewart kill off Ish in a 20 page short story.","I see many people loved this book, but having just finished it, I just don't get the appeal it has for so many people. I found it incredibly boring and tedious. I do not exaggerate when I say I spent an afternoon struggling with it, nodding off to sleep every two or three paragraphs. To his credit, Stewart raises a number of issues about science and human nature, but it is done in the context of an uneventful story. The first book in years that almost made me abandon it halfway through, but I fought it out to the end. I remained disappointed.","Wow I can't remember the last time I started to hope something bad would happen to the main character in a story. Worst main character in a book ever. Annoying, Lazy, sexist, racist, boring and anti-religionist. Maybe it was the slow story line. Maybe it was the fact that NOTHING happens to the characters after the first 100 pages. I don't know. But I hate this book. I felt like yelling \"Get up and do something!!\" The power goes out and he sits. The streets start to flood and he sits. The water stops running and he sits!! Then he starts to think of himself as a god!! haha. The best part of the book is the end. Why? (spoiler)he dies and you don't have to read anymore.Sorry to ramble but my mind is cloudy now from finishing that \"book\".Do not buy this book. Get it from the library read the first 75 pages then take it back.","This book is dull, slow, and predictable. I read most of it hoping that it would pick up but it never did. I usually like these type of disaster books too. Lucipher's Hammer is ten times better than this one. I really have no idea how this book could have 5 stars.","Having skimmed the other reviews, it seems that one had to read this book as a young person and use those glowing memories to enjoy it. Since I approached the book fresh, the flaws are glaring.The main character, Ish, is pretty dull. There isn't much dialogue in the book, so most speech is communicated through his hearing others and describing what they meant. Since he's not particularly insightful, reading is slow and the pages creep by.Civilization seems completely lost despite the fact that books, machines, etc. remain intact. Ish rules The Tribe, who are a step or so above a Neanderthal group. They even walk from place to place like hunter-gathers. How about using the million and one bicycles laying around if you can't figure out how to get gas for a car?The book is not poorly written, just improbable and boring.","The concept of how civilization slowly succumbs to the forces of nature was an interesting concept. That part of the novel was very good. Ish the main character of the book was the leader of a small community of survivors. He sees himself as the most intelligent of them all and for some reason wants to keep it that way. He locks up a library and only he has access to it. Once children are born and old enough to go to school he cancels it, no children of the new world learn to read. Nobody seems to want to become self-sufficient but relies on the products of a past civilization. A stranger comes to join them and Ish murders him out of jealously that his role might be challenged. From then on he carries the hammer he killed the stranger with, with him all the way to his death. No interest was ever sparked by anyone to learn to read, farm, make things or anything else. Everyone lives off of canned goods for 20+ years. I won't say anything more in case the reader of this has not read the book and would like too. Ultimately I was disappointed but would recommend it anyway.","Earth Abides is a book about no matter what happens to the race of people, Earth will always abide. A Man named Isherwood Williams somehow survives this fatal virus that is going around killing the whole human population. Ish then spends almost the rest of his life driving across the country searching for survivors. When he finally meets a group of survivors he \"marries\" one of them and has about twenty children with her.Ish does find a few survivors, however it was definitely not enough to keep me interested in finishing the book. I thought this book was long, drawn out and sometimes too boring. If George R. Stewart, the author, would have spiced it up a bit with more science fiction things happening. For instance if more abnormal things happening to the humans than just death like it was a flesh eating virus and then something else happened with the virus. The genre of the book is Science Fiction. The plot this author had in mind was a god idea however if it was only about one hundred pages shorter and the ending with the twenty children was cut then it would have been easier to keepinterest.So all in all the book had very few parts that could have beenedited out and still would have made sense. The idea of the book and the plot of the book was good. I like the little reality the book had in it. Again if there were more science fiction, and less pages, it also might have been better. So that is why I gave the book a measly two stars out of five. I think this a reasonable amount and I commend the author on his work. I would recomend this book to someone who loves to read and is interested in books about little science fiction and little reality.","If you like this kind of book, you must read this one. Written in the late 40's, this is the grandaddy of all apocalypse stories.","Earth AbidesEarth Abides, a novel by George Stewart taps into people's fascination of being the last one on earth. In this book the main character Isherwood Williams (Ish) survives arattlesnake bite in the mountains and returns to find almost every single person dead from a cataclysmic plague. Ish survives the plague and explores. While exploring he finds other survivors and they try re-founding American civilization. They live above San Francisco Bay in the Berkeley hills.Although this novel is well written and very real, I did not like it. The author put a lot of thought into it but it just didn't interest me. This book wasn't all boring, it hadsome good things about it. One of which is how it was frightening because this could really happen to mankind if we don't watch out, but there was more dull things than scarythings in this book. I also thought that it was weird that Ish and the rest of the community were so interested in caring on civilization instead of thinking about their own survival.The only reason that I finished this book is that it is based in the bay area and that is where I live so I can relate to the scenery that the author describes. If you didn't live in the bayarea then this would be one more thing that wouldn't interest you.I would not recommend this novel. It is interesting at the beginning but then gets boring. It is too long and the author seems to drag on subjects to the point where I don'tcare anymore. If you were going to read this book I would say it is best suited to high school or college students. If a young person read it I don't think that they would understand it.","This book Earth Abides by George R. Stewart is about a man who passes by a massive disease which basically obliterates the US. This man, Ish, has to come to realization of this huge crisis and try to find survivors. It goes on and on about his thoughts and shows the struggles that he faces it the horrid situation. He goes around america finding survivors and ends up making a huge family in the end.This book was basically boring and depressing because it was just lagging on and on about how he thought of everything. It made you want to fall fast asleep at times too. (something that i obviously did) I am one of those kind of people who likes adventure and this book had none. It just was one of those books that wanted to show how horrible things could happen to us if we don't watch it. It sort of chilling and makes you depressed to think that it could happen. George R. Stewart was probably giving a good message out when he wrote this, but in the sense that people want to live there lives without this catastrophe, it is not very good.I would not recommend this book to kids under the age of 12 because it probably is too advanced for them. Also because kids do not have to worry about this sort of horror happening to them at that young of an age. People who need to sleep at night and want to fall asleep fast, please read. If you like adventure and mystery in a book, please go find a different book.","The book earth abides was about a man who passes up a massive disease that spreads throughout america and basically obliterates it. It has this man, Ish, come to realization of this huge crisis and shows his struggles to find civilization. As he searches through america he finds out that many other people have survived the catastrophe and he starts to make a family. As the book goes on it shows the will of human survival and the horror of this situation.I thought that the book was a little too slow. I am sort of a adventure book reader and this book had slim to none. It just went on about Ish's thoughts for like 2 chapters at a time. It made you want to just fall asleep everytime u read it. It was dull most of the times, but it does make you think how bad it would be if that sort of thing happened to the country.I would say that this book would not be very appealing to young kids because it is too advanced for them. I would recommend this to people who need to fall asleep at night definately. Also if you like to hear about the deep thoughts of a person who has no one to talk to for weeks, read this book. If you are an adventure or mystery reader who likes action, do not get this book.","\"Men come and go, but Earth abides.\" These chilling words written by George R. Stewart leave the reader feeling bare and stripped in the popular science fiction novel \"Earth Abides.\" A novel I read and still can't decide what to think about it.This book is filled with puzzling situations, frustrating moments, and mind-bending problems that make the reader ask, \"What would I do?\"Plague has struck the world, and people are dying by the millions. A lone survivor, Ish, on a mountain camping trip manages to fend off the disease with snakebite. He returns to a frozen, empty world, and is determined to find civilization and life in the seemingly dead planet. Most of the people he meets are in shock, having seen the horrors of death and destruction of the planet and are stupefied, unable to talk sense or even take care of themselves. One man Ish comes across is drinking himself to death; only eating things out of cans and seems only half-alive. Through his journey's, Ish has a growing urge to settle down and establish life as he knew it again. He alone must save the human race.I thought this book was very interesting, at first. The beginning was intriguing and exciting to think about. But after a while, the idea became old, and boring. Ish just begins to muse over the world's pathetic state, talk about how he's the only intelligent person left, and even starts to become a little snobbish to say the least. The way women were used merely as wombs, though logical in such a situation, got a little annoying also. The detail and wordiness left my mind to wonder away from the book, and I even recall something as simple as a storm drain overflowing taking up two pages to talk about. Ish's endless attempts to get people to think and work for themselves also become a bit momentous and bothersome. It really makes you want to slowly go crazy along with Ish, as you read his \"bible\", page after page of musing nonsense. I really wanted to tell him to start enjoying life and give up on trying to control everyone's thoughts and actions, just to let things go. But there were moments of truly beautiful writing and raw honesty that drew me out of the droning slump. When Ish finds something to believe in, though, it was really disappointing to have it destroyed so suddenly. Ish becomes so obsessed with saving the world, he becomes very self righteous and stuck up, he transforms from a hero into someone you are sick of and increasingly angry with. The author looses his grip on the story and turns the book into a guide of what to do if you find out the world's population has come to an end, and it's up to you, being the only truly sane and intelligent person, to save the planet. The character's personalities fade, and you are left with a bunch of names and occasional dialogue.The novel begins with a bang, and ends with a whimper, which makes the reader want to whine as well. It was not something I'd want loved ones to read, but I would highly recommend the first two hundred pages, and then move on to something else. The people who say they truly enjoyed this book through and through, in my opinion, are liars. It's a thoughtfully written piece, and deserves the recognition it receives, but if you are looking to be entertained, find another book, \"Earth Abides\" will leave you out in the cold.","It's amazing how despite half a century of technological advancement the Earth Abides is largely just an expanded version of the Red Plague by John Steinbeck.","Good story, but a bit unbelievable. Characters reasonably developed.Mostly clean, no gratuitous sex or violence, but some crude language.","Excellent book.. Highly recommend it. Very well written. Takes you through generations. a great read!","Dated but thought provoking aptly describes this novel. Set in post-nuclear holocaust America. excellent.","earth abides may have been original when it came out a zillion years ago but it's dated now and can't compete with stories being written today. the hero is some boob who survives the plague only by stepping on a rattlesnake? wow. and then he can't even teach children to read. why not? there are some good moments here and there, but in the end this book is a yawn.","When I write &quot;one of the most memorable books I've read,&quot; that's saying something, because I've kept up a pace of reading at least four books a week since before entering Kindergarten and am now 67. I borrowed EARTH ABIDES from the library a year after it came out, in 1950, when I was a 14-year-old high school sophomore, reading everything and anything labeled &quot;science fiction.&quot; I didn't own the book until fairly recently, but it stayed vividly in my memory. I could call up characters like fussy Maureen, stolid George, loyal Em and the tragic genius child, Joey. I remembered the fascinating journey across America, the vague frustration I felt (even so young) over Ish's passive character and the generally negative slide of the tribe from scavenging off civilization into what appeared almost to be an Upper Paleolithic lifestyle at the novel's end--not even qualifying as barbarism.But it's Stewart's refusal to tread the usual Golden Age sci-fi path and make Ish a superscience hero that makes the novel very special. Ish may be a scientist, he's academically bright, but like many people he's low in energy, street-smarts, and foresight. By and large his motley clan possesses even lower survival skills. They aren't much different from the Valley Girls in another good story in the end-of-the-world genre, the movie NIGHT OF THE COMET. Both are based on an understanding that if the human race's average IQ is 100, half the people who are likely to survive a major disaster aren't going to be awfully competent. Stewart certainly knew that, and it provided both the uncanny realism and the rather depressing pessimism of this story. It's fascinating to note that the other reviewers have noted both aspects of EARTH ABIDES.","George R. Stewart weaves at once a beautiful and hauntingly believable tale with this novel, one that I've never been able to forget...or wanted to. Once considered dated, with the lessening of global nuclear tensions, the scenario Mr. Stewart envisions for a possible worldwide catastrophe, one brought about not by bombs but disease, has once again come to the forefront and become the most plausible ingredient in mankind's demise. More even than the fact that this is a truly enjoyable read is the deeper message Earth Abides shares with the reader as it reaches down and touches our very hearts, defining what it means to be human in an inhuman environment. The symbolism involved in Isherwood Williams' desire to keep a hammer with him for the future as a tie to the past is obviously an unconscious comment on his personal hope of rebuilding a fallen civilization. A hope that goes unfulfilled in his life time and maybe many lifetimes to follow. The insight into the human psyche that Mr. Stewart demonstates as he carries Isherwood from his youth at the beginning of the book to old age and finally death at the end and Isherwood's subtle change of attitude during that process, rings exceedingly true and speaks volumes about Mr. Stewart's keen and perhaps unique ability to put into words what it really means, or at least should mean, to be human. I've rarely read a book more than once because I just don't have the time, but I've read Earth Abides several times since I was a teen and I know I'll read it several more times before I too reach that stage in my life that Isherwood assures us won't be the calamity our youth oriented culture would have us to believe.","Due to a multitude of rude comments regarding this review I will edit to please. Here goes... NON-SPOILER ALERTI can't expound upon this book as some of the reviewers have. Nor can I recall in exact detail everything in the book.But I can add value in this way.... I read this book 30 years ago, and I still think about it. I can remember the xxxxxx, the xxxxx that xxxx the main character, the waves of xxxxx xxxxxx after the event... the xxxx, the forced xxxx, the eventual shut down of the xxxxx xxxxx as the xxxxxxxxx started to xxxxx. The shift from xxxxxxxxxx( for years) to xxxxxxx for themselves.The last breaths of the xxxxxxx and the xxxxxx for the xxxxxxx, the xxxx which every year the xxxxxxx took up to the xxxxx and xxxxx the time since the xxxxx.30 Years.... and I still think about it. How many books, movies, songs... etc... do you expect to think about 30 years down the road. You probably wouldn't even remember the title let alone a rough outline.Will I read it again? Certainly! I ran into a young lady reading this on the subway a few years back, and we had a wonderful conversation... it's that kind of a book.SPOILAGE AVERTED --- Skol","One thing that disturbs people about Earth Abides is its incredible humbling realism about the human condition. People who read it come away profoundly unnerved by the idea that civilization is not something guaranteed to come into existence if we lose it and that it requires an enormous convergence of many different kinds of stimulus to create the energies needed within a race of men to bring it into being. Even the most gifted races of people on the Earth can barely hold it together in the best of times, George Stewart shows us how easily it can all fall apart and remain in a primeval condition for untold generations.The protagonist Isherwood suffers from the same disease that afflicts even the best of men - he lacks direction, loses initiative, becomes too preoccupied with the daily stresses of living and watches his life trickle away in the post apocalyptic environment without ever seeming to summon the right kinds of ambitions to carry out his grand dreams of rebuilding the old world.Stewart was quite prophetic considering when this book was written because many modern anthropologists have since confirmed that many previous civilizations have died out precisely because of this &quot;critical threshold&quot; of the division of labor and sheer numbers of vanished races being too low to sustain a breeding population and achieve the critical mass that leads to a progress oriented civilization. Stewart was very perceptive too be able to articulate this phenomenon and even narrate its exact trajectory following the loss of so many people who were vital components in the world that Isherwood regrets the demise of.The most disturbing aspect for me was that I see much of the exact decay of western civilization going on right now all around us and we have not even have a catastrophic plague yet. The same loss of purpose, of drive, of a sense of our own individual worth as a nation and a desire to maintain our sovereignty is slowly giving way to the degenerative notion of a world socialist government of faceless consumers who lack any culture beyond the food court and cineplex.The terrifying thing about the book &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that it is the story of our world and the modern era ... even before we suffer the inevitable collapse of our civilization in the physical sense. The reality is that we see it all crumbling around our eyes into the multicultural carnival of formlessness and we often find ourselves as helpless and feckless as Ish himself in doing anything about it.Highest rating, possibly on the top 100 list of best fiction I've ever read. I consider Stewart to be the author of a modern classic in publishing this book. It is so much more than simply speculative fiction, it contains eternal truths.","As I look at the many Amazon customer comments, I see a real split between very favorable and unfavorable reviews. This seems to be because some readers are looking for conventional science fiction/fantasy or adventure. Much as I love those genres, this isn't it, so if that's what you're looking for, save yourself the trouble and don't read Earth Abides. If you do read it, don't expect it to be something it's not.Earth Abides is a book for people with a strong streak of curiosity, who cannot resist thinking and speculating about the human condition. If this is you, few books will satisfy you as well as this one. It first captivated me when I was 14 - yes, there are teens who would be very excited by this book - and I am now on my fourth reading. There is no other novel to which I have returned so regularly. If you are possessed of this curious, speculative streak, then you will appreciate the protagonist, Ish, who himself is driven to understand the horrible event that has overcome the world and to raise and shape a new world. You will also appreciate the realism of the action and characters, and the underlying drama of the situation and tragic heroism of Ish, and you will not for a minute miss the contrived drama and heroism that make for conventional action fiction.","I read this book in '75. Since then I've been pretty much obsessed by it and other eoc novels (End Of Civilisation). I've looked for a book that had similar 'feel' to it. Unfortuntaly 'The Stand', 'Alas, Babylon' or 'Swan Song' don't capture the same magic. The closest I've come to simulate the read experience that was 'Earth Abides' is Alfred Coppel's 'Dark December' or Brian Hodge' 'Dark Advent'.Out of all 300+ eoc novels I've picked up over the last 25 years, 'Earth Abides' STILL ranks as the best. It's probably my all time favorite novel...I think I'm going to go read it again...","First published in 1949, this novel won the 1951 International Fantasy Award in Fiction (the first one awarded) even though this is not a true fantasy novel. The International Fantasy Awards were originated by four British science fiction and fantasy fans (Leslie Flood, John Beynon Harris, G. Ken Chapman, and Frank A. Cooper) for the 1951 British science fiction convention. The awards lasted between 1951 and 1957. George R. Stewart (1895-1980) was a Professor of English at the University of California in Berkeley. This well-read novel is about life after a plague has killed all but a few people on Earth. Isherwood Williams, a graduate student in geography, returns from a trip to the mountains to find everyone dead. He travels throughout the land and finds a female survivor. They settle down in the Bay Area around San Francisco and a small community grows around them. As time goes by, Isherwood tries to teach the children reading and the knowledge of the past. As the decades go by, he discovers that he is the only one who recalls the greatness of the past. Humans have become a band of hunter-gatherers. History has come full circle. &quot;...men go and come, but earth abides.&quot; Carl Sandburg considered it one of the best novels of its time. It is regarded by many as a masterpiece and was a precursor for many later disaster novels (note that one of the voters of the International Fantasy Award was J. B. Harris, whose pseudonym was John Wyndham and author of another classic disaster novel, &quot;The Day of the Triffids.&quot; One of the earlier reviewers suggested that Wyndham was a better disaster writer. But, &quot;Triffids&quot; came out in 1951, and Wyndham still chose &quot;Earth Abides.&quot;). The name &quot;Isherwood&quot; is a direct reference to Ishi, the last surviving member of a California Indian tribe who was brought to the University by Kroeber of the Anthropology Department (many science fiction enthusiasts are very familiar with Kroeber's daughter, Ursula K. Le Guin). Ishi is still quite famous in the study of native American cultures. This book has had such an impact in the development of the science fiction genre that it is now required reading for all serious students of science fiction and speculative literature.","Very rarely do I finish a book and immediately recommend it to other people. Mostly books help pass the time and end up portraying the same plot; another female FBI agent trying to catch a serial killer who ends up stalking her. However, after reading Earth Abides I called up my brother and told him to pick it up. The book, while written some 50 years ago is still topical. The book takes you on a journey of how a person survives after a disaster that wipes out almost the whole population. It then takes you deeper, you find yourself emotionally involved with the character. And you realize that George Stewart has moved from an tale of physical survival into a tale of emotional conflict. The transition is smooth and the two easily complement each other. If you enjoy reading about a world where civilization has been wiped clean and a new world must start over. I highly recommend this book. The writing was engaging and intelligent without confusing you. The storyline was deep and involving. Overall, the main character becomes immediately identifiable. The book ends; but the world created by George Stewart lives on in our imagination. And, I believe that is a definition of a good book.","As of this date there are 158 reviews of George R. Stewart's Earth Abides here in Amazon.com. I'm not sure that writing a 159th will really add any value or if anyone will even make all the way to #159 to see it. But I feel very strongly about this book and to the intrepid reader who gets this far, I hope it helps you to decide to give the book a try.I was 12 years old in 1968 when my Mother gave me this book to read. She was (and still is) a voracious reader. But she has never liked or appreciated science fiction. Then again, she never considered this book to be science fiction. I read the book in one day that summer and have read it at least a half dozen times in the 35 years since then. And I would agree. Although often voted as one of the best science fiction books of all time, I don't really think of it as science fiction. Stewart was not a science fiction writer. Rather he was more of an ecological writer looking at how the planet behaves in relation to specific circumstances. Two of his other novels, Fire and Storm are good examples of this.One area I differ strongly from my Mom is, I do have a good appreciation for science fiction as well as other apocolyptic fiction. Ray Bradbury, Frank Herbert, Robert Heinlein, Philip Jose Farmer and Issac Asimov have thrilled and entertained me for years. But Earth Abides was what got me started and remains my favorite piece of fiction.Earth Abides is a simple \"what if\" story. What if virtually every person on earth died and only a handful were left? Given the book's publication date in 1949, it was groundbreaking. No one had really written a novel on this topic before this. Virtually all the other books in this genre owe a debt of gratitude to Stewart. Books such as The Stand by Stephen King, Alas Babylon by Pat Frank, Malevil by Robert Merle, Lucifer's Hammer by Niven & Pournelle and Swan Song by Robert McCammon included.Stewart must have had his influences, but not from a book or author of this kind. Therefore the story does not focus on war or technology or industry (or science fiction). Instead it is a tale of how the people might behave under the circumstances, the struggles they deal with, the decisions they make and the decisions they fail to make. It is also a tale of how the earth changes and the previous efforts of mankind are so easily erased.Some reviewers here have criticized the main character Ish as being too passive. But this is a part of the novel that rings very true for me. How agressive would one be after living through a time when virtually everyone else dies? Wouldn't most people struggle to survive, never mind thrive?I won't give away the plot for anyone who has gotten this far. Plus if you've made it all the way to this review, you've seen the plot described almost 158 times. In the end the book is both depressing and uplifting. It is depressing in that most of man's advancements appear to be lost by the end of the book. But it is uplifting to realize that the earth heals itself and in the end man will start fresh.The book is both a product and a victim of it's time period, the late 1940's. Some of it will feel a little dated, after all it's over 50 years old and think what has happened in those 50 years. But remarkably, it still comes across as fresh. And with very little update could be brought up to present day and still be a powerful piece of fiction.All in all this is a great read for most people. For those looking for a hard core science fiction look at the end of the world, go watch the Terminator movies.","&quot;Earth Abides&quot; is a wonderful literary work. It's a shame that it's catalogued as a work of &quot;science fiction&quot; because it is so much more than that. I'm sure that many serious literary fans have failed to pick up on this teriffic book because of that &quot;tag&quot;.The book has a tremendous &quot;hook&quot; line - that being, &quot;almost the entire human race is eradicated by a terrible catastrophe&quot;. The plot is very believable and amazing when you consider that the novel was written in 1949. Author George Stewart is a great storyteller and has created some very interesting characters. The hero of this book, &quot;Ish&quot;, is both a &quot;superman&quot; and an &quot;everyman&quot;. He is both the leader of his tribe, but also easily led. His development as a person and as the head of his people is a wonderful progression throughout the book. His wife, &quot;Em&quot; exhibits all the great characteristics of the strong woman behind the &quot;great man&quot;. And, let me say that the symbolism of Ish's hammer was a very interesting facet of the book.My only criticism (and it's a pretty minor one) is that the book did not go into enough detail regarding the disaster and how other people throughout the country were affected. I think that this would have added some rich &quot;body&quot; to the storyline.All things considered though, this indeed is a book for the ages.It belongs with some of the best works of that era, such as &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot;, &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, and later &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. As an educator, I would really urge school officials to add this novel to their list of great American Literary selections for high school students.But, do yourself a favor - go to the library or your local bookstore get a copy of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; and delve into this great classic with its timeless message about the unshakeable human spirit!","I read this book based on other reviews - having searched for good post-apocalypse novels. After reading Cormac McCarthy's \"The Road\", I was preparing myself for a depressing, yet thought-provoking read. \"Earth Abides\" was a thrill to read, and I kept turning back to remind myself that it was originally published in 1949! I thought the complete absence of any \"modern\" references to today's highly computerized world would make the story instantly outdated, but in fact, the opposite was true, for if we lost power, we would have to revert to very basic skills, just like Ish and his tribe did. This truly is a book that will stay with me for a very long time. Highly recommended!","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it. This maturity is perceptible all along this work.The story is situated in a world devastated by a sudden pestilence that annihilates most of the humankind. Taking into account the last SARS epidemic that jumped abruptly from China to Canada it doesn't look an impossible scenario.Isherwood Williams comes down from an isolate spot in the mountains to discover an empty world. He starts a search all across USA, from California to New York and back again. He finds only isolate human cells, couples or trios, overwhelmed by catastrophe and in a near catatonic state. Returns to his native town and contemplate with a certain scientific detachment the fading world around him.Mr. Stewart intercalate brief vignettes describing what happens to dogs, cats, cattle, plants, roads, dams, bridges, contrasting them with Ish's daily experiences.Little by little the story grip reader's attention and even if action is somehow slow, the book can't be putted down.Human cells began to draw near each other and a rather feeble structure starts to grow up.This is the story.The author approaches universal questions about survival and extinction; civilization and savagery; social structure and anomie. He also examines religious values, ethics and the ultimate sense of life itself.This book gives the reader a lot of stuff to think about. A very enticing read!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","I read this book over and over, loving it more each time. It gives the reader alot to think about because even though it's ficitonal, it is still possible. It is about a man who goes up into the mountains for some time, gets bitten by a snake and becomes very ill. He rests in his mountain cabin for several days, coming close to death, but eventualy regaining his strength. When he left the mountains and headed back home, he noticed the town was dead...literally. Very well written. I bought a new copy because mine was falling apart. Buy this book.","Like some of the other reviewers, I read this book 25-30 years ago. It changed how I viewed the value of the work we do. Stewart makes a strong case that if we can't maintain the infrastructure of our phyical world (roads, bridges, water works, electric plants, etc.), all our knowledge about the rest of the world is for naught.Stewart also explores &quot;events in nature&quot; and how them affect humans. In his book Storm, Stewart quotes Sir Napier Shaw: &quot;Every theory of the course of events in nature is necessarily based on some process of simplification of the phenomena and is to some extent therefore a fairy tale.&quot;In Storm the phenomena is a Siberian wind blowing south; in The Earth Abides, it is a virus. In both cases the earth is fine, but human are worst for wear.By the way, like The Earth Abides, Storm, and a third Stewart book, Fire, are set in Northern California. Everyone familiar with the great Pacific storms or the forest fires, will find these books fascinating.","I enjoyed this book and appreciated the thoughtful way in which the author depicted how the world could be with only a few humans left in it. Stewart covers a lot of topics (religion, education, environment, race, family, marriage, etc.) and how they would evolve or devolve over several decades. He describes a world where random people are left alive and those people may not be the most suitable people to live under the new conditions. The story moves along fairly quickly and generally kept me interested, if not fascinated.Some other reviewers mentioned how the main character, Ish, seems a little devoid of emotion at times. I agree, but I found another trait in main character more annoying. He spends a large amount of brainpower philosophizing and lamenting the lack of intelligence and motivation in the rest of the tribe. While Ish does some teaching, the children never learn reading or basic math skills. They also never work on any improvement projects or learn to recreate any of the basic disposable items they use regularly. My complaint is that Ish doesn't do any of those things either. I blame him for many of their failings. You could say that his shortcomings are realistic, but it drove me a bit crazy.Overall, this was an enjoyable read.","This book makes me want to explore Amazon's return policy for Kindle editions.Barring that, it has made me learn how to delete items from my Kindle.It has also taught me to pay attention to negative reviews.It is simply awful. Why, then, 2 stars?Well, the story - once you get past its one massively huge, incredibly off-putting major flaw - isn't too bad. Many folks have pointed out factual issues (ever volatile gasoline and canned goods that never go bad), and called these fatal flaws. I attribute them to the publication date: maybe, in 194x, when personal automobiles, gasoline, and canned goods were still fairly new, it simply wasn't known that they both spoil? I don't know, but those details weren't killers for me.What ruined the story, then? The protagonist. Our hero. I've read books with villians who were infinitely more likeable than the main character, Ish. He's a contemptible, amoral, elitist sociopath and I feel dirty having inhabited his mind for the past 2 days.I can kind of understand his elitish judgement of the people around him. Again, consider the context of the 1940s. Even today, college degrees are relatively rare (even though I think many of us who have them forget this fact. They are almost universal in the people with whom I associate, but still only 10% of the US population have them.), and in the 40s they were rarer still. So our disgusting hero was part of an elite at the time, and the majority of the population probably did not possess even high school diplomas. Once I realized that, he became slightly less unpalatable.However, our hero, Ish, views the near extinction of humanity with no more emotion than I view an empty of box cereal in the morning. In fact, I think I have more emotion over the cereal. His reaction to learning his parents have died? Effectively, \"eh, so what. What's in the fridge for dinner?\" Similarly, for no reason, he considers simply shooting the dog that accompanies him and, later, decides to shoot two cows just because. Not for survival or meat, really, just because he had a gun and they were there.He has no qualms about simply looting whatever he needs (a viable survival skill, I'll grant you), but views with contempt a group he encounters on his road trip who didn't move into a more palatial home simply because they could - and who are doing a more effective job of adapting to their new situation.He meets a couple in New York who insist on pretending nothing has changed, and looks down upon him. Yet the rest of the book, he exhibits nearly this exact behavior - living off canned food rather than adapting. He constantly disparages his colleagues in the Tribe for lacking imagination and drive, yet for all his superior intellect and thinking and ideas, does exactly nothing to drive change.I thought, eventually, that the author had made him so utterly horrible deliberately and that, over time, we'd see a metamorphosis in Ish, an awakening in him that he was not the paragon of humanity he believed. There are hints, here and there: his admitting that, though she's stupid, his wife was the true strength in the Tribe, etc. But, in the end, this contemptible human is still full of himself, believing his descendent's view him as a 'god', and, sadly, is still the same, utterly obnoxious, foul human that he started as. He takes pride in this, too, which is pathetic: to have survived the death of civilization, to have had even a weak hand in its rebirth, and to believe that the experience has left you utterly unchanged, that you would have been the same person if society had simply carried on, is truly sad.","George Stewart's super-classic is my favorite SciFi sub-genre--the demise of man by one means or another. Stewart uses a pandemic virus which is a bit cliche--oops, wait a minute, he did it first! Everyone _else_ is the cliche. His writing is dark and literary, brought to life by his protagonist, Isherwood Williams', gloomy, introspective personality. Stewart does not develop the science behind the virus, but given that he wrote the story in 1947, I suppose he can be forgiven. On the other hand, H.G. Wells and Jules Verne forcast many technological wonders in their stories, so maybe Stewart could have gone out on a creative limb just a wee bit more than he did. Nevertheless, the real gem of the story is Stewart's portrayal of the demise of mankind--not the virus that reduced his population to a handful--but the demise of his culture, his literature, his creative energy. It seems we humans are what we are because with great numbers of people scarfing up every last spot of ground and every last resource, each individual has to be ever on his toes just to turn a buck. Take away the people, say, overnight, and the detritus of their civilization becomes easy pickings for the surviving few. No need to grow anything to eat--just open up a can. When they ran out of cans, it was almost as easy to hunt for dim-witted, slow-footed domestic cattle, now living in the wild. But the real casualty was culture. Several generations after Ish, people no longer spoke Ish's English, at least not so he could understand it. Culture too appears to be a product of crowds. Stewart set the bar for this SciFi sub-genre. There have been many since 1949, including my own example listed below, but he has yet to be equalled.--Ejner Fulsang, author of \"A Destiny of Fools\", [...] 2007","This is the granddaddy of post apocalyptic novels. Whenever I read this book I see bits of so many post apocalyptic novels in it. Well written, well delivered. If you like post apocalyptic books then read this one. It wasn't until the release of EARTH THE NEW FRONTIER that I read a better end of the world book than Earth Abides. Both of these are classics in the post-apocalyptic genre.","This is a book that rewards close reading--not skimming. Written in 1949, it is still a haunting and poignant read. Those who dismiss this as cliche must remember that this is the book that gave birth to the cliche, the first truly prophetic biological-apocalypse piece of writing, and all who come after must merely stand on its shoulders. Re-released in the &quot;SF Masterpiece&quot; series, and deservedly so.","Earth Abides is a book concerning a plague that kills off most of humanity and the survivors' attempts to reconstruct civilization. The pace of the book is rapid in the beginning and the reader doesn't have to get very far before they realize something terrible has happened. We are initially with one character, Isherwood Williams, who seems emotionally well suited to survive this tragedy in which 99% of everyone has died in the space of two to three weeks. The story continues with Ish traveling across the country looking for survivors and eventually returning to his home in Berkeley, CA where he meets a woman, Em, and they marry each other. Slowly a group of people calling themselves &quot;The Tribe&quot; forms and Ish tries to lead his small group back towards civilization and away from a more &quot;primitive&quot; existence.Strengths are the good character development as well as interesting asides on how the world is readjusting to no longer having man dominate it. It offers some interesting insights on human nature and societies in general and as a disaster book ranks highly on the list. In a sense it is like The Stand except for that this plague is strictly natural, not a tool for a climatic battle between good and evil. The plague simply comes and kills humanity off and that is that.Some of the negatives are found in the style of writing. This book was written in the late 1940's and the language used is rather dry. The author seems to go overboard on his word usage and sometimes seems to be talking down to the audience a bit.Still, if you like disaster stories you should pick up Earth Abides, it is well worth any effort.Robert Merkamp","I'm not going to defend it; excellence stands the test of time, and this one has been around for decades (1949). I would simply ask you to read it for yourself.\"Ish\" came to be one of my favorite literary characters and an inspiration for my own work.","'Earth Abides' is a classic novel of the end of human civilization and it's rebirth. Unlike other apocalyptic sci-fi fantasy novels in the mold of Mad Max, there are no weapon wielding skin headed cannibals roaming the wasteland. In fact the only violence in this novel is an encounter with a pack of wild dogs and the heart rendering decision the community makes to deal with one of the human survivors. In light of recent research exemplified by books such as 'The World Without Us', 'Earth Abides' is astonishing prophetic and knowledgeable. You might say that this novel is an environmentalist's apocalyptic novel 50 years ahead of its time. The novelist's understanding of modern ecology is amazing considering when it was written. The theme of the novel is stated in the title. Human civilization may disappear but earth will abide. A modern classic that should not be missed.","Isherwood Williams is away in the mountains pursuing his graduate field studies in geology. In our iPhone, instant connectivity world it is hard to imagine the isolation this kind of trip entailed in the 1950's when George Stewart wrote his book. Recovering from a snake bite, Ish stumbles back from the hills to find most of humanity wiped out by disease. We follow Ish through the remainder of his life as he comes to terms with a changing Earth--an Earth on which humanity is a barely noticeable presence.The absence of humanity is not only a stark fact, but is emphasized by the author's writing style. Ish is a clear introvert and we experience much of the Earth's change through his internal monologue. Even when he encounters, interacts with, and teams up with other people, this produces very little dialogue. This style underscores the aloneness of the book's characters. It's not loneliness, in the emotional sense, but a continuing reminder that other people no longer play a significant role in the world.The Earth itself becomes an evolving character in the book. We experience the successive rise and fall in populations of insects, rats, dogs and other species as seasons in the Earth's changing life. The diminishing resources scavenged by human beings from cities and storehouses are important to their survival, but also serve as markers of change as the Earth sheds the thin layers of Man's influence. This change is not progress, nor is it overly mourned as decline. It is thoroughly described and documented as inevitable change. Ish observes it and reacts to it. But neither he nor the other characters influence its path or pace.Read and compare this book with two other classics of post-Apocalyptic fiction:Alas, BabylonandThe Day of the Triffids. These works also follow their characters through crises, scavenging, and attempts to preserve the technology and civilization of the past. They are both more optimistic and more social in narrative style and in the strategies followed by their characters. After reading them, return to Earth Abides and appreciate it for the melancholy and aloneness felt by both its characters and its readers. It is a good story, a moving experience, and a skillful integration of message and writing style.","Yes, this is a must-read. I found it 40 years ago and have never forgotten it. Very realistic, this runs rings around today's fantasy and sword-and-sorcery pseudo-science fiction. Countless derivative novels and movies owe this book a lot.","Earth Abides is not a typical post-apocalyptic novel. It doesn't present a world of mutants, giant cockroaches or bands of marauders. It simply shows the slow and inevitable decay of man and all his works, in the teeth of attempts by the protagonist to restore the old ways of civilization. In that it succeeds beautifully and shows us the grandeur of our world and the majesty of what we have wrought...then compares it to the greater majesty of nature and the eternal gaze of time. The novel works best as a family drama, more Swiss Family Robinson than Mad Max, and has no sensational adventures to offer other than the daily tribulations of life. For man may be a great creature, but he is still small and the world doesn't really need him at all...Earth Abides is the most meditative and serene post-apocalyptic novel I've ever read, and it's recommended for more thoughtful readers who won't be easily bored.","EARTH ABIDES is lauded as one of the most noteworthy post-apocalyptic novels ever written. It was originally published in 1949, and its author, George R. Stewart, was better known as a writer of nonfiction than fiction, but EARTH ABIDES is easily his most recognized work--it has been in print off and on for nearly fifty years.Isherwood (Ish) Williams is a graduate student working on his thesis--\"The Ecology of the Black Creek Area\"--in the wilds of northern California when a virulent virus destroys humanity. When Ish returns to civilization he finds emptiness. There are no bodies littering the streets, no signs of struggle, nothing except the surreal stillness of empty towns, streets, businesses and homes. Everything is gone, and Ish doesn't understand what has happened until he reads the bleak, desperate headlines of the last issue of a newspaper in an abandoned magazine shop.EARTH ABIDES is the story of how Isherwood Williams survives the death of humanity, and with it, modern civilization. He is man of intellect--he mourns the passing of knowledge--and he can visualize the future not as an abstract idea, but as it very well may be. Ish chronicles the remnants of humanity as they form themselves into small tribes. They live off what the \"old ones\" left. They open cans for food; they raid sporting goods stores for firearms and ammunition, and miraculously they survive and grow. Ish begins his journey as an observer, but he quickly finds himself a participant of this new world.EARTH ABIDES is one of the most troublesome novels I have read. It is troublesome for two reasons. The first is the writing--style, narrative, and plotting--drove me batty. In a matter of pages it would cycle from being an immensely powerful and energetic story to a dull, over analytical and tiresome diatribe. One of the reasons for this wild and frequent swing was the frequent, every few pages, interruption of the narrative with an omniscient perspective spoiler: It was italicized and, in a very technical and academic style, told exactly what was going to happen in the next few pages. It interrupted the flow of the prose, and generally annoyed me.Secondly, it was a very unflattering look at just how terrible it would be to survive the death of civilization. There is nothing romantic, or eerie, or wholesome, or evil, as in many other popular post-apocalyptic stories--but rather it showed the difficultly, the loneliness and down right miserable aspects of surviving past modern civilization. It read very realistic--the way it would be if our neighbors suddenly died and one or two of us were left holding the bag: suicides, drugs, alcohol and insanity all the flavor of the day.This aspect of the novel was its strength--Mr. Stewart's visions of desperation were apt and vivid. One example of this is when Ish returns to an empty world, and drives through town after town honking his horn, and then waiting for the answering honk that never comes. Ish's loneliness and desperation is palpable and completely understood by the reader.EARTH ABIDES was a roller coaster ride. I enjoyed it yes, but I also disliked it. It is a novel filled with ideas, but its impact is lessened with the over-evaluation of those ideas. If you enjoy a good post-apocalyptic novel EARTH ABIDES may be the answer, but tread warily, because some of its impact and importance has worn away with the passing years.-Gravetapping","Let me preach: I consider it a crime that _Earth Abides_ is out of print. But I can understand why. It challenges way too many of modern man's notions. It is seditious in the quietest of ways.I had never heard of this book till I wrote a review for _I Am Legend_.Some people compared both books and out of curiosity I picked it up at a used book store.Wow! Why is this book not in the canon of great works of American literature? True, it is a 300 page (in the paperback) _meditation_ by one man on the fall and gradual rise of mankind. I can understand why some reviewers loathe the book. It is an observation, not an adventure. The hero's meditations merely travel through time; through space his travels are almost incidental.Our hero, Ish, is no Odysseus. He is no Don Quijote. He is no Robin Hood or King Arthur or Moses. He is an ordinary scholar, a grief-stricken individual trying to come to terms with post-traumatic stress after witnessing the near-universal death of the human race. All he can do is make heroic attempts to _keep track_ of events and time.His meditations and road trip bring him in contact with stoic people, with depressed people, with defensive people and at one point, his Tribe encounters religious fanatics--all isolated groups of survivors trying to cope and remake society in their image.As _written by Stewart_, Ish's burden and character are not those of a civilization builder but rather of a witness to decay, ruin, and eventual rebirth, in which Ish _realizes_ that hubris and a need to control \"fate/destiny/the future\" drove much human action, human culture, and the human spirit.Ish's insights continually bowled me over as I turned page after page. His meditations on technology, progress, humanity, eugenics, government, economics, religion, philosophy, superstition, anthropology, education, and literacy (all man-made institutions) constantly challenged my views and I began an internal dialogue with Ish's character!Ish/Stewart challenges a lot of notions of what we call progress and culture. Amazing. No wonder some people have hated and, doubtless, will hate this book. Prepare to have your attitudes about culture, and civilization,--and what makes a _great literary character_--challenged.It's not one of those, what-would-you-do-in-this-scenario novels, but rather an exposition of what one man _learns_ from his circumstances. Does he challenge them? Fight back? Does he mold circumstances to his spirit or does he go along with them? Is the \"individual acting upon his circumstance and vice-versa\" _question_ some kind of cosmic constant?There are earthquakes, forest fires, city-wide conflagrations. The daily amenities are gone: water, power, fire/police protection, doctors/medicine, etc. You are on your own. What do you do? Responses are manifold. Ish's response and that of his \"tribe\" is just one. That is the brilliance of this novel. You can understand Ish's actions, but would they be yours? Would any actions make a \"difference?\" What is this \"difference\" and who gauges/judges it? Therein lies the crux of the novel. Those who hate the novel seem to resent this existential/metaphysical point.A harsher critic would say that \"events happen\" in _Earth Abides_ in order for Stewart to make his point. Fair enough. Very few characters are developed with fine detail, but that is not the point of this novel. The novel is _about Ish_, the man, his conundrums and his meditations. Not about what we would have done or written or how we would have developed the \"supporting characters.\"Oh, and the pathos in this book is very real. The human universals occur: love, births, bondings/friendship, weddings, tribalism, leadership-rivalry, loss, death. And even a morally ambiguous, ethics-challenging execution.If a few scenes don't bring you to profound sorrow, well...let's just say _I_ experienced the sorrow and emotion of the scene as the novel unfolded.I will not reveal more, but this sad and haunting novel is worth the read. This is a novel that for some reason reminded me of H.G. Wells's _The Time Machine_. Shelley's \"Ozymandias\" and Yeats's The Second Coming\" come to mind as well. Read it and buy your friends a copy. Be a friend. Be well. The Earth Abides.","In my top 5 Science Fiction Novels Ever.Earth Abides tells the story of one solitary man who survives a global, but short-lived plague by pure chance. The novel chronicles his life from that point until his eventual death and is filled with both adventure and introspection. At times the main character, Ish, is hard to like simply because his reactions are so human it's disturbing. He's no hero, and in the post-Heinlein flood of heroic SciFi novels you could be forgiven for calling this novel slow.Earth Abides reaches the lofty height of my number 3 favorite despite the fact that it DID NOT win either the Hugo or the Nebula Award, in fact it wasn't even nominated. Instead I award it this honor because it is the most brilliant example of the post-holocaust theme I've ever encountered, and that theme is a huge one in the Speculative Fiction genre. This is THE BAR, and no one has raised it in 50 years.Superbly poetic and graceful, Earth Abides is undeniably honest, realistic and human it's long, diary-like journey from start to finish. I could easily see myself as Ish... which is both a revelation and scary thought at the same time.","This is such a great book on so many levels, it's a shame that it's being subjected to negative comments from readers who have totally missed key points about the story. First off, the protagonist, Ish, is a geographer, an informed and detached observer and not meant to be a hero or role model. Please don't ladle 21st-century dramatic or politically-correct expectations onto him. He's more real than that. Second, some reviewers here are complaining that Ish doesn't teach his fellow survivors to read etc. But in fact he tries throughout the second half of the novel to do so. They just won't. Ish gradually accepts that his fellow survivors aren't capable of hard intellectual work, that the torch of civilization is going to be mostly extinguished. Ish theorizes that probably the few, functioning survivors of the global plague are going to be doltish people. The sensitive, intelligent ones that survived went mad and were deemed unfit to join the little tribe of survivors. So Ish has the human clay that he has -- simple, uncurious, habit-driven people. He's constantly frustrated that he can't rouse them to live above the level they quickly sank to -- of hunting and gathering cans from supermarkets, talking about fixing up things but never doing it, etc. The whole novel is about the unstoppable descent of the last survivors into primitivism, despite having all of the knowledge of the world at their fingertips in the library.The stopover in the south at the family of the \"negroes\" deserves to be called passe -- the book was published in 1949 after all.","A young man recovers, from what seems to be snake bite, to find humankind has basically been decimated from a strange disease. That's the way Mr. Stewart's work begins. And where does it go from there? Well, the protagonist procedes to explore the remains of the U.S. Eventually he settles down and begins a new life, in the new world that Earth has become.Even though this book might be classified as a sci-fi piece, it is a little less and more than that:- Earth Abides does not deeply explore the \"sci\" in sci-fi. There are not many explanations for the disease that destroys civilization. And there are not too many explanations either for what comes next in the book.- On the other hand, Earth Abides does a great job in exploring the psychological effects on the survivors of the demise of civilization. Moreover, Mr Stewart stretched his work through time to show us the way the first generations of the world (the survivors' sons, daughters and grandkids) would behave. This is really nice.I enjoyed this book. It really did not make a big difference on me the fact that it was written some 50 years ago (frankly, I'm not really sure if the outcome would have been different if this disease attacked us now).I recommend this book to anyone interested in exploring the possibilities and consequences of a decimation of humankind by disease (not impossible considering the bird flu). Regular sci-fi readers might enjoy it, too.Don't read this if you want a hard-core sci-fi book, if it being 50 years old is an issue for you (no Internet and cable TV here...), or if you don't want to share the protagonist's loneliness.Enjoy!","An aging story. I liked the book on a whole, but the middle and end dragged into tedium.The first half of the book was very interesting to me, and I enjoyed the writing immensely. The last half of the book, on the other had was very, very slow.By the time the end came I was ready for it to be over, and did not much care what happened to everybody after that. good riddance.","The book must be praised for being quite different from most sci-fi of its time. Much of the narrative is spent taking a look at the details of the slow collapse of man's works after he is gone. If you enjoy \"Life after People\" you will enjoy this. However, Stewart's Apocalypse is a gentle one, with little evidence of panic or struggle as mankind fell.I also love that the timeline spans many years, interspersed with important episodes from the anti-hero's perspective. Having a hero that was not a superman was definitely different for the time, as was his pessimism. I loved the cross country adventure and the gradual expansion of the Ish's tribe as it met others. The book felt a little like Asmimov's foundation, which is a good thing.I thought the ending sequence [minor SPOILER alert] concerning how old age affects one's cognitive abilities was particularly well done.This could have been one of my all time favorites, if not for two things :1) the main character's egotism was hard to swallow. Perhaps the author expected he would be disliked? I doubt it however.2) Dated 40's attitudes. It feels racist AND classist (in the author's/Ish's description of the other survivors).I do highly recommend this novel, but with the grain of salt.","I have just finished reading \"Earth Abides\" for the fourth time. The first time I read it I was in my early twenties after having been lent a copy by a friend. Like so many readers, the story haunted me and many years later I decided to buy a copy of my own to read again. It was out of print in the UK at that time but I did eventually manage to obtain a copy in the States. I read it again and again. I am now 59 and the member of a book club which had \"The Road\", another post-apocalyptic story which has recently been made into a film, as one of its reads. This had a rather mixed reception from members and so I told them about \"Earth Abides\". I am delighted to say that every one of our members has read \"Earth Abides\" and enjoyed it.I notice that, like me, 90% of reviewers are happy to give \"Earth Abides\" 5 stars. Out of curiousity I have read the reviews of the minority who give it less than 3 and I have the following comments to make. Those who say \"what happened to all the dead bodies?\" need to read the book again. There are numerous references to what happened in the final stages of the epidemic, the way that they dealt with the dead and the dying, the emergency centres that were set up and the subsequent places that Ish avoided on his travels because of the smell of rotting corpses etc.Another popular criticism of the book is the apparent inability of Ish and his tribe to be creative, to teach the children to read, or to make any progress in salaging anything of the previous civilisation. I have had about 30 years to think about this one myself and I am not convinced that given the small, random group of survivors that Ish had at his disposal, and the lifestyle that they had gotten used to, that things could have turned out differently. For me the whole point of the story was that in a situation where the population slips below a certain threashold it is not possible to hang onto civilization as we know it and that a new civilization has to be born. The children of the tribe instinctively knew this and taught themselves the skills they would eventually need to survive. Think about what happened to previous so-called civilisations in our history to what happened to them in times of climactic change - they disappeared.The haunting part to this whole story is the question what happened next? For me \"Earth Abides\" will be one of the best books I have ever read or am ever likely to read.","Audible.com recently recorded what I think is the first ever audio version of George R. Stewart's classic novel, Earth Abides, so I decided to give it another read. I've read it before of course, but it's probably been almost 20 years since the last time, so I was excited to get into it again.Written in 1949, Earth Abides, is probably the earliest \"modern\" example of a pandemic post-apocalyptic novel. It follows Isherwood Williams, known as just Ish, for a period of about 50 or 60 years, starting after The Great Disaster, an unknown plague that wipes out all but just a few pockets of survivors. We see The Tribe, as they call themselves, started from just seven survivors, as it develops into a group of over a hundred people in the hills of San Francisco.There are hundreds of reviews of the book around the web, so I'll just stick with a few thoughts. It' definitely a good book (it won several awards and is credited by Stephen King as an inspiration for The Stand), and I really enjoyed it myself, but I can see how if you're not a super-fan of the post-apocalyptic genre, you might think it's a little slow in places. The first third or so feels like watching Tom Hanks in Cast Away; there's basically zero dialog as Ish travels around the country looking for other survivors. Even when a few of them gather to start a community, the writing style is mostly descriptive, without a lot of talk.But the material that's covered is perfect for anyone who wonders about how civilization would fare after an apocalypse. Would the children born into the new world be curious about the old one? Would they care to learn to read or to carry on the knowledge of the \"Old Ones\"? Would they view the Old Ones as people like themselves, or would they look on them as gods who created all the indecipherable wonders they see around them?Ish struggles with the answers to these kinds of questions as he tries to preserve and pass on enough knowledge to keep some semblance of civilization, if not simply his people, alive. They face actual dangers, such as wanderers bearing disease, but the greatest threat to the future of The Tribe is their apathy. The few from Before are comfortable enough in their current existence to not want to bother reclaiming the comforts of the old world, and those born after don't know enough about what they're missing to care either. So they live off the corpse of the old world, eating wild animals or out of cans for decades, not bothering to learn how to plant their own crops or keep their own farms.So, if you're looking for a primer on how to keep a small community alive in an urban environment after the collapse of civilization, this isn't it. This is almost an anthropological study, seen as it's happening, of the recreation of society from scratch, and as it goes on, we're not sure if that society will turn out to be recognizable to those of us left behind or not.So like I said before, if you're not a fan of the genre, or are looking for a more action-oriented story, this might not be for you. But for a true fan, Earth Abides is one of the \"Big Ones\", on most every list of the best post-apocalyptic novels ever written, so if you haven't read it yet, you really should.","I first read this book in the 60's as my husband and I were in university. I carried it for about 20 years and lost it and life took over and I never replaced it. But my mind has continued to reflect on passages, in fact, I will tell someone how racial prejudice starts and I got it from this book. It covers a frightening time but the ingenuity, focus, and just \"I will not die\" leaves in the reader ideas that will live with you forever.This morning, I couldn't stand it and went to look for it and found it here at Amazon. Thank you, thank you.","I haven't read this book in at least 35 years yet I feel like I read it only last week. This story was unique in it's treatment of humanity and it's approach to the end of the world. This is not a Man conquers over all obstacles story. The future is bleak but the characters are real humans faced with the end of their civilization. They abide, after a fashion, but not near the same as the humanity we know. I wonder how this might have been done with man's dependence on technology even greater today. This is a classic and deserves more attention.","While doing research in a remote cabin, Isherwood Williams is bitten by a rattlesnake. Emerging from a short delirium, Ish returns to civilization only to find that a new virus has wiped out 99.9% of the Earth's population. Ish sets out to see if he can find any survivors.The story is told in an irregular fashion, slowly detailing Ish's immediate experiences, then speeding into the future only to slow again for years that are more important. I enjoyed the haphazard narrative, but wished that the author had focused more detail during several essential emotional scenes regarding birth and death.The focus of the story revolves around Ish's struggle to preserve the American society against superstitions that threaten to govern the new society. The author touches on many of the possible earth changes that might happen in such a catastrophe. Some systems immediately fail while some last for many years. Fans of Stephen Kings \"The Stand\" will enjoy this similar, yet simpler tale.","Earth Abides was a great book. It is not what you would call an action-packed sci-fi novel. Rather, it is extremely thought provoking. It makes you think about the meaning of life, human relations with other men and with nature, your place in the world, and the value of what you do. Although written in the forties, it is still very relevant because it also makes you question the value of our increasingly faster and busier lifestyles and constant striving for more advanced technology.Yes, like some reviewers did, you can argue with some details, but if this is your main concern you are taking quite a shallow view of it and not seeing the forest for the trees. The beauty of this book is not so much in the details, but in it's enormous scope and ambition.This was a book that I could not put down and one that I think will long influence me.","Earth Abides is an interesting take on the human condition. Whether you agree or disagree with what the author is trying to say, it is definitely a book that makes you think about the story line and characters.While I disagree with most of Stewart's assumptions, it is well written and thought provoking. Definitely a classic that should be read again and again.","\"Earth Abides\" is NOT a science fiction novel, which is probably why many readers...have been disappointed. It is much more a social commentary, a critical examination of the human race, and a thoughtful analysis of where the human race really rates in the grand scheme of things. Thematically, the novel has more in common with Daniel Quinn's \"Ishmael\" than King's \"The Stand.\" Stewart asks us to consider the true meaning of \"civilization\" -- is it all about electricity, running water, and refrigeration? Or is it more about community and survival? Stewart's main character tries valiently to convince the new race of Americans to work together to reform the kind of civilization that led to world overpopulation in the first place (and that overpopulation, he theorizes -- in very Quinn-like reasoning -- results in a very natural plague that wipes out most of the human race). The lessons learned in this compelling novel are both profound and frightening. Could it be possible that some day our ancestors, generations in the future, will look back on us as odd and strange creatures who depended too much on invention and not enough on ourselves? In some ways, the novel is about the conflict between intellectualism and naturalism. In other ways, it's about learning to deal with change. However you read it, \"Earth Abides\" is a terrific book you won't soon forget.","I stumbled across this book a few decades ago when living in Japan for over a year. I was hungry for English words in a good book. It surpassed my expectations! The plot is beautifully developed and makes a surreal world believable. The human struggle and resourcesfullness was absolutely heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time. I cared so much about the outcome of the characters, I couldn't put it down! Very few books lure repeat reads like this one did. After misplacing it during my returning to the U.S., I hunted for a another copy everywhere to no avail. Finally, when it appeared in the dark corner of a small used bookstore, you would have thought I struck gold. Years later, at the end of a job interview, I was asked to name my favorite book--probably to ensure that I was cultured reader. Without hesitation, I recommended \"Earth Abides\" in full glory. The irony is that I'm not typically a science-fiction reader, leaning more toward drama and suspense. Well, that's exactly what this book offers as no other! If you have time to read only one book, make it this one!","I like reading older books, and this one certainly fits the bill as it was published in 1949.It was written in an older style with minimal dialogue. It's also written in the first person which makes it very subjective.I found Ish, the main character, at first, bland and uninteresting. But as I read he grew on me.I would recommend the book as one version of how things may evolve after a widespread plague and only a few survivors.It is well written, although in some scenes I found the dialogue a little too 'bible-ish'. I also found some plot developments a bit unrealistic. I believe it is an ingrained characteristic in humans to want to survive, to lash out at fate and try to beat it. I don't think that, as in this book, people would just give up and live off the remnants of the old world forever (or until the next generation picks up the ball). I think people would automatically try to herd cattle and sheep and try to start gardens and orchards.Another weak point is how the author seems to avoid the harder scenes in the book. When something is done about Charlie, when Joey contracts the disease and it's outcome, and when Ish's wife finally dies. All these main moments in Ish's life are avoided by skimming over them.All in all I do recommend this book, but it is not for readers wanting action. It's for readers wanting to think.I'll remember for while the passage in Chapter 2 of the last secion where we discover that Ish did make a impact on the outcome of the tribe. It reminded me that sometimes just by doing what we think is right we affect the outcome of our own immediate environment, our tribe.","Maybe today the plot of \"Earth abides\" is nothing new, but when it was written, in 1949, it surely was. Professor Stewart's only book in science-fiction quickly turned into a milestone concerning apocalyptic themes. William Brinkley's \"The last ship\", Pat Frank's \"Alas, Babylon\", Nevil Shute's \"On the beach\" and Stephen King's \"The stand\" all come to mind as having similar ideas, although each of the five books mentioned have their own characteristics and deal with the subject of \"end of human civilization\" in unique ways.\"Earth abides\" is more like a one-man chronicle. Isherwood Williams, a reclusive geology student, finds himself a survivor of an unnamed \"Great Disaster\" that has wiped out 99% of humankind. During the course of the book, Stewart tells the reader how Ish, as he calls his main character, learned to live again, without all the comforts of civilization, forming a new family, than a new community. Ish thinks of himself as \"the last american\", and Stewart explains very well why that is so.Although not overtly a \"dark\" science-fiction story - like \"On the beach\", for example -, \"Earth abides\" has a subtle way of making the reader very uneasy and impotent as he turns the pages. This book was written almost sixty years ago, but has a very modern feeling about it - not scientifically, of course, but if we think about how Man deal with his peers and with nature, Stewart's book will ring some known bells.Grade 8.7/10","I fully expected to enjoy this book. I've read piles of books in the same genre - The Stand, The Road, Plague Journals, etc. This is notably different in that there is absolutely no faith or hope - there is no striving for better, there is only just getting by.I was very put off my the narrator's belief that no one else possessed any intellect. I've met loads of blue collar workers who would have done a much better job in getting things started. I simply can't imagine a group of people who would settle for canned food instead of growing their own. Who would settle for no electricity? I can't imagine having access to a library and not researching how to start a power plant back up. There was no planning - just living day to day.I guess I have a different belief about the nature of man. And, as others stated, I don't know that the author had children or interacted with them. They are sponges and want to learn. They can be inspired - he was simply ineffective - it was his fault then that he couldn't get them motivated.","After reading Earth Abides (for the second time, in the early 1960's), I was moved to write to GRS, which I had never before done, with any author!My letter was passed on to his address via his Literary Agent in London, and arrived in San Francisco three weeks after his death.I received a treasured return letter from Theodosia Stewart, his widow, and after a few exchanges of letters, she invited me to come to San Francisco to meet her and that she would give me access to all of his notes and work in the archives at The Bancroft Library at Berkeley University.I took up this offer, and in 1985, travelled to California - my first flight!!!I have written an account, with photographs, of the people I met and the places connected with GRS, many of whom I am still in contact with, and will some day publish this account, but the above serves to show what an effect this book had on a young (38 years) englishman, to pull me across the world.The high points of my visit were meeting Theodosia (Ted) Stewart, visiting \"the house on San Lupo Drive\", and standing on the smooth slabs at Indian Rock Park.All of this came from reading \"Earth Abides\".","I hate to add a note of dissent to all the glowing reviews but this book really frustrated me. It`s not that it was badly written though I found the style a little clinical. I guess that is just a reflection of the personality of Ish, through whose eyes we see the unfolding of the years following the devastating plague. Myabe it was his character that annoyed me so much and basically put me off the book. He seemed to consider himself so superior to those about him and become almost unbalanced in his lofty plans for his favourite son. I found it hard to believe that everyone else in the community apart from him was so darn thick. I also found it very sexist, even though i know that only reflects the time it was written. The author`s attitude to race relations was dedfinitely more forward-thinking than towards women, who were mainly portrayed as baby-obsessed brood-mares. Even Em, the main female character was seen as reacting to events on an instinctual rather than intellectual level.The apathy of the community also bothered me - would people really be this unconcerned about their children`s future? Decades later and they hadn`t taught the children to read so they could learn how to do all that stuff they`d eventually need - like how to make candles, when to plant crops, how to weave fabric, etc etc. I can`t believe they were STILL living off tinned food all those years after and hadn`t even bothered to domesticate any horses or grow vegetable gardens! I prefer the English series Survivors, which I feel tackled the practicalities of having to provide and produce absolutely EVERYTHING necessary to life for yourself much better than this did.","First, as a story, the character development is poor and any drama is virtually non-existent. There are a few opportunities for drama, but in each case, the author fails to draw in the reader and make them care. Similarly, there's little to cause the reader to become invested in the characters. You could read abstracts on the characters and get as much out of them as reading the novel.Secondly, the \"hero\" is annoying and a bit contemptible, but perhaps this is the author's goal. Regardless, it made me like the story even less. In short, the hero prefers to sit around and do nothing while he complains inwardly about the dullness and laziness of his \"tribe\". This goes on, and on, and on... In short, I eventually got tired of the hero's endless elitism and hypocrisy.Perhaps the author's message is that the hero didn't understand while the simpletons did. Perhaps his message was that civilization is overrated compared to a simple and primitive life, we should stop worrying, live in the now, leave the rat race, etc, etc. If so, his delivery of that message is painfully boring and repetitive for the reader. At the end of the book, I really didn't care if there was a message or what it was.On a positive note, the prose used to break up chapters was often well-written. It just wasn't enough to make up for the bad execution on the actual story.","Every time the protagonist passes judgement on other characters, have a drink.Every time the protagonist compares himself to a god or demi god, have a drinkEvery time the protagonist says \"Oh! Mother of Nations\" or \"Oh Joey!\" have a drink.Every time the protagonist refers to himself as the last American despite there being evidence that other communities of survivors have formed, likely with their own elders, take a drink.Every time you find an editing error, have a drink.You may want to take it one chapter at a time so you are not utterly intoxicated. The book was most interesting for the interpretation of what post pandemic America could be like. However, the story moves slowly and the dialogue is stilted and awkward. Not as good as I had hoped for.","I know this is the grandfather of post-apocalyptic fiction but some of the attitudes expressed in this book are so dated and unrealistic that they pulled me out of the story. There are lots of poetic passages and lyrical writing but the hero is surprisingly unsympathetic and uncharismatic for my taste.","The premise of the story is interesting, especially in our time of ridiculous overpopulation of this planet and the ability for any virus to move worldwide in a short time, but the story wasn't especially well written. I really can't see so much of current civilization being lost as Mr. Stewart expects. Also, there wasn't very much character development.","Long ago, when I was about 12, I read a book by George Stewart called Fire. I remember enjoying this book. When I came across The Earth Abides last year I remembered thinking that I might enjoy this one based on my prior experience with his earlier book. Besides I liked the title. Well my enthusiasm started to wane after reading the first 100 pages or so. I started to think that perhaps my taste had changed in the intervening decades. In Fire, I had found interesting his asides where he described the fire and its growth. Here, when he interrupted the story in an aside describing changes to the world and the decay of mankind's works, I found it distracting and thought it broke the narrative flow. Several times I found myself saying \"that is not the way people would behave\" and second guessing the author- fighting against the direction the author was taking us. I thought that perhaps the story, being written in the late `40's, was dated. However, about two-thirds of the way through the book, right about the time when a couple of the colony members were sent on a cross country trip to see what was going on in the rest of the country, I had a major change of heart. It was like a log jam breaking. I suddenly let go of my preconceptions and opened my mind up to his vision, his story. I found the story suddenly compelling and the characters believable, and the writing, while not on the level of a Saul Bellow, moving and effective. I found his description of civilization slipping backward, and the growth of the colony into a tribal, superstitious society, in contrast to the protagonist's scientific \"modern\" leanings, very powerful and imbued the story with a powerful melancholy. However, the book is not necessarily all depressing. Indeed it makes clear that mankind would survive- and the earth would abide until his eventual return. Looking back, writing in the first person was very effective. The final chapter is a beautiful and fitting ending.","I don't think I've ever read a book where the author has done more research than Stewart has done for this one. Not only did he have to do all that research, but he had to sit down and think things through: the rise and fall of ants, the mountain lions running out of food in the mountains, the sheep being lost. It was truly amazing. It also brought to light several things that would and would not happen if man were gone. Some of them are bad and some are good. Stewart gives a fair, unbiased (and likely acurate) picture of an Earth where most humans have suddenly dissappeared.","I found the premise of the book interesting and, for the most part, it was well executed. However, the characters' passivity and lack of ambition is very frustrating. The people who survived the plague seem to have lost the will to achieve! Stewart seems to deliberately portray all characters except Ish and Joey as somewhat limited, despite the fact that they actually contribute more to the continued survival of the community that the \"smart one\". Ish seems content to just go along and then regret that things haven't advanced. Ish doesn't ever seem to gain any understanding that he could have taken the initiative to broaden the scope of the community. Even in the context of the time the book was written, the women are treated as objects. There is no indication of deep thought or emotion from any of them.","I first read this book when I was a teenager and read it again last week (30 years later.) I was surprised at how much I remembered from it (I have completely forgotten books I read 6 months ago!)Of course the book is dated, it was written over 50 years ago and of course technology and social attitudes have changed. Of course the main character is flawed and of course we think we could all have done better, but wouldn't fiction be boring if every character were perfect?I loved the descriptions (in italics) of the breakdown of civillisation, about how plants and animals evolve when \"man\" dissappears.I've looked at some of the reviews for this book and am not surprised that most enlightened readers have given this book 5 stars. Neither am I surprised to see the occasional reader give it one star and to read their vehement reviews. These show that the book has worked and all its readers have strong opinions about it.","This book is with out a doubt one of the best I have ever read. Stewart portrays the end of our world, as we know it and tells the story of a man's need to survive in a world he no longer knows and trusts. This novel is not one of action and amazing death defying feats, but one of a man's introspective thoughts and of the will to live in a world that has been brought down by it's own ignorance and naivet&eacute;. This book is like a huge juicy red stake, there is almost too much meat to handle. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to think, and think seriously about what it means to be human!","A must read for fans of apocalyptic fiction. Even though it was published in 1949 nothing about the book seems dated. It deserves its ranking (by David Pringle) as one of the 100 best Sci Fi novels of all time.","I read Earth Abides the first time over 35 years ago. It is one of the few books that genuinely presents an &quot;end of civilization&quot; as we know it and does it well without a lot of fanfare. This is a discriptive story that I plan to read again.","A friend lent me this book many years ago. I loved it. But I forgot the title and author and when I recently wanted to reread it no one was able to help me. I searched and searched for it to no avail. Finally someone on a sci fi newsgroup was able to help me. This book is fascinating. It is one of my all time favorites. The author has an incredible imagination and you really believe this is what would happen if civilization were to die off. It is so full of vivid details and really makes you think.","This is a book everyone should read; a book worthy of being read over and over during a lifetime. I've read it twice and will probably read it several more times. The subject of a disastrous plague almost wiping out civilization is written in such a way that it's entirely believable. It's fascinating to see how Mr. Stewart's characters face survival. The very last part of the book is a bit confusing, but then life viewed from the point of a very old person may be very confusing.","I throroughly enjoyed reading The Earth Abides because it compelled me to consider what motivations there are for the individual to continue living. I felt the most interesting part of the book was the notion that the individual must actively define what direction his life is to take, the setting of the story added to the importance of this decision and entertained different options and the validity of those decisions.","I read this for a geography class in college. Boy, what a downer. Think Little House on the Prairie meets Mad Max, it's that skewed and contorted. Moments of trying to rebuild are perpetually dashed. In truth, what we have here is the story of a man trying to recreate the past, and how a world gone wrong prevents him from achieving his dream. He is in essence, powerless to do anything about it for the forces against him are nature itself.I do not recommend this book unless you like to read about characters who have no hope whatsoever. I think the one plus is that it's set in the San Francisco Bay Area, so there's a kind of tangibleness to it from this reader.Beyond that, I should've trashed or donated this thing ages ago.","This is one of the great books of the 20th Century. Unfortunately, a poor job was done producing it for Kindle. It seems to me that the print edition was scanned using Optical Character Recognition software and not proofed. It is full of misspellings and incorrect words due to the software limitations. If Amazon expects us to pay for this, they should make some effort to be sure that their product is correct!","The start of this novel was magical for me - so engrossing and so convincing. But then it descends into the comfortable and the suburban. Is this the fate of all human communities? More disappointing was the ugliness of some decisions made by the community - and for me these were far from inevitable or even justifiable. These were presaged on p132 of the SF Masterworks edition - '... except for Evie, the half-witted one, who should never be allowed to have children.' How attitudes have changed since 1949 when this book was written!","This book is about what is wrong with us as humans. The beginning of the book is very interesting as the main character, drives around the country to see what is left in the aftermath of the disease that has wiped out most of the population. After that the book goes downhill. The characters are not that likable. The children are brats, and the adults lack the conviction to make them better people. The items which are in the story aren't realistic (it is very unlikely that gas would not be usable after 20+ years even if stored well), and overall the story just wasn't very interesting to me.","Was disappointed in this book. Expected there to be more action and survivors to be more aggressive in making a better life for themselves. In my opinion people would not act this way in a disaster. They would try to make things better.","This is one of my favorite books of all time and one of the few books that I can re-read. Oddly enough I almost find at times I want to live in the horrible world that is created in the story. Maybe that says more about me than it does about the book though.","I have read this book several times over the years, I really favor this type of fiction (science?) This book is so well written it has stood up to the test of time, as good as any newer fiction of the same genera. Give this book a chance, you won't be sorry. You don't have to buy it, I saw a couple of copies in my local library, I'll bet most full size librarys have a copy. Happy reading.","I loved this book from front to back. Its a beautiful story with characters you can invest in. I have passed it around to many friends and they agree its moving.","This book stands the test of time! A great survival/end of the world book that entertains as much as WWZ (without zombies). Like \"I Am Legend\", Earth Abides tells a great tale of survival of a lone man on earth (without vampires). Love the progression/deterioration of the man made world described here as well as how society evolves. Epic in scope this book covers an entire lifetime, not just a few months or years. I've read this several times and will again one day I'm sure.","Apparently, Amazon shows when a book was last published in the details section, but not when the work was first published. Earth Abides was written in the 40s or 50s.It's an interesting read, but coming with 21st century sensibilities, with ideas of the horrifying chaos and violence should civilization fall from the likes of 2012 (the movie) or Stephen King's The Stand, Earth Abides seems very pastoral and unrealistic. I won't spoil it with too much detail, but two examples are 1) one character is able to drive from California to New York after 99% of humanity had perished. Wouldn't the roads be full of abandoned cars? 2) There's no horrifying killings, rapes, cannibalism, robbery, diseases among the survivors ... something that we know does happen when authority breaks down from real wars in Africa and elsewhere, but in this novel, the only dangers are from failing electricity and running water.I'm not being fair. Stewart is probably reflecting the more naive era of the 1940s or 50s. The book does flow very nicely and I especially LOVE the very nostalgic and melancholic last few chapters of the book.","I first read this book nearly 40 years ago, and loved it. I go back and re-read it about once per decade, and I never tire of it. This was the first &quot;post-disaster&quot; novel, and in some ways still the best. Because it was written in 1949 it's a bit dated in some ways, but the human element is so strong that it still holds your interest; you really CARE about the characters! One of my all-time favorites!","Recently I took it upon myself to read the twelve books describing end of the world scenarios that are being recommended by Amazon in one of its lists. Of the twelve that I read, this is by far my favourite book. George Stewart wrote a story that is both believable and entertaining. In fact, with only a few minor historical references to culture in the 1940's, one could easily think that this book was written yesterday. I regret that the other books written by Stewart are not widely available. I think he's an amazing writer. Buy and read this book. You will not regret your selection.","Though it feels a little dated having been written over four decades ago, &quot;Earth Abides&quot; deserves its place with great 1950s era end-of-the world books like &quot;On the Beach&quot; and &quot;Day of the Triffids.&quot; The scenario is similar to the one Stephen King used in &quot;The Stand&quot; though the plague wipes out a much larger number of people and there is little spiritualism here. What affected me most was the latter part which shows the years passing in the life of the main survisor. I rarely get emotional while reading, but this story did it to me.","Global plague vectored through air travel has beenfeatured in recent films, television specials, andthe news. Set between the European Black Death ofthe late 1600s and this decade's African Ebola,Earth Abides deals with the hope, struggles, andresignation of modern-day plague survivors. Withfewer than one percent of the world's populationsurviving, how would you fare? What wisdom wouldyou pass on to those younger than you? The Centerfor Disease Control intimates that world-wideplague is more a question of When, rather than If.So... how do we begin the day after?Over the years, I've read this provocative bookseveral times, and have enjoyed it more each time.For those who enjoy Crichton's works(Jurassic Park, Congo, or Eaters of the Dead),Earth Abides is a rare find. Kay O'Cullane.","Stewart did an excellent job of putting your hand on thehammer! Classic tale of &quot;What if I were the last man onearth?&quot; Best read out loud at least twice in your lifetime.","I dont write too many reviews any more and I dont want to make this into a flame session but let me get this right Corie (from your review).The book is literally about the last man on earth, and you're indifferent to the character's guarded and self preserving manner. I think you are completely out of sync with the theme, let alone the character. This is a brutally honest portrayal of a human being (with all his short comings) in the wake of oblivion. Not a butterfly in the midst of smoke. It's a reactionary tale, one of struggle and survival. You seem to see it as moment for liberation and righteousness. If anything Corie, you have imposed yourself on this character, in the same vain you speak of.This is the individual, warts and all, and merely hating him does not render this book yucky.As for the racial tone that you claim, as quoted by Powell Timothy \"...its revolutionary (for the time) treatment of racial issues was particularly powerful in the mid-20th century when the book was published, and influenced many contemporary artists, most famously Jimi Hendrix. \"Earth Abides\" was Hendrix's favorite novel, and inspired some of the songs on his first album\"Perhaps, if some of you better relate to decisive characters, you should watch the post apocalyptic TV soap drama, 'Jericho' instead. There you will find your cliche depictions of heroes and villians.","Okay let me tell you how I really feel. WOW!!!I hesitated to buy this book after hearing it did not have much end of the world violence, no undead or lots of dead and has a more clean antiseptic air about it. They were correct but what it lacked in that area was more then made up in the quality and depth of the characters and the uncanny ability of the main character Ish to pull you into the story and carry you along in his experiences. I would compare Earth Abides to a movie from the 30's or 40's where there was more dialog and depth as opposed to many of today's films/books based more on spectacular visual effects and lots of gore but lacking in most every other area and are soon forgotten.(And I like some of those books and movies).Earth Abides has a much stronger human touch or bond as you see Ish from a young man dealing with a plaque that wiped most of humanity away and his final death at old age. What transpired between youth and death for Ish is something I guarantee you will remember for the rest of your life. I have read numerous Sci Fi books and rarely has any reached a level comparable to Earth Abides. This book is a keeper that I will definitely read again in the future.","This book reaches across time and avoids the technology trap. It hits home in many circumstances and is an excellent read. I liked its energy and symbolism. It avoids being grim and actually gives you hope for a disastrous future.","A worldwide virus has killed off nearly all the world's population. Ish starts exploring a world with no rules and few people. He finds some other people and they form &quot;The Tribe&quot; to restart their civilasation. Interesting book, and it actually survives pretty well considering how long ago it was written. There are very few passages in the book that date it significantly.","Earth Abides by George Stewart is one of many post-apocalyptic novels written during the height of the Cold War. However it is quieter and more introspective than most of its peers, something made evident by the manor of disaster that devastates mankind in the novel. Instead of a nuclear inferno, a viral plague almost eradicates humanity. Isherwood &quot;Ish&quot; Williams is trapped in an isolated cabin recovering from a snakebite when the epidemic is unleashed. When he heals and ventures outward, he discovers the near extinction of his species and begins a search for others who immune to the disease.That section is interesting but Earth Abides becomes a truly outstanding novel when Ish discovers others and they found a new society. Stewart takes a sociological approach to this development. He gives a fascinating account of a community completely isolated from other communities and a generation living in a Garden-of-Eden-state, completely isolated from its own past. One of the novel's best moments occurs when an untrustworthy visitor comes to the area and Ish and the other elders must decide what action to take. Their decision will surprise you. Both in the post-apocalyptic genre and the field of science fiction in general, Earth Abides is a gem.","Earth Abides is a fantastic book. When I noticed it was written in 1949 I was a bit concerned, but it was not dated at all. The simple synopsis of the story is that everyone on the planet dies in a plague, except for a few hundred people. The story follows Ish, who was a ecologist or something and is now forced into the role of designing plans for rebuilding civilization. Along with a few others he meets and adds to his community, the book follows Ish's &quot;tribe&quot; for about 60 years. During that time the human build infrastructure deteriorates along with Ish's hopes of quickly restoring an active civilization. I would like to especially credit Stewart for including two long chapters he calls &quot;Quick Years&quot;, where he moves ahead 10 or 20 years. A less confident author would fill that 20 years with the same nonsense over and over making this a much slower and longer book.","It is a mystery how anyone could read this book and feel it is poorly written. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is a heart-breaking, gut wrenching , beautifully written novel. The only fault I had was its' length. I wanted it to go on and on. That is the highest praise I can give any book. Stephen King's Stand is a very good novel, too, but doesnt hit the emotional chords as well as this one does.","&quot;Earth Abides&quot; deals with the collapse of society after a plague has killed nearly everyone in the world. Isherwood (Ish) Williams was in the mountains when this happened, so he was spared the trauma of seeing everyone die around him.&quot;Earth Abides&quot; is probably one of the more realistic apocalypse books. A plague is tidier and more envionmentally friendly than a nuclear holocaust so the world was quite lucky. The survivors who band together are just ordinary people. No military strategists, scientific experts or specialists. No engineers or architects. They have to cope with life in a world without medical services, police, government, or farmers.Over the years, 20th century life is slipping away and Ish's tribe can't bring any of it back. Decades later San Francisco is a jungle and Ish is the last of the old race. The new race are illiterate hunters but they are also a more decent people. They treat the animals as equals, they are happier and have none of the hangups that affected 20th century society before the plague. They'll never know how to split the atom, build missiles, or damage the ozone layer.Because history tends to go round in circles I don't think civilization really died after the plague. It just went to sleep. One day it will come back, maybe in a few centuries. Something new and better. A rejuvinated world, fresh and clean.&quot;Earth Abides&quot; was a good book. It probably wouldn't work as a movie, though. Not after the criticism that &quot;The Postman&quot; got. But I thought Kevin Bacon would be good as Ish. I'm not sure who would play the other characters.","I was really looking forward to this book, and was left feeling really disappointed. I have now read all of what I consider the \"big-4\" of 50's PA literature, I found Alas Babylon and \"Canticle for Leibowicz\" excellent, \"on the beach\" overly depressing and unrealistic (but I was 16 when I read it so my opinion might have changed by now) but Earth Abides left me un-impressed.I thought the central character was so devoid of likeability and compassion it made him entirely unrealistic, in fact he came across as some sort of post-apocalyptic Daily Mail reader who spend a significant proportion of the first part of the book traversing America deciding if anyone was \"good-enough\" to share his planned new civilisation, but found the survivors too emotional, too provincial, too poor, too black, too uneducated etc etc. \"Ish\" would have benefited from a good punch in the face, and the only character who might have offered to give him one was executed for bragging about his carnal adventures whilst drunk.His long suffering and dignified wife Em, also had to make the startling confession that she was of mixed race and was beside herself with gratitude that Ish didn't then and there string her up from a nearby tree (like Charlie).The pace of the story is languid and the descriptions interesting, but for me, the entire book was held back by the attitudes and small mindedness of the central character.I am generally not a fan of the \"marauding biker gangs\" type PA style but in this case, if the Toecutter had rocked up at Ishs' house and decapitated him with some sort of boomerang, then the community and post-plague America would have been done a great service.Sadly, the attitudes of Ish probably just reflected those extant in America in the 50's but that means that the story has dated particularly badly, and although Alas Babylon also suffers from the same malady, the central character in that book is much more human and flawed and this makes that book a more engaging read.I am currently reading \"Summer of the Apocalypse\" which borrows some elements from Earth Abides, but is a much better fit for me in terms of what I like in PA books.","I first read this book when I was twelve and lived very near Berkeley. It was the first time I had seen the word \"ecologist\". The book has stayed with me for the last 59 years. I have reread it many times, and have used it as a basis for many earth sciences classes. While it is in a sense, apocalyptic, it is not preachy, or sensational, but a gentle, detailed reminder that in this day of climate change, it is not earth that is in danger, but our own and related species. That Ish, the protagonist , is an observer rather than a charismatic leader, gives us, as readers, a chance to observe with him the deeply meaningful theme that, \"men come and go, but Earth abides. One of my all time favorite reads.","Man has passed and what remains are the things built to sustain us; our cities, bridges, highways, grocery stores, street signs, power plants and dams, parked cars and canned peaches. These things do not simply disappear. Yet with enough time much will be lost to the weeds, the earth will take it back and intermingle our fallen silver coins with the pebbles of the riverbank.***As one of the founding novels of apocalyptic fiction, \"Earth Abides\" is not only a tale of what comes after global disaster but what is means to be human in the simplest and grandest sense. Although written in 1949, it continues to be praised decades later and for good reason, it is a captivating book that reaches beyond the genre of science fiction and into the heart of humanity. On the surface, \"Earth Abides\" is the tale of Isherwood Williams' survival yet it such an expansive novel that the tale of one man becomes that of all mankind.In our contemporary world we tend to forget (or deny) that individuals are entangled within society for better or worse, but the truth is that we cannot be separate from our culture, our history, and our way of life. I found this novel to be a mindful mediation on what it means to be a part of a community and a sort of Anthropological study of civilization.I was surprised and actually relived to find there were no zombies, no riots, no constant struggle to fight hordes of panic stricken survivors, but a rather calm and quiet end to the human race as it once existed. To be sure it seemed quaint; this notion of a peaceful ending in spite of sudden pandemic and inevitable death, but it was surprisingly optimistic without being wholly nave. Many people would likely continue to follow the rules of society even without the enforcers of law for a while, but with time, these things would matter less and less. And despite many who choose to do no harm to their neighbors, there will always be some men who pose a danger to his peers in malice or self-preservation.","I was surprised how well \"Earth Abides\" held up as a post-apocalyptic novel being read in 2010, even though it was published in 1949 - over 60+ years ago. It was remarkably current, in my opinion. Yes, there were a few politically incorrect/outdated views on women, race and retardation - based on this day and age. But if you read it based on the reality of 1949, some of the ideas put forward by Stewart were actually ahead of his time.This novel is not an action packed, shoot em up, zombies control the earth PA novel. It is a character study on how different people or small groups of people react or shut down in a disaster. And the way they act and react may not be what we would consider to be the best - for the individuals involved or for the salvation of mankind. But I can actually see the events in \"Earth Abides\" happening. Scary to think of but imaginable. This book stands the test of time.","I ordered the audio book based on an article that called it \"one of the best post-apocalyptic novels\". I expected a plot that would detail the heroic efforts of the protagonist to survive and thrive in the world after most of the human population dies. I did not expect the protagonist and his band of survivors to do the obvious - to be scavengers upon the bones of civilization, and to give up or not even try to keep or advance civilization's progress up to that point. The slow realization that the path of least resistance would be the course of action was one of the most depressing and poignant moments I have had in considering the future of humans on this planet. I felt I was personally witnessing the de-evolution of mankind.Of particular interest to me was that the author, George R. Stewart, chose to use a virus as the vehicle that killed most of the inhabitants, not the obvious nuclear holocaust. The fact that atomic bombs were capable of killing off the bulk of mankind was still very fresh in the minds of his readers in the late 1940's. Viruses as agents of destruction seem to be one of the very real swords hanging over our heads today, making us relate to this book even more.","George Stewart's \"Earth Abides\" is regarded as a classic of the overcrowded post-apocalyptic genre, and for good reason. But the book achieved classic status only because its post-apocalyptic setting is a secondary feature of the narrative.Stewart didn't write an adventure story about a loner/survivor who must fend off attacks from marauding mutants. In fact, given the context, there is surprisingly little action at all.Instead, \"Earth Abides\" puts you inside the mind of the main character, Ish, for an extended meditation on the nature, specifically the frailty, of human existence.Stewart ranges far and wide, if not deeply, into an astonishing array of issues, from the personal to the universal. That said, there is a core idea, which the title expresses in part:Earth abides. The dude does not.It is a pagan formulation: Earth 1, Humanity 0. And while I would put it another way, I'm at least grateful that Stewart made me think. Who needs marauding mutants?","This book has been torpedoed by some readers because it isn't \"The Stand.\" While \"the Stand,\" is one of my favorite books, what happens after the world is wiped out by plague becomes highly supernatural. Much as I like that, Stewart shows a much more realistic side of what would happen to whatever few survivors this world might have if a plague took most of us out of circulation. Any possible community would be small, and battle dogs, ants, rats, diseases, and the like. The characters here are never to be forgotten--Ish, Em, Joey and Charlie above all, and the plot stays with you long after the book is finished. I read it in the '80s when I worked on a book assembly line. Imagine my delight that it is now available again. This is up there with \"Alas Babylon,\" and just a bit less depressing than \"On the Beach.\"","Stewart's Earth Abides has long been considered a classic in the sci-fi genre and a classic apocalyptic novel (it even helped to inspire Stephen King's The Stand). And it is no wonder why. Stewart has a highly believable, excellently written story here. Though it does lose something in the the third part of the book, when Ish is an old man. One you should definately pick up.","I think I first read this book when I was about fourteen, and it made a powerful impression on me then, so much so that I could still remember almost the entire story some forty years later. But, given that youthful impressions are sometimes not all that accurate, I decided to re-read this and see if it is really as good as my memory said. It is.The scenario is simple: what would happen if a new virus suddenly wipes out almost everyone? And this is no ordinary disease, as the fatality rate is incredibly high, leaving (at most) perhaps one person in 100,000 alive. With this as a starting point, Stewart looks at his new world though the eyes of Isherwood Williams, who is something of a loner, intellectual in outlook, an observer, rather than a doer. This outlook stands him in good stead in the immediate aftermath of the great die-off, as it gives him a reason to live, to observe just how the Earth will react to the sudden removal of that pesky, environment-changing species called man. And reaction there is: ants, rats, dogs, cattle, cats, wheat, corn - each has its fortunes drastically impacted. Many of these changes are detailed in some interstitial material that is told from an omniscient viewpoint, very reminiscent of the similar technique Steinbeck used in The Grapes of Wrath, and perhaps these sections are just as powerful as Steinbeck's, though they don't have quite the great prose-poetry that Steinbeck had. By detailing these changes in this manner, Stewart makes his scenario both highly believable and very immediate.But Stewart's main focus is what happens to the very few people that are left. Ish eventually finds some other survivors, most especially the lady who will become his wife, Em, and here we find some buried social commentary that probably made this book quite controversial when it was first published in 1949, as Em is not white, a point made very subtly and never directly stated, as one of the clear messages here is that race, looked at from the standpoint of long-term survivability, is of absolutely no consequence.Another point of departure for this work from the standard disaster scenario is that there is no world-saving hero; mankind cannot get back on its feet in short order and re-establish civilization, and that the great majority of survivors would necessarily live off the leavings of the old civilization, for the simple reason that it is far easier to open a can of tomatoes than grow your own. That this same attitude of doing the minimum to survive would carry over into other aspects of post-disaster living, so that there would be little or no effort to teach children how to read or fix some of civilization's infrastructure as it slowly fails, such as electrical power or water supplies, is perhaps a debatable point, but Stewart's depiction makes this very logical and believable. Right alongside of this portrayed attitude is what do people do when there no longer is any `law': what is right and wrong and how do people cope with actions by some that threaten the survivability of the Tribe? The answer Stewart shows to this problem may disturb some people, but it strikes at the heart of the whole concept of `for the good of the many' and what personal moral responsibility is.Some have commented that this book is `dated', and there is some of this, as tube radios and phonograph turntables show just where technology was at the time of publication, but any serious reader will quickly realize that the specifics of the technology are immaterial to the thrust of this work. And perhaps somewhat ironically, there is one item detailed here that is as current as tomorrow's headlines, when Ish pulls down a book from the University shelves which details imminent climate change (keep in mind when this written!) and decides that this, too, is irrelevant to his current needs - the climate will be whatever it is, and mankind will just have to live with it.The last section of this book paints a very powerful picture of just how gods, legends, and social mores become ingrained in a society. Perhaps it's not the prettiest picture of where mankind is headed or how well he'll deal with problems, but it is remarkably plausible and will produce strong feelings of melancholy, despair, and (perhaps) subdued pride.A remarkable work which avoids just about all the pitfalls of typical post-apocalyptic works, and has a great deal to say about just what makes man man and what is truly relevant to the daily business of living.---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)","A virus wipes out 99.9% of the population, leaving the few stragglers left to figure out how to survive, organize (or not), etc. Don't be fooled into thinking that because this book was published in 1949 that it somehow won't be 'with it'. It's pretty well thought out, both in terms of what happens to the people AND everything else (dogs, cats, cattle, crops - things which other authors might leave out entirely), and in a departure (which I won't reveal here) from the usual 'we'll survive and things will eventually return to normalcy' plot so often present in this type of book.","Stewart's novel begins with a science fiction premised used by Stephen King in The Stand -- a virus quickly wipes out most of the world's population -- but from that point on, the two books (and others that have used this idea) are completely dissimilar. Stewart has little interest in the plague itself, and it is covered in a short part of the book. Rather, his interest is in how people react to being deprived of modern civilization. For years, his characters try to keep things going by teaching their children to read, and keeping memories of the old world alive. However, the drastically changed circumstances of their children's lives make this impossible, and the small group of survivors descend to a hunter-gatherer civilization.Stewart also addresses the question of what would ordinary people do who find themselves deprived of the protections of the law, and thus having to make their own difficult choices.Those who read this book expecting a typical science fiction novel will be disappointed. Stewart uses science fiction themes to explore significant issues in much the same way that George Orwell did in 1984. An excellent novel.","Apparently many of the reader-reviewers are science fiction or horror fans and thus compare Stewart's novel with that genre. Those readers are not likely to appreciate the ideas expressed in &quot;Earth Abides&quot;. Stewart was one of the first fiction writers to deal with ecology and human's place in the balance of nature and his extrapolations from anthropological thought of that period (1940's) are exceptional. It seems that many of the readers, without realizing it, got so caught up in the novel that they criticise the protagonist's character flaws as though he were a &quot;real&quot; human wanting him to be &quot;more insightful&quot; and less of a pedantic man. Those flaws appear to make him more authentic.Although classified as science fiction, the term speculative fiction is a better fit. It is interesting that the period of time covered, approximately 1948, to the present day, and although it was written in the late 1940's, it is still fresh today. Looking back, if there had been a catastrophe at that time, we would very likely today be at the point where the novel ends. A hundred years from now the novel is likely to be a classic and hopefully be on a shelf not labeled &quot;Science Fiction.&quot;","I know this is considered a classic, but, in my opinion, it does not pass the test of time. None of the characters, including the narrator, Ish, is engaging, and the passivity of the survivors is hard to accept. I don't need zombies to make PA fiction exciting, but reading about survivors who basically just live as if nothing has changed, happy to eat canned food is dull and depressing.","Well what can I say - if you want a book that will make you think about it not only whilst you are reading it but for a long time afterwards, then this is the book for you. The story is great and I thought Ish's character was great too - I know some people didn't like him (including my husband) - but I think that is just the point. He is a young man with little experience who thinks he knows everything because he has been to university, but really doesn't know that much at all. Sure he's not perfect but who is! He does the best he can and whilst we may not always agree, at least he is a believeable character. It has been a long time since I have read a book and thought \"wow\" when I was reading it and wanted to debate it for hours afterwards. The only other memorable books I can think of are \"Wild Swans\", \"Watership Down\" and \"Day of the Triffids\". This beats all of them! I followed \"Earth Abides\" with \"Timescape\" - which made me appreciate even more just how good \"Earth Abides\" really is.","\"...and the government of the United States of America is herewith suspended, except in the District of Columbia, as of the emergency...\"With those ominous words begins a classic tale of the end of human civilization. \"Ish\" (a graduate student whose given name is Isherwood Williams) is the barely tolerable protagonist who survives a rattlesnake bite (and possibly some strange infection) only to leave the forest and find a world of ghost towns. As Ish discovers, while he was in seclusion, engaged in fieldwork for his thesis, a virulent plague broke out worldwide and eliminated virtually every other human being from the face of the earth. Instead of descending into a drunken madness like one of the few survivors he meets, Ish roadtrips across the country looking for a vestige of the learned civilization he remembers. Alas, his quest comes up empty-handed, for, as he discovers, not many people have survived the plague, and those who did are (understandably) not too interested in higher education or high culture, preferring instead to focus on subsistence and maintaining their sanity. Along the way he picks up a loyal friend in the form of a dog, and finally returns to the Bay Area of California, where he meets a group of survivors and sets out to re-establish some kind of human community. In the second half of the novel, we follow the growth of this community and are faced with Ish's growing apprehension about humanity's future. Much to his chagrin, the aspects of civilization he prizes so much--music and art appreciation, reading and literature, mathematics and philosophy, etc.--seem to have no place in this new world where humans are once again a part of the natural order and not her proud conquerors.While the novel itself is quite a good read, filled with interesting speculative insights into human life after the collapse of modern civilization, Ish provides an aggravating example of the 1940s American white male ivory tower academic (his character's qualities definitely date the novel). When he encounters black survivors in the South, he muses about the possibilities of exploiting them and establishing his own little fiefdom. He continually considers his cohorts in the new community as his intellectual inferiors, even as they manage to carve out a new life in the face of this overwhelming calamity while he reads his books. That he spends more time worrying about the restoration of high civilization than about the very real issues of day-to-day survival that they face was also incredibly infuriating. Ish is at his most distasteful when he contemplates his son Joey, a boy whose sole worth seems to be the fact that he is bright and can read. Somehow, though, in spite of all his character flaws, Isherwood Williams ' arrogance and detachment are finally overcome by his circumstances, and he has, if not a complete change of heart, then at least an acceptance of the reality that \"men go and come, but earth abides.\"","This post apocalyptic book starts off strong with somewhat of a new twist on the traditional post-collapse civilization, as told by one graduate student and his struggle with a life after modern conveniences are gone. He is an observer kept alive as the second wave of deaths wash over the world by a mere need to observe and discover. I'll never forget reading as if with him while he waited for electric power to finally fail. The lights dim slightly and with this realization he waits up as a long time friend passes into oblivion. Several of the concepts are quite dated (the copy I read was re-released in the 70s but still referred to household items long since out of date and probably belonged in the original publication from '49).The main character is faced as being the only intellectual left in a small band of survivors he later deems \"The Tribe.\" This is the placement of the majority of the book and faces the questions of what humans would do with so much time on their hands? How they would adapt to a life with everything they need laying about them, but no deadlines to push them to reestablish a civilized world? It also conicals several things other books leave out, such as the adoption of odd superstitions about \"Americans\" by children who have never known a life with organized government or life outside of their small Tribe. I would give this part of the book a higher score, but the later portion fell short of my expectations and the standards set by the rest of the work.As the book continued it became quite redundant and predictable, and though I had high hopes the book would somehow redeem itself and return to it's previous glory, I was left disappointed. If you are looking for a book with a strong resolution upon completion, this is not a book for you. While I am glad I finished it (the first half was quite good), and several major problems were resolved, a larger picture of what would happen with the passing of the main character was left unsaid (though a general idea was obvious and alluded to several times). This portion of the book brought down the overall rating I could give.I would recommend this book as an easy read with an interesting take on the traditional end-of-the-world concept.","Earth Abides from George R Stewart is a good book about what would happen if suddenly the entire world population, except for a few, would die from a disease. As such, the book is remarkable as one of the first post-apocalyptic novels in existence (dating from 1949). And it is a very well thought through one too. Aiming for realism, exploring the various effects and problems the survivors would face, it renders the many successive post-apocalyptic stories as merely unrealistic popcorn stories. However, don't expect the story to \"draw you in\". The events are typically kind of boring, and even though there is a distinct set of characters, they never really develop. Further, the writing style is not always really gripping, but rather unexciting. Also the dated moral reflections might be a let down for some, but I suppose that is mainly caused by the time the book is written.The book details a number of time periods: just after the epidemic, 5 years later, 20 years later, and 50 or 60 years later. The time in between is sketched very roughly. The story centers on Ish, a survivor of the mysterious epidemic. Ish is an academic, working on his (PhD?) thesis in Biology. We learn later that if the epidemic would not have struck that Ish would probably end up as a professor (like the writer). Ish is, apparently, the only 'thinker' left on the world, and all the people he meets are about (or under) average on IQ and ideas, but not necessarily in other practical matters. Ish is an observer, not really a natural leader, and he does his best to plan a safe way for the remaining people towards a new civilization. However, it becomes clear, that even though Ish knows a lot and has many skills, that a lot of work and ideas hardly influence the people in his community and that he fails on many great planned things, even though he also has some unexpected success with small but eventually rather important things.The good part of the book, what makes it a classic, is that it explores most issues you can think off about what would happen if such an epidemic would occur. It explores the psychological effect in the beginning, the scavenging of the stores for existing goods, the mingling of very different average people in a group, the effect on the rest of the ecology by the sudden disappearance of men, the effect of aging on materials, infrastructure and goods, the way the average people would face these changes, (small) group interactions, diseases, unnecessary skills (e.g. reading), the automatic development of groups of people, and the limited effect of the ideas of the intellectual few (maybe dealing with some of the writer's own frustrations). And probably I forgot a few explored ideas as well.However, the book is not perfect, and not a classic in the sense of some Heinlein, Clarke or Asimovs that I have read. Some flaws: characters are rather stereotypical, the main character seems to be a bit thick and single minded at many points (irritating sometimes), all characters have a great lack of initiative and many times things just stay as they are, but also not all ideas are fully (satisfyingly) worked out. Also some logical plot holes exist, and timescales of things happening seem to be bended a bit to fit with the lifetime of the main character.However, in spite of the many small flaws I shortly pointed out, I can still recommend the book. It is not for everyone, and certainly not for people that look for a really exciting story, but the discussed ideas and the thoroughness in which many of those are explored (making it a kind of hard-scifi book), combined with the historical value of this book as a very early post-apocalyptic book make this book really valuable and read-worthy. If you are not immediately letdown by its flaws and if you are interested in idea-books and speculative fiction, I would certainly give this one a try.","I have been searching for this book for the past 35 years. It was a story I have never forgotten since reading it in my teens. I applaude the publisher who has reissued it. Can't wait to read it again and share it with my friends.","Misinterpretations abide, it seems, when it comes to this book. This &quot;disaster&quot; novel merely uses the disease plague scenario as a backdrop to explore human nature. There are many subtle examples here of how individuals develop as adults, how everything people know and believe is dependent on their own life experience and frame of reference. Most of all this is about the myriad of seemingly small things that people take for granted every day and do not even notice, seemingly unimportant things which are really the foundation of society and culture. Here the characters are stripped of all their artificial interests, and are left with only that foundation. The genius of this story is that it will leave you wondering just how independent your own thoughts and views are. There might be many reasons people go in the various directions they go in life, the least of which have to do with independent choices. This book is much more than a disaster novel, it is a fascinating look at sociology in action. And always in the background, amidst all the human trials and tribulations, Earth and non-human life continue as they always have, oblivious to human superiority. Hence the title, and the ultimate humbling message.","One of the better disaster novels to come out in this century, Stewart essentially takes the Robinson Crusoe point of view and applies it to (then) contemporary America, having a plague wipe out most people, even though the rationale that it's because people are too numerous is a little on the shaky side, he should have just taken the Solaris route and said he didn't know. Would have made things more interesting. However, in itself the novel is an excellent and very realistic portrayal of people struggling to live after everyone else is gone. Nobody has any real need for ambition since everything they could ever want is right there. The main character is the only one who can think ahead far enough to see that the children have to be taught so that civilization can come back but when the book ends it's unclear if that will ever happen. The point I think is to show that we're not better than the animals when it comes to civilization and that our intelligence doesn't necessarily make us better, an old point, to say the least but one that should be stated often. Evolutionarily the human race just got lucky and as quick as we rose (a million years isn't that long really when you figure the age of the planet) we can fall just as fast. And the thing that makes Earth Abides so more real is that civilization isn't restarted, to have that happen would seem unreal, a small group of people does not a civilization make and to have them turn into some sort of super-community to go across the US and return society to what it was before would just seem unrealistic and that would have ruined the point of the book. The way it's written now is much more interesting because even though it's so depressing, it feels that much more likely and thus in the end is more satisfying.","I don't think that any of the reviewers have mentioned this, but I think that there are important details in understanding the book. George R Stewart was an English professor (at UC Berkeley), but he has a real strong feeling for the land, landscape, weather and nature. He wrote about storms, the Donner Party, and other geographical subjects, especially relevant to California.The story is set in the East Bay, and has many identifiable locations and views .that add a certain warmth and familiarity to the story, even after six decades. The tribe lived in easily identifiable Oakland/Berkeley hills of the late 1949's.Ish is initially bitten by a rattlesnake in the Sierra, which would have been familiar to many in Berkeley (then and now)-the mountains, not the rattlesnake. He has respectful and loving depictions of the UC Berkeley Library, which Ish needs to break into- Stewart would have used the library regularly. He described the natural changes in animals and plants that would be expected in the hills. He describes a fire which occurs across the Bay, in San Francisco and the northern Peninsula. Finally, the last scene has the tribe walking across the Bay Bridge. That is the same bridge that exists today (although it will be replaced in a few years).BUT the most important thing is his name. Ish (\"Isherwood\") really stands for Ishi., the famous Indian survivor studied by Kroeber at Berkeley in the early 1900's. That is a well-known piece of Berkeley lore, and Stewart was certainly familiar with it. ... Ish, the last survivor of a dead tribe....","A virus wipes out most of humanity within a couple of days. I've read many scifi novels that begin this way, and most of them spend the majority of the subsequent pages describing the ensuing social chaos in dystopian detail. Earth Abides takes a completely different tack. There is no swaggering little Napoleon lording it over a tiny flock of survivors--there are simply too few people left. There is very little deprivation--people can comfortably survive for years on the leftover canned goods in every corner store. Indeed, there is very little drama of any kind.This is more of a character study of two entities. One is the protagonist, Ish, an anthropologist by training who sees his role primarily as that of an observer of the slow, inevitable decay of civilization. He makes half-hearted attempts to save vestiges of knowledge but is mostly content to watch what happens to the environment around him. The question of what would happen to the planet itself--along with all the plants and animals--without its human caretakers, is the true core of this novel. I heard Octavia Butler recommend this book as one that inspired her, and now that I have read it, I can see why. Thoughtful and surprisingly gentle, it highlights the gifts possessed even by apparently unremarkable people to make a life out of what they are given, supported always by the ultimate Mother: Earth.","Being a fan of apocalyptic SF (among other things), I ordered this after seeing it on several peoples's lists of the greatest end-of-the-world/post-apocalyptic novels. It tells the story, of Ish Williams, who is one of a handful of survivors of a sudden plague that kills off something like 99.99% of the world's primate poulation. Earth Abides describes, in linear chronological fashion, the subsequent 50 years or so, following Ish who becomes the leader of a small band of survivoirs and eventually the shaman-like last survivior of the pre-plague people.The book was written in 1949 and feels very dated, in terms of dialog, ideas and socio-political themes. There are distinctly (although thinly veneered) anti-technology, elitist and generic christian motifs running rather crudely throughout, all of which turned me off. In a couple of places, the author's science is arguable or just plain wrong, and some of his plot devices (cars that still work after sitting on a lot for decades) feel contrived. All this aside, the writing itself just isn't that good.The main character, Ish is a neurotic misanthrope. No genius himself, Ish is nonetheless an incredible intellectual snob, judging everyone around him including his loving wife, to be of lower intelligence than he. A young (already lonely and alone) graduate student at the beginning of the novel, this remarkably unlikeable character goes on to comment negatively about the intellectual capacities of everyone who comes along in his life, except for one grandson that he deems worthy to become his successor.There is very little action, and many descriptive passages about changes in the earth and its flora and fauna following the disaster. The latter are fairly interesting, but not as interesting or well-researched as more recent works (e.g., After Man: A Zoology of the Future). The novel is unfortunately, not particularly well written. I guess, being written in 1949, one has to award points for originality, but compared to dozens of novels and a number of non-fiction works published since then concerned with the fate of the earth after man is gone, there is not much here that warrants this novel's amazing longevity.I understand how this novel could have been very popular when it was published. I am, however, at a loss to explain this novel's huge popularity and staying power today. That it remains in print 61 years after first publication is astounding to me, as are all the 5-star reviews. Virtually all of the ideas and themes visited have been done better by others who are much better, and more interesting writers. One particularly acute contrast is with James Van Pelt's \"Summer of the Apocalypse\", that I read immediately after \"Earth Abides\". It is far superior in every respect, although a superficial description of each makes them sound very similar. Nevertheless, they could not be more different.I was very disappointed by this \"classic\" and would not recommend it on any level.JM Tepper","A plague wipes out most of humanity, and one man (Isherwood Williams) tries desperately to save a piece of civilization to pass on to the generations of survivors. The first part of the story deals with his survival of the plague, and his journey around the country looking for signs of survivors.He returns to his home (in the Bay area of California) where he finally meets a woman (Emma) whose courage convinces him to start a family, which becomes a 'tribe' as a few other survivors come to join them. He tries to pass on as much knowledge as he can to the children of the tribe, but his efforts are largely in vain as civilization continues to regress. Ultimately he realizes a way to pass on some very basic knowledge to help his descendants in the future.The author does an excellent job of dealing with the plague, the after effects of such a plague on nature, as well as the slow decay of the cities and infrastructure of our civilization. He also describes well drop into a primitive society that would result from the plague. There is also an interesting moral dilemma when the tribe has to deal with a potential threatening outsider who tries to join them.The flaws of this story are few. There are a few sections which clearly take place at roughly the time when the story was published (1949). As a result, some of the references to technology and personalities make those sections of the story feel a bit dated. This only happens a few times though, and doesn't really hurt the story.This book won the first science fiction award given when it won the International Fantasy Award in 1951. In 1987, it rated 28th on the Locus All-Time Poll of All-Time SF Novels, and in 1998 it tied for 41st on the Locus poll of SF Novels written before 1990.","I read Earth Abides and was stunned with what a great book it was. Its attention to detail was unparalleled, its character development was exceptional, and its plot never got dull. Every part of the book was breath-taking, from the opening sentence to the closing words.Stewart wrote Earth Abides in third person and includes italicized background information which helps the book play before the reader much like a movie. Stewart doesn't just tell the reader the story; it is like they can see it for themselves. The reader is left to ponder many comments made by characters, and is allowed to reach conclusions for themselves. The thought provoking way in which Earth Abides is written was my favorite attribute of the book.Some books can be read and enjoyed, but do not really leave a mark on the reader. This one reshaped the way that I view the world. I have read hundreds of books, and consider this perhaps the best I have ever read. In one word, it was &quot;awesome.&quot;","Do you know the joyous feeling you get when you just happen upon a book quite by accident, read just a few chapters of it, and realize that it will be of great signifiance to you? Well, that was my experience with this book! I can't believe that I was not introduced to this book before now. It is with some sadness that I just completed reading it.My degree of connection with the main character, Isherwood Williams (Ish), astounded me; therefore, I must admit that my reaction to this book is quite subjective. It as is though the author looked into my mind and wrote a book about me in a post-apocalyptic world, including my greatest virtues and worst vices. The descriptions of the thoughts, triumphs, failings, joys, and frustrations experienced by the main character are poignantly honest and real. Metaphorically, this story seems to describe, with regard to many things, my existence in this, our so-far non-apocalyptic, world. For example, I find that I constantly struggle to define what I think to be the appropriate balance of individuality and community/state in our world. If you are one who consciously ponders such things or pursues a study of philosophy, I believe that you will view this book as a masterpiece. It just made my top 10, that is sure.I feel that I have gained much in my reading of this book. Mostly, I come away from this reading experience with a renewed feeling of peace and a reassurance in myself and the human spirit. I will no longer, I think, become quite so frustrated with regard to certain things or people in this world.&quot;Am I happy? Yes, I am happy. Things are as they are, and I am part of them.&quot; - Jack, great grandson of Isherwood Williams (Ish), the Last American.","That about sums it up for me. All others on this theme (with the honourable exception of John Wyndham's \"The Day of the Triffids\") are just cheap imitations. Earth Abides is the real thingCivilisation, and some 99.99% of the human race, is gone. The few survivors, all traumatised by what has happened to them (some more obviously than others, but they all are) either just commit suicide, drink themselves to death, live out their lonely lives in some familiar spot, or, as with Ish and his companions, get together into little \"tribes\".Having already read a few reviews, I get the impression that there are few neutrals on this one. You either love it (the majority, including me) or hate it. For me, Earth Abides' big virtue is precisely what some people seem to dislike about it. Its characters are just dead ordinary. Even Ish, the nearest thing to a brain among them, is too passive and contemplative to be more than a titular head. There are no survivalists who have long been waiting for the day; no jacks of all trades, conveniently endowed with all the needed skills, and above all no \"natural leaders\" (aka bullies and control freaks) out to remake the world in their own image. (Perhaps Charlie had some ambitions that way, but fortunately he is bumped off before the question can arise). They are in fact just a bunch of very average or even below-average people, trying to make a life for themselves amidst the ruins of the world. That, I suspect, is pretty much how such an aftermath would really be.Indeed, on considering the matter, I feel Stewart did a really good job of making his characters internally consistent. They are, essentially, the ones who come through the end of the world - and just react with a shrug. \"The human race is almost entirely wiped out, civilisation's gone and we're all back in the Dark Ages. Now what do I do about breakfast?\" Well, to be fair, Ish does throw up in the sink when it finally \"sinks\" in that his parents won't ever be coming home, but that's where it ends. If he ever considers the matter again, we aren't told about it. The other characters take a largely similar attitude. Em apparently had a family pre-Disaster, but never talks about them, while Ezra and the others have even less to say. They just write off their losses and \"move on\".Well, fair enough. That is probably exactly how they need to be in the situation. This attitude is probably what allows them to come through without being driven into insanity and/or suicide. But of course it has consequences. First off, it implies a decided lack of empathy toward fellow beings. Unlike some reviewers, I'm not particularly disturbed at their willingness to hang Charlie, and to at least consider \"mercy killing\" of the retarded Evie. Given such personalities, this is exactly how they would be. Indeed, it says much for their basic decency that they agonise as much as they do over the first decision, and never take the second one at all. Stewart has made his characters act \"in character\", as an author should.Secondly, however helpful this attitude was in seeing them through the immediate aftermath, it is far less so when it's time to think of rebuilding. Having taken the Disaster itself almost in their stride, they are likewise accepting of its aftermath, and generally take only such action as is forced on them by circumstances. The \"Lewis and Clark\" expedition in Year 22 is distinctly exceptional. And Ish's basically solitary disposition stultifies his attempt to educate the children. The only one he can \"reach\" is an academic loner exactly like himself, after whose death he essentially gives up. Stewart has wonderfully portrayed how the virtues which were such a help at the start of the book have now turned into vices.Loooking back on it (I first read the book at age ten) I have some minor gripes. In particular, the Great Disaster itself seems more than a little \"sanitised\", with mankind dying and all the bodies neatly tidied away, during Ish's two-week absence. Somehow, that does not quite carry conviction. Apart from that, however, my only real complaint is that Stewart was content with a single book, when the theme deserved a trilogy at least.Read and enjoy","Anyone who has read Alas, Babylon or Lucifer's Hammer needs to read this also. The premise is a panepedimic wipes out almost the entire population of the earth. Earth abides, but Man is almost extint. The turning point comes when the main character realizes that civilization as he knew it is over. He then turns his energies into teaching the Tribe to be self sufficient.A very good read, very on point and topical for today's world.","This book was hard for me to read simply because the pain of the main character became my pain while I read. In the aftermath of the end of the world You experience fear, loneliness, pitty, love, hope and finally resolution through the narrator Ish's observations.This is no adventure novel but it is a hard hitting look at just how much we truly rely on the trappings of the industrialized world to get by and how naked we would be without them. Although the book ends on a bit of a hopeful note you can't help but mourn for all that's been lost as well as watching the rest of the world's knowledge die slowly over the generations.This book made me ask what if it were me? A mark of a good thought provoking book.","Earth Abides by George Stewart is an incredible book. It follows the main character, Ish, as he tries to make sense of a world where humans are nearly wiped out by disease. What makes this book special, is that it's protagonist is a deliberate, thoughtful man that brings the story a sense of realism that is rarely seen in this kind of fiction. It is very interesting to see how and if civilization can survive such a \"Great Disaster\". The story benefits by being completely plausible, and even though the book was written over 50 years ago, it is still fascinating today. I highly recommend this reading.","A grossly interesting book, perhaps the actual first, to explore the thought of \"what to do to survive in post-apocalyptic America with little skills and a hammer\" - all avenues are skillfully probed and prosed.The first quarter of the book captivated my imagination with the wandering, scavaging and, ultimately, surviving. The middle half was deeply interesting to see how one man could restructure his life so that Americans could live after the plague. The last quarter was filled with expectation and anxiety, seeing how the family has turned out and whether or not the new Americans will prosper as they had before.","At the beginning of Earth Abides, Isherwood Williams, a graduate student alone in the wilderness and working on his thesis, is bitten by a poisonous snake. For several days, he drifts in and out of consciousness. When he is at last able to drag himself to civilization, he finds that a virus not unlike the common flu has mutated into a deadly strain, and the world is suddenly devoid of people. The rest of the book follows Isherwood as he discovers the strange freedom of the empty world, struggles to find other survivors, and works to rebuild civilization.Earth Abides is a sweeping saga, stretching across decades and roaming across North America. Most of the story takes place from inside the head of its protagonist, at a range so close that it takes us several pages to learn his name, as he simply does not think of his name that often. Stewart infuses the story with concrete details and scientific observations, giving it a strong sense of authenticity. Caught up in and believing the action, we are completely absorbed in the efforts of Isherwood Williams to survive and thrive in this strange new world.One trap lurking for any story, but particularly a science fiction story like this, is that of becoming quickly dated. Things change daily, and what is fascinating and new today will soon be old fashioned. Stewart has given his story a certain timelessness, at least so far, and I think he achieves this effect by incorporating very little medium-range technology. By this I mean that things are either seen close up, as in hands working with tools that change slowly, such as hammers, or are seen at a distance, such as the lights of San Francisco. In the middle distance, very little attention is paid to devices that evolve quickly, such as televisions, radios, and automobiles (other than the venerable Jeep). The result is that Earth Abides does not suffer from a feeling of being out of date, and it could easily be imagined to be a present-day story.One interesting feature to me as a writer was the use of interstitial chapters called Quick Years between each of the three major sections. These bridge the time gaps between the primary sections of the book, recalling the primary events in the passing years through Isherwood's eyes. This device lets the author tell a sweeping story while keeping the bulk of the detail in the activity at the turning points. On first glance, this sudden shift in gears seems likely to distance the reader, but Stewart handles the narrative so deftly that the reader finds the story as engaging viewed at this speed as when it is slowed down.Ultimately, Earth Abides is a masterful work. The author gives us enough detail and character to connect deeply with the story, then stays out of the way, allowing the story to unfold with its own power. The result is a riveting and deeply moving tale about all of us, how strong and resilient we are, but also about how fragile we are, how tenuous our grip on the world is, and how little it needs us.Do not miss this story. But do not, however, try to finish it without a generous supply of tissues. You will need them.","I heard about \"Earth Abides\" from someone reviewing \"The Stand\". In their review, they indicated \"The Stand\" was a one for one rip off of \"Earth Abides\". I decided to investigate this accusation and started reading an old edition of George Stewart's book. This book investigates what could potentially happen to human civilization if most people died from a highly contagious disease. The decay of civilization is seen through the eyes of the main character, Isherwood Williams.First, what was my impression of the book? I enjoy reading sci-fi and have read my share of \"end of the world\" books including \"Alas Babylon\", \"The Stand\", \"War Day\", \"The White Plague\", and most recently \"The Road\". I did not enjoy the writing style of this author. It was not fluid and was archaic. However, the subject matter was interesting as was the thought the author put into the story. Ultimately, the author kept my attention.How does this book compare to \"The Stand\"? They are two entirely different books. \"The Stand\" is more realistic in depicting the immediate aftermath of a plague. However afterwards, it becomes more of a \"good versus evil\" tale whereas \"Earth Abides\" seriously contemplates the state of civilization years after the plague. All in all, both books are worthy reads.\"Earth Abides\" is at times is an awkward read. However, the story is interesting and well thought out. All in all, I recommend the book.","I swear it seems that all the reviewers of this book seem desperate to convince people that they've been able to read for a really long time.\"I first read this book back in Vietnam...\"\"I first read this book about thirty years ago...\"\"When I first read this book, I was only twelve years old, and...\"Great, we get it, you're old, and you can read.Ahhh... Anyway, despite my grumbling, I do agree with the essential point that these reviewers made--that this is a book that pulls you in, that surrounds you with a \"world entire,\" that creates a place that you inhabit completely from page 1 to page 317 (in the edition I have, anyway), that creates a world that you'll find hard to forget.The book, \"Earth Abides,\" tells the story of a man who emerges from a long period of solitude to discover that more than 99% of the planet's humans have been killed by a powerful virus, the man himself having likely survived only because of having been bitten by a snake around the same time.The book's descriptions of the abandoned world are awesome, enlivening and atmospheric, and for some of us no doubt a secret dream come true. It gets even cooler whent the man decides to take a road trip across the newly desolate America--from California to New York City. That's the book's first section, and was probably my favorite part of the book, but the book remains interesting and engaging throughout. The man meets a woman, they have children, they meet others, they form a community, and then--this seemed a bit hard for me to swallow--they basically let all of civilization go, and three generations later they're basically a tribe of primitives who are happy and functional, but who can't read, can't use any of the technologies created by mankind, and believe the sun revolves around the Earth. Yeah, that happened kind of quick....Set your disbelief aside though, and read this. It's well-written, nicely paced, and enjoyable, and the depictions of the man when he's really old seem totally accurate in their depiction of the sort of fuzzy and uncertain warmth of old age, though I'd need to have this book's other reviewers confirm that to be absolutely sure.One of my only complaints about the book would be the 1940s mentality that saturates the main character's logic: at one point he says in a sort of wistful tone that maybe one day they might be able to care about such things as race again, he contemplates making himself king of two frightened black people that he meets, and he laments that the his community's lack of law has made it impossible for them to require that an insane girl be \"put out of her misery.\" At first these comments were kind of amusing in a kitschy way, but then they really started piling up, and didn't make his character more endearing to me.Overall though, this was a great book, and like almost everyone else who's read it, I'm sure I'll be thinking about it for years.","This novel did more than entertain, it made me think. Everything that we hold of value weakens when weighted against what is essential in continuing our existence after such a catastrophe. The main character \"Isherwood\" had such a difficult time with the notion of the \"Old\" world being forgotten. What impressed me was that their continued existence was not dependant on the \"Old\" structure of things. If all the demands of our everyday life are absent what is left?I am pleased to have read this book. I'll be honest I was reticent about reading a sci-fi from 1947. This was well worth it.","This is a great read, but before you spend the $50 for this paperback, go check your local used book stores and thrift stores like Goodwill, I got my copy of the 1962 version for 69 cents and it is in great shape at a Goodwill store.","Several reviews have noted what they call the essential pessimism of the book: Man Has Fallen, Civilization Is No More, etc. Well, yes, that is all there. But what is also there is a profound triumph of the human spirit: Civilization is Dead - Long Live Civilization. I will NOT spoil the ending, but book ends with a rebirth - an obvious societal pregnancy if you will - of a new civilization, one profoundly in keeping with the new conditions of their brave renewed world.One can imagine a sequel, and I wish Stewart ahd written one!I first read this book almost 50 years ago, and have re-read it multiple times. It is one of the best \"transition\" books ever written. I recommend it on several levels.","Hello,The main character, Ish, manages to spend over 20 years mostly clutching his worry beads and freting. By the end of the book you just want to slap him and ask, \"What the hell is wrong with you\". His character is indecisive, and whiny. Over 20 years and the most productive thing he did was teach the kids how to make crappy bows and dig a well. If the characters in this book are supposed to be examples of the best way humanity could cope post SHTF we are probably all doomed. The only thing I can think of is that among the characters all had IQ's of 95 and Ish had an IQ of 100. This is more a human drama story (written in a most boring way) written around an apocalypse than it is anything else. If your interested in realistic post SHTF stories don't waist your time here. If your interested on how a small community could waste +20 years post SHTF in blissful denial with only one character recognizing the denial but doing nothing but hand-wringing about it than this is the book for you.","I found this book sitting on my mother's shelf, and after reading the description, couldn't wait to begin delving into it. The description of the book makes it seem like it's going to be very intriguing and exciting. It failed in that area. (And it's rare for me to dislike a book)In general, I really dislike the character. He shows no real or genuine emotion and is very full of himself. He is a geographer, but thinks of himself as a philospher. Which in his book, I guess that means spending a lot of time thinking about how unintelligent and hopeless everyone is. Including his wife and children. In fact, he had around five children, but you only learn about three of their names, and he spends his time only liking one of them. Since this book was written in the 40s, there are some racist and misogynistic undertones.The first two-thirds were mostly boring to me. He spends the majority of his time traveling across America and describing the scenery. When he's not doing that, he's judging people.Overall, I only like the last third of book, and that had nothing to do with the character. Instead, I enjoyed the process that could happen if civilization were lost, and the reforming of it.","I first read this book when I was 19 years old in 1974. At that time, most novels in this genre were post-nuclear where the United States and the Soviet Union were foolish enough to unleash their hellfire. This one takes a different approach. There are no mutants, no zombies, no cannibals. The end comes, as it has for so many human civilisations, from a disease that was not created in a lab but evolved from an earlier less virulent agent. Think avian influenza.It is based on the premise that any species that becomes so very numerous and lives in such dense number is vulnerable to a sweeping pandemic that kills many or almost all of the species. In this case, humans have skated by since the Black Death hit Europe and killed one third of the humans in Europe. A disease appears, but owing to the mobility of our species with rapid global transport, it manages to sweep the planet before anyone is really aware it is there.As with all pandemics, there are generally some individuals who survive either by peculiar circumstance, slight differences in genetics, or just pure luck. In Ish's case, it was more a combination of circumstance and luck. He has gone to a cabin to rest from the stresses of life and is not even aware at first that a new disease is abroad in the world. He just happens to be hiking and suffers a snake bite. The story suggests that he became ill with the disease at the same time and that venom and the disease basically worked against each other; thus, sparing his life. Once he recovers, he discovers a world empty of people. He takes a trip across the country from his starting point in California to New York City then down through the South and back to Los Angeles. This is where the first clear difference appears between this book and most all others. In this story, there are small numbers of survivors, but most are too shell-shocked and skittish to approach. So North America and presumably the rest of the planet is beginning to restore its natural balance, and the marks of humans are slowly being swallowed up.The second difference is that this story demonstrates what I think is the most realistic outcome for the survivors. Most do not have the skills to survive from nature and starve or die from injury, but some begin learning to survive. Ish is one who does. It follows him through the remainder of his life and the one or two generations that are borne from the small collection of survivors who collect around him. Unusual intelligence is not something that results from all matings. Mostly it is average intelligence sufficient to learn survival skills from the parents. Ish will make efforts to ensure some civilisation survives such as reading and writing, but even with that humans change. Domesticated animals survive in feral forms or die out. Predator and prey balance is gradually reestablished. Suburbs gradually revert to forest or grasslands. Natural fires become part of the norm, again.This book is an adventure but not in the same way of a story such as Alas Babylon or the movie 2012 (abominable science in that one). This is an adventure in that the world returns to a form that produced humans in the first place. This is a book for mind and heart more than the thrill. It has stood without becoming as dated as most of these books do. The words 'computer', 'radiation', and 'desperate' do not appear. I think more than anything, the survivors take a while to realise that their lives are not going to return to the way they were. I give this novel all the stars allowed and would give it more if I could.","I really enjoyed this book, George Stewart uses an interesting writing devise to describe time passing without you as the reader feeling as if he is grasping for ideas.Right from when people start dieing and the world changes the whole pace of life changes and this is captured really well and I feel is conveyed very effectively.I also loved the insights into what happens over time to various things that we are accosted to, cats, dogs, corn and cars. I know, I know I sound a little weird but it works !At only 337 pages this is not a taxing read, its definitely worth throwing at your younger readers in the home wanting something that is a little more challenging","I would like to say that in reading other reviews here that dislike this book, the people in this book remind me greatly of many people I have known. Yes, they didn't seem to try very hard to continue civilization, but then he explains that and ponders that at great length. Yes, the main characters were annoying and all too real. All the people that say, \"I would have done this!\" or \"they should have done that!\" are just getting what the author wanted you to do, think about it.They characters in the book, the few rag tag remnants of civilization, fail to even prepare for the inevitable illness that befalls them, typhoid. Just like all of humanity in 1949 failed to prepare for the pandemic that wipes them out. And just like we have still failed to prepare for the coming pandemic of today.This is a cautionary tale that is enjoyable to read. What I would say the the people who don't like it is, And what exactely have you done lately to prepare civilization for what the World Health Organization has recently stated is \"inevitiable\"?","&#8216;Earth Abides&#8217; by George R. Stewart comes with a considerable reputation. First Published in 1949, It was the first winner of the International Fantasy Award although it is clearly science fiction of the world catastrophe kind. That said the book isn&#8217;t extra-speculative in approach, it is set in much the same time as it was written, in an America of that late 1940s early 1950s. The main character, and narrator, of this disaster novel is Isherwood Williams a post grad geography student, Ish is one of the few survivors of a plague which has decimated the USA (and by inference the world). The book tells the tale of what happens to civilisation after the fall and describes Ish&#8217;s attempts to preserve some of it into the future. The story is told and progressed in a series of accounts, the exploration of the USA, the founding of a community, the growth of that community etc. It is written in a straight forward narrative style, with an occasional aside to speculate on the ecology, and traces the life of Ish from the time of the plague to his death. Through this journey Ish will face loneliness and find love, the small community he gathers about him will both flourish and suffer tragedy, and all along Ish chronicles things with his eye on history and ecology.For me, one of the main strengths of this book is that Ish is one of the most relatable protagonists of just about any book I&#8217;ve read. Ish is the sort of person who we&#8217;d like to think we would be in this situation. This is not to say Ish is perfect and he&#8217;s certainly no hero. He has a methodical and intellectual outlook to tackling situations, but he suffers as many failures as triumphs. This gives the book an emotional depth uncommon in a lot of SF and it is this humanity within the characters and their simple plight which drags you into the story. I think this is the book&#8217;s secret, it has the ring of truth. The characters send you through a gamut of emotions from nostalgia to anger, we care about them and are emotionally invested in there future.I don&#8217;t often read disaster novels and it took me some time to build up to read it, I wanted to read it because of its reputation but somehow I always seemed to find another book I needed to read first. Finally biting the bullet I found after only a few pages it had become compulsive and it ended much too soon. Whilst I have read some high enjoyable and great books both before and since, it is this book I find that sticks in my mind and the one that I contemplate upon. This book deserves all the praise it has received, and it has widely been proclaimed a masterwork. That it isn&#8217;t more widely known today is a shame. This book has probably become, even against my will, my favorite SF novel.","The premise of this novel is that mankind suddenly experiences a biological holocaust in the form of a new disease--a form of super-measles that wipes out all but a tiny remnant of mankind. The author explains that &quot;mankind had too long been rolling an endless succession of sevens&quot; and that like all animals that had multiplied out of turn, the sudden catastrophe was inevitable to set the balance back to what nature intended. This novel tells the story of a very small group of survivors, and suggests what life would be like under in the aftermath, and perhaps, more profoundly, what such a scenario might mean for mankind.The author's premise is that little or nothing of civilization would survive such an event. In the story **very minor spoiler** although the survivors make attempts at preserving the skills and lessons of civilization, this eventually becomes impossible against the tide of events sweeping mankind back not just to barbarism (in which some skills and beliefs might have survived) but to downright savagery and superstition. The most profound thought that the author successfully imparts is that all of the traditions, skills, and manifestations of our civilization could--and would--be lost in a single generation. Unforgettable is when one of the characters in the story looks out at the ruins of the San Francisco Bay Bridge (before it too passes away) and asks--&quot;who built this.&quot; The protagonist thinks for a second and answers: &quot;the Americans built it.&quot; The next question is &quot;who were the Americans?&quot; I have never forgotten this exchange, which I felt illustrated brilliantly how important it is for one generation to impart the best ideas of civilization to the next, and how easily all our achievements and successes might be lost in the face of a global catastrophe.The reader need not and probably will not agree with all of the author's conclusions about what would happen in this scenario. Would we really lose the skill of a written language? Would we really fall all the way back almost to the Old Stone Age? The author will challenge the reader's own thoughts on this subject, and that is fine. One need not agree with all of the conclusions that the novel contains to enjoy this story.Although written many years ago, upon re-reading this novel recently I found that it had lost little or none of its impact or relevance. It features a bit more prudishness than a modern novel might contain, but in my opinion is none the worse for this. The story is well-told, the prose is quite good, and the storyline moves along all the while capturing and retaining the reader's interest. This is a novel that I would recommend to everyone.","I could almost feel the age of this book when I read it. It is slow, the main character is an idiot (in my eyes), and he spends most of his time thinking about single-handedly saving (well, rebuilding) civilisation. Delusions of Grandeur. No critical thoughts about civilisation as realized in 1940/50 America, either: \"Modern civilisation is good. We need to rebuild it at once. End of argument.\"I took two things from this book - first, sheep are the most stupid animals on this planet. And second, people may come and go, but Earth Abides. The Author managed very well to show me that, by having his protagonist realize a few pages before the end that he isn't the center of the world. Wow. Finally. I was waiting for this for about 200 pages.This could have been done with a much shorter and faster-paced book. Still, the book poses some interesting questions, and it's vastly better than what you get today when being shown post-apocalypse worlds (I'm thinking along the lines of the Mad Max movies, or Waterworld, etc - the book never sells out this cheaply). So, all in all, Earth Abides earns it's place on my SF bookshelf. A serious book that tries to seriously investigate the end of civilisation as we know it, and guide us into the new world that rises out of it.","I could not put this book down. It challenged me, it entertained me, it made me cry.When I run across a copy, I buy it and give it to friends.","Perhaps because I've read several recently published books that deal with life after \"the end of the world as we know it,\" I found this book to be slow moving and even boring at times. However, I enjoyed moments of nostalgia when presented with phrases like \"tourist court\" and \"I pressed the starter button on the car.\" Brought back memories. Sadly, the world as we knew it then has already ended.","One of the handful of true classics in the Apocalyptic genre that are Must reads. This account follows a survivor in a post-pandemic world that decimated the human race as he seeks out other survivors and begins to rebuild. Excellent read from page one!!! Solid and believable story line, great characters, and very entertaining! Includes \"year zero!\"","I love the apocolypse genre - so thought provoking, and Earth Abides is one of the best I've read so far. I was surprised I'd never heard of it before seeing someone on a message board mention it. I decided to give it a try, and am so glad I did. This has now been moved into my books to read again, and that really doesn't happen often.I didn't realize how long ago this had been written until the main character described going into a house and sitting down to rest on the \"davenport\" - how long has it been since we heard that term?Really though, the premise is such that it really doesn't matter when the book was written. The same thought provoking situations occur. Highly recommend.","I enjoy Post apocalyptic sic fi but this was not that entertaining after a while.","With so many books available to read, is this one worth your time? Ultimately, you'll have to make that decision, but I hope my review can help in some way.There are some technology issues with the story that clearly show it was written in the late 1940's; however, these don't detract too much from the story.There are also a few typos in the Kindle edition, which I assume is a scanning problem when converting to eBook format.The two main issues I had with the book are:1. Food - It is unrealistic to think that people would be subsisting off canned food for 20+ years, let alone, 40+ years at the end of the book.2. Future generations - Without ruining the ending, the book makes a plot decision on how Ish decides to pass knowledge on to future generations. I liked two aspects of what he did, but I thought the rest was foolish.I liked the book overall, but I didn't necessarily think it was a \"great\" work.","This review is a spoiler! Don't read on if you are intending to read it for the first time!I had heard many times that this was a classic that would haunt me for life. But I was not impressed, partially because there were things that were left unanswered. I may have missed something - what was the significance of the car on the bridge at the end? Modern man's constructions were all around him...the Golden Gate Bridge, for example. Why the car? Why did they want him to die there, instead of with their tribe? I thought it weird, too, and unlikely, that he saw so few bodies in the aftermath. I liked the hammer symbol a lot - and the fact that he passed it on to the young man he'd chosen - and why. I liked that his gift of leadership helped humanity live on. I also liked the way that he changed his desperate struggle from lecturing - to action...his building of the simple bow and arrows. I loved that he continued to describe the inevitable and looming corrosion of the modern world. That did make him the last American - his final months spent with his oldest friend. Those things saddened me a great deal.I have read another holocaust book that WILL haunt me for life...perhaps because it was on such a massive scale, and yet confined to only one remaining group of characters. The book is The Last Ship, by William Brinkley. I've read it 3 times, as has my oldest son.","This is an extraordinary novel, wider appreciation of which has probably been hampered by categorization as science fiction. While there are some slight anachronisms (the book appeared in 1949) the ideas, and the narrative, are disturbingly fresh. To me the most stunning - and frighteningly plausible - theme was how fragile &quot;civilization&quot; is, and how quickly everything could collapse even though the material and intellectual basis for &quot;civil society&quot; remained intact and available.","In short, I liked the first half of this book - the plot is intriguing and you don't want to put the book down! But after reading 2/3 of the story you expect something more to happen but the tempo goes down, the main character gets more introspective and the flow of the narration starts to falter. The book starts to get boring and you just want to get through to the end to see what the end will be like. With a better pace all the way through, I would rate this book higher.","Chris FitzgeraldEnglish 10Mrs. Cruces5-20-02Earth Abides Evaluative EssayThe novel Earth Abides, written by George Stewart, took place in San Francisco,California. This science fiction novel focuses on a plague that has spread across the NorthAmerican continent and is threatening the human species. The novel contains the life thatan individual survivor, Isherwood Philips (Ish), lives. A majority of the population hasseized to exist. Ish is an important part of the Plague because he is a biologist. Ish goesthrough his life in this novel by bringing other characters into his life. Ish is one of thesurvivors that has the intelligence to form a tribe and become the leader of this tribe. Ishhas a compassionate soul and struggles to help other survivors find their way.Earth Abides is a very interesting novel. This novel is easily enjoyable because ofits connection that it gives of the key characters who are intertwined in a drama that isdealing with a cataclysmic event of a Plague. This makes the novel a good read. Thiskind of event is very possible considering the times that we live in now. This novel doesnot only relate with people coming together to struggle for survival. It also deals with anevent that could very well take place.This novel is great for anyone over the age of about 12 years old, because of theway that this novel is set up to involve thinking and real life experience to understand thetrue meaning of the novel. Anybody who is looking for a good science fiction novel willlike the great novel Earth Abides.","I bought this book based on the overall good ratings.I speed read through most of it, hoping it would pick up. I can't stand the idea that these people weren't a little more intelligent and chose to preserve what they had and plan for the future without technology. They had a whole freakin' University Libary for pete's sake!Out of the whole book I got that Ish was the only inteliigent one but didn't have the teaching skills to subsequently teach the next generations.If you like post-apolcolytipic books, then I highly recommend \"One Second Later\" by Fortschen. The spelling may be off slighly....I don't have the book here. There is a line-up at work to read it. This book scared the hell out of me. And as a professional health care worker I could see the devastating domino effect happening like this book portrayed. Like the book \"One Second Later\" says, \"Its not IF, but WHEN.\"","If they did an audiotape of \"Earth Abides\", only Ben Stein would be up to the task of delivering the text into spoken words. The novel wastes no time getting into its subject matter. Within the opening pages, an unknown plague wipes out the vast majority of humanity, leaving the remnants to either rebuild civilization or bear witness to its final collapse. It sounds promising, but the delivery never comes.The story is narrated in the first person by \"Ish\", a young college student whose circumstances enable him to survive the disaster. Very early on, the reader gets the first inklings that this novel will serve as a sounding board for George Stewart's various preoccupations. The first hint is the dominant theme that nature has some innate sense of population control that strikes suddenly and absolutely on all levels, and this is explored not just in discovering what happened to humanity but also in a number of situations as the story advances.In fact, Ish seems to be merely a mouthpiece for a number of observations, ideas, and insights postulated by Stewart. For a work of fiction, \"Earth Abides\" reads more like an apocalyptic version of \"Future Shock\", the landmark Alvin Toffler sociological study. Unfortunately, it reads as dryly as \"Future Shock\" as well. All of Stewart's ideas are presented in a dry, impersonal manner, which precludes any emotional connection with the story itself and thus lessens the impact of these insights in the end. Recommended only for the most voracious of sci-fi readers.","I 1960, I was nine years old, I remember staying up all night during summer vacation to finish it, I still love this book!","I found this book totally by happy accident, and it remains one of my all-time favorites. What is chilling is that the basic premise of the book is quite possible and believable, given diseases like Ebola that are out there. He gave real-life examples of other species that became overpopulated, and then were nearly wiped out by a plague. What is man but another species of animal on this planet, and we are not immune--look at the Black Plague, for example. A truly unique look at what might happen to the earth if we are nearly wiped out, and what might happen to the people left to survive afterward. A great read!","As always, interesting to see the vast number of five star review for a book deserving of maybe three. Would be quite fascinating to easily see a breakdown of reviewers' ratings showing number of reviews at each star level - would we see most people rate things at 5 stars?I just finished this book, and have been thinking about why it was so bad. It never captured my interest, the characters were cardboard, astoundingly enough the plot was nearly nonexistent and worst of all, no conflict/tension!After the initial collapse, our hero drives across the country, from San Francisco to Manhattan, making trivial contact with a few people apparently for the purpose of seeing an empty New York City. He then returns to California, where he proceeds to settle down for the next 20+ years without doing anything except mosey down to the local abandoned grocery store to snag some canned food.My big insight from reading this book was realizing most people were essentially lazy before television was invented.There are so many other better genre books, including _On The Beach_ and _Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang_.","The book, first written in 1949 tells a story that could be just as true today. A pandemic that sweeps the contenent leaving few survivors. Isherwood (Ish) Williams is the protagonist. His life is the focus of the story, with interaction with a gradual collection of a few other survivors, that results in a slowly growing tribe. Well worth reading and rereading a few years later.","This book is great and I found it on Amazon at a great price. it shipped promptly and arrive in great shape.","Written in the 50s, it talks about ecology when nobody even knew the word. Ish watches the world spasm itself back into equilibrium after man is removed from the equation. Add elements of anthropology and sociology and and you have a truly remarkable book. Read it. NOW!","First published in 1949, Earth Abides is George R. Stewart's take on what would happen if all of the human population of Earth, except a few scattered survivors, were killed by a vicious disease. The tale is presented entirely through the thoughts and experiences one man, i.e., Isherwood Williams. Ish is a graduate student when the \"Great Disaster\" leaves him alone in the Oakland CA area. He eventually finds a few other survivors, including Emma (Em) who becomes his partner and the mother of his children. Ish and Em and their small band of survivors create a fledgling community that struggles with immense hardships to survive. However, they do survive and their community \"The Tribe\" grows slowly. Ish, as the only educated person among the group, becomes a leader and eventually becomes revered almost as a God after many years. Ish remains a thinker throughout his life, and a worrier through most of it. The book is very interesting and presents much credible (at least based on the 1949 knowledge base) information about what the world would be like and how it would change if humans cease to be a significant force. It also presents much logical information about how a very small human community would struggle to adapt and develop a simple but functioning social organization. Much of the book presents Ish's thoughts about how to help his tribe survive and also how to motivate or manipulate them to develop skills and knowledge that might enable them to develop a new civilization in the future. At times, I did not like Ish, but I usually understood the logic of his thoughts and actions. Although things did not work out the way Ish wanted, he finally realized that the tribe and Earth's changing environment would interact to determine the future without his help. I found this book to be a slow but interesting read. It was also intellectually stimulating and engendered much emotion. Reading this science fiction classic is well worth the effort.","I have read this book multiple times and have totally been immersed in WHAT IFS. I have talked more about this book than about any other book that I have read except for The Source by James Michener.. The idea of the world actually existing after most of the people have died from an unknown cause is so thought provoking. Most people I have talked to and let read my book have been as impressed by Earth Abides as I have been but then there are the very few who thought that they could do better if they had been in the same circumstances. I always thought that I would eventually have to go back to cave man status. It is a book that should be read in college. I would totally recommend it.","This book is less about an apocalyptic event that kills most humans and more about the reemergence of society and the influences that geography, history, and personal beliefs have on it. Ishi, the main character, strives to bring back the scholarly lifestyle he values, but is faced with convincing the new generation of its value in a world where his children are free from the society he knew.","One of my favorites that I surely will read more than once. I loved how you got to read about the main character from the age of 18 to his death. The book is amazing at telling the story of how they all survive and how mankind seems to revert back to tribal and superstitious beliefs. I almost wanted to jump in and live this life with them even though their hardships seemed too much to bear.","I had great expectations when I started this book and got out of it slightly unsatisfied. The book shows pretty well what civilisation is about and how much it is fragile. Also how much civilisation relies on a few individuals only. All the lost knowledge in the library no one can understand remains as a vivid image in my mind.In spite of some theories underlaying the story being already out of date, that book poses essential issues and the empathy we develop for Ish in his efforts and trials to answer them and maintain some civilisation makes the story moving.","This is one of my favorite books. Written in 1949, it's remarkably contemporary and accessible. I love the references to hifi. It seems to me more of a work of philosophy; a meditation on humanity, relationships, change and civilization, which is precisely why it's so timeless. It's also something of a love story and there is a gentle tenderness pervades the entire story. Ish is a wonderful character. As the world is completely and unalterably transformed around him, he strives for continuity and permanence. In the end, his striving is for naught, he's failed. But there is no bitterness and remorse but an acceptance of the world around him and the love that expressed itself in his relationships with others. The story wasn't anything like I thought it would be, much better.","Earth Abides was written by George Stewart and released in 1949. The story follows the main character Ish, short for Isherwood, as he is one of the few people to survive a pandemic that kills the majority of the human population. Ish has an interesting perspective on the incident as he has an academic background and tends to view events through in a very historical, geographical way. Ecology and population dynamics are frequently discussed throughout the story. Stewart explores population fluctuations in nature in comparison to the die off of humans. Much of the story takes place in California, near San Francisco and follows Ish through most of his life following the outbreak. On a practical level, this book contains more generalized preparation information such as the durability of canned food, hunting and gathering methods and the continuation of life without public water and electricity. While Earth Abides is certainly entertaining, it also provides a very unique perspective on the end of civilization and it will leave you with some very interesting ideas for your consideration.","I read Earth Abides months ago, and I still find myself thinking about it often. Some of the reviews I read before I read the book mentioned the book remaining with the reader for years and years; I didn't expect that to be the case for me, but now I think it will. We take so much for granted, both things and people, but what would we do if life as we know it basically vanished? How would we manage alone? What abilities would we need which we don't have now? So much to think about!","This book is not so much about the end of the world itself; instead, it uses the end of the world - the end of most of mankind, anyway - as a plot device to explore how a new, small, totally contained society would develop out of the leavings of the old one. This task it accomplishes quite well; the growth of the Tribe in San Francisco and their mythological beliefs, traditions, and practices is fascinating, if a little slow-moving in several parts. But because societal development is the primary concern of the novel, the little details are simply glossed over, and there are so many technical errors or things left unexplained that it had a tendency to lift me out of the story and re-engage my disbelief. For instance, most of mankind is wiped out by a mysterious, very viral disease, but it's never explained what the disease is, where it came from, or why some people are immune. In fact, the main character of the book comes down out of the hills after it's all over, having no idea what was going on the \"civilized\" world, but he shows a total lack of curiosity about what happened to everybody that I found unbelievable. And when several survivors get together, they never discuss where they were or what happened to them when the Great Disaster (as it's called in the book) went down, which I think goes totally against human nature. And the survivors continue to live off the leavings for forty or more years afterward, eating canned food that must have long since gone bad and even smoking cigarettes that had to have been unsmokeable after at least a year. They never bother to start even a rudimentary garden - an idea which I think would have occurred to just about anybody - but somehow manage to live in nearly perfect health until old age without eating any fresh fruits or vegetables. Again, I understand that these details weren't important to the author, but they were important to me, and so these little problems served to disrupt what was otherwise a well-written, intriguing take on the old end-of-the-world plot.","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it.

The internal debate and conflict and the final resolution are wonderful. The characters are personable and easy to relate to. More importantly, in the time of the H1N1 virus and other diseases, a harsh and jolting wake-up call to humanity and civilization. Worth every cent.","This book is amazing in that it was written so long ago (1949). I have had dreams for as long as I can remember that resemble this story, but I only read it this year. It's a quick read but one must pay attention to keep up. Some things that were not accomplished by the people are disappointing, but since technology has changed the way we live in the last 60 years so greatly, who's to say what he would rewrite today. Overall I really liked it. I started reading this at a friend's house and just had to buy to reread again.","George R. Stewart weaves at once a beautiful and hauntingly believable tale with this novel, one that I've never been able to forget...or wanted to. Once considered dated, with the lessening of global nuclear tensions, the scenario Mr. Stewart envisions for a possible worldwide catastrophe, one brought about not by bombs but disease, has once again come to the forefront and become the most plausible ingredient in mankind's demise. More even than the fact that this is a truly enjoyable read is the deeper message Earth Abides shares with the reader as it reaches down and touches our very hearts, defining what it means to be human in an inhuman environment. The symbolism involved in Isherwood Williams' desire to keep a hammer with him for the future as a tie to the past is obviously an unconscious comment on his personal hope of rebuilding a fallen civilization. A hope that goes unfulfilled in his life time and maybe many lifetimes to follow. The insight into the human psyche that Mr. Stewart demonstates as he carries Isherwood from his youth at the beginning of the book to old age and finally death at the end and Isherwood's subtle change of attitude during that process, rings exceedingly true and speaks volumes about Mr. Stewart's keen and perhaps unique ability to put into words what it really means, or at least should mean, to be human. I've rarely read a book more than once because I just don't have the time, but I've read Earth Abides several times since I was a teen and I know I'll read it several more times before I too reach that stage in my life that Isherwood assures us won't be the calamity our youth oriented culture would have us to believe.","Science Fiction books are hard to remain classics given our growing understanding of science and technology. Earth Abides is an exception because it is written from the perspective of an anthropologist trying to cope with the fact that his world has been destroyed. Like many readers this book changed my life&gt; I read it in my teens, in my 20's and I guess it is time to pick it up again in my 30's.","First of all, I think D.D. Shade's analysis of today's society on Earth Abides is unsubstantiated. This book is still a great book today because it is a classic. A classic, by definition, relates to all time. The assination of JFK or MLK would not have had any greater impact on this book. This book, like Ish, will continue to stand the test of time because of it's overall classical themes. That man is the complicating variable on the planet earth. Regardless of if a man or men die, the earth abides.","I read this book in High School in the 70's in Saratoga Ca. I have a teenage daughter and I can't fathom that she is not required to read these types of books anymore. My mind constantly wandered with Ish. I dreamt of what I would do in that situation, of how I would react. Needless to say I finished the book in one weekend well ahead of my classmates, and decided to just start it all over. I recomended the book to my Mom, and she also fell in love with it. Ever since we are both on the lookout for others like it. I have read most of them (The stand, postman, alas babylon, on the beach, SWAN SONG (the best), plus mony other forgetable tales), and thank Earth Abides for my passion for these books. I wish someone would write another that is as good as this.","I have only read 2 books more than once - &quot;Earth Abides&quot; by George R Stewart, and &quot;The Quest of Aah&quot; by Alexan Farelane. If you read one book a week for 70 years, you would only have read 3,640 books in your lifetime. There are millions of books you will never be able to read - even with the Reader's Digest versions! Life is way too short to read the same book twice - except for books which can change your life. These 2 books are &quot;Life Changing&quot; books. The thing which most appeals to me with &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that our hero is just an ordinary guy and his failures are at least as impressive as his successes. He starts off with the best of intentions, becomes an unwilling leader by default, and is unable to persuade the other survivors of the need to maintain and/or restore the facilities and civilization we have come to take for granted. I KNOW that this is exactly how it would happen for me, if I was in his place! I know what I'd want to have happen, but circumstances would prevent me from being able to make it all happen.&quot;The Quest of Aah&quot; is a fantasy about the seven levels, the seven valleys, higher planes of existence, stages on the journey from Earth to Heaven, some of which any spiritual person can relate to, and anyone on a secular plane can be entertained by. The novel is presented as a memory, and is the way we hope it will be when we reach the end of our lives. It is completely different from &quot;Earth Abides&quot;, but if you like speculative fiction, then it is worth a read (or TWO!)","This is a story of the first years and the ensuing decades in the lives of the very few survivors of a natural plague. At first, there is a detailed overview of one survivor's (the main character and often narrator per se) actions in the first several months after the plague. This account of the &quot;short-term&quot; impact of a plague has been seen in other SF stories and might seem repetitous. But where this story is different, and where this novel is in a class of its own, is where the plot goes when this survivor meets others and small families begin and a community develops. The challenges which are faced by and met with by this group are detailed, yet are those involving environment and illness which are perhaps expected. But more interesting is what new moral values that arise and what &quot;holdover&quot; values (school, religion) which are attempted to be maintained, but are not or can't be embraced by the new generations which follow. The book follows the community though several decades, jumping years and stopping to go into detail about an event or time period -- but giving several pages in between as a summary to provide a good junction between sections...thus keeping the story flowing. The book ends with the natural death of the main character and seeing that the new generations have embraced a &quot;new and different&quot; value, knowledge, and societal system which is suprisingly similar to another culture -- and perhaps quietly challenging the reader to ask whether or not such the result is good or bad; and, whether or not the result was destiny, or the result of proper or improper actions of the original group of survivors. For a book written in the late 1940's, it was very, very far ahead of it's time.","After reading Earth Abides in 1968 as a 10th grader, I have read it six more times, getting a new insight of the book each time. My son (11yrs of age) has now read it twice with the same enjoyment as I have. It is a book that makes the mind think, wonder and dream the &quot; WHAT IF&quot; and &quot;COULD IT REALLY HAPPEN&quot; questions. Read it, sit back and think it. After the hair on the back of your neck sits down. Then read again next year.","I first read this book when I was 14, having borrowed it from the school library. I read it twice more in the following year. It affected me deeply and since then it has quite often crossed my mind to find the book again and re-read it. How surprised and happy I am after idly checking this website to see if that title would come up! I plan on ordering the book so I may savour every word of it all over again!","When my teacher first informed our class that we were going to read a science fiction book, my heart sank; I hated science fiction books! However, when I started to read Earth Abides, I found myself becoming engrossed in this book. The plot and the characters were something new and fresh to me in this age of quick storytelling. This was actually the first book I didn't skip to the end to read the final chapter because I was bored. It held my attention the whole time, and I was disappointed when it ended. This book reminds me of the movie &quot;Deep Impact&quot; because of the armageddon plots. I hope this is turned into a movie because it will probably be just as good as the book!","Of the novels written on this subject, I think I have read them all, this is by far the best. Most interesting is the authors attempt to regenerate civilization. Methodically covers natures reaction to the demise of man, fascinating! &quot;The Stand&quot;, &quot;Alas Babylon&quot;, &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; are all outstanding; &quot;Earth Abides&quot; stands alone!!!","The protagonist is arrogant, lazy and stupid. He likes to sit around smoking cigarettes and thinking about how much smarter he is than all the other survivors while his wife cooks him meals and takes care of his children. He doesn't bother to teach his children to read, and he doesn't bother to learn anything medical or mechanical or any other potentially useful skills in a post-apocalyptic world. At one point he runs across some other survivors who are Black, and he thinks about how he could stay and \"be king\" of them because he is white. The ultimate self-absorbed old white man fantasy.","If almost all the people in the world were dead, and you had to spend your life with an egotistical, chauvanistic, racist white guy with absolutely no redeeming qualities you'll love this. Archie Bunker would have loved this guy. I, did not.Old does not have to be disfunctional.","The idea of an apocalyptic end of our planet and of humankind has always been extremely prevalent in society. From religion to movies, theories of annihilation can be found everywhere. But few books attempt to tackle the subject of life after the end. I think George Stewart wrote this book in the 60's and I wanted to see what his ideas were on that subject. The premise was great, but I was extremely disappointed with Earth Abides because Stewart brings in many themes/ideas but never goes into any of them in any detail whatsoever. There is absolutely no emotional connection with any of the characters,and even less so with Ish, the main character. I felt like I was waiting for something to happen throughout the book, and it never came. The author attempts to tackle way too many &quot;big&quot; subjects at the same time, and in the end,he fails. The only reason I gave this book even one star is because the reader can learn about how the world may deteriorate in the future when man is no longer here.One could say that that is a positive thing.","Some good ideas. Some interesting speculations on the nature of man and society. Some interesting predictions of how the earth would respond to a die-off of humans. Ruined by needless wordiness, 2 dimensional characters and very little to say of a philosophical nature. A bore and a disappointment. Skimmed the last 100 pages.","Glowing reviews, word of mouth praise and the subject matter all left me eager to read Earth Abides. Unfortunately this book fell far short of my expectations. The premise of a global plague is truly fascinating (and frightening), especially in light of recent world events, but the story drags on in such a depressing and mundane fashion that reading the book became a chore rather than an adventure. The lead character's over inflated opinion of himself is so prevalent through out the book that it prevents any character development on the part of any other survivors. Over 300 pages and you barely get to know any of them. That would not have mattered so much if the author had done a better job of portraying the aftermath of the plague. Too little attention was paid to what would happen to the local environment. Impacts are generally glossed over in short, simplistic passages. Survival was no more difficult than raiding the local grocery store and opening a can of beans, even after 20 years. I never felt the horror and struggle for survival that one would expect with such a global catstrophe. The technology in the book is certainly dated but I didn't find that a distraction. This is not an enjoyable read. Better classics on man wiping himself out include \"On the Beach\" and \"Alas, Babylon\". For a more up to date adventure try \"Ill Wind\" by Anderson & Beason.","I love to read, so there are very few books I don't finish. I usually slog through even the bad ones. Here's my take on this book. I was looking for a novel about how people came up with creative ideas about how to survive in a world after civilization is wiped out. This book dealt with that facet somewhat in the first hundred pages. After that most of the book deals with moral issues. \"What are the moral or ethical responsibilities of survivors\" is the main theme of the rest of the book. After an ok start, the whole rest of the book seemed preachy and a little like the author was trying to coerce me into agreeing with his point of view. Three-quarters of the way through the book I quit reading, because there were no characters I was interested in enough to care what happened to them.","Written by a self-righteous professor of English Lit from Berkeley. The authors preconceived notions about the ignorance of rest of us comes across pretty clearly, as his protagonist constantly judges everyone based on his perception of their intelligence. Book was very poorly researched....the protagonist and his children live mostly off of 20-30 year old canned food for most of the book (something that would probably kill you). He fixes up a jeep and then fills it with 20 year old gasoline (which is unusable a year or two after its refined). He raises his offspring in total ignorance...his greatest achievement being to teach them how to make a bow and start a fire (teaching them to read was apparently not important). Worse end of the world book I've ever read.","The plot in Earth Abides is very simple. It is basically the ongoing struggle one would face in creating a perfect society. The setting is in San Francisco, California after a great disease has struck and wiped out 99% of the human population. The main character is a survivor named Ish. He survived the disease an interesting way, and then sets out to build a new society. Through his trials and errors you find out the complexity to people and modern society. You understand the restraints that society has on a person, even if it is not present. For example alcohol is a big part in the novel. Without anyone to stop them, people begin to drink themselves to death.Earth Abides' plot is thin, and dragged to eternity and back. The author spends the majority of the second half of the book reasoning about worthless issues. They were worthless because they do not apply to the main theme of survival. This makes you very confused, as the book is already hard to follow. He also spends a good deal of pages with Ish's inner thoughts, which are basically a bunch of complex nonsense. It is very hard to put your self in his place, and understand his thoughts. He becomes so paranoid with every decision he makes, that he becomes overly analytical.This book could possibly be amusing to very patient adults. It has close to zero action, and does not keep you turning pages. In reality it is the exact opposite, it puts you to sleep. Anyone who likes a book that keeps you interested, Earth Abides is not for you. The only person I would recommend this book to, would be an insomniac who needs to find a way to get to sleep.","Not really SiFi. Fiction and Apocalyptic yes, but after a very few chapters to grab your interest, author drifts off into non-related daydreaming, repetition and his personal philosophy on various character's lives. I'm betting that he was a self proclaimed authority and certainly a pipe smoker.No science, little innovation, but it goes on and on. You keep hoping it will get better, but unfortunately, it doesn't. How it won any award remains a mystery to me. If you are looking for an exciting science fiction work, sorry, but this isn't it.","Having loved this story 20 years ago as a teenager, it pains me now to find that it is surely the worst novel on my bookshelves. All the characters are two-dimensional. The dialogue is uniformly stiff and amateurish. The story's hero is arrogant, aloof and dismissive of anyone he perceives as inferior. Since he actually perceives *everyone* as inferior, the book quickly becomes very tiresome. Perhaps the saddest aspect of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that the story is clearly and shockingly the fantasy of someone who dreamed of existing in a world without people, or at most with just a thin sprinkling of simple folks over whom he could rule as their intellectual master. &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is a truly awful book.","I love a good post-apoc book, but this one just wasn't that great. Other than the narrator, the male characters aren't very well developed and the female characters were even worse. The jumps in time threw me off and the overall plot just didn't grab me.","I'm surprised so many people rated this book so highly. It's hideously dated, both in language, and in writing style. Not even in the same ballpark as something like The Stand. It was interesting to think about what path civilization would take without a unifying threat after an apocalypse, but the writing just ruined it for me. No great character development at any point, a lot of cliches and brushed over details. It kept me reading, barely, mostly to see if it went anywhere. Pretty disappointing though."],

      "reviews.text":["I have read all of Stephenn King's books, so when he wrote that this book was his inspiration for writing The Stand, I knew it would be good. I purchased Earth Abides in a London bookstore a few years ago, but somehow it has gone missing. So I was very surprised and exited when I saw that it was being offered as a kindle book. I have now re-read Earth Abides and it is truly a great work of fiction. It really gets my imagination working, and makes real just how fragile the human race is.","I first read this book when I was in high school. That would be early '60s. It was one of those stories that was foundational in my own thinking. It was a pleasure to read it again after all these years. It is one of the earliest of the apocalyptic genre and its themes are timeless and the characters unforgettable, as you yourself Ish well know. It is still fresh and engrossing to read.","After having read many apocalyptic scifi novels; this is defenitely utopian. SPOILER: The disappearance of all the victim of the plague is suspiciously clean. Also, the simplification of the breakdown of infrastructure seem a bit too clean. However, having dealt with these questions, Stewart frees the book to deal with the most preponderous question: How do the Survivors of a great diaster rebuild civilization?","After reading this book I can no longer get myself to read anything else. There is just no other fiction novel, I believe, that can possible be as good as this book.It's so incredibly thought provoking and engrossing I can't stop reflecting on it.","This is a classic sci-fi drama with interesting survival and sociological study. Long but entertaining and I can recommend it.","This is an enduring futuristic fantasy novel that is hard to put down. The characters are well developed and sympathetic without being heroic. It is easy to image yourself in the protagonist's position, and contemplate how you would react. It really makes you think about what is important in your personal life and in society. An excellent novel for anyone with an active imagination.","This book is so old I was leary about reading it...I have to tell you..even though this book was written so long ago..this book will stick with me forever...the characters are memorable and you are right there with them..you laugh and cry with them!!! i will always remember this book..i am so glad i read it!!!","this is a very well written sci-fi/apocalyptic thriller. it isn't so much as a thriller but an exploration of the human race (in the POV of Ish, one of the most memorable fictional characters IMHO). I love the line \"between the plan and the fulfillment lies the frailty of human life\". so many quotable and thoughtful quotes. this is not for sci-fi readers who like action-packed plots - this book has depth, it satisfied me as a realistic portrait of life after an apocalypse. in fact, if there really is an apocalypse, i believe those who had read Earth Abides will be more than prepared to deal with it.","Excellent book. Still current though written in late 1940's. It is a novel that sticks with you. I have read many disaster books, end of world stories, but I have to say this one is my very favorite.","George Steward did a great job writing a novel that is timeless in nature. I thought the book was well written and the characters in the book were believable and down to earth. I could not put the book down. The pace of the book was fast and exciting. Each page of the held a new twist or further clarity in the development of each character. I especially enjoyed the development of the relationship between Ish and Em as it spanned over time and life events. George Steward did a great job writing a novel that is timeless in nature George Steward did a great job writing a novel that is timeless in nature.","I had been really looking forward to this book. Sadly, it really didn't deliver. I found the story telling very linear, the main character Ish, lacking in any real depth and the logic of how he and his small band of people survived, very questionable.I found the first 1/3 of the book interesting. The main character Ish, travels the US in search of other survivers of the deadly plague that ravenged the world. It read more as a travel logue than an sci-fi book, but never the less, was still interesting. However, one would be better served reasing the book, \"A world without us\".Ish, seems nonplused by the vanishing of humanity. The character uses \"logic\" to deal with the situation, but calls those who are enotional or \"crazy\" as being in shock. Frankly, it appeared to me that Ish was in shock, due to his lack of emotion over the loss of basically everyone. It was as if he rationalized it this way, \"wow, everyones gone, oh well, I'm lonely, but that's the breaks\".Finally, gathering enough other stragglers together to form \"the tribe\", they seem to live solely on old can goods from local markers for...22 years!!. I don't know about you, but the last thing I would eat was a can of food that was 22 years old.It appears as if everyone in the \"tribe\" was hit with the stupid stick. Any normal parent would teach their kids the basics of reading and writing, not these folks, it's as if they all just gave up. Plus there is a point in the story where it's highlighted that none of the children even know numbers! WTF? Any normal parent teaches their kids how to count their freaking fingers and toes!Also, the book was written in 1947, yet no one in the book knows a thing about gardening! No one had victory gardens during the war? No one lived on ration cards?It's like all these people dropped out of the sky.There are some many other things wrong with this book, I could go on for pages.Why did I give it 3 stars? 1 for it was a post apocolypic story, the second for the first 1/3 was okay, and lastly, the 3rd star because there were some mildly interesting moments.Beyond that, it's like a group of morons running around in a dark room trying to find the switch.","If you're manic depressive you definitely don't want to read this book. Normally, I love exploring the delicious idea of an end of the world scenario, then having the opportunity to start over. But, I was amazed at how much I hated this book. The characters simply showed little redeeming value and did little but live off the works of the last surviving generation. God, how I slogged through the entire book, hoping that it would get better, that I was going to learn some valuable life lesson or something. It never came. When I finished the book this morning, after reading it in spurts over a period of a month, I really was depressed!The writing is workman like, which is sad, because there's not a poetic line in the whole book, with the exception of the title itself. Oh well.","Having just finished reading Earth Abides, by George R. Stewart, my mind cannot put it down. When I began the book, I expected an apocalypse type novel, and it is that, but it is very much more. I was drawn into the existence of the main character, Isherwood Williams, in such a profound way that I am quite at a loss without him. He is not a formula hero, in that he has human frailties. He is a ponderer and a worrier, much like me. Perhaps that is why I was able to relate to him so easily. He takes nothing at face value, instead he is always fretting, contemplating, and evaluating. His successes are mitigated and his blessings are mixed, as is often the case in real life. There is nothing about the book that is formula, which is a rarity in this genre. On the contrary, it is a truly original work, replete with both adventure and philosophy. The writing style flows beautifully, without an unnecessary phrase or a word out of place. It is a true work of literature, one of the best books I ever read. I am sure that its effect on me will endure, and I will remember this book and its vivid characters for the rest of my life.","I first read this probably 40 years ago and I've re read it over the years, most recently last week.This is a book that stays with you and I was surprised how much I remembered. But I had forgotten just how emotional it was. Stewart's prose seems simple and utilitarian but has real depth of feeling.It's a terrific book.","Very well written and interesting plot. Kept reader wondering what was next. Could not put the book down. I have it on my e-reader and will read again","A friend let me borrow this book to read and I could not put the book down. I do reccommend anyone reading this book, even to this day I still am thinking about the story. It does make you think of how you would be able to work things out when everything you know has disappeared. Great read, I loved this book so much that I had to get a copy for myself!!","I've read a lot of Science Fiction in the past 35 years and found this just ok. I guess I didn't get the underlying message. There was little action, little adventure and basically a bunch of slackers degenerating back into the middle ages. The main character Ish was an odd duck that I could not relate to. I guess I just don't get it.","I felt that this book is very monotonous in how the main character of the book travels around the country looking for people and answers to what happen to the world. he will go in to extreme detail in minor occurrences like seeing something like a body or a hammer. i think this book is very good and has a good plot and deep thesis but i wouldnt recommend this book because it is a slow pace dragging book.","I first read this novel, borrowed from the library, in 1963 and was intrigued by the by the author's detailed descriptions and unique story line. I purchased it in 1987 and re-read it, then loaned the book to a friend and lost track of it - but it was every bit as enjoyable again. Now, I'm 68 and purchased it thru Amazon and re-re-read every word in detail. It is still a tremendously powerful novel and challenges the readers to place themselves in the past and future. What would you do to rebirth a civilization? How could you cope in those first, empty days. What regrets might you have as you witnessed the demise of literature and art? What, then, the consequences as the \"Earth Abides?\"","I realize this is a 'classic' of science fiction, but I couldn't find it in me to really love it. It''s good, but sooo dated in many respects. And frankly, I never really connected with Ish, the main character. Still I am glad I read it, because of its enduring status.","Even at 60 years old this book still resonates as to the plight of man and his insignificance in the universe. Told as a simple story of survival of the species it gives the reader pause for thought about many issues. Well written without much superflous wording. Great detail on the impact of man and what his loss would mean to the planet.","I love the apocalyptic genre. I had high hopes for this book and it started off good as the main character travels across the country during the aftermath of the disease (which he did not witness first hand while it was happening). After he meets up with a group of fellow survivors, they form a small community and from then on the whole book just seems to be pointless and boring. I got excited when the main character's two sons decided to take a trip across country, but the story line did not follow them on their trip and we found out little of what they saw and experienced when they returned. That infuriated me. Overall, this book was disappointing.","I have been a huge fan of the TEotWaWKI (The End of the World as We Know It) genre for quite some time. In a conversation with a fellow fan, I revealed that I have not heard of this book. After the shouts of shock and consternation died down, I was strongly urged to read it.Boring!Most of the book is taken up by the main character (Isherwood Williams) going on and on about what he or others should do. Then he does nothing! It got to the point that, after an actual interaction with another character (rare though they were), I dread the blah-blah-blah that was about to come.The only reason why I finished this book (and kept this from being a single star review) was the insight it provided on the age in which it was written. These are the things that stand out for me:* Being apologetic for not killing or running off the supposed mentally dificient member of the group.* It seeming to be OK for younger folk to painfully pinch very old people when they don't respond as expected (so much for respecting your elders).* The shame in having to bypass a mountain lion rather than killing it.* Killing a calf only for its liver, and killing its mother just because it was in the way.* Fear that a kid may be too smart and the need to keep it from reading too much.* Purposely not using reference material when trying to do something for which they have no experience.* Seeming lack of desire for good food. Whatever is around is good enough. No need to go out of your way to make something good.* The only time sex is implied is for making babies or cast aspersions upon someone's character.This was an exercise in anti-intellectualism and anti-sensualism. I'd rather be killed in the plague than to have to live with this bunch.","I've read many of the \"apocalyptic\" books. This was a quiet one. Since it was written in 1949, that might explain that. It was a pleasure not to see the F-word at all, and so many of the other obligatory modern slang phrases. It did avoid any positive reference to religion, so it is \"modern\" in that respect. Not exciting at all, and somewhat sad. Probably would appeal to women and those who consider themselves as intellectual or literary critics. Me, I just wanted some action from this book--not.","Why is this kindle book \"not available to kindle customers in Australia\"? SHAME on you Amazon. This was the best book I ever read as a teenager and I so wish to read it again","I read this book years ago (in the early 80's I think). It was my first post-apocalyptic novel and there are pieces of it I still remember. When something kills most of the people in the world, Stewart takes us into middle America. A dog named Bridget (I think), an Irish Setter, sits and waits for her people to come home. Bridget's bewilderment and her mourning is what I remember. The protagonist is a teen-aged boy who struggles to survive. Along the way he meets a housewife in her 30's, and she eventually becomes his wife. She's lost her husband and children and there's something she's hiding--a secret that illustrates how the world has changed since 1949 when Stewart wrote \"Earth Abides.\" Earth Abides ends on a positive note with humanity not quite back to square one. If you like \"everyone dies-but-us\" books and you're sick of flesh-eating zombies and vampires, I recommend it.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005F6569Y/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title","I read this book as a teenager. I've shared it with everyone from siblings to grandchildren and they all agree. It's a thought provoking look at a possible future for the earth. A must read for everyone!","This is a remarkable science fiction novel that has stood the test of time. I read it in the early sixties and recently bought it for my daughter.","What an excellent book! I read this on Vacation in Cancun, and couldn't put it down. I may have missed a couple good vacation days totally engaged with this story. Well worth it.","Earth Abides is a great book in general but among its genre its easily one of the best. If you enjoy post apocalypse fiction then this is a must read. No hesitation at a five star review.","Isherwood Williams is away in the mountains pursuing his graduate field studies in geology. In our iPhone, instant connectivity world it is hard to imagine the isolation this kind of trip entailed in the 1950's when George Stewart wrote his book. Recovering from a snake bite, Ish stumbles back from the hills to find most of humanity wiped out by disease. We follow Ish through the remainder of his life as he comes to terms with a changing Earth--an Earth on which humanity is a barely noticeable presence.The absence of humanity is not only a stark fact, but is emphasized by the author's writing style. Ish is a clear introvert and we experience much of the Earth's change through his internal monologue. Even when he encounters, interacts with, and teams up with other people, this produces very little dialogue. This style underscores the aloneness of the book's characters. It's not loneliness, in the emotional sense, but a continuing reminder that other people no longer play a significant role in the world.The Earth itself becomes an evolving character in the book. We experience the successive rise and fall in populations of insects, rats, dogs and other species as seasons in the Earth's changing life. The diminishing resources scavenged by human beings from cities and storehouses are important to their survival, but also serve as markers of change as the Earth sheds the thin layers of Man's influence. This change is not progress, nor is it overly mourned as decline. It is thoroughly described and documented as inevitable change. Ish observes it and reacts to it. But neither he nor the other characters influence its path or pace.Read and compare this book with two other classics of post-Apocalyptic fiction:Alas, BabylonandThe Day of the Triffids. These works also follow their characters through crises, scavenging, and attempts to preserve the technology and civilization of the past. They are both more optimistic and more social in narrative style and in the strategies followed by their characters. After reading them, return to Earth Abides and appreciate it for the melancholy and aloneness felt by both its characters and its readers. It is a good story, a moving experience, and a skillful integration of message and writing style.","The premise of this story is the elimination of 99% plus of the human race as a result of a world-wide plague. The plague only effects humans. All other species of life continues to live and in some cases, thrive. Does that sound like something you've read before? I don't think so. In this story the plague kills slow enough to allow the living to bury the dead, thus the streets are not full of dead bodies and the freeways are empty. The remaining few gather themselves into small \"tribes\". The leader of the tribe in our story was a history professor at a major university which is very close to the location of the University of California, Berkley. As a professor he observes the progress, or regress, of his tribe as a student might and creates a tale that would be appropriate for an Anthropology class.Equally interesting to the \"student\" is the impact on the ecology as a result of the loss of mankind. It is truly amazing how much control man has and the impact of his sudden removal. To give even examples would be to deprive the reader of experiencing it themselves. Although not a long book it covers a period of around 70 years or more. It does so by summarizing periods of 10-20 years into short chapters. The author does an excellent job of maintaining continuity in this manner.I would recommend this book hold-heartedly to the serious reader, not because it is a difficult read, for it is actually quite an easy read, but because it is not an action adventure story but a serious look at the possible destiny of mankind. A destiny which I for one would hope we would be better than. The story was written in 1949 but would vary little if written today. An \"end of earth story\" with a very modern premise would be \"One Second After\" written in 2009 which was fascinating to read back-to- back with Earth Abides and which I will be reviewing separately.","Earth Abides is well worth the read. It is difficult for me to suggest precisely why that is so, thus very little actually happens through the course of the book.I suppose there may lay its charm. It's simplicity seems to add plausibility. My impression is that there was much more hype than the title deserved, nevertheless, it certainly deserves some.","With nearly 300 reviews of this book at Amazon, I hardly have to give a summation of the story. I was swept along by the narrative, and I identified greatly with Ish, the protagonist of this post-collapse novel, perhaps because of affinity with his personality. However, I do not give it 5 stars because I happen to differ with the kind of fall-back-into-pre-literate-history climax. Ish should have done a lot more than he did to preserve literacy and a connection with tradition. True, the memory of the Iliad and the Odyssey and the real horrors of the Holocaust is not something we could describe as essential for the survival of mankind, but I could not blithely accept the disappearance of the history and the literature of our human species. There is much that is terrible in our history, but much also that is heroic and even sublime.However, I must say this book is one that will stick in my mind for a long time, and it is rare today to find a book that will have that effect. Most of the books today that are lauded as \"good reads\" are just entertainment for a few hours but are quickly forgotten. Not so with \"Earth Abides.\" You may argue with certain aspects of the novel, and/or certain philosophical conclusions of its author, but once you've read it, I doubt that you will be able to dismiss it or pretend you didn't spend a few hours with the survivors of \"the plague.\"","I read this book when I was a freshman in High School, after it was assigned by a cool female sci-fi teacher. At the time I didn't care much for reading, but I read Earth Abides cover to cover. The book changed me, turned me into a reader and then a writer. That was over 30 years ago, and still I so often think about various sections in the book. Now, here I am, ready to purchase another copy and reread the incredible novel, just to see again how it still so deeply affects me. Earth Abides is powerful, memorable, and deeply moving--it is everything a book should be.","This is, if not the best, at least one of the best books of its type ever.The story is told with a grittiness that makes every page crackle with life. I read it first in high school, and have read it several times since. I was so happy to see that Del Rey Books re-issued this timeless classic in 2006.A whole new generation of readers will be able to enjoy Stewart's amazing novel.A. C. Ellisauthor ofIn Pursuit of the Enemy,Worldmaker,Soldier of 'Tween, andSHADOW RUN: Book I of The Ancients' War","Isherwood (Ish) Williams has recently finished grad school and is camping in California when he is bitten by a rattlesnake. At first the injury seems minor, but he rapidly descends into a delirium-filled illness. After several weeks, he gradually regains his senses wondering how a simple snake bite could have affected him so strongly. He heads back into town and find everyone gone. It seems a bit odd at first, but Ish thinks to himself that perhaps it is Sunday (he has lost track of time). He eventually comes across a newspaper that describes a devastating plague that has swept across the country, and he becomes aware of the full magnitude of the catastrophe that has struck the United States and the World. What follows is one of the best stories about post-apocalyptic survival ever written.This book is divided into three sections, the first two taking the lion's share of the space. In the first section, Ish discovers the plague, realizes he is one of the few survivors, and decides to take a cross country trek to see who and what else has survived. In the second section, set 22 years after the first, Ish has settled down with a small number of other survivors who start families in the SF bay area. We see the first and second generations of children born after the plague who have no concept or awareness of what we would term modern civilization (and all that implies for better or worse). We follow the slow decay of the remnants of the earlier civilization, and the construction of a new way of life. In the final section, Ish is an old, dying man reflecting on his life and all that has happened. In between each of the three major sections are brief vignettes that cover the major events of the the chapters that are set decades apart.This is largely an introspective tale about Ish's thoughts and emotions as his world crumbles around him and is rebuilt and transformed. If you're looking for a story about a lone survivor battling mutant zombies or some such thing, you'll be disappointed. In the first section, Ish is just trying to make sense of what happened and figure out what he wants to do. In the second, he tries to teach the children of his small community something about what life was like prior to the plague and maintain some continuity with the past. One of the children ask him what an American was, and Ish finds that it isn't so easy to explain. In the third section, Ish is the only pre-plague survivor left in the community, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren now unrecognizeably changed to cope with their new environment. There is some action in this story, but not much. One of the best aspects of this story (and this genre in general) is that the author explores what would happen to all the trappings of modern life if the machinery just stopped. In some ways, the changes would be immediate and profound, in others, changes would take more time.The bottom line is that this sad, introspective tale woven around some Biblical themes is an all-time classic in my view and definitely recommended. There are some outdated (or just plain different) ideas and ways of thinking in this book (Stewart wrote it in the late '40s I believe), but don't let that stop you from reading the book. Stewart conveys a message and asks some questions that are relevant to people and human nature whatever epoch they happened to be born in. People will be reading this 100 years from now. I read this book (along with Alas Babylon) many years ago as a teen and decided to re-read the pair again. There are many powerful images from this book that I still remember now decades later. My view now has changed a bit as I can understand Stewart's central message better, but no matter what you think about this genre in general, this is a timeless story that you'll never forget.","What happens if mankind is almost wiped out yet the infrastruce remains relatively untarnished? What skills are most valuable in such a situation? Once Maslow's hierarchy of needs has been fulfilled, what comes next? Can a society regress but improve simultaneously? Can extreme preventive measures be moral? I love a Mad Max post apocalyptic tale, but the seemingly pedestrian situations and questions posed in this book continue to haunt me long after reading it.","I read this book 35 years ago while in junior high. It captivated me. I pondered (as only an adolescent can) what I would do if I were Ish. What would I do if I came home from a trip into the mountains and found the world dead of a plague. How would I respond? What would I do? How would I survive? How would I cope?I read it again when I was in high school and the same musing returned. I found it in my box of \"things\" several years later when I was 23, after I was married. I sat down that afternoon and read the entire book. Again it affected me - but in a different, more mature way. After I had children, I gave it to my daughter to read when she was 16. She found it to be a very fascinating read on the sociological impact on man of a devastating plague which leaves only a few scattered survivors. I have lent my copy to several people over the years and everyone who reads it finds the book to create emotion and ponder what they would do in such a situation.The mystery and appeal of the book lies in the writer placing the reader into the conscience of the main character named Isherwood \"Ish\" Williams. There are several undertones within the book - one of which is the role of the reluctant leader, the second the \"sacramental\" image of the hammer. It also shows the tendancy of man to desire religion.This book review, I hope, motivates someone to read a book that they may not have read by simply looking at the cover. You will be mesmerized by this well written classic... I guarantee! (I have been mesmerized by it 5 times now in the past 35 years)","I remember first reading this book in High School almost 30 years ago - the story of Isherwood Williams and his struggle to survive in a world where 99% of the people have perished in a biological holocaust. Well written, it keeps the readers attention pretty much throughout. While the book suffers a tiny bit of \"out-dated-ness\" (no mention of cell phones, or the internet) it is still an excellent and well-thought-out read about the demise of our techno-centric civilization. I especially like the way the book takes you through the passing of years, and eventually decades - to a future that makes you step back and say \"Yeah, I can see that happening...\" Enjoy the book, it's a great read!","I just read this book again. I don't know how many times I've read it and I enjoy it each time. I bought it at a used book store in Las Vegas years ago and I'm so glad that I did.","Disappointed. I'm slowly learning to pay more attention to Amazon's negative reviews to get a more calculating grasp of a book's contents.Apparently civilization goes out with a very orderly, civilized whimper. As the police and military forces crumble along with everything else in a matter of months, civil order magically maintains itself with little looting. Perhaps a feasible conclusion to reach, but much more fleshing out was needed to explain the psychosocial motives for such an end to 99%+ of the human race.The author makes no effort to create a story arc--this is a poorly written fictional ethnography, not a novel. The plot mirrors the personality of the plodding, coldly methodical protagonist.Most of the other characters are two-dimensional and cliched, following personality and behavioral stereotypes you'd expect from a 1949 bog standard. While this is feasible /to a certain extent/, the author proceeds with no introspection about it, as though the Leave It to Beaver cast was instantaneously transplanted into a world without people.On the positive side, the author makes distinct efforts to present the ecological side effects of humanity's disappearance. But this saving grace grows old, too, as the novel plods through the decades following the apocalypse.Now that I think of it, I believe that's exactly what the author intended, realism be damned. He imagined a band of primitive hunter-gatherers in the withered skeleton of an American city, and worked backward to see how it would fall into place. Too bad verisimilitude was the first casualty, normally a hallmark of the genre.","I wanted to like this book. I really did...but after getting into it, I had to stop and put it down. The plot is just too unrealistic, and the main character Ish is robotic and boring. As some other reviewers have stated, Ish shows almost no emotion after literally 99.9% of the human race is wiped out. He reacts clinically, robotically, and without apparent emotion after he returns to his parent's house to find everyone dead or missing. \"Hmm, that's interesting. Everyone's dead.\" He takes a freakin' road trip to \"look for survivors\" --yet leaves them all behind--deeming them unsatisfactory companions. This is justified by stating that Ish enjoys solitude. Umm...sorry, I enjoy the outdoors and solitude as much as anyone, and no normal person would react in such a way. Ever hear of the \"mad trapper\" or \"cabin fever\"? That's what really happens to people denied human interaction. Madness. Depression. Paranoia. Suicide. A longing to see another human face.The author, an English professor, must have fancied himself in the role of Ish--a purely logical, Spock-like Vulcan wandering around an empty world. This was a mistake--don't make the protagonist (and hero) of the novel to be a clone of yourself--the savior of the new society, a professor. Gag. I just couldn't buy into that. I also didn't like the author's prose--dry and dull. I can see why some people liked the book, but it just didn't do it for me. I'm thinking things would be a lot more like \"Lord of the Flies\" than \"Earth Abides\"!","The reviews I noticed are fine reports on this fine book. However, one point may have been overlooked. This is the first book I'd read (my first read was back in the 1960s) that used the term ecology. Mentioning this point will deepen the other reviews.","Stewart's books was perfectly creepy and emotional. I identified with the protagonist greatly, and do not feel he was too passive or overly-cerebral. Truth be known, in the few crises I have known, I've often reacted much like him. Okay, I'm a little more attached to things than he is, but I feel this is a plot contrivance to allow the story to go forward.Having read and re-read &quot;The Stand&quot; quite a few times now, I was struck by Stewart's decision (1) not to gather large groups together, (2) not to restart civilization (e.g., electricity, running water, et al), and (3) to cover such a large span of time. &quot;The Stand&quot; covers perhaps up to a year after a plague wipes out 99% of the human race. This book covers over a half-dozen decades. I feel that all three of these decisions demonstrated a far more likely result than King's use of dreams as a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; to gather persons into two camps for the &quot;final conflict&quot; between good and evil.Born in 1976, I am only now becoming aware of these post-apocalyptic classics. I have now finished &quot;On the Beach&quot; by Nevil Shute, &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot; by Pat Frank, and of course this one. The first two dealt with the all-too-real Nuclear Nightmare that even I experienced (though all those younger than me can't even remember there being a USSR). Shute's book was &quot;a stern warning of things to come&quot; and &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot; was more of a man vs. nature story.But this one, it dealt with the nightmare that first captivated me in &quot;The Stand&quot; - a world decimated by plague, leaving the infrastructure intact. While Stewart did not pick up the thread the way I wish he had - that is, some form of civilization being preserved, rather than yet another &quot;Time Machine&quot;-style primitive culture that barely recalls our culture. However, Stewart does spend a great amount of time talking about the decay of this world, and that fascinated me. Storm drains clogging, water seeping into houses and rotting the carpets, termites collapsing houses over the work of decades, dust settling into the corners of the Golden Gate Bridge and grass growing there, and the work of rain and frost on the Northeast roads. All of this riveted me.My biggest complaints are mostly minor, such as (1) how could running water go on for 20 years? (2) why did it take so long for the electricity to run out, and the biggest one (3) why were there no signs of panic (e.g., looting, riots, massive traffic jams as swarms of panicked people ran about in civilization's death throes, et al).My biggest gripe, however, is spiritual. Nobody in this book, even former churchgoers and clergy, feel any need to reach out to God. Admittedly, I'm biased, being a Christian, Biblical scholar, and future University prof. But I am a rational being, and I feel a rational argument can be made for the spiritual side of man, a characteristic that even the protagonist recognizes, even if he can't properly articulate, let alone address, this &quot;God-shaped hole&quot; in each of us.Now, I realize that science fiction, even more than other genres, allow us to paint on a blanked canvas (the devastated world) our worldviews on such things as man's innate goodness or evil, the necessity or redundancy of God (e.g., church, Scriptures, etc.), the expression of our social nature, the necessity (or redundancy) of modern technologically-dependent society, and so forth. I understand that we're not all going to agree; I don't feel it's my job to insist on homogeneity amongs everyone. However, if I wrote a book along these lines, I would make sure to include atheists, skeptics and agnostics, along with members of other religions (at varying degrees of dedication) along with those persons I feel &quot;make sense&quot; from my perspective. While by no means do I feel &quot;all religions lead to God&quot; or that &quot;you just need to be sincere,&quot; I do agree that any description of a post-apocalyptic (or any other) reality, in order to be fair to the multiplicity of human thought and experience, must recognize that &quot;it takes all kinds.&quot;That said, I did find myself chilled by the spiritual apathy evidenced, among other things, by the community's perception of &quot;Evie,&quot; the mentally-challenged pariah. &quot;We don't want no idiot children ruining the gene pool&quot; the protagonist declared in some fashion on numerous occasions. While I may see, in a survival-based world, the necessity of taking precautions, I did feel that the cold and unfeeling attitude (&quot;should we have even let her live?&quot; Ish asks himself repeatedly) was frightfully inhumane. There is no &quot;all are created equal&quot; here, no &quot;all are God's children&quot; here. While I understand expediency, I do not feel it must be carried out heartlessly.However, apart from this one real gripe, I truly do recommend this book to anyone interested by such things, like me. After borrowing this book from a library (copies are hard to find!) I've decided to buy it. I suppose that's the best recommendation I can give...","This novel, Earth Abides, written by George Stewart takes place in San Francisco during present times. A worldwide virus overtakes and wipes out the entire human race, leaving only a select few alive. Of these few is a man named Isherwood who goes in search of other survivors to band with. He meets a woman named Emma and a few other people who start a new civilization. It is not easy, however, and they are constantly hitting head-to-head with nature, fighting for survival. As in any other society, there are some people who challenge the law that was laid down in the beginning. As a result, certain members of the tribe are divided. Unity is essential for survival...will they make it? Only time will tell.The author of this book was probably raised in a Christian environment because there are many Biblical references in this book. For example, one of the characters in this novel is named Ezra, as is an Old Testament prophet. Stewart&#65533;s Christian roots are evident in the way he unravels his novel and the double meanings behind some of his story. For example, a child named Joey is born to Ish and Em that is far more intelligent than any other of the many children. Ish finds hope in this young boy because he knows that Joey&#65533;s outstanding brightness will one day be of great use to future peoples, just as God had much pride in His son Jesus.This novel is a wake up call to the reader in that it brings attention to how weak and vulnerable humans really are. What if mankind were to die today? Would people have their affairs set in order?This novel is a fictional story but has real-life applications. For example, there are real people facing real starvation and shelter needs. Stewart portrays very well the thoughts and feelings of each of the characters, which enhances the story line.Earth Abides is an excellent novel. It is extremely well written and it flows nicely. Anybody thirteen years of age and older should definitely read this book because it captures the reader&#65533;s attention and has the ability to transport the reader to a world no longer inhabited by humans. Younger children may not be able to understand some of the vocabulary in this book and may be easily confused due to the complex plot line. However, I give this book a two thumbs up.","Despite the quality of Stewart's writing, which is elegaic at its best and readable at its worst, this is a very creaky and dated work. Certainly, you have to make some allowances for the culture and time in which books are written, but like John Wyndham, Stewart seems handicapped by an assumption of the rightness of bourgeois values, especially when it comes to women. The book does address this, and in some ways is all about the struggle to maintain these values in a world where they are making less and less sense. But, you get the feeling that, in terms of sociopolitical change (as opposed to the obvious physical change - the old infrastructure has been destroyed), it's a case of 'apocalypse? what apocalypse?'. Stewart's characters are like Hollywood western stereotypes - the men are either upright patriachs or shifty loners; the women are wives and daughters who appear strong but are really just there for breeding and cooking. There are works which do tackle the obvious questions of the use of social roles in a society totally different from that which created them, most notably the vastly under-rated New Zealand film, The Quiet Earth (if I've remembered the name right). Read Stewart by all means: it isn't a bad book, but it isn't the classic it's built up to be.","Many readers will find this book very frustrating. It describes in one lifetime the dissolution of civilization on the planet. We know that if even a handful of humans survive a major disaster they will probably cling to the fundamentals of civilization a bit longer than one generation.In particular we will cling to reading and writing. These are the foundation skills of civilization. Writing systems are one of the foundation stones upon which civilization is built. The notion that we would allow a generation of kids to grow up without teaching them to read and write is tantamount to criminality.But if you stop seeing this as a single generation book, and think of it more as though Ish, the lead character, is able to see through many generations, then the story becomes much more believable.With all the talk of avian flu and the potential for a super virus this book seems eerily relevant to society today. Much more so than when it was written. Throughout the book we have metaphors for the natural balance of nature as we see one rampant population of animals after another expand and then die back to sustainable levels. And the question must always be, is the human population on earth sustainable?The answer is clearly no! And if we don't do something about our population levels and our resource consumption, this book may well represent our future on this planet.","First, I would like to say that just about everything to say about this book has been said. Most reviews are accurate, there are some great characters in this book and Ish does have some intense experiences, however I have mixed emotions as far as this book goes.Ish's long time companion Em, is a reliable and loving character, Ish & The Tribe look to her for strength and wisdom, time & again she delivers. She is loved and respected by all, but when she passes away, her death is all but over in one paragraph. It is similar with old George, he is a lovely character, like a grandfather or old uncle, I would have liked to see a few pages devoted to his passing. This is not the case. This leaves me a little flat.Some parts of the story are deeply moving ie when the boys return after their adventure and a stranger is with them. He is the carrier of desease and when he will not leave when asked, a solution must be found. The elders have to make a decision that chills them all to the bone. Great reading, but when Em & old George die it is almost glossed over.I enjoyed this book, but I would not recommend it as a light read. If you are into PA stories and you like deep intense stories, then I guess this is for you.If you are after action and adventure, stay away.","I know this book was first published in 1949. I can overlook the unlimited shelf life of canned goods and gasoline. It's the main character \"Ish\" who ruined this story for me. He is your typical elitist douche bag who confuses a large vocabulary with intelligence. With a university library at his fingertips, this mental giant could not learn the basics of survival (agriculture, animal husbandry, auto repair, food storage etc...)in his lifetime! I muscled through the book hoping it would redeem it's self in the end, but I ended up losing eight bucks on my kindle and three days of my life. If you want to read this \"classic\" be prepared for constant complaining about the stupidity of others while doing absolutely nothing to better the situation. Hubris abounds with his superior attitude and god complex. He's also a bit of a racist (Not for his use of the word \"Negro\", but for his temptation to use the black people he encounters to make himself king!) and a sexist.","My hobby is reading . I enjoy reading stories. all kinds of stories by bestselling authors or never heard of authors. always looking for a good story. In my search I have read some great stories, some not so great and just plain awful. but only three times have I ever disliked a story where I could not finish it. This story was so bad not only could I not finish it I would like a refund. the story line could of been interesting. The writing was horrible. I hope it is a long time before I come across a book this bad again.","I liked the book but all the characters were technologically ignorant. Even in the forties they had small portable generators but this was ignored in the book. One part of the book basically said they let all the lights go out. People knew about generators then and if not you would've have soon found out.","I'm not talking about the pandemic itself; I'm talking about the aftermath. I found the lack of progress of the human race, as detailed in this book, to be very unlikely. Even assuming that out of initial group of adults in Ish's group, Ish is the only highly intelligent one, I found it really hard to believe that the adults wouldn't bother to teach the kids how to read and do math, so that they'd be able to use the libraries to learn the skills they'd need to survive. It didn't make sense that there would only be two main characters with any sort of curiosity about *anything*. Why was knowledge of carpentry lost when The Tribe's carpenter died? Didn't he train anyone in his craft? Didn't anyone want to learn?I expected this book to outline some sort of return to the land, which would be much more realistic than having The Tribe live off canned food for forty years. This book spends way too much time expounding on how intelligent Ish is without showing him actually doing anything to help the human race.","I had heard excellent things about Earth Abides. I have always liked post apocolyptic books, and this is often the first recommendation by people. I tried reading it once, but thought the writing was detached and boring after a few pages, so put it down, and gave it away. Then, i saw the audio version on sale on audible.com, and downloaded it.I know this book was written in 1949 or something, and those I've talked to, comment on that as if its an excuse for blatant and rampant sexism and racism. But, I'm sorry, there is not accepatance in me for any of this no matter when it was written.The women are portrayed as either blood sucking, parasitic whores or blank and faceless wombs. Even his dog, a female dog, is described as ungrateful, needy and parasitic, expecting to be taken care of without giving anything in return, and provides in no way useful in the way of dogs, that I can remember. She is named Princess.The first non-whites that are encountered are identified as \"Negros\" and are described as unattractive, nervous, hesitant and lice ridden, living in a cabin with cheap and rickety furniture although there are far nicer houses empty for the taking. Our main character trades a dollar bill for eggs, and the \"negros\" are well pleased. So, they are poor, dirty, and stupid.Then, there is our main character, he is an unappologetic arrogant elitist who deems 99% of those he meets as unworthy of living. He decides that they will all die \"secondary\" die off because they are stupid, crazy without will to live. He drives around in his car, looking for people, but yet finding none, eventhough he infact comes across people. None of them are \"worthy\". He even makes a list of why he will survive were the others will die, and the list includes that he is solitary, and never cared much for people anyway. Which seemed strange to me, since he had found 4 or 5 people in one day's search. Its not like the world is entirely empty.I gave it two stars, because initially, I was interested in the observations of the earth and the cities and how nature is taking over and civilization is breaking down, but with no engaging characters or furthering of a worthwhile plot, I quickly lost interest and had to force myself to go on, looking for even a glimmer of the amazement and awe others seem to view this book. I found nothing of the like.","One-and-a-half stars really. Not much happens in this book.The main character spends most of his time musing over the fate of the earth and observing the effects of erosion on human artifacts, now that most of the world's population has been wiped out. One of the racier sections I recall was his observation of a storm water drain overflowing.It took two or three pages.However, the book is readable enough to fill in a bit of time while trapped in a hospital bed for a few days, and might even have earned as many as three stars from me, were it not for the &quot;hero's&quot; much over-inflated sense of self worth which manifests itself on nearly every page, most often by refering in his thoughts to all of his friends as simple, stolid, dull, or just plain stupid.Not to mention what he thinks of those whom he doesn't count among his friends!Maybe we are not meant to like the &quot;hero&quot;, but I think we are, and I can't help thinking that this story could be written by one of those aneamic, spotty, embittered social outcasts that one often finds lurking in the shadows at science fiction conventions, more at home with his onanistic fantasies than with any human being. I quote:&quot;...he realized that in some ways...he felt a new security and even satisfaction at the contemplation of a solitary life. His worries in the old days had been chiefly about people. The prospect of going to a dance had more than once sent him into a sweat; he had never been a good mixer; no one had asked him to join a fraternity. In the old days, such things were a handicap to a man. Now, he realized, they were actually a great advantage. Because he had sat on the edge of so many social gatherings, not quite able to mingle in the conversation, listening, watching objectively, now he could endure not being able to talk, and again could sit and watch, noting what happened. His weakness had become strength. It was as if there had been a blind man in a world suddenly bereft of light. In that world, those with seeing eyes could only blunder about, but the blind man would be at home, and now, instead of being the one who was guided by others, he might be the one to whom others clung for guidence.&quot;His intellectual snobbery becomes glaringly obvious as he begins to meet other survivors, and is at it's most repellant when he discusses &quot;half-witted&quot; Evie, whom one of the other survivors found &quot;dirty, grovelling, and unkempt, living in filth with merely enough intelligence to open cans to feed herself on whatever they contained, without cooking or preperation.&quot; This doesn't seem too much of a crime, and neither does the only other thing that seems to be &quot;wrong&quot; with her, that she can't hold a conversation. Nevertheless, the &quot;hero&quot; goes on to say:&quot;It would have been better, he had often thought, if they had merely put a can of sweet ant-poison within her reach somewhere.&quot; Of course, we must remember that when this book was published, in in 1949, social policy in the US was still under the sway of brianiac and boffin advocates of eugenics, and many &quot;subnormals&quot; and &quot;moral degenerates&quot; were still being sterilized by court order, despite the widespread revulsion over the results of Nazi social engineering procedures based on the same premises. A good antidote to the attitutudes expressed by this book is to be found in Jonathan Kellerman's excellent thriller &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot;, wherein eugenicists lurk behind a spree of cowardly murders. Kellerman's book is also recommended as a healthy locus for introspection by any readers of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; who find themselves agreeing with the &quot;hero's&quot; attitudes and solutions.","Overall this book didn't impress me enough to ever recommend it to anyone else but it also wasn't horrible. The beginning explanation of the plague and the prehistory of the character are so vague that the rest of the book is ruined. Doesn't stand anywhere near books like The Stand or Swan Song.","I would not recommend this book. UNLESS you are having a hard tiime falling asleep!! The main character, Ish is supposed to be an educated man who survives a deadly world wide virus. He uses his aledged power of observation to observe how the people around him, who are incapable of doing anything without his help survive. Unfortunately for the people around him, Ish seams to be unable to do anything but watch and complain.","Earth Abides is a disaster story where aplague almost wipes out humans. Becausewe grew too prosperous we had to die, according to the author, that is just the way things work. So the few survivors get by never trying to improvetheir lives, having no ambition the human race lapses into hunter gatherers with only superstition as a guide. Thisbook is a waste of a good oportunity. Insted of saying &quot;Hey, we can occomplishthings if we work hard and perservier.&quot; The author tells us &quot;Hey, we're almost as good as cockroaches and if we drop our standards, we too can can eek out ameager existence.&quot;I don't have to pay people to depress me, I can do that all by myself. What awaste of time and money.","I read this book a number of years ago, and forgot about it. Recently, I saw it on the shelf, and decided to re-read it. After forcing myself to read it, I understand why it was easy to forget.The main character, Ish, is highly arrogant and self-righteous. Ish, only Ish, has the power to drive civilization back from a total collapse. Ish has a son, Joey, who worships Ish, and Ish drinks it up. Joey is The Saviour, The One, a child who must be taught the abstract ideas which created Civilization. Nothing else matters.The side-characters are all inferior. These are the people with skills to survive. This includes artistic skills which doesn't include the formal education which _must_ be part of any \"real\" artists training.The most interesting part of it all is the background story of how the Earth really abides without Man trying to impose his will. Structures decay due to natural events; forests and wild-life reclaim the land.It may be a classic book, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a good book!","I have been a fan of PA fiction for over 30 years. My first PA novel was the children's novel \"Beyond the Dark River\" by Monica Hughes - a novel which I read when I was eleven. It hooked me on PA fiction and ever since then I have been trying to find as many novels or movies that I could get my hands on.I had read good things about Earth Abides online and was looking forward to reading it. Can I say how disappointed I was? Perhaps it was the era in which it was written, but all I could think of throughout the book is that the new civilization would have been much better off without the pompous a$$ of the main character Ish. \"They thought of me as a God.\" Good grief!If I could have rated this movie a zero I would have. Take this one out of the library if you must, you'll be glad that you didn't waste your money on it.","I've gotta confess I was not very excited to read this book, having obtained on a bargain and postposed its reading for about a year, when I eventually got to it, I was absolutely blown awaythe writting, althought not brilliant, is very polished and takes you throught the wonderful adventure of the end of mankind as we know it, throught the vast territory of a deserted united states, and tells us how it would slowly and rapidly decay in its various facets, until it would stand almost naked, a fertile ground for life anewcoming throught the plagues caused by the broken ecosystems and among the difficulties tapped by the human intervention we give for granted, it sets up a perfect place for the second half of the book, in which civilization begins again, necessarily different of how it came about in the first place, offering us exciting reflections on how we are and how we'd be, on values and life and growth, we age with the original characters, and by the time Ish is an old man we can see this new world throught the eyes af an old man, we understand and are subjected to the same hoplesness as him in the development of the new world, yet the hope of life, free of our cultural bagages and preconceptions, grows and leaves you a great aftertastean incredible novel, terribly underrated, which should be cherished and shared","Several reviews have noted what they call the essential pessimism of the book: Man Has Fallen, Civilization Is No More, etc. Well, yes, that is all there. But what is also there is a profound triumph of the human spirit: Civilization is Dead - Long Live Civilization. I will NOT spoil the ending, but book ends with a rebirth - an obvious societal pregnancy if you will - of a new civilization, one profoundly in keeping with the new conditions of their brave renewed world.One can imagine a sequel, and I wish Stewart ahd written one!I first read this book almost 50 years ago, and have re-read it multiple times. It is one of the best \"transition\" books ever written. I recommend it on several levels.","An astonishing science fiction novel in the apocalyptic vein, written in 1949, and despite a surprisingly few dated references, a story that remains both entertaining and relevant. In the beginning, protagonist Isherwood Williams (with the unfortunate nickname of \"Ish\") is one of the few survivors of a virus that wipes out a majority of the human population. Ish is in his twenties, an over-educated outsider, who stands on the margins of society analyzing and contemplating what he sees. After a solo excursion across the county and returning to the Bay Area, California, he slowly joins up with an assortment of characters, and becomes the de facto leader of \"The Tribe\". The struggles that confront them are meticulously well thought out and explicated by the author while rarely dragging down the narrative. The slow decay of an industrial society with no one left to manage it and the natural environment no longer held at bay serve as the antagonists. There are no sci-fi pulp orientated elements such as giant mutant killer ants (for better or worse). Threatening the Tribe are scourges of rats, wild dogs, and other animals, as various species overpopulate until starvation brings their numbers down again. There are outbreaks of disease to be dealt with and wild brush fires caused by dead trees no longer cleared away. The novel deftly provides details such as what happens to the plumbing when city reservoirs dry up and fall into disrepair. The real strength of the book, however, is how Ish is forced to confront what knowledge and wisdom needs to be passed on to the future generations in order to rebuild society. Hence with his intelligent introspective nature, interwoven into this entertaining story are thoughtful reflections on what purposes societies serve, what they protect us from, and even what they blind us to and cause us to take for granted. This is a timeless classic our own civilization would be mistaken to let slip into the \"out-of-print\" abyss.","Well almost everything has been already written about this book but I have one new curiosity not yet mentioned by anybody. In fact it's this curiosity that caused me to only give it a three star rating. To enjoy this book I had to believe that the handful of survivors world wide all loss basic curiosity. I can understand the total grief, the total denial and complete loss of the few who survive. I cannot understand the total and complete loss of curiosity. All around the survivors they have the tools, the machines and all the books but nobody has any interest in them. The leader of the survivors gives only lip service to the books but does nothing to really grow from them. Nor does he use them to learn the psychology of how to motivate his tribe. He only once attempts to do anything and at that it's only an after thought. He comes up with an idea that sparks the survivors into thinking about rebuilding a jeep but that's all. Aside from this his tribe cares about nothing. His tribe lives only day to day but seem forever lost in the now and blind, uncaring and unwilling to look to the past and what it can offer to help then survive in the future. The author never mentions curiosity or its loss in any of the timeline that the book traverses. It's as if curiosity never was part of humankind. All in all, I could enjoy the book without curiosity but it left me wondering what if it had included it in the story.","This is the 'end of the world as we know it' novel that all others are compared to. Even though it was written in the 1940's (copyright 1949) it is timeless, not aged at all, a great literary work.It all starts when the main character, Ish, is bitten by a rattlesnake and laid up in a remote cabin, unconscious for an extended period of time, while, unknown to him, a plague destroys over 99% of the population. There begins a superb story of the trials and adventures of one man, and eventually a small group of people, as they battle nature and themselves, and attempt to re-establish civilization. This is one of those rare novels where characterization and plot and setting all mesh together into one beautifully written yarn, that after reading it, you will never forget it, it is that powerful. If there ever existed the proverbial page turner, this is it. Of course, being written in the 1940's no mention is made of personal computers, CD players, and the like, but if civilization was gone these most likely would be of little use anyway.The philosophy and human interest angles contained in this book are well done. The scenes and descriptions of the demise of civilization and peoples' reactions to it, depicted by Stewart, seem very realistic. Your heart will be with the characters of this book when you read it.","Earth Abides is a thought provoking look at how the world would go if almost all people were eliminated from the picture. Some very interesting looks at the eco-structure, reformation of small societies and how they would interact from the short term to the long term. The book has some very sad and touching aspects that help you relate to the characters. The technology is a little outdated because of when the book was written but you can get past that. Overall, a very good book. One I would think in a few years I might like to read again.If you liked &quot;The Stand&quot;, and have wondered what would might happen 50 years afterwards. This is the book for you.","I have been looking for this book for a long time. I read this book for an Environmental Science class at Long Beach State about 20 years ago and it made such an impact on my thinking about the environment. Every time I see grass growing up through the cracks in the street or the roots wrapping around pipes I think of the book. While the environment seems quite fragile, it appears that it is not a fragile as we think and we are the fragile ones.","Let's start with the book's obvious problems. First, the author is a creature of his times -- the 1940's, and his views relect those times. He is paternalistic towards African Americans and women, and he feels that people without much formal education are not very smart or capable. Second, his main character, Ish, is not likeable; he is lazy, selfish, unloving (for the most part), rather anti-social, inflexible, and egotistical. (I am not sure that the author intended Ish to be unlikeable, as Ish is also a creature of his times.) Third, the author's view of the post-apocalytic world does not ring true; even given the dolts that the author has chosen to survive this catastrophe, surely more of the modern world would have survived -- at least for a few generations. (Example [MILD SPOILER]: would middle-class Americans ever decide not to teach their children to read? If there ever were a group of people who needed to know how to read, it would be this new generation!) Fourth, I do not find the biology/physics of this new world to be believable. (Example: where did all of the bodies go?) Fifth, the \"mother earth\" motif that runs throughout the book is hackneyed -- though, in fairness, it might have been fresh in the 1940's.Still, I liked the book. It is a book of ideas dressed up as a post-apocalyptic tale. What does it mean to be human? How does one balance the needs of the group against the needs of the individual? What is culture? What aspects of life/culture have value? What is love? What role should religion play in society? What role should education play? How does one go on after a devastating loss? How can people relate across generational lines? Can one generation truly lead another? What is happiness? What skills in life are most important? When is violence justified? What does death mean? How does one motivate and lead others? What does \"fun\" mean? How do small group dynamics play out? What function do rituals and symbols play in life? How do cultures adjust to rapid change?I did not usually agree with the author's answers to these questions (when he provided them), but they did challenge me. I have thought a lot about the book since completing it.","I agree with another reviewer who said it is a measure of this book's greatness that I still think of it now, fifty years after I read it.Fire, by the same author, is also unforgettable.This from a guy who can re-read a mystery he read three years earlier and not remember who done it.","A horrible disease sweeps the planet in days, killing just about everyone. Isherwood Williams is for some reason spared from this plague, and finds himself a survivor in a barren society. The book follows the course of his life, and that of other survivors, as they live out their days in a new world.My opinions ran wild with this book. For reason I will explain further along in the review, I started out very much enjoying the book, then my interest waned, and finally something clicked into place in my pea-sized brain, allowing me to finish the book on a strong note.I found it very easy to step into the mind of Ish. He reacted in a way to his situation that I felt was very natural, while learning how to cope with life alone. I don't want to give much of the plot away, but roughly the first third of the book deals with Ish's life alone. Ish starts out as something of a loner and a worrier, and seems to adjust to the world...for a while. Soon, he becomes desperate for a purpose, and with that notion, sets out to find out \"what happened\".Later, Ish struggles with his own weaknesses while trying to decide how to save the future. Through it all, Stewart keeps the characters consistant. I found it refreshing that he didn't try to thrust someone into the heroic role. For whatever reason, this earned him a good amount of credibility with me.A note on the writing style; I believe this book was written in 1949, so the flow of the book seemed a little odd to me. Some of the conversations just didn't flow well, and I chalked that up to the age of the book. On the other hand, Stewart's timeline fit right in with the world we live in today, and did not really date the book. Except maybe for spraying DDT around like it was air freshener.Around the middle of the book, I started to lose interest. I guess for me the story sort of bogged down with Ish trying, and consistantly failing, to get his people to try to focus on the finer things in life. As I said earlier, when things finally \"clicked\" for me, I found myself appreciating this part of the book more, as it fit in very well with who Ish was and what his purpose was.The ending was just magnificant. I very much felt what Ish was feeling, and clearly saw that he had finally accepted that things were going to work out for his decendants, even if things didn't turn out exactly as he had planned. I can't stress enough how good of a job Stewart did with the ending.This is not an action novel, and at points did become a bit too philosophical for it's own good. For me, it all came together at the end, but it might turn some people off. Also, as mentioned above, the writing style can seem a little strange, but overall this book shot far up my favorites list. This book easily get's five stars from me.","EARTH ABIDES is such an amazing book. In fact, I happened to keep my high school copy rather than returning it before graduation. Deep down, I think my teacher knew and was happy to take the loss.I have three books that I will not part with - EARTH ABIDES, THE STAND, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. EARTH ABIDES and THE STAND have a lot in common. I am surprised, as were others, by all of those who gave this book such a low rating.The story tells the tale of a college student, Ish, who is working on his thesis up in the mountains. He gets bitten by a rattlesnake and heads to lower ground for help only to discover the human population has been wiped out thanks to some weird plague. The story becomes Ish's quest to live as supposedly the last human on earth.First, I want to clarify that this book was written in the 1940s. Those who complained about the writing being poor, one guy even said the book was written in the 60s and he is wrong, need to look at the times. The world in the 1940s was far different to today. If you cannot adapt to the language differences, skip this book. While I find it rather narrowminded, I also understand the world is full of people who just can't stand something that is different to the norm.In the 1940s, they didn't have the computers, men were working away from their family farms, they'd become used to modern technology, so it isn't surprising that Ish would have allowed so many things to slip by for decades. If the world ended tomorrow how many can honestly say they would know how to irrigate their crops? How many even know how to garden?At heart, EARTH ABIDES needs to be viewed with the consideration of the differences in time. It is and always will be my favorite book.","I am a 62 year old grandmother who has read hundreds of books, but no book ever moved me like this one. It is the story of one thoughtful, intelligent young man spared during a world wide epidemic that wiped out most of the population. While we always expect that the end will come with a bomb that distroys everything, this time, all the infrastructure was left intact. The plants and animals that had evolved to be dependent on humans also succumbed and Mr. Stewart deals with this in a remarkable and sensitive way. Today human beings have brought civilization to the brink, but this book reminds us that no matter what, the Earth Will Abide.","However, if you want Mad Max or his clones go elsewhere. Since I read this book back in grade school it has always been on my shelf, in fact I usually have 2, one personal copy and one copy to give to friends. I read many of the reviews of this book and wonder if some of these people read the same book. To me Earth Abides is one of the most uplifting books ever written. This book shows that no matter what comes, life and happiness will happen. No matter all Ish's failings to teach his people, his Greatgrandchildern are happy, they do not miss what they never knew. He teaches them to survive and they will teach themselves the rest. Again I say if you are looking for an actionpacked end of the world book I would recommend Daybreak-2250 A.D. by Andre Norton. However if you want one of the best books written that will make you think about humanity and all its failings and gifts, READ THIS BOOK! I just wish I could have given it 15 stars instead of just 5.","Ish, a college student, survives a rattlesnake bite and mysterious illness alone on a mountain camping trip. When he recovers, he can't find anyone and slowly realizes a plague has wiped out the human race. He wanders across the country, finding only a few stunned survivors and makes an intelligent and courageous decision to not join the first people he finds. After a period of terrible isolation, he finds Em, a true survivor like himself. They are happy together and attract five other survivors. A tiny little tribe grows around them. Ish devotes his life to trying to bring back civilization as he knew it. He fails at his superficial efforts at farming and at educating the children. He succeeds beyond his deepest dreams at giving his descendants the tools they need to create a healthy, happy way of life. The novel works as a thought-provoking study of what do you do when the world collapses around you. It has some weaknesses. Here and there, the fact it was written in 1949 shows. One can argue that Ish would have been able to get the children to read if only he hadn't been such a boring pedant and he could have been a better farmer if he'd been willing to explore alternate ways and crops. The book's strengths greatly outweigh its weaknesses. For one thing, with not much action, it's a true page turner. This is a fantastic novel to discuss and to argue about and to ponder the fundamental question it raises. What would you do for the rest of your life if you survived the end of the world?","First off, I should state that this novel was written in the late forties, and thus reflects many of the prevailing attitudes of the time. It is rather sexist, and even vaguely racist (although neither element is malicious, just ignorant) so if you think that may ruin the novel for you, then you probably want to skip it. That said, if you can look at \"Earth Abides\" in the context in which it was written, you will find a thoughtful, entertaining novel.\"Earth Abides\" is predicated on a super-virus wiping out the overwhelming majority of the Earth's human population, while leaving the rest of the animal kingdom unaffected (at least directly). The story follows \"Ish\" as he struggles both to survive, and come to grips with the loss of civilization. Over time, a community of survivors gels around him, and they work to scratch an existence out of the ruins of San Francisco.Stewart takes a rather bleak view of the survivors of the holocaust, not to mention their children. Rather than trying to reestablish \"civilization\" they slip into a more or less Stone Age existence, supplemented by the leavings of a culture they are completely alienated from, and that is not understood by the children at all. While I understand that Stewart was seeking to comment on what makes up a \"civilization\", and what the natural human condition is, or should be, I think he introduced an element of wishful thinking into his narrative (strange as that may sound). It is extremely unlikely that things as fundamental as literacy would completely disappear within two generations, and while they might very well fail, I suspect that survivors would at least attempt to maintain electricity, water supplies, etc.Where this novel really shines, and what I found most interesting to read, was Stewart's descriptions of the ecology of a North America largely depopulated of humans. He does a superb job of predicting the fluctuations in various animal populations, and I believe that the long-term balance that he predicts is probably not far from what would actually happen.Ultimately, \"Earth Abides\" is an entertaining novel that leaves one thinking about how they would react in similar situation. While I don't necessarily agree with the way the novel plays out, I was constantly challenged to come up with an explanation as to why I thought things might be different. In the process, I gained a deeper appreciation for the depth of Stewart's characters, and the challenges he pitted them with. If you enjoy \"apocalyptic fiction\" this is definitely a book for you, but even if you have not strong feelings for the genre, I suspect you will enjoy the excellent characterizations, thoughtful story and wonderfully realized world.","This book attempts to answer the age old question, \"what will earth be like without humans?\". In a word, BORING, just like this novel. Don't get me wrong, there are some great parts to this novel with real drama and action and intrigue and heart-wrenching feeling. Unfortunately, those parts are few and far between, and they are between mountains of tedium and monotony. I will give George R. Stewart credit for doing his homework scientifically, historically, culturally, etc, and I have no doubt that if a horrible plague ever wiped out nearly all of the human race, this is probably a really accurate depiction of what would occur. However, and this is why i give this book such a low rating, there is a vast difference between writing an accurate book and an entertaining one. In many ways this book is very similar to other post apocalyptic novels like The Stand, The Road, The Book of Eli, On the Beach, etc etc etc, however, where those novels shine and where this novel falls flat is in the art of story-telling. Basically, this novel has no story other than the mere survival of the last remaining humans. There is no plot, no antagonist (unless you count harsh nature herself), no great task to complete, no long journey to take, and no lesson to be learned. When gone is the human race, the earth and everything on it will still be here, and in the closing words of the author, \"Humans come and go, but the Earth Abides.\"","I really enjoyed this novel from the apocalyptic genre very much. It was not a fantasy good versus evil type of story but rather a speculative look at how civilization might fare if there was a sudden die-off of 99% of the population. In this story there is a sudden plague of such devastating severity that nearly everyone is dead within a couple of weeks of its outset. This book does not focus on the plague or the sufferings of the infected and dying people. No grisly oozing bodies are found in these pages and very little trauma or grief. We enter the picture shortly after the dust has settled, so to speak. The story is not about the plague but about its aftermath. It is told from the perspective of one man who survives and traces his experiences as he goes in search of other survivors and finally settles back in his native California and makes the foundation of a new \"tribe\" of civilized human beings. This book was written in 1949 so it is doubly interesting because it not only gives us a look at the author's speculation about the factors that make up civilization and the interesting trials and successes that might arise, but it also gives us an amazing look at the huge changes that have taken place in our consciousness just in the short period of years since it was written. It has the unexpected bonus of actually confirming some of the points the story originally was designed to suggest. Even though the author seems as though he was an open-minded, perhaps even liberal thinker, the book contains ridiculous racial stereo-types, as well as skewed ideas about the personhood of mentally disabled people and also of women. Women are shown as being entirely domestic and dependent. Cigarette smoking is still very much a happy pastime in this brave new world and is enjoyed by men and their pregnant wives without a care in the world. When a plague of ants becomes a problem the main character, Ish, sprays himself and his pregnant wife down thoroughly with DDT, a substance that is used several times in the surviving world to overcome pests. I found these old-fashioned ideas very interesting when coming from a \"reasonable\" man that no one of his time would have considered to be prejudiced. The book is a thought-provoking page-tuner. I kept imagining that I would have done things in a much different way from the main character but I found the ideas and reasoning to be essentially sound and worth contemplating. This is an interesting look at how the Earth might rid herself of the virus called mankind and is certainly a good look at the power of her self-healing capabilities. I definitely recommend this book.","I first read this book when I was 8 years old. My dad had left it out and I grabbed it up and read it. Even at 8 years old I found this book gripping and thought provoking. As I grew older I would find a copy and read it, and each time I would gain something new from reading this book. I am 45 years old now and I am feeling the urge to read it again. I think the reason why the survivors did not \"rebuild civilization\" was because they were all in shock--their whole world (friends, lovers, children) had been wiped off the face of the earth almost overnight. If you add to this the author's stated premis that the survivors were mostly average to dull, then the story makes more sense. I recommend this book to anyone, it's a sci-fi classic. I also think the movie \"The Omega Man\" might have been inspired by this book.","Many reviewers here expected something different, I think. They are dismayed.They have all the elements properly arranged but do not see how they add up. Ishi characterizes himself as intelligent and the others as inferior to him in cognitive ability, yet he fails in almost all his undertakings.At the first sign of trouble he goes home and sleeps in his boyhood bedroom, then returns there and takes up a permanent residence in the old home place -- this infantile reversion is culture-shock but he can't see it. He is supposedly trained in ecology but is taken by surprise every time the local ecology adjusts itself to mankind's absence -- this emphasizes the futility of a college education in a survival situation. He carries a prejudice against negroes yet marries a mulatto and doesn't even realize it at first -- his blindness extends deeply within him. He tries to educate the youngsters but cannot hold their interest -- he is too disconnected from their reality. He has in front of him all the ingredients for success -- yet fails on his own terms, which are unreal.And yet, he does succeed, doesn't he? In spite of himself he does manage to attract a group which survives and stays together. Gradually over the course of his life he becomes ever-farther removed from reality, while the children take over the lead. They develop the skills they need to live in the new world almost while Ishi is not looking -- they become \"wild Indians\" wearing skins and shooting arrows.Ishi was the name given to the last member of a tribe of California Indians, the Yahi. In 1911 he was brought in by white society and nursed back to health by the Kroebers, with whom he lived. The Kroebers were a university couple, anthropologists. Their daughter Ursula was born in 1929 and grew up with Ishi in the house. Ursula's married name is LeGuin; she has won many awards for her science fiction. (Google 'Ishi' and see.)Ishi also is the short form of Ishmael, a name for the Wandering Jew of legend; Melville's \"Moby Dick\" begins with the sentence, \"Call me Ishmael.\"In short, Ishi is sort of the Dagwood of survivalists. Arnold Schwartzenegger would not star in the film version. Despite his shortcomings and failures, life actually does go on. In fact he is a lot like you and me. How well do we know ourselves? How well do our everyday decisions turn out? Once Ishi says to heck with it and lets things slide, things get better just like in real life.Stewart's genius was to place these things before us and then get out of the way. He has placed hints in the text, the italicized passages which give us objective truth, sandwiched between Ishi's misadventures. What he is saying is, in despite of ourselves, Earth Abides.If you enjoy the subject, try Walter Miller's \"Canticle for Leibowitz\", or Clifford Simak's \"City\" or David Brin's \"The Postman.\"Dave","I enjoyed this one. It is a very good read and certainly gives us some food for thought. We do need to remember when this one was written as to social attitudes, etc., but if we keep this in mind, it is good. I suppose you could read the book for it's social commentary, relate it to unspellable philosophical stances, blah, blah, blah, as one reviewer did, or you can read it for a very nice story to read on a rainy weekend. I enjoyed it, will probably read it again and highly recommend it.","I read this book about half way in sophmore year, and quit reading it. Now I'm 20 and I decided I'd give it another try. I have about 60 pages left, and I gotta say, this book is one of the slowest I have read, up there with the lord of the rings fellowship. I know it's a classic, but man, I can't even read this book for more than 30 min. at a time. Usually I blaze through books within a few days, but I'm probably on a month and a half with this book. I work a lot, so I dont usually have much time for reading except while I'm going to the bathroom and before bed, but wow. I mean the book is ok, it's not bad, it's just not a pageturner, which is what I usually go for. The main character Ish is very paranoid, thinks to far into detail over everything, and is in my opinion is a coward. I also feel like there is too much side tracking in this book. It's also very repetuous. I feel like there is too much thinking and too little action about anything. In some ways I relate to the main character, because I overthink a lot of things, I'm not the biggest strongest guy, nor the most handy, but that doesn't make it any more interesting of a read. It kind of defeats the purpose of me reading a book. I read to meet interesting characters, be engrossed in a story that is not mine, and to entertain my mind. I don't want to read about a character thinking. If i did want to read about that, I would read a philosophy book and do the thinking myself, or better yet, I'd read nothing and just think. When I think of books taking place in a post apocalyptic world, I think of a little bit more than this gives you. There could have been a lot more interesting scenarios in the depicted world than the one focused on in this book.I will say though that this book does use an interesting vocabulary, and I've learned a few new words. And the part's in Itallics are by far the best parts of the book. These parts do truly make an impression in your mind, and I would rate these as 5 star. Some of the itallicized parts are very deep and meaningful. I love this quote out of one of those parts \"Between the plan and fulfillment stands always the frail barrier of a human life\"Overall: Id say it's worth reading, but it's by far not the best book ever like some of the other reviewers are saying. I liked Cormick Mcarthy's \"The Road\" as a post apocalyptic story better, it seemed more real, and it moved at a quicker pace.","I read this book when I was in middle school, probably 1982, and it's impressive that it seemed futuristic even at that time when it had been written decades earlier. With the imminent release of \"I Am Legend\" I was reminded of this book again as a different take on post-apocalyptic literature.I said it was memorable but flawed because it gave an interesting early look at the idea of a pandemic, and the aftermath of such, but didn't seem to give a realistic take on the survivors' civilization. Why would people suddenly give up their institutes of religion, for example? Historically, when has this happened? He has black people in the south growing cotton \"just because\" and worshipping crocodiles (I don't know if this was a racist component or not.)In the end, his view was rather too cynical and unrealistic about the way people react to the loss of technology. Technology isn't what makes people great, it is their values. I think he didn't realize that.","I first read this book in high school -- 1964! And, loved it soo much I &quot;forgot&quot; to return it to the library &lt;blush&gt;. I've re-read it numerous times over the years and enjoyed it every time. I hope you enjoy it, too. It's a tremendous read.","If you like post-apocalyptic sci-fi, as I do, you'll probably enjoy this book. The book starts out strongly but peters out toward the middle after the narrator settles down and becomes embarrassingly introspective about how himself and what it takes to build a civilization. Parts of the book are clumsily written and pretentious. If you want better apocalyptic fiction, try John Wyndham or John Christopher.","I love end-of-the-world fiction. Call me a gourmand of it, if you will. Well, one story I had missed was, &quot;Earth Abides&quot;. So, I read a lot of reviews here at Amazon and I decided to buy it.I gave it three stars because I did not finish it. Usually, I can read anything. Even bad fiction becomes a challenge to conclude; disappointing fiction is a different story. It's just isn't my type. Though, I can appreciate what others see in it.Summary: A fellow goes off hiking and is bit by a rattlesnake. After his near-death experience and recovery (lasting about 2 weeks), he comes back to society to find no one home. The book follows his life as he: travels, struggles, meets other survivors, starts a fledgling society.The strengths of this book encompass one man's struggle to survive an unthinkable situation. It is wonderful at explaining some the effects of a global disaster in which only the people are gone. Our ordinance remains. But all eventually decays. The next generation of human society loses it cerebralness, but gains an innate link to the earth. Man exterminated by a virus with extreme prejuidice has now become just a creature not a ruler of the earth.In fact, just as I am typing this out; I am getting excited to read it. But, here come the negatives.The weaknesses are few, but very important. Characterization. Stereotypes abound, while the earth abides. Women are merely wombs needed for their matronly duties. Which would be true in this case. But there is no other extrapolation of feelings and thoughts for the women other than a prehistoric regression of their being and worth. All other characterizations are weak. The protagonist grows on in years but not in emotional or intellectual depth.There are other things that I did not like in the book. When things start to break down, our hero does nothing to stop it; even when he has others to help him. On grand scale, when the infrastructure fails, nothing is done. Not even attempted. One man may not be able to save a power plant or water system. But a group could. Well, possibly. After all, they have all the time in the world. Even if the those infrastructure repairs are ignored, what about personal systems? Our hero is a graduate student in Geology, and this book was only written 50 years ago. The Cold war is in it's infancy. Bomb shelters, survival gear are not unheard of. Oh well. That's what I don't like.Conclusion: I think if I was a teenager I might have read this book differently. But being in my early 30s and a scientist skews my notion of this type of fiction. Please read this book. You may be able overlook, or not even think what I pointed out were points against it. Personally, I'd suggest reading, &quot;The Stand&quot;, &quot;Warday&quot; or &quot;I am Legend&quot;.","I hate this book. I truly hate it, more than any other novel I've ever read outside of fundamentalist hate-drivel. That's saying a lot for me, given that I love reading and I particularly enjoy sci-fi books and those with apocalyptic themes (morbid, yes, but what can you do).The reason I loathe this book with the burning fire of ten thousand suns is the blobs of useless goo that pass for the main characters. They don't DO anything. Sure, they do the usual things like eating and sleeping and scratching their nether regions, but that's about it. As I read through this train-wreck I wanted to grab a bullhorn and scream into the book for them to do something, ANYTHING, to better their situation or try to learn something new or to show an emotion of any kind. The author has the main characters sitting around and eating out of tin cans and twiddling their thumbs for-get this-forty-two YEARS. Not a few months while they get the hand of harvesting fresh food, not a year or two while they learn new trades or research better ways to go about things, but forty-two freaking years.They don't even bother to teach their kids to read. There's one kid named Joey, whom the main character Ish keeps thinking, \"Garsh, he's the one!\" (repeated often), and ponders the possibility of teaching this precocious seven-year-old how to read, but Joey suddenly dies of illness. Presumably, so does civilization, because the passel of thirty-odd other kids running around at this point are deemed by Ish to be either too stupid or too disinterested for him to bother getting out of his Lay-Z-Boy and teaching them the ABC's. Obviously the author has never been around children. The ONE thing he does teach them, and he refers to this as his \"legacy,\" is to show them how to make a bow and arrows.The basic message of the book is \"Yup. We're screwed, folks, so give up early.\" Frankly, if I had been in the situation that these main characters were in, I'd do my damnedest to rebuild and make use of the remaining human world around me. I'd teach my kids how to read and how to use all the technology around them, and if I didn't know how to use something I'd find out how. I'd learn to farm and how to turn the electricity back on and basic medical care. I sure as hell wouldn't be sitting around for forty-two years staring at the wall.The only thing that kept the first half of the book from being used as toilet paper (don't ask about the other half) is that Stewart drops in the occasional interesting factoid about what would happen in nature if there suddenly were no longer any human beings. These facts are nicely offset from the story, set in their own paragraphs and in italics, so if you're interested in this sort of stuff you can skim through and read them fairly quick.","I was looking for a good \"end of the world\" type novel, and after the amazing reviews, chose this one. Disappointed hardly describes it. This is one that as a quick reader (usually finishing a novel in less than two days) it took me over a week of forcing myself to keep picking this back up. This was so anti-climatic it was boring.The most interesting thing about the story wasn't even told! One day, Ish wakes up to the aftermath of a world stripped of most humanity. Personally, I would have liked to read about the actual acts of the end of days, not the leftover start over.So Ish decides to drive all over the U.S. just observing, meeting some people along the way. Again, pretty dull. It is described well, and the writer is a good writer, but he doesn't seem to have anything to tell. He could have had more conflict, more interesting character, but it lacked this. In fact, until the end of the book, I didn't even know how old Ish was in the beginning. For a book that focuses on this main character, and pretty much the first quarter of the book is all about Ish, there is very little backstory and knowledge of him. Unacceptable.Instead the focus is on everything going on, well not going on, around Ish. The lack of people. The mess. The fires and fallen trees. Where has electricity and where doesn't. The looting.The most interesting thing he actually wrote about was the rise and fall of other species. I would have LOVED to read more about THAT! However, his telling of the ants, which was brilliant, was summed up in a few paragraphs while he took ages to tell the most boring parts.It also was unbelievable to me. Granted, this was written in the forties. But I hardly think for as long as time passed, even in simpler times, that people would live as they did without making more adjustments until they absolutley had to. I suppose some people might be that way, and I guess we'll never know until it happens.Honestly, I would have been more interested in reading about the other survivors than Ish, who was a procrastinator and thought very little of those closest to him.I would not recommend this book. Yes, it does stick with you. But not in a good way.","This book sucks. Cars don't run on 20 year old gas, canned goods go bad after time, You should probably learn how to grow your own food and get your own water before 20 years has passed... This book is not only dated, but just plain stupid in it's aspects of survivalism.","First, let me start off stating that I know this is suppose to be a classic; however, I found little to like in this book. It is a very, very long story where nothing happens...really. After a couple hundred pages I started to skip forward, looking for something to peak my interest. Nothing ever happens in this book...let me sum it up for you. 1) Plague, 2) a few people find one another, 3) they plant plants, 4) they plant more plants, 5) they watch the ants and rats die out, 6) they have kids and scribble on a rock for 20 years, the end.If you want to read a great post-apocalypse book, get One Second After or The Road. Either of these books blows this dull piece out of the water.","Great book. I really enjoy apocalyptic fiction. I have read a lot of it and this one has got to be towards the top of my list.This book takes on more of an human approach to the end of the world. There is not a great deal of action but the pace does not get sluggish. Unlike most end of the world fiction this one has a much broader scope and looks at the future of a \"Tribe\" of survivors instead of just the main character. Plus in most of these type of stories there is one main challenge and once that is defeated the story ends and that is all. Not at all the case with Earth Abides.The best part of the book for me was the 2nd half. There is a heart touching story of the main character and his son. Since I can't give away any spoilers it is hard to say what I like about the end other than the way the book hints at what life has become but only through glimpses of the main character.The reason I didn't give it five stars was the length. While it never drags it could have had some parts cut out and not effected the book at all. In fact, more than once I read something went to the next page and read such a similar page that I went back to make sure I had really turned the page. It only happened three times tops but still you start noticing that there could have been some trimming done.Great book, cheap book, fun read.","I wandered in here and was suprised to see that the book was still in print, and how many people had read and loved the book. This was recommended to me about ten years ago by the author's grandson, and I agree with many other readers. It is a timeless and thought-provoking end-of-world scenario. It is a strong argument for compulsory education as well. Very enjoyable.","A half-century ago, Stewart saw too clearly a future which could, indeed may yet, come to pass. He, and only a few others, survive a world-wide plague. How he attempts to preserve his society - how he prioritizes, what agonizing choices he and his 'flock' make, the compromises they have to accept - makes for among the finest end-of-the-world books ever written. Ish, the main character, is no less uncertain, no less fascinating, than Macbeth. Ish is clearly the everyman each of us could see in him/herself after a catastrophe impossible to imagine. A long book - it could be no less - by its end, one hopes for a sequel. It is not clear whether Stewart is optimistic about this future - and that too is appropriate. For every reader will probably come to a different conclusion as to where the 'tribe' is headed based on his/her own perceptions of what Ish did correctly or otherwise and what the reader might have done differently. No modern home library is complete without Earth Abides.","George Stewart provides a compelling &quot;thumbnail&quot; picture of mankind and how adversity can bring out the best and worst in people. This mini-saga is so well written and loaded with such a rich mix of characters and situations that the reader cannot help but wonder what tomorrow might bring. If you enjoyed Sarum you will love this","I was introduced to this book at a time when the world was beginning to fully envelope the &quot;benefits of technology.&quot; As part of the computer generation, for whom the desires of the world could be acquired at the click of a mouse, Earth Abides awoke in me a deep appreciation for the distance we have come and the importance of the most basic lessons in life. For more than 15 years I have been looking to recapture the insights I discovered in reading the book as an impresionable teenager. How ironic that is technology that now presents me with the opportunity to read it again","I have spent twenty years &quot;selling&quot; this book to friends and acquaintances as a must read. Some &quot;got it&quot;. Others didn't. Read it. If you &quot;get it&quot;, you will re-read it many times again! If you &quot;don't&quot;, hey, it takes all kinds","This magnificent book tells the story of one man's struggleto recreate and rebuild society in a world where societyhas abruptly ceased to exist. Set in the Bay Area and rifewith haunting moral and ethical questions. Every student -heck, every HUMAN - should read this one at least once. I'vebeen through it more than ten times since I read it incollege. TIMELESS.","As the lead character copes with the demise of civilization, we find an elegant creativity that challenges the mind and helps us see the world in new ways. This is one of the greatest books I've ever read and certainly one of the most haunting. I strongly recommend it to anyone. Another along the same lines is Malevil","This in one of the finest &quot;Last Plague&quot; genre I have ever read. Fascinating from beginning to end. It is the ACKNOWLEDGED inspiration for THE STAND by Stephen King !!","Facinating concept. It's far ahead of it's time. Written in 1949 it could easily be updated to any time. It must have caused quite the controversy when originally published. Each time I've read it, I've found something new. A perfect book for discussion groups","Lost Books -- Review Number 1 Earth Abides by George R. Stewart D. D. Shade 6/11/98Had Isherwood Williams lived to see our day, with it's social and political decay, he might not have worried so much about &quot;preserving&quot; our culture. As it happens in George R. Stewart's book, the devastating viral plague that cleanses the earth of nearly all human life occurred approximately 50 years ago. Long before the assination of John or Robert Kennedy or Martin Luther King, Jr. Long before the war with Vietnam. Before we put a man on the moon and then cut the space program. Before the pervasion of television and the computer revolution. Before the escalation of the cold war, AIDS, or most of the great serial killers. In other words, Earth Abides takes place in a time that many Americans with gray hair look back upon with nostalgia. The post World War Two years, when those of us between forty and fifty were born. The boomer years. A time of great prosperity. A decade that saw the birth of rock-n-roll, hamburgers, and Oreo cookies. Yet it was a time of great poverty for some. When restrooms, restaurants, and the seats in public transportation were separated by the color of ones skin. When equal pay for equal work was unheard of and a woman's place was in the home. A time when the word 'communist' was the dirtiest and deadliest thing one could call another. An altogether strange time, know as the fifties. It is into this world that Isherwood suddenly finds himself alone. Victim of a freak snakebite while out in the wilderness working on his graduate thesis and survivor of an even more freak accident, the development of a viral plague that wipes out humankind in a matter of weeks. It is altogether fitting that someone named Ish, this is how he signed his name to a hand scrawled will while delirious from the snake bite, should find himself alone in the world. Ish, David Pringle tells us , is a direct reference to the historic Ishi, a California Indian who became famous as the last living representativ! e of his tribe. Ish spends at least a quarter of the book searching for others. He finds a few, lucky people with great immune systems, and in the process stumbles upon the woman with whom he shares the remainder of his years. Together they try to build a community and at the same time rebuild civilization as they had know it. You will have to read the book to learn of Ish's heroic triumphs and failures as he tries to make sure the future has a heritage. Although following the traditional post-apocalyptic formula, that of the earth being cleansed by some means and leaving a few to rebuild civilization, Earth Abides offers some interesting commentary on some central moral questions of our/that time. One of those is racial unrest. Given the nature of European and African American relations in this nation in 1949, Stewart was taking a quite a risk when he developed one particular central character, Em. Ish chooses a strong willed, able, out-spoken, African American woman to be his mate. She was not the first female Ish found, nor was she the best looking, but she had within her the strength to become the mother of a new civilization. Ish recognized this and fell in love with her quickly. And Ish was right-Em alone had the strength and courage to bear the first child in the small community that had grown around them. There was no one who knew how to deliver a baby, and that was frightful enough, but the greatest fear was not knowing if children born into the world would inherit their parents immunity to the plague. Earth Abides is considered a classic by several sources but to my way of thinking, it deserves that exalted position in speculative fiction for having been a forerunner is demonstrating that black and white can live together. Stewart further shows us how important is the relationship between past and future. He does this symbolically through the vehicle of a 4-pound, single-jack hammer. At the beginning of the book, just before the snake bite, Ish is exploring a cave and finds this hammer. It is the! kind miners used in the old days when rock-drills were placed by hand. It is called a single-jack because it can be used with one hand. Ish notes the pleasure he feels when he finds the hammer because of its tie to the past. Even delierous from snake bit, he remembers to take the hammer with him. He keeps it with him throughout the book. As the community grows around Ish and Em, the hammer is used each year to chisel the numbers of the year on a big rock in the hills above where they live. It is always present on the mantel in Ish's living room. And at the end of the book, when Ish has grown old and the younger men, his and other's children, sense that he is ready to pick a new leader for the community, they wait in a circle at his feet for Ish to pick the next leader by giving them the hammer. The importance of tradition to the family and the community is symbolized in the single-jack. John Clute and Peter Nicholls feel that post-apocalyptic or disaster stories are so popular because they appeal to secret desires we all share: a depopulated world, escape from the constraints of a highly organized industrial society, and the opportunity to prove one's ability to survive. I choose the latter of the three. Post-apocalyptic speculative fiction provides a window from which to view the &quot;stuff&quot; of which humankind is made. The writer of a disaster or holocaust story can pit humans against the worst possible odds. The post-holocaust novel gives us the ability to perform an experiment that in reality would be unethical-to put a group of people in hell and record their progress getting out. Earth Abides is a moving, triumpal story of just such a group. No single character in Earth Abides has the stereotypic appeal of Bruce Willis or Nicolas Cage, and yet I came to love them all and worry about their conditions because they were real people. People with many of the same problems and weaknesses I have. People whose actions made me stop and wonder what I would do in the same situation.","If seen only as an example of early writing in this genre - mankind after the apocalypse - this should be taken as an acceptable novel as compared to later attempts in the same vein. The characters don't really develop and just seem to stumble along without learning how to cope beyond what they knew &#34;before&#34;, which makes for a somewhat plodding read.","There are plenty of other reviews that go more in-depth as to why this book is amazing at the top of the list, but i just wanted to contribute to its stats, and give you my .02$Its memorable to the core, i read it almost a year ago now, and have read a decent handful of post-apocalyptic fiction between now and then, and this one really stands out in my mind.From the very beginning it was gripping, and only got better. It didn't focus on the die-off, but on the aftermath, and how it affected the environment, wildlife, and the anthropological ramifications.Once he does meet up with fellow survivors, there's no great battles with cannibals, not even starvation, but just life. The book really gets down to the core of what it is to be human, and what is important, and how different types of people have different priorities, and how these different ways of thinking would affect the rebuilding of human society in a near extinction level event.It both gives you hope, then rips it away, and makes you question what is really important in life. It makes you wonder if the way of life we are living in our modern world is natural, or a freak coinsurance. perhaps it would happen again if somebody hit the &#34;reset&#34; switch.","A bit dated, but a good read nontheless. Some parts are very wrong (such as gasoline, tires, and batteries for a jeep keeping so long, or that all of the stores of weapons and ammunition back when it was written (M1 garands, M1 carbines, 1911s, and all of the civilian models) not being available after the military and most people are gone. But still very imaginative and well written.","This was a real change for me, which I was looking for in a book at the moment. Not an &#34;action&#34; book, but still holds you spellbound at times, and often I couldn't put it down. It had it's slow areas, but not enough to distract from the total experience. A thought provoking story from the 40's I believe - but you will find yourself thinking about things in every day life a little differently. Definitely a good read!","I found this book to be amazing. It is a very detailed -- at times almost too realistic -- depiction of life after an apocalypse. I found Stewart's handling of societal changes quite believable, and more sophisticated than many more modern works. He also does a great job drawing characters that we can believe.I read somewhere that the author was shocked that this is still on the top of many \"The Best of Science Fiction\" lists. Since he set out to write a literary adventure story, and not science fiction. So be it.Whatever you call it, though, it is riveting.","It led the way for so many great apocalyptic yarns, and was influential in literature and in creating an awareness if the fragility of society. Isherwood was a paradigm for most civilized men. He was content to observe life, and was only dragged into life by his wife. When society fell, he calmly observed the fall of civilization, along with it. He dreamt of rescuing civilization...but settled for surviving on it's leftovers.I wonder how many preppers read this in their formative years.","I have read this book several times and it is a timeless classic. It leaves you feeling what the main character would feel under the scenario that this book was created.The World Without Us","The latest post-apocalyptic fiction seems to focus on dealing with deadly infected persons. What if they just all died and a small group had to start over. This book focuses on a main character who is more human than the supermen of modern apocalypse, he's not an ex-special forces operative with pre-med and a welders certificate who grew up on a farm. He's a little lazy, has some relationship issues, a mediocre teacher and in the end is just a normal guy dealing with population events.","A very original and unique plot, particularly given that it was written in 1949, makes this book a great read and not to be missed for fans of the post-apocalyptic sci-fi genre. Most every book since written in this genre borrows elements from this book. The pace of the story moves well and there are many sub-plots which are interesting (in particular, the main character makes frequent introspective observations that are thought-provoking about humankind). Of particular note is how relevant the book is today, over 60 years after it was written.My main negative critique is the general prose and writing style. It is impossible to believe that the author was an English professor... very basic sentence structures, little in the way of character development, and a ridiculous over-usage of exclamatory statements from the novel's characters (literally hundreds of exclamation marks throughout the book). The Kindle version had a number of typos as well.Still a worthy four-star book given its deep and compelling observations on humankind and a very clever and original plot.","I had great expectations when I started this book and got out of it slightly unsatisfied. The book shows pretty well what civilisation is about and how much it is fragile. Also how much civilisation relies on a few individuals only. All the lost knowledge in the library no one can understand remains as a vivid image in my mind.In spite of some theories underlaying the story being already out of date, that book poses essential issues and the empathy we develop for Ish in his efforts and trials to answer them and maintain some civilisation makes the story moving.","This was one of the early end of the world novels where the survivors try to restart society. Though there is a lot of scientific inaccuracies, what makes this book great are the characters. If you liked Stephen King's The Stand which also had great characters, then you should like this one.The main character is Ish. Ish seems to be someone that we all strive to be. Caring and smart. Ish also, has the son that we all wish our children would be like. Ish's son is the smartest of all the children and he simply idolizes Ish.Ish uses a hammer (a basic, I guess Stanely model) as his symbol of power (or his sceptre) over the survivors. Undoubtedly, the hammer is to pass to Ish's son when Ish dies.The big project for the survivors is to get an old automobilie repaired enough to explore other lands and try to find other bands of survivors and get civilization back on its feet. I don't want to give the rest of the plot away only to say that this project turns out to be a big mistake.","A brilliatnly written socio-sic-fi. Though the book is a bit austere for the scope fo the catastrophe, it is truly a wonderful tome! Like the later work of Stpehn King's The Stand, Earth Abides explores the questions and illustrates the harrowing reality that might be if a \"super\" disease were to kill most of man-kind.Thought provking and beautifully crafted.","Earth Abides, a novel by George R. Stewart, is an excellent novel that depicts a possible scenario for a post-apocalyptic world. It provides people with a fantasy realm with questions of what could happen and what will happen all through the eyes of the novel's main character, Ish. He joins up with a couple of survivors in what he sees fit for the new world and they create a society that tries to cope with it. George Stewart further enriches the story with character chemistry and strong elements of theme.Themes of survival and love are strongly present throughout the novel. Ish's strong will to contain the community he had once known pushes him to survive so he can teach the next generation of what good can become of it. His relation to Em also draws out the love and caring in Ish.George Stewart uses chemical equations between characters to draw an exact importance of each person in their society. He chooses a man named George who is a carpenter to build and repair homes. He has a friend named Ezra, who acts as an advisor to Ish. They all piece together to form Ish's envision of a good society.The topic that concerns Ish the most is the community he had once known. Ish, who is trying to inflict positive change in society, is cursed with the inability to change himself.Throughout the book, he learns to trust his society and the future, which is dependent on him to lead them. He learns of the differences between the two generations and tries to blend in. He goes through many experiments, which has led in to some disaster and many good.Earth Abides is a great novel about the fantasy and high possibility of a post apocalyptic world. The characters and themes in the novel are beautifully inscribed drawing an essence of drama and suspense into an already stone set feeling of both feelings. Reprising themes of love, survival and many other themes are present to enrich the story. Earth Abides, a novel by George R. Stewart, is a novel I'd recommend to anyone who is interested in character chemistry and the post-apocalyptic ideology of George R. Stewart.","Societies Rise and Decline but the Earth Abides In the classic apocalyptic novel Earth Abides George R. Stewart creates a nightmare on earth that could occur tomorrow when a massive unknown epidemic obliterates almost all of society. A young man named Ish is forced to search for companions on this barren, naked earth void of human life. He searches for sensible people to aid him in his quest for survival and mental sanity. Em is the person who keeps Ish sane and through her love and courage helps him to face the future. Together they find a group of companions, and together they establish a tribe in the Berkeley Hills in the Bay Area. George Stewart1s powerful and realistic writing captivates the reader and makes one imagine how each of us would react in Ish1s situation. Even though his novel gets rather slow in the middle with few dramatic events adding to the plot, Stewart demonstrates the harsh situations and triumphs of life this small nucleus of mankind must face without modern society. Stewart1s writing fascinates the reader by exploring the actions of the offspring of the original seven tribe members and shows how people develops without modern society and all its conveniences. Stewart shows how all-human societies have come about, by tracing the development of this small tribe that survives a cataclysmic disaster. In the novel Stewart puts Ish and the tribe through many difficult trials as they struggle to survive. He is able to create an almost unimaginable situation and turn it into a reality. Each character is developed so well that the reader is able to experience the events. Ish1s leadership is strengthened by Em1s courage and Ezra1s loyal friendship. Because the reader can relate to these believable characters in this unbelievable situation, it is easier for the author to relate his point. Stewart fascinates the reader by showing how man develops with all his customs and superstitions and without a modern society. While reading about the tribe1s triumphs and failures we are able to step back from the modern world and see how civilization perhaps developed. The author examines the growth and characteristics of individual characters. What each of them bring to enable this tribe to survive, show how a society begins and flourishes. Em brings her courage, Ish brings his knowledge and his leadership, George is the carpenter and so on. Each member of the tribe contributed to the betterment of the whole society. Then at that point we are able to see the growth of society again, as if it was cut out from man1s actual past history, when ancient tribes started to develop. . At first the challenges are just simple, to fulfil the basic necessities of survival like shelter, water and food. Once these needs have been fulfilled, the tribe progresses to larger concerns such as education of the younger generations, keeping records and calendars, rules and exploration. Eventually the tribe integrates with outside members sometimes successfully, sometimes not. For instance when Charley comes back with the Robert and Richard he brings disease and chaos to the tribe. The tribe had the difficult decision of banishing him or killing him to protect their way of life. Many of them, including Joey who was the hope for the future as a leader because of his intelligence, die because of this outside influence. Later however the tribe successfully mingles with another tribe, which helps their society grow because there are more possibilities for men and women to find mates in a larger society.All through the novel Stewart accurately demonstrates the development of a simplistic society with all its triumphs and failures, to symbolize the history of human development. He is able to show that future societies would develop as past societies have as long as basic human needs are met. When people have food, shelter and more importantly significant human relationships then a society can begin. The society that Stewart creates starts with two people who found each other in the midst of chaos. They unite with others with whom they are compatible and from this small group a multi generation society formed. In his lifetime Ish saw a society develop. He saw his children and grand children and great grand children living happily. Through Ish1s eyes, the author masterfully shows all of us how societies rise and decline but how through it all the earth itself abides. Stewart in this famous apocalyptic novel captures the reader and artfully demonstrates the nature of human societies.","This book is one of the most moving and realistic surival novels that I have ever read, the suceive plauges of Domsicated animals and pests for one, and the point that the most brilliant minds of of western, and Gobal Civilization would break under the strain of the end of civilization seems all to true. Though the very end of the book was depressing(as San Fransico burns, and the Part about the new Human tribes) but even though civilization is pushed under, it is suggested that it will rise again in the far future though as we watch civilization unravil as Isherwood tries to pick up the peices is heart breaking, his attempt at a school is sad and the way that he finally breaks under the strain of being remembered as a god. This is a great classic of Sf Read this book!!","It really made me think about the sensativity of the planet and society of every day life.","Earth Abides is a great book for the reader new to the science fiction genre. Isherwood and Em are strong characters. The building of a new society is intriguing. I read this book over 25 years ago and I still remember it fondly as my introduction into science fiction books.","I have read and re-read this book over the years. It is riveting, entertaining and more than likely prophetic. The bomb that may destroy us all is the one we can not defend against, the incurable, quick-acting and all powerful virus. A nuclear Dooms-Day could not be more horrifying.","The well conceived story captures the imagination from the start. That's why we buy books like this...right? The intellectual and forward looking main character reminded me of the captain in &quot;The Last Ship&quot;. Read it!","George R. Stewart weaves at once a beautiful and hauntingly believable tale with this novel, one that I've never been able to forget...or wanted to. Once considered dated, with the lessening of global nuclear tensions, the scenario Mr. Stewart envisions for a possible worldwide catastrophe, one brought about not by bombs but disease, has once again come to the forefront and become the most plausible ingredient in mankind's demise. More even than the fact that this is a truly enjoyable read is the deeper message Earth Abides shares with the reader as it reaches down and touches our very hearts, defining what it means to be human in an inhuman environment. The symbolism involved in Isherwood Williams' desire to keep a hammer with him for the future as a tie to the past is obviously an unconscious comment on his personal hope of rebuilding a fallen civilization. A hope that goes unfulfilled in his life time and maybe many lifetimes to follow. The insight into the human psyche that Mr. Stewart demonstates as he carries Isherwood from his youth at the beginning of the book to old age and finally death at the end and Isherwood's subtle change of attitude during that process, rings exceedingly true and speaks volumes about Mr. Stewart's keen and perhaps unique ability to put into words what it really means, or at least should mean, to be human. I've rarely read a book more than once because I just don't have the time, but I've read Earth Abides several times since I was a teen and I know I'll read it several more times before I too reach that stage in my life that Isherwood assures us won't be the calamity our youth oriented culture would have us to believe.","Even if Stephen King did base THE STAND on this book, he takes the idea of a world-wide plague and develops it much better than Stewart. I understand that EARTH ABIDES was written in the forties, but the stilted style of writing used and the attitudes and world view of Stewart's main characters are so jarringly anchronistic that I could never forget I was reading a book --- it never transported me into the world that the writer was trying to create. The italized asides within the chapter explaining what was happening elsewhere (i.e., lice, cats, ants, etc.) were interesting but not enough to save the book as a whole. LUCIFER'S HAMMER, WAR DAY, or THE STAND are all much better &quot;end of the world&quot; type books","It's been awhile since I read this book, but what I remember about this book is that it insults you and basically says that if you haven't gone to college and grad school that you cannot be intelligent or sire intelligent children. The author writes this book about the one truly intellegent person left alive. He portrays the rest of the survivors, who are average non-college educated, blue collar types, as little more than simpletons. The main character and the author doesn't even try to have the survivors learn to use the left over technology to help better their situation because they are too dumb. When they reproduce only Ish sires an intellegent child. The rest of the chilren are all dumb like their parents. Bah, that's it. My hatred for this book is off my chest. I don't reccommend it.","Having loved this story 20 years ago as a teenager, it pains me now to find that it is surely the most badly written book on my bookshelves. All the characters are two-dimensional. The dialogue is uniformly stiff and amateurish. Worse, there's a faintly fascist tone running throughout the entire story that I failed to notice as a callow youth, but that now reveals itself on almost every page. Perhaps the saddest aspect of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that the story is clearly and shockingly the fantasy of an author who was very probably an insecure misfit who dreamed of existing in a world without people, or at least with just a handful of simple folks over whom he could rule as their intellectual master. If Stewart had spent some time in analysis, &quot;Earth Abides&quot; might never have been written. It is a truly awful book.","Plot Kernel - A deadly virus has nearly annihilated the human race, leaving all other life untouched. Civilization has ended. A survivor searches for others and eventually joins with a woman who lost her family in the epidemic. In time, he becomes the leader of a few families who have intermarried and who together live off the abundant supply source of the otherwise uninhabited city.","I love post-apocalypse fiction, but I can't figure out why everyone likes this one. The first 1/3rd of the book is great, as the main character experiences what becomes of his world after everyone else dies. Then it's as if the last half of the book was written by a female. It's mostly introspective, about how the character feels, and nothing really happens. If you want a page turner from front to back, read 'Alas Babylon','One Second After', or 'Without Warning'. I would donate this book to my local library, but I would feel guilty knowing some poor guy might pick this up and waste as much time on it as I did.","Great story of what would happen if a lazy / self proclaimed intellect survived the human apocalypse. Ish may have let thousands of years of basic knowledge disappear without getting off his highchair for a second. But, in the end at least \"Jingle Bells \" survived his incompetence and carried on.","I was very excited when I received this book, because I had read great reviews about it. However, it did not hold up to my expectations. The first two thirds of the story consist of the main character driving back and forth across the country looking for survivors (that is as far as I made it- leisure reading should not have to be a chore). When he does encounter survivors, he only stays for a brief time to visit with them and moves on. That is it. There are no conflicts. There is no tension or threat from others or nature. No plot. He simply drives back and forth looking for people, discovers them, and then moves on. I have never read anything more boring, not even required readings for courses I have taken. Perhaps this book was the first of its kind when it came out, and that may be why it has such acclaim, but the storyline is nonexistent. On the up side it does have some very well written descriptions of the land and animals (that is the only good thing I can say about this book).","Wordy, verbose, unrealistic. Meeting around a table with the woman who eventually gives him children, written like a bad female romance novel.Emotionally mature hunter-gatherers evolve from his haphazardly raised progeny. Unrealistic ending, which was a slog to get to.","If you are easily depressed or get melancholy, do not read this book. If the thought of the human race dying out and mother earth thriving gives you the warm fuzzies, then this book is for you. After the major opening disease-kill tragedy there's *some* hope for man... then less hope for man... then a little more hope for man... then a *lot* less hope, and on, and on. It's an emotional roller coaster that, on average, only looses altitude. In the end, earth wins, man looses. I had 100 pages remaining to read and finally had to flip to the last page so. I. could. just. &quot;end it&quot;. Yuk. Two weeks later I still have a bitter taste in my mind. If you like sci-fi's such as &quot;ender's game&quot; I predict you'll hate this book too. My hope here is that I've saved somebody else the pain.","I started becoming interested in the post-apocalyptic genre after watching a few episodes of the TV show \"Jericho\" (which is quite interesting in Season 1). While searching this category on Amazon, \"Earth Abides\" popped up a few times along with several other titles. I picked up a copy and read it last weekend. The plot and the characters are mildly interesting and I guess I should cut it some slack having been printed back in 1949. However, I have to say as you get more than halfway through the book, the story line just seems to drag on and on and is generally pretty boring. As I neared the end I found myself skimming from page to page and just praying it would finally end. The copy I bought was used and I threw it away when I was done to prevent someone else from wasting their time with it.By comparison, I also bought a used copy of \"Alas Babylon\" (also printed in the 1950s time frame) and I can safely say it is a far more interesting read after only being about 100 pages into it.","I first read this book back in 1967. At that time I was a kid and the whole story seemed to be nothing but \"science fiction.\" I read about the way Ish went through his life, with a disbelief that it could ever happen here and now.However, today I look at the possibility that civilization could be shattered by the loss of what we have come to consider the essential necessities of life - electricity, water, gas, gasoline, telephone, computers, drug stores and grocery stores. Now when I read Earth Abides, I realize that this story could actually happen to us. The problems that Ish had to deal with are now possible. As I read this story, I found myself wondering how I would handle dwindling supplies, the threats of animals and disease, the decreasing availability of items that spoil or evaporate, the social interaction with people, both good and bad. I wondered how I would deal with the lack of food, water, and medicine? Would I be able to survive in a deserted city with no electricity? With terrorists threatening to destroy our way of life, this book could be a survival guide for the modern man.I especially found the greatest distress in this book was the way knowledge was lost. First Ish wanted to read and then it became less important and then the books fell apart. Ish became an antique with knowledge of things that meant nothing to the younger generation that was growing up around him. This book should be used to teach us all a lesson - that we must keep the flame of knowledge burning all the time or we could lose it so very fast.","This 1949 novel is one of the earliest explorations of the theme of a doomsday plague. Our hero, named Ish, is a young college student who returns from the mountains to find out that an airborne virus has wiped out over 99.99 percent of the population in remarkably tidy fashion, leaving behind only a handful of survivors.It is hard to rate a book like this. On the one hand, it is well written, and, despite a few implausible suppositions, manages to explores a number of interesting ideas and insights.But there is a big problem: Our hero, Ish, is completely wicked -- an amoral, self-worshiping, arrogant, elitist monster; and the author seems to be on his side. I understand that books of this type tend to be misanthropic fantasies, and even understand the appeal. But I cannot stomach Ish.Ish is not particularly upset by the tragedy, since he never had much use for his fellow man. Still, his first reaction is to contemplate suicide. He can think of no reason to live. How this differs from his outlook before the tragedy is unclear, but he apparently bemoans the loss of superior human specimens who are mirror images of himself -- detached, scientific, rational, and essentially amoral. He ultimately rejects suicide, only because he decides it might be scientifically interesting to observe the continuing downfall of humanity. That he might try HELPING his fellow survivors never occurs to him.It immediately occurs to him that there must be other survivors, but just as quickly concludes that the shock of the tragedy will soon destroy most of them as well, because of their difficulty adapting. He calls this theory \"secondary kill\". On his first day of searching, he finds no less than 5 survivors, but immediately writes them off as not worth saving, according to his quasi-darwinian \"secondary kill\" theory. He then drives entirely from the west coast to the east coast and back, without ever finding a single human being who he thinks deserves life. No matter how many survivors he finds, he persists in regarding himself as the last surviving human. Only Ish counts. (Again, how this differs from his outlook before the tragedy is unclear).He then returns to his California home and sits around eating out of cans and reading books. While reading the New Testament, he ponders the fact that Judeo-Christian morals are obsolete, since he has no neighbors to love. My jaw dropped. What about all those traumatized survivors he abandoned to die according to his detached and rational \"secondary kill\" theory?But then he starts reading the Song of Solomon, and realizes he wants a woman. Almost immediately, a beautiful woman, a fellow elitist, drops out of the blue and into his bed. Soon a handful of survivors, who Ish persists on regarding as inferior beings, gather around them and form a sort of a tribe. This is one of the more implausible aspects of the novel. Ish a leader? He may have all of Hitler's faults, but he has none of his virtues.Happily for Ish, all of the other characters (except for one man whom Ish murders) have personalities even less forceful than his own. He arranges to marry off all the tribe's children, including his own daughters, at the far-too-young and not-entirely-willing age of 13, without a peep of protest from his own wife or anyone else. (Incidentally, this is a terrible scheme if you want to preserve a high level of culture, which Ish claims is his goal). Nor does anyone protest his scheme to murder a newcomer for the crime of having a venereal disease. The only person he has any regard for is one of his many sons, who he thinks of as a mirror image of himself. But then tragedy strikes, dashing Ish's hopes for the preservation of Ish-manity.Very early on, Ish remarks, almost out of the blue, that he does not want to become a god. This is such a strange thought that I think he doth protest too much. In any event, it is virtually all he achieves. For instance, his efforts as schoolmaster, though failing to teach, succeed in instilling superstitious reverence for himself in his pupils.","Unlike all contagious diseases before this one that traveled over time, this contagion sprung up globally at about the same time. For practical purposes the human race is extinct. Isherwood \"Ish\" Williams survives the pandemic, but wonders if he is the last man on earth.In what was once called California, Ish eventually meets up with a small rag tag band of shocked survivors. As his cohorts just try to live, they turn to Ish, more an introspective loner, as the leader. Reluctantly he takes charge not knowing what the future will bring or even if there is even going to be a future.This is a reprint of a highly regarded post apocalypse tale first released in 1949. The story is actually told over a period of years broken into five major parts of which the above only briefly touches on the first two sections. Ish is a terrific protagonist whose belief in survival changes over time as he observes his little colony mature. Thriller fans will enjoy this strong after the doomsday tale that in some ways shows its pre-information age initial publication, but remains a strong cautionary story.Harriet Klausner","This review will be short and simple as there are tons of detailed reviews already available.Earth Abides is great. It turns over and over in your head for days, weeks, months, & years.. just as a great book should. Not only does it provide a glimpse into the possible future, it also shows what it was like back in mid-1900s America. Definitely a thinker's book. I'd recommend it to anyone, ESPECIALLY if you like post-apocalyptic/last man on earth type tales.","Many of the previous reviewers state that they originally read this book a long time ago, and how it stuck with them over the years. For me, the pleasure of reading Earth Abides is a very recent event, but I do know that like those other reviewers, this will be a book that will stay with me for a long time.Originally published in 1949, Earth Abides still reads fresh. It describes the life journey of the graduate student \"Ish,\" a more intelligent that average, bookish, slightly passive young man who is one of the few human survivors of a catastrophic virus outbreak. Early on, he travels from one side of the former United States of America to the other, and back again. Living in the home of his parents, he slowly meets other survivors: some are compatible and eventually group together to become members of The Tribe, others who are not, and do not. Earth Abides is a tale of the survival of a man, of a group, and of a planet without the continuing influence and domination of human civilization.This is fundamentally a book of journeys: a travel across post-apocalyptic America, within the remnants of the surviving San Francisco Bay area, of some of the Tribe's offspring attempting another cross-country journey, but most powerfully, it is the journey of Ish, as a survivor and young man, as a reluctant leader, as a torch-bearer of the hope of the re-establishment of the former Civilization, as a semi-god and The Last American, and finally as an old man who accepts that man will survive in new ways, not in the old ways, and that no matter what, that the Earth itself will abide.","A few days ago I listened to a lecture by renown geneticist Francisco Ayala. He discussed a simple experiment demonstrating Darwin's concept of natural selection. If you take a test tube holding 10 cc of the bacterium E. coli, it will hold approximately 20 billion organisms. Adding a drop of a modern antibiotic like gentamicin into the tube will result in the survival of some 200 cells (out of the original 20,000,000,000). However, since those cells are now gentamicin resistant, in only a few days the tube will again hold 20 billion (now gentamicin resistant) E. coli cells. The only E. coli cells that made additional copies of themselves were the ones with the mutation for gentamicin resistance. Evolution has occurred.What happens when the human race is hit with a viral \"antibiotic\"? What happens when a population of 6 billion humans is suddenly, within a week, turned into a population of 600, scattered across the planet?One thing is for sure... the population won't rebound in a few days.College student Ish Williams is one of the survivors. Although he thinks it is because he suffered a rattlesnake bite during the plague, unless all the other survivors also had a similar snakebite (even in places rattlesnakes don't exist), he probably already possessed whatever mutation that made him plague resistant.From his home in the San Francisco Bay region, he drives across country, looking for survivors while seeing first hand the beginnings of civilization's decay. As for survivors, they are rare indeed. But some people, like Ish, did survive.Back in the San Francisco Bay area, Ish and a few companions begin to rebuild civilization. But when the survivors don't include an engineer, a physician, a teacher, a scientist, or even a farmer, our \"survival knowledge\" is limited indeed.Author George Stewart wrote this book in 1949, so a number of the technological issues are quite dated. Nevertheless, survival isn't easy. Ish and others have to deal with exploding populations of wild cattle, and rats, and dogs. They have to find something besides canned food. They have to ensure water is still available. And they have to teach the children, so they don't forget.\"Yes, [Ish] reluctantly concluded, this matter of the children's beliefs was extremely serious. In the Old Times [pre-plague] the beliefs held by the children of any family or small group of families might be momentous enough, but still those children on growing up would come into contact with other beliefs and make adjustments. Besides, there had been a great, even overwhelming, mass of tradition - the tradition of Christianity, or of Western civilization, or of Indo-European folkways, or of Anglo-American culture. Call it what you wished, it was still so tremendous that you might say it was omnipotent, for good or bad absorbing the individual.But now their little community had lost much of the tradition. Part of it had been lost because no seven survivors... could preserve and transmit all of it. Part had been lost because for so long a time there had been no big children to pass on the tradition to the small ones. The oldest of the younger generation had been taught games by their parents, not by older comrades. The community should therefore be plastic to an unprecedented degree. This was an opportunity, but also a responsibility - and a danger....Now, more certainly even than before, he knew that he had the opportunity to be the founder of a religion for a whole people. What he told the children in school, they would probably believe. He could insure their memory of it by mere insistence and iteration. He could tell them that the Lord God created the earth in six days, and found it good. They would believe. He could tell them a local Indian legend that the world was the work of Old Man Coyote. They would believe\" (p. 222-223).Sobering, and interesting. Stewart ends by writing, \"Men go and come, but earth abides\" (p. 345).","I first read this novel over 20 years ago in a college history course. It's a story that has stayed with me, and I recently wanted to discover if the book was a good as I remembered it to be. Well, in one sense, it was: Stewart's style is still powerful, the plot timely, and the characters all too human in how they react to the end of the world as they've known it. What I also discovered was how dated this novel is, for some of the same reasons it's still a good story: 'Ish', the main character, is right out of the Cold War era, as he's chauvinistic, detatched, and more than a little pompous at times. The plot is all too familiar to our post-modern world (and King's 'The Stand' has some similarities): some kind of plague wipes out most of the world's population; Ish, bitten by a rattlesnake right before this happens, survives. The first part of the book really puts the reader into a world where Ish fears he is the last survivor. Even when he encounters others, he feels no connection to them. On his cross country trip, he sees no reason to stay with even the kind people he meets; instead, he returns to his parents' house, where he begins to plan for some kind of rebuilding of the former society. Eventually, he meets 'Em', a mixed race older woman, and they collect a small group of survivors who try to continue life as they knew it, children are born, and 'The Tribe' grows. Inserted in the narrative is Stewart's description of the title: as mankind and his works diminish, animals, native plants, nature itself transform and overtake 'civilization'...\"Men come and go, but earth abides\" (345). At times, Stewart and Ish overdo it with the dramtic language. Ish is not always the most sympathetic character, pompous and seeing himself superior to most of The Tribe. The Tribe doesn't seem to really have the energy to truly rebuild -- or even build anew -- another existence; the incident when the water system breaks down is the best example: even Ish realizes that the survivors and their children don't have either the desire or the knowledge to fix the problem and continue to enjoy indoor plumbing. Even the digging of latrines is never really finished, as no one seems to care when the work gets too hard. One does feel for Ish when he finally realizes that no one cares about the old education; The Tribe essentially regresses to hunting and small farming, but also seems happier than the 'modern' man ever was. Stewart had a good idea of modern man's virtues and foibles, and also provides a thought-provoking study which makes the reader ask \"what would I do in this same situation?\" You can also see, historically, where this novel fits into the US Cold War fears of complete annihilation of our 'great' way of life, and the land of plenty that the US was in this era: how do the survivors eat? They plunder the cans in the supermarkets for decades. The Tribe simply forages off of what's left behind, and at no time does it seem that the leftovers will ever end. It's an interesting comment on the world Stewart knew, and a compliment to the abundance in the US in the late 1940s, when the novel was first written.","George R. Stewart's main character isn't as helpless as a quick glance at the first page reviews may imply. He is a character that is able to do significant hands-on tasks such as auto mechanics, hunting, lead a small surviving group of humanity, and teach and school children. He is just not an expert in these fields, which isn't too surprising for a random person, but in many cases his knowledge and aptitude turned out quite useful. It's just that when one is dealing with what could be the last of humanity, a lot is needed for the human race to go on. Written in 1949, Stewart's Earth Abides makes one reminiscent of that time and of what was available then. Stewart takes some time to describe what happens to the other mammals, although I'm not sure if the prey vs. predator equilibrium was a new idea at that time since he does elaborate on it quite a bit. His visions of primitive and/or overly religious societies in humanity's backslide in certain areas will be quite well known to those that follow more modern writings and films of `the end of the world' genre.The setting takes place in three time eras, one right after the disease that wipes out most of humanity, one 22 years later, and the last at over 42 years later-probably 50+ years. The first takes place more or less in the time the book was published, 1949. The other one has to realize would then be taking place in what would then be 1971. Now Stewart makes the 22 years go by fairly quickly, but thinking about what happened in the real world between 1949 and 1971, the James Dean era, the hippy movement, Vietnam War, the start of the oil crunch, makes one realize a lot can happen in 22 years as opposed to what Stewart writes. What Stewart seems more to be writing about, isn't the end of the world, but the laziness of man, which eventually becomes a downfall for some and something that needs to be overcome. Now I don't know if he was writing about something he saw in his workplace or in the armed forces if he was in WWII, but he does take it to an extreme. Sure some people may just be tired of an 8 hour workday, when there's so many aspects of life out there, but it's hard to believe one would maintain an utterly lazy lifestyle for 22 years, when there wasn't any need to worry about food for the short term, or how one's retirement plans were going, and instead, without these shackles on one's mind in terms of worrying about the future, not feel free or have interest about how to rebuild society. There are some groups of people in the real world that if you get two of them together, they'll come up with three visions for the future as opposed to almost no visions by the characters of the novel.The book is also a bit too ideal. Maybe it really was like this in 1949, but the world as I've seen it would have the character's in marital disputes, the usual utterances of \"you suck,\" some saying to get rid of old man Ish, let's move our group, this in no good, that is no good, and so on. However, what makes this novel different from, say the usual post-nuclear-war book, isn't just healthy young men surviving, but a random group of people surviving that somehow have immunity to the disease (although one could say those that have built an immunity by being bitten by a snake represents a certain group of people and that would skew the randomness that Stewart tried to set up in the survivors), so his vision of the type of characters that survive may have some credibility.Overall it was a fun book to read. Stewart has a flowing, easygoing style that makes you want to keep reading to see how things turn out. It does get a little slow around the 200 page mark, so, as in other books, you just have to plow through it to get to the end. I'd recommend this book. It's one of the better post-apocalyptic novels that came out in the 40's and 50's, and is a compelling read.","I read this book in the 60s, just over a decade after it came out. When I read some of the reviews here, I decided to skim through it again. What had surprised me were the negative reviews. I remembered the story as a very interesting one, with characters I could appreciate, if not like.What I found different was the fiction that has come along in the past 40 years. In \"the old days\" fiction often was more thoughtful with less action and more introspection. Characters did not always solve the problems with which they were confronted (although I must admit that this was not the case as often in science fiction). Stewart in Earth Abides gives us a world in which nearly the entire population of the earth has died from a pandemic. Ish, the main character, spends much time alone in the beginning. As the few survivors begin to gather together, they look to him for leadership, something he's not certain he is qualified to do. The exception is that he is well read, and his greatest passion is to preserve the library in the area in which he lives.(spoiler lieth here) Some of the reviewers here seem surprised at the deterioration of civilization amongst the group. Were they as surprised if they read Lord of the Flies? True, those characters were all children, but many of Stewart's characters are uneducated or unsophisticated, who never understand Ish's preoccupation with the knowledge housed in that library. They are too busy learning to survive with none of the trappings of modern life, and without the tools to re-create that life. The story is depressing as one reads the slide into savagery. But what is represented is one possible outcome should such a holocaust occur in the world.For different outcomes, try reading Day of the Triffids (there be monsters), or Malevil. Or see the old b&w; film Things to Come. This was once a very popular sub-genre of science fiction and many possible outcomes have been depicted.","Wow, just wow. I can see that a lot of better reviewers have already had their say, but I've never been this moved and impressed.I was concerned about getting a book that was so old, but there really weren't many references that took me out of Ish's shoes: The lack of TVs, the attitude of and towards the African Americans (to avoid using his words), and to entertainers of whom I only recognized Bob Hope. Other than that it could have easily happened today.I'm pleased by how the book was ordered, with most of the chapters covering only a year in detail with a chapter about the intervening years between sections. It probably would've been easy to pad out those years rather than summarizing them, but it would've been too much.Most of all I like the short sections in the middle of chapters, largely in the first section, that help to break it up and provide a omniscient viewpoint and a break from Ish's lesser understanding and awareness. The portions relating to how the different plants and animals were affected interested me greatly.I'm very happy with the ending as well. Overall the book has several good thinking points. Definitely one I would suggest to others.","I read this book when I was in my early teens during a time when I read many sci-fi books. This one stuck with me. I won't repeat what others have said, but this book struck me as a beautifully told story about a horrible, if remote, possibility. I'm happy to stumble over it here and see that it's still in print and people are still reading it. I guess it's become somewhat of a classic, and it deserves to be.","This story is as contemporary as it was when it was first published in 1949. Except for a few references to the availability of hand cranked phonographs, there is no indication that this disaster and it's aftermath didn't take place in the present. The story is told entirely in the third person. This would generally seem to be tedious, however is simply does not loose its hold on you. The writing is careful, the author is economical in the use of words that describe concepts. The premise of the story is simple: a deadly virus sweeps the earth and within a few weeks all of mankind is gone. There remains only isolated individuals who eventually find each other and begin life again in the altered world.I first read this book in my early thirties. It impacted my life to the point that I always referred to the reading of this book as one of the turning points in my life. I have now reread it with the perspective of 20 additional years and it has the same impact. I was so struck with the understanding Stewart conveys of the emptiness of contemporary life. This emptiness is not to be construed as useless. The grand civilization we have constructed is great, is a monumental, exciting and dynamic achievement. But if you put all these achievements against the needs of a group of people that will eventually have no access to prepared foods, electricity on demand, water and heat or cooling, instant access to far away members of their family, by telephone, car, plane, fax, etc., you soon see what the hero saw: What the emerging generations needed was a basic knowledge of hunting and gathering. Laws become obsolete, customs change to suit the need of the group, language changes and a thought that resonates within me, is the idea of the God of the Bible. Because the Bible refers specifically to groups of people and their interaction, what is there to refer to, when the groups and the interaction are gone? For me, the consummate fundamental Christian, this is very thought provoking and brings me into another dimension: to examine my faith and trust and what it is I have faith and trust in and for. This book should be required reading for Sociology, Anthropology and Psychology students. Absolutely wonderful!!","This was one of the first books I read as a kid. I was enthralled back then with the idea of a plague wiping out the vast majority of people so my father suggested \"Earth Abides\" as a suitable read. I enjoyed rereading the book as an adult recalling the same fascination with the storyline as I did over 25 years ago. The author tells the survival story of Isherwood Williams, a man who evades a plague due to a counteraction to a snake bite.The author peppers the pages with intricate details such as Isherwood's realization that he is a good candidate to survive the aftermath since he was young and fit and had his appendix removed. Even so, he took care while descending a flight of stairs, concerned that even the slightest injury could be fatal in a post-pandemic world. At one point, Isherwood sees a Coke-a-Cola sign in the distance flashing on and off (like they used to do in the 70's) and wonders how long the power will stay on without people maintaining the infrastructure. Later as children are born to the survivors, he feels no need to correct their improper English since there was no longer a basis for proper spoken word.An interesting point about this storyline is that presumably those that did survive the epidemic would have had a natural immunity to the disease, but those like Isherwood, surviving by a counter reaction, could pass on the susceptibility to the disease to future generations.Throughout the book Isherwood possesses a hammer that first is a mere tool, but later comes to symbolize his authority and a new justice. Along the way, many difficult decisions are faced by the people of the new society. The author assembles an extensive expanse of possibilities all logically facing the survivors of a new world. I highly recommend this book as I have for many years.","I recently re-read this book after twenty five years. The story drives with a unique force as the naturally detached observer-protagonist Isherwood witnesses the Earth and Mankind's remnants slowly re-establish a new balance. This reacquaintence also served as a reflection on myself.As a teenager, I was drawn to Ish's character, much like my own at the time: quiet, reflective, socially uncomfortable. I took great delight in identifying that the book took place in my own neighborhood: The rock where they carved the years is a perfect description of Indian Rock in Berkeley, where I climbed countless times as a kid. For years after, wherever I went I liked to see how unkept gardens took over their yards, how abandoned houses returned slowly to Nature's way, how unused roads returned to the soil at a relentless if geologic pace.As a man in my 40s I find the tale retains its fascinating hold. I still like to see how Man's works change in their own way when left alone, just as any other object in nature. Much of Stewart's description of that change rings true and is well visualized. But most striking to me was that the nature of the characters had changed in my mind. No longer were they just people like myself, making the best out of this extraordinary circumstance. The second time around, the characters were very unsatisfying. Ish is the only one with any ambition at all, and he is unable to make anything of it. This is due entirely to his personal failings: the social stiffness he never outgrew, his lack of focus, his increasingly insular view of his place in the surrounding world. I was particularly offended by a scene of &quot;crime&quot; and punishment. Yet these are not failings of the author nor of the book. Stewart was simply taking the opportunity to show that, barring the survival of some remarkably talented and organized people, civilization is not by any means guaranteed to carry on. Though &quot;The Stand&quot; is more entertaining, &quot;Earth Abides&quot; remains much more satisfying.","I first came across this book while stationed in Vietnam in 1971. The story is about the life and times of a young geologist who escapes a catastrophe that causes the deaths of almost all of the population of the world. As you read, you see how this young man copes with loneliness and then love after finding another survivor.These two begin a life together and eventually establish friendship with other survivors and then form a \"tribe\". As chapters pass by, they are named for significant events in the tribe's lives during the year.I have read and re-read this book to the point that I will need to purchase another copy in the near future.","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it. This maturity is perceptible all along this work.The story is situated in a world devastated by a sudden pestilence that annihilates most of humankind. Taking into account the last SARS epidemic that jumped abruptly from China to Canada it doesn't look an impossible scenario.This is the story.Isherwood Williams comes down from an isolate spot in the mountains to discover an empty world. He starts searching for survivors all across USA, from California to New York and back again. He finds only isolate human cells, couples or trios, overwhelmed by catastrophe and in a near catatonic state.Returns to his native town and contemplate with a certain scientific detachment the fading world around him.Mr. Stewart intercalate brief vignettes describing what happens to dogs, cats, cattle, plants, roads, dams and bridges, contrasting them with Ish's daily experiences.Little by little the story grip reader's attention and even if action is somehow slow, the book can't be put down.Human cells began to draw near each other and a rather feeble structure starts growing up.The author approaches universal questions about survival and extinction; civilization and savagery; social structure and anomie. He also examines religious values, ethics and life's ultimate sense.This book gives the reader a lot of stuff to think about. A very enticing read!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","Reading Earth Abides what struck me most was not the story, though this was certainly well told and presented, but how bravely the book took an unusual tack on its chosen topic: the survival factor of our civilisation and man himself when measured against geologic or cosmic time as represented by the planet Earth. Normally we are reasured that the embers of civilisation and man will never go out, and that we will always triumph as a species. Almost every film, book or play impresses this perception upon it's audience. And at first, as Isherwood works to rebuild, it seems Earth Abides will follow the same route. Then things start to change, and the reader begins to feel an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of their stomach; Isherwood's attempts start to fail, and the flickering ember of 20th century civilisation begins to dim. At the last, time takes its own course, and our ability to outlast even our own planet, never mind spread to the Universe as many SF books believe, is brought into question. And it is with this that the book triumphs. We are asked to question our entire society, and its true prospects for survival. One of the few books I've read that made me question the daily trip to the office, not from the point of view of myself, but my entire species, and to wonder what on Earth we are doing to ensure the real future of our species.","I did not notice the year until the second reading. The story plays out today as well as it did in the forties.Profound and thought inspiring. My wife is a lit major and had little experience with SF. This book opened a new world for her. It is unfortunate more of Stewart's work is not available.I was originally intrigued by the location. San Lupo Drive is San Luis Drive in the hills of Berkeley, CA. The rocks are Indian Rock Park. Everthing fits. Stewart talks of walking down to to a shopping district, Solano Avenue.The cleanliness of society's destruction was an interseting twist. No mess and madness. Imagine suddenly being a surviver on the planet.A good series to read is Earth Abides, Lucifer's Hammer, and Into the Woods. Throw in The Children of Men.","Earth Abides will no doubt remain one of the classic post-apocalyptic books of our era. The characters are well-developed and easy to like and the setting is as familiar as the Golden Gate bridge and the Oakland hills (where most of the story takes place). When I first read Earth Abides at the age of twelve, I thought it a fascinating and engaging tale that kept me turning pages well into the night. Now, at forty-five, I find it somewhat quirky, ethically questionable, and rather unrealistic in it's study of human nature. Despite the great effort George R. Stewart puts into developing well-rounded characters, most of their attitudes and beliefs would be more suited to the 19th century than the 21st. Racism and sexism are both a noticeable undercurrent and the academic elitism of the main character starts out annoying then rapidly becomes nauseating.Although a powerfully thought-provoking read at the age of 12, at the age of 45 I find it strongly dated and woefully inadequate. Still, it is a classic and is well worth reading for anyone with an interest in post-apocalyptic fiction, anthropology, or the foundations of social order.","This was a great book, but not an action-filled book. It is a book to generate ideas, not to get the adrenaline flowing. If it ever comes to a survival situation as posited in the book, life won't be glamorous. It will be mundane, a matter of getting food and having a dry place to sleep. Stewart gives us good reasons for why this is so.I wrote the following this morning, trying to sort out why Ish is the leader for the group:In reading the complaints of those who don't like Earth Abides, it seemed to me that many were disappointed that George R. Stewart did not create a group of super-humans to rebuild society. Why didn't they plan better? Why didn't they show more interest, more creativity? The author chose a group of ordinary people, who were used to living in a civilization doing everything for them, from providing their food, to thinking and planning.One of the points that is frequently missed for those reading \"Earth Abides\" is the way humans behave. As long as their needs are taken care of, many people tend to let the rest of life come as it will. Making plans takes mental effort, and that is where only Ish has any experience. The energy to think ahead, and to make others see what is coming, that is what makes a leader great.Ish is a scholar--he's well on the way to becoming a professor. That path makes him a professional thinker and ponderer and not a man of action. His career makes him one who watches from the sidelines without getting involved, and even if that were not the case, his personality pushes him in that direction. He is not a people person--he's a loner, uncomfortable in the company of others. He's a geek, more interested in privacy and private pursuits than in being a leader. Ish has half of the great leader equation; he has the energy to think ahead. What he lacks is the ability to convey what he sees to others.When he thinks of himself as a leader by default, he is being realistic; of his band of seven adults, no other shows any sign of talent for leading. The one person in the group with strong social abilities, Ezra, defers to Ish. George is \"dull,\" a man of craft who's job as plumber involves rushing to fix broken things; he is accustomed to reacting, not to making plans. George's wife's main concern is domestic tasks, and in this, she is a product of her age. Of Ezra's two wives, neither shows any signs of interest in planning for the group. Of all of the group, only Em leads when Ish cannot. Where he is the geek, timid and unable to marshal people, she is the one with backbone, who gets people moving when she sees a need. She lets Ish plan, perhaps, because she lives in the here and now, and only leads when she sees a clear cut need or threat in the immediate future. She doesn't worry about the future, because for the present, all the needs are taken care of.This is the group that survived the Great Disaster in Berkeley; seven ordinary people, products of a country that has professional leaders, so that the people don't have to think.There are also a number of complaints about the main character, Ish. People who disliked the book tended to write negative comments about him. In fairness, Ish is not a leader; he is a geek, one interested in private pursuits. He is introverted. Unfortunately for his social tastes, he is the sole person left in the Berkeley area who was accustomed to thinking and judging on a daily basis. This makes him the one who others turn to for ideas, the leader. As the leader, his decisions come out of his non-charismatic, introverted self. He is not a natural teacher (and in spite of this he is the only one to attempt to teach). These social weaknesses, however, are tied to his intellectual strengths. A different main character could have had different strengths, but then the reader would not have been treated to Ish's unique views as to what happened to the world after the fall of civilization.About Ish's attitude: Reviewers have accused him of acting as if others are too emotional, too black)--I think these opinions about how Ish interacts with his world ignore Ish's nature. He isn't judgmental, he is professionally distanced. In a state resembling shock, he turns a scientific eye upon the world, as if the world means nothing to him. He's lost his country and family and everything but his life's work (which was ecologist, one studying the interactions of living things and environment). If he hides behind his life's work in a time of crisis and shock, he isn't the first. Journalists do this all the time. Work now, think about yourself later.About the racist elements: Ish never really shows signs of being racist (but he was living in a racist society--segregation was the law of the land in 1949. And mixed marriages were illegal in many states). He is a product of that society. But in looking at the rural black people, his tone is almost admiration--THEY will survive when all the rest can't.","One of the origional Apotholyptic tales. Since this is probably how it will all end, it is internesting to see the authors views on environmental \"take back\" from humans. Good read, young or old.","I read some of the rave reviews by others which made me decide to order this book. Of the end of the world genre, I would say this rates near the bottom.I guess what annoyed me the most was how far off the author was to guessing how the world would decay... I'll list a few examples and let you decide for yourselves.1. The rate of decay of everything was grossly exagerated. Rail lines reduced to nothing but a pile of rusty chips in only 30-40 years? Entire houses rotting away and completely gone in just 10-15 years? Huge dams rotting and breaking after only 5 years? Very silly scientific assumptions.2. The lack of doing anything worthwhile for a so called smart man. He can only teach just one child to read? Doing basically nothing to improve his life over the course of 40 years?3. He comletely underestimated human will. The children in the tribe lacked any kind of basic intelligence. The author probably never had kids and assumed they are stupid without a formal education.You know what, this isn't even worth my time to continue listing all the flaws. Trust me, spend your time watching one of the recent Discovery Channel episodes on the end of the world without man, it would be much more compelling then this book.","I just finished this book, and I have to say it was interesting but nothing really special. I read The Stand many years ago, and loved it, although it was extremely unrealistic. Earth Abides has the realism, but it overdoes realism, without too much excitement. Basically if you have some time and want a quick read, pick this novel up, but if you are looking for a spectacular sci-fi or post apocolyptic book you are better off picking up another novel.","This tale of the apocalyse is very thorough in its examination of all of the changes in the ecosystem if man were to disappear from the earth. The first half of this book is a real page turner as the main character travels the countryside to discover what has become of the great cities of the U.S. after most of the human race has been wiped out by a deadly disease. Unfortunately, the second half of the book sinks into mediocrity as Ish's small band of survivors shun the \"old ways\" in favor of a return to illiteracy and primative life, which makes the second half kind of not belieavable. Christians [should] be offended that the author has absolutely no respect for and even argues against the existence of God in this book. Nevertheless this is a great book and worth the time and money.","The Greatest Book I've Ever ReadIn the book Earth Abide, By George R. Stewart thesubject at hand throughout the book is the survival of man. Thisbook takes place in San Francisco California where a vast plaguehas almost wiped out all of the Homo-Sapiens. This book followsthe life and times of one man (Isherwood)and his struggles to rrebuild his past American life. This is very heart warming thatour culture would last to the breaking point of our species. Ihope you all feel the same.Isherwood starts out in the mountains on a school studytrip. This is when he became sick from a rattle snake bite. Hereeven before the plague he had to struggle for his life. \"I justhave to cut the bite holes and extract the poison,(Stewart 12).This characteristic shows that he is a survivor and foreshadowshis success aaginst the plague.He also in many other ways begins to stabilize hissurvival iin this book. He ensures safety by meeting othersurvivors and creating a tribe. He tries to edjucate their youthwith their past culture, but loses the young ones to moreexciting activities. He even tries to better the adults, but hefaces complete anguish because not a single person cares. \"Nothanks, were going to play with the bulls, and go dodgin,(Stewart 44).Isherwood thorugh much heart ache and disappointment,goes for one last hurrah to save his people. He teaches his twomiddle aged boys to drive, and sends them in a cross countrysearch of survivors. When they return, it was to no avail. Theygave up and found no one worth finding. Ish is lost agian tothis new world.This is a reamarkable book that is one so captivating iscauses internal turmoil in yourself. By reading of a quitepossible tradgedy, it makes life much sweeter. Also by seeinganother man struggle so hard for all that we stand for isinspiring. Even though Ish couldn't accomplish what he wantedit's good to see he had a moment of clarity at the end of hislife. For then he realized how the only constant is change, andthat Earth Abides.","This book Earth Abides by George R. Stewart is about a man who passes by a massive disease which basically obliterates the US. This man, Ish, has to come to realization of this huge crisis and try to find survivors. It goes on and on about his thoughts and shows the struggles that he faces it the horrid situation. He goes around america finding survivors and ends up making a huge family in the end.This book was basically boring and depressing because it was just lagging on and on about how he thought of everything. It made you want to fall fast asleep at times too. (something that i obviously did) I am one of those kind of people who likes adventure and this book had none. It just was one of those books that wanted to show how horrible things could happen to us if we don't watch it. It sort of chilling and makes you depressed to think that it could happen. George R. Stewart was probably giving a good message out when he wrote this, but in the sense that people want to live there lives without this catastrophe, it is not very good.I would not recommend this book to kids under the age of 12 because it probably is too advanced for them. Also because kids do not have to worry about this sort of horror happening to them at that young of an age. People who need to sleep at night and want to fall asleep fast, please read. If you like adventure and mystery in a book, please go find a different book.","The book held great promise in the first few dozen pages... a believable plague and a believable reason for the protagonist to have survived. It goes rapidly downhill from there. The lead character, Ish, is pompous, self-absorbed, grating, and oh so very tedious. Even giving credit to the fact that the book was written in 1949, there are some very basic errors. Canned goods don't remain safe after 20 years, nor does gasoline remain usable. I kept reading hoping that the book would go somewhere, but it really never did. If you must download this book to your Kindle, do yourself a favor and pull down the sample. Read it, enjoy it, and move on. There's NOTHING more there. If you persist, don't say that I didn't warn you.","2 stars for the \"human\" emotional experience but the book lacked excitement and was mostly dull and depressing. The year of the rats, grasshoppers, etc. How original - not. The only thing the people did was marry more than one wife and breed. No one learned from \"George\" on how to keep the plumbing and houses in good order. No formal schools were set up so everyone learned to read so civilization could rebuild itself. They talked and made plans but never followed though.Ironic their small group refused to breed with a pretty but dim witted female because they didn't want dim witted children yet in terms of learning, each successive generation became dumber anyway. The author must like caveman because his little \"tribe\" is rapidly devolving into that era.","Many of the rave reviews for Stewart's post-apocalyptic novel are by readers who first read it many years ago. After prodding from a trusted reader-friend, I read it last month for the first time. Our hero, Ish, is uninspiring, and the other characters are wooden. Although the premise is a clever one, and many of the events that occur are unexpected and therefore interesting, it's difficult to get caught up in this story of mankind's fate after a disease wipes out most of humanity.Everything in the novel occurs within one man's lifespan, and it is therefore not surprising that Stewart exaggerates character traits so that mankind will swiftly evolve. But the characters are so unenlightened - Ish is the only one interested in teaching children to read, and he gives up after a while - that it's hard to take seriously Ish's assurance (to himself?) that these are average Americans.In short, an interesting concept but flawed in the execution.","If you like this kind of book, you must read this one. Written in the late 40's, this is the grandaddy of all apocalypse stories.","Despite its age and archaic language, Stewart's practical knowledge of nature makes this one of the best epoch-ending books ever written. Other stories reveal this knowledge but unfortunately, are out of print (Storm and Fire). You've probably read enough reviews to know what the story is about, but be prepared for some radical thinking compared to today's social standards. This was written when many words were compounded by hyphens. When you read of the tail-gate on the station-wagon, don't be shocked. We really wrote that way back in the late forties and fifties. His story reflects the way things were then, not now, so you'll likely find this story as alien as many future fiction stories. We really have evolved that much. Enjoy one of the great SF stories of all time. It certainly is my favorite.","This book is a &quot;must read&quot; for those of us living in Northern and Central California. His descripitons bring the story home. I have assigned this book to students for extra reading. I believe it should be assigned reading in our local high schools.","This review is only of the Kindle edition not the book. There are too many typos and editing problems in the Kindle version. Stick with a hard copy.","After I picked this up I realized I read this book a long time ago. Because the time setting is over 60 years ago some of the language and terminology has passed into disuse but, what would you expect? Entertaining and thought provoking.","I read this book about 35 years ago as a paperback and just decided to read it again as a Kindle edition. I liked it much more when I read it as a teen, now in my 50's it seemed kind of slow. It's not one of those books you read over and over again.","I first read this book as a senior in high school, and it's stayed with me all this time. Some typos and poor editing in this edition, but the story is worth reading and sharing with friends.","From start to finish, the book was entertaining if not thought provoking. I enjoyed the the perspective of the main character throughout the book and each encounter. He was much more relatable than most protagonists in the genre. I recommend this book to anyone looking in the survival / post-apocalyptic genre.","For the year written, it seemed ahead of it's time. It does not compare to &#34;Alas, Babylon&#34;. At one point I put it aside and read another book. Though, as the principal aged, his thought's and actions, were first class.","Warning before you read, no cannibals or massacres are devices used in this novel. It is a thinking man's teotwawki! I totally enjoyed sharing the thoughts of this quiet man who watched his world rebuild. Great balance for all the survivalist info I glean from all my other beloved shtf reads!","This classic book reminds us how greatly our civilization affects our surroundings yet how temporary and insignificant we are in this world.Mr. Stewart has written a book that keeps pressure on the reader to think introspectively. The style is easy to read and allows such personal thoughts to mingle with the words being read.","A thoughtful examination of the slow collapse of civilization in the lives of a small band of survivors brought together by one man who remains their leader until old age. In general, four stars, in science fiction genre alone, five stars.","George Stewart has crafted a science fiction tale that stands up fairly well to the test of time. Although it was first published in 1949, the language and ideas are still immediately relevant today. What would happen to you if civilization fell apart? How would you survive? How would people treat each other?The tale unfolds gradually, without suspense. For me, this was not quite the memorable novel that the highlighted reviewers described. I read the whole thing, but I could have easily put it down halfway through, since I did not develop a deep emotional attachment to the story or its characters. The novel is told in the third person, but through the eyes of Ish, the main character. This unusual point of view puts the reader at a distance. I didn't feel that I really knew any of the characters in the book, except for Ish.Ish has a bland personality. He is one who accepts his lot in life, even his lot in death. As the workings of civilization fail, he notes their passing. In the end, he does little to oppose his tribe's drift back into the stone age. This engendered my main disappointment with the novel. Why did the author make the protagonist so weak? There have been great novels fashioned out of weak characters, but ultimately I did not find greatness in this book. It is well written, but it did not fulfill my expectations.","This isn't badly written but, it didn't hold my interest like a really good Sci-fi book will do. It has a good story line but, the characters lack personality. It is interesting to read a book that was written as Science Fiction years ago.Earth Abides","Given a copy of \"Earth Abides\" in 1976 while stationed in Atsugi JA. This novel takes a single premise and projects the \"what if\" to a very logical and believable conclusion. I have read this novel three times since, each time obtaining a different prespective on the way human nature molds our life's decisions. Ranks with 20,000 leagues u/sea, The Time Machine and other SF stories that will stay within your mind years after the final page has been turned. One of the very few works of fiction that I recommend to friends - if you're searching for a believable work of science fiction \"Earth Abides\" will exceed your expectations.","I liked this book, its a very good view on what things could be like for the few survivors of a near species-ending pandemic. Written some time ago it does tend to be dated, but not annoyingly so. I knocked off a star due to the fact that it is somewhat navel-gazing in its execution. There's alot of deep thinking going on by the main character. Given all of this, its still worth a read and will IMO promote some thinking of your own.","The story of a world decimated by a fast-moving plague, Earth Abides follows the life of Isherwood, a 29-year-old loner who, while camping, suffers a rattlesnake bite that saves his life. After recovering from the snakebite (and other symptoms), he makes his way back to the San Francisco Bay area, where he finds his parents gone and the city deserted. Indeed, only a few people remain after the scourge that killed millions.Written in 1949, Earth Abides is a philosophical sci fi classic--it takes place before rock and roll, before microwaves, and way before computers. As Ish bands together with a few survivors to found a new civilization, he must decide what is important to keep from the Old Times, and what can be abandoned. The charm of Earth Abides is that it is as much a portrait of the mid-20th century as it is a futuristic fiction. It is the story of the last Americans.","The first scifi i ever read. Published , i believe, in 1949,the language is still current and still moving. Love a book that makes me think about the end of the world...","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it. This maturity is perceptible all along this work.The story is situated in a world devastated by a sudden pestilence that annihilates most of humankind. Taking into account the last SARS epidemic that jumped abruptly from China to Canada it doesn't look an impossible scenario.This is the story.Isherwood Williams comes down from an isolate spot in the mountains to discover an empty world. He starts searching for survivors all across USA, from California to New York and back again. He finds only isolate human cells, couples or trios, overwhelmed by catastrophe and in a near catatonic state.Returns to his native town and contemplate with a certain scientific detachment the fading world around him.Mr. Stewart intercalate brief vignettes describing what happens to dogs, cats, cattle, plants, roads, dams and bridges, contrasting them with Ish's daily experiences.Little by little the story grip reader's attention and even if action is somehow slow, the book can't be put down.As the story goes on human cells began to draw near each other, grouping and interacting again. A rather feeble structure starts growing up.The author approaches universal questions about survival and extinction; civilization and savagery; social structure and anomie. He also examines religious values, ethics and life's ultimate sense.This book gives the reader a lot of stuff to think about. A very enticing read!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","In this profound ecological fable, a mysterious plague has destroyed the vast majority of the human race. Isherwood Williams, one of the few survivors, returns from a wilderness field trip to discover that civilization has vanished during his absence. Eventually he returns to San Francisco and encounters a female survivor who becomes his wife. Around them and their children a small community develops, living like their pioneer ancestors and gradually returning to a simpler way of life. It may seem odd to say that a book in which the majority of the world's inhabitants die is life-affirming and spiritual, but I'm going to say it anyway. I have read this book again and again over the years, and each time I come away from it with a deep feeling of peacefulness and confidence in the power of Mother Earth.","I read this book about 15 years ago and had completely forgotten its name, but this book kept coming back to my mind over the years and I had to search and rediscover this book. What made this book to stay alive in my mind were my own thoughts and ideas that I have developed during the years about how civilizations grow and develop trends like religions, life styles etc.The central character of this story, Ish was an ordinary man before the plague that wiped out the whole world. In the new civilization, he, oblivious to himself, started assuming the role of a leader. The civilization, against his own wishes, started looking up at him as their spiritual leader.Most of the story is made up of his reflections and ambitions for the new civilization. He intended the new civilization to be based on the old one, taking advantage of the technological developments already in place. But, the civilization chooses to follow its natural progression and he found everyone around him to be very comfortable with the barbarian way of life.It is a thought provoking book. Must read for anyone who is a thinker !","It seems like this book was super-great when I first read it about 40 years ago. I haven't been able to forget it. I am excited to see it is in print again---but why was it ever out of print? It is timely, provocative and just plain great reading for any age.","I read the Earth Abides, after listening to a friend describe this story as one of the most impactful he had ever known. Several years later in the early 1980's, I stumbled across a slightly used copy in a bookstore. George Stewart tells a fascinating tale of a post apocolyptic vision staged in the East Bay section of the San Francisco Bay area. This story has stayed with me and endures as a valued set of images. The struggle to make sense of the horrific and nonsensical was intuitively accurate. The story revealed in human terms the everyday efforts of a small group of survivors, suddenly stranded and adrift. The beneficiaries of a hulking but hollow industrial infrastructure that no longer served those who remained and their succeeding generations. The unfolding &quot;descent&quot; of industriatized society as well as the marginalization of technology was at once fascinating and frightening. The ending left me stunned, yet wisened.","My 12 year old daughter is reading Alas, Babylon right now and was discussing the plot with me. I immediately remembered reading Earth Abides over 10 years ago and was wondering if it could still be found. Obviously, there are lots of fans. What a compelling story about the potential future of mankind. Should be required reading in school","I read this book when I was 12 or 13 years old (more than 30 years ago) and it had a lasting impact on me. I have long since forgotten most of the &quot;classics&quot; I have read but this story has stayed with me through the years. Friends think I'm nuts when I say things like &quot; as you yourself, Ish, well know!&quot; right out of the blue. I just stumbled across it at Amazon and immediately ordered it. I can't wait to read it again!","I first read this book about 20 years ago, it caught my eye because the opening date used in the book is my birthdate 12/22/47. Have read it many times since and it never fails to make me re evaluate my current situation and really look at what is important and what is not. This is a must read book for me at least once evey 18 months.","I read this book 10 or 20 years ago, and I still think about it nearly every week. Where would I choose to live? What would I try to save? I have even thought of making my own screenplay adaptation based on the book. If the author needs help or motivation, then please e-mail me!","Read this book when you're really depressed. You will realize that things are not all that bad. Earth Abides provides hope. Even if everything we hold dear, everything we assume to be permanent, everything human disappears, the dream will survive.This is not the metaphysical good v. evil crap of Stephen King, nor the bang-bang rootin' shootin' end of the world of the pulps, but a quiet look at what the world would be like if mankind silently slipped away.","This book was captivating, and exciting. It makes you think abou the fragility of life, and how quick things change. This should be read at least once in your life. Stewart was 40 years ahead of his time when he wrote this and you don't want to miss out on it.","To read this book for the first time, at 10 years of age, is to enter suddenly into the reality of the fragility of the material society into which we are submerged.How could everyone really die off like that? This was MY town! MY Bay Area! MY UC Berkeley campus playground! A major metropolis! Fascinated, I couldn't put the book down. Living in Oakland, Ca. in the late 60's, I avidly looked out the windows when traveling through the East Bay, striving to see that little pony, running and running and running.It was beyond my comprehension that a thing so large as the Bay Bridge, which my grandfather had had a hand in building, could fall apart! I had thought such a thing would take ages and ages to break, not just a generation.All it takes is an earthquake, a dash of sea salt and a virulent bug.","This book is way ahead of it's time in exploring the way mankind can be taken down by virtue of the adaptabiliy of micro-organisms exploiting the large population of world ranging individuals. This book is scary that way, not to mention the writing is incredibly good. George Steward shows a love and understanding of ecosystems and how culture can be shaken and lost by the loss of the majority of constituant members. How Isherwood Williams copes with his deminishing expectations for the next generation is realistic and shows how most of us adapt to the whims and caprice of what life can throw at us. This book could be a world shaker if given a good rewrite updating the 1940s slant. With what we know now that Steward seemed to predict would come about intuitively, this work would be very popular today. Don't let that stop you from reading this great, great book.","Excellent book! I've owned a copy many years ago, and had to have another since my old copy was lost or stolen!!!","I, too, read this book 30-something years ago. What I remember most is the boy. I think he is Ish's son. He is the only one of the new generation to wonder how that dark box (the television) once worked. And he dies! I so wanted him to start figuring things out.","i have read the last ship alas babylon year zero footfall lucifers hammer this book was the best even though it was written long ago that is the most epic story MEN COME AND GO BUT EARTH ABIDES i read it 20 years ago and several times since","One of the most interesting books I've ever read. I wish he'd focused a little more on what happened in the rest of the world than the Tribe, but an amazing book all the same.","EARTH ABIDES by George R. Stewart is one of many books that take as its theme the destruction of mankind, leaving the Last Man on Earth as a narrator. THE PURPLE CLOUD by M.P. Sheil did much the same but Sheil's book was marred by excessive racism. Stewart's book is saved not only by the logical working out of the plot by its narrator-survivor, Isherwood, but also by Stewart's clever though subtle use of using Isherwood's slowly failing senses over many decades of post-apocalyptic adventures as a metaphor for the slow destruction of the American ideal of life.As the novel opens, the reader is told that the United States has been hit by a super-plague that has spread with lightning rapidity with near one hundred percent fatality. Ish, one of the very few survivors, passes by a abandoned car on the San Francisco bridge. This car is registered to a James P Robson of Oregon. This seemingly innocuous narration is later seen as the central metaphor of the book. Years later, Ish has several opportunities to pass the car in and out of San Francisco. Each time he does so, the car becomes somehow less distinct, a fuzziness that resonates first in his mind, then in the reader's mind. As the decades pass, Ish meets isolated pockets of survivors who have forgotten their American heritage. To these barbaric Mad Max types, Ish is the Last of the Americans. They tease him, they pinch him, they see him as a failed god type who could not deliver on the promises of the fabled technology of their legends. By the novel's end, he sees them pinching him, but he cannot feel them doing so. His senses have failed him just as America's technology had earlier failed to protect its population from the plague. Just before his death, Ish remembers the car on the bridge. Was it red? blue? green? Owned by Robson? Robinson? Robertson? He does not remember. But he feels sure that America has died, its technology has long since died, but its people live on, possibly learning from the mistakes of their predecessors, or maybe not. Stewart concludes his otherwise depressing work with a hint of optimism: \"Man may come and go, but earth abides.\"","I would have given this book fewer stars if I had been able to put it down. In spite of the stilted prose, odd inaccuracies, and generally bleak view of human nature, Earth Abides' end of the world scenario is completely gripping. There's none of the pseudo-mysticism of The Stand, just pure mid 20th century sci-fi goodness. Some of the scenarios Stewart presents aren't very subtle, and his views of women and blacks are what you might expect from 1949, but if you're at all interested in the &quot;what happens after a mysterious virus wipes out most of humanity&quot; scenario, Earth Abides is worth a read.","I bought this book and read it with the hope that it would be at least as good as Alas Babylon, one of my all time favorites. It was not. Earth Abides may have been the prototype of the collapse of civilization genre of Science Fiction but it has been outdone by so many other later books I hardly know where to start.To begin with, even the main character is very shallowly drawn and it goes downhill from there. You don't really care what happens to any of these people because the author does such a sketchy job of portraying them as having any of the qualities that we need to see in a literary figure in order to identify with them. This book is a science fiction version of The Grapes of Wrath without the character development. Be prepared for sexism, elitism, stupidity, lemming like fatalism and lack of preparation for any kind of civilized future. Also the author totally fails in most respects to know and understand how long canned food will last and how quickly you might be killed by scurvy living the lifestyle described in this book. Add in unrealistic pretexts for the characters doing what they do and you have a book that drags you into editor mode thinking how you could make it better.If you why I gave this book three stars when I disliked it so much, here is why It gets one of them for concept, the second for being the prototype of the genre and the third for having an interesting beginning. Where is really falls down is the ability to deliver on the initial promise. Books and movies for the most part succeed when they take an initial premise, however, far-fetched and then elaborate on that initial premise in a logical manner. After the initial suspension of disbelief this is how they suck you in. This book doesn't suck you in but actually loses you in contradictions, flimsy pretexts, and poor research with an ending that tails off in a whimper and left me whipping through the last several pages to get to the ending only to find that there was really no \"there\" there. Earth Abides gets credit for illustrating very convincingly the complex web of technical knowledge and individual job skills as well as motivations that keep our industrial society afloat but loses all the previous credit when it fails in a primal manner to explain why rational people who didn't really want to do a lot of work would makes life choices that initially and in the long run would mean a lot more work than the alternative choice that they didn't make. A low-tech lifestyle is a bundle of work compared to learning about and maintaining some of the elements of civilization. This is where I really fault the author as I believe that a lot of things including; the shelf life of canned goods, the back breaking labor of a hunter gatherer existence without even any horses, human craving for fresh food, and basic human emotions are ignored or glossed over in order to reach a contrived conclusion.","This a truly great book that everyone should read. Now to my experience with getting. I was looking for a reasonably priced hard back edition. This one said very good condition, in a price range I could live with. When I got the book I was happy with the condition until I found a bar code on the back cover which tore the cover getting it off. They should have specified that there was this sticker on the back cover. I like to keep my books and that is why I buy hard back. I was disappointed. Not only that but there was a sticker on side that read salvation army, $2.99. I really didn't care about the price difference but it showed me lack of concern by the seller which I do not appreciate. ruscolombo","I was really looking forward to reading this book as I have lately been going through a post-apocalyptic literature jag. After thoroughly enjoying \"On the Beach\", I purchased \"Earth Abides\". While \"On the Beach\" centers on humanity's ability to stay hopeful while facing the inevitable, I was confused by the intended message of \"Earth Abides\". The book's protagonist, Ish, likes to think of himself as the forward-thinking leader of a new civilization, but he comes across as more of an apathetic dreamer. In the twenty-plus years following a devastating plague, Ish and his companions evolve from foraging through supermarkets for food to....foraging through supermarkets for even older food. And I guess that is the really frustrating element of this book- in all that time no one has the foresight or gumption to make more than half-hearted attempts at creating some sort of self-sustaining community. The 'Gilligan's Island' crew did more in two years to create a society than this motley crew does in thirty!Kidding aside, I am sure that the author is making a statement about mankind that others have picked up on and that has apparently gone way over my head. I actually look forward to reading more learned reviews of the book to figure out what I missed.","Can't believe the negative reviews of this extraordinary novel. Read it for yourself. Then, you will appreciate life as we know it today. You will sleep well, adore more your family and friends, and rest assured that Earth abides.","I'm an avid reader. This is one of the most memorable books I've ever read. Earth Abides is a true masterpiece in every sense.","This book was written in 1949. It has withstood the test of Time.If You like a good Post-Apocalypse yarn, Read & Enjoy.","\"the Earth Abides\" is a well written book. It is now somewhat dated, but it still offers a good set of characters that are well developed and a solid story line. Good story telling, realistic characters that are well written, fine dialog, all combine to make \"The Earth Abides\" a pretty good read.","This book should be considered right up there with the classics of the genre. It's a wonderful and complex narrative that pulls you in and slowly pulls you along. It's not action packed but it is a very realistic look at a future where mankind has suffered a terrible tragedy. Highly recommended!","This timeless masterpiece recounts the most likely of the various apocalyptic ends to man's brief reign on Earth. Written from a naturalist's viewpoint, the novel recounts the fall of man following a sweeping measles-like pandemic. The author deftly informs us that the unknown disease is sirborne, that it hits only higher primates, and that the death toll is so all-encompassing that society simply vanishes. Mr Stewart also notes that the bulk of the few survivors are so devastated by the event that they become incapacitated. He also recounts nature's way of restoring an upset ecological balance and how the remaining animals cope with their new-found freedom.Ish Williams, the main character, himself goes through a period of psychological angst, but as with some persons in any crisis, recovers his equilibrium. He sees and meets others who cannot, but eventually meets an equally resolute woman. The book then briefly, but viably, notes how mores change when society disintegrates.In a section entitled \"Quick Years\", the couple meet certain other adjusted persons who have adjusted to the \"Great Disaster\", as they call it, and a rudimentary \"tribe\", so-called, comes into being. A tight, fascinating study leaves the way clear for \"The Year 22\", the next chapter.It is interesting to note how the members retain traditional taboos, remember dates and holidays, and yet slowly return to a hunter-gatherer society. Organized learning is a natural casualty, to be replaced by superstition. Obviously, the ability to conjugate verbs becomes surplusage at such a time.The tribe learns to face disease, criminality, and tragedy. Religious tenets alter in each such society. One is left with the belief that man hasn't really learned very much by all of it. You learn that the most important thing to primitive man was the bow and arrow, and fire-making. Ish preserves these for future generations, along with a less credible democratic tradition. Even the language begins to change, as history marches on.I won't spoil it by giving the ending, but you won't forget it, any more than you will forget any of the details of this incredibly well thought out, impeccably written book.Even if, as with some reviewers, you cannot accept Stewart's approach or result, you will be forced to concede that, in addition to being a great storyteller, he is an incomparable, almost lyrical, wordsmith.I hated to see the book end.","Even Stephen King admits he based THE STAND on this interesting novel. I also recommend Doherty's AREA 51 series.","Considering all the raves, I was disappointed by Earth Abides. Although the premise was interesting, it never really went any place and kind of left me hanging. I thought the discussion of how man's departure from Earth affected other species was thought provoking and well done, but the rather dry writing style and lack of depth in the characters left me underwhelmed.","All i have to say is this book is sooooo gooood!","Allow me to digress for a minute. Has anyone ever seen the Bruce Willis movie The 12 Monkeys? Anyone besides me that is? I didn't think so. Back to the subject hand. The plot of Earth Abides is similar to that movie. A biological plague devastates the United States and the rest of the world. Isherwood, &quot;Ish&quot; Brown, comes across a dying man named Barlow. After Barlow's death, Brown's the last man on Earth. If I may digress again, it's also similar to the 1971 Charlton Heston movie &quot;The Omega Man.&quot; Ish sets out on a cross-country trek to preserve our culture. In Arkansas, he finds roads in disrepair, and forests reclaiming everything. That's all I'm telling you. If you want to find out &quot;the rest of the story,&quot; READ THIS BOOK!!!","I read this for a geography class in college. Boy, what a downer. Think Little House on the Prairie meets Mad Max, it's that skewed and contorted. Moments of trying to rebuild are perpetually dashed. In truth, what we have here is the story of a man trying to recreate the past, and how a world gone wrong prevents him from achieving his dream. He is in essence, powerless to do anything about it for the forces against him are nature itself.I do not recommend this book unless you like to read about characters who have no hope whatsoever. I think the one plus is that it's set in the San Francisco Bay Area, so there's a kind of tangibleness to it from this reader.Beyond that, I should've trashed or donated this thing ages ago.","I read Earth Abides in the sixties as a teenager, and it is one of the few books that stays with me through the years. A beautiful, haunting book.","Every fan of post-apocalyptic stories has his own reason for following the genre. Mine is, that I like to see what the author considers most important to life in this world. When civilization and human society collapse; when food, medicine, and basic comforts become scarce; when friends are few and family is imperiled, what values will prevail? Most of the classic novels of calamity portray survivors determined to carry on, forming communities which are insular and self-reliant; learning and developing the skills and collecting the resources essential to living in a new world. Earth Abides paints a somewhat different picture.Ish is much like the heroes of the other popular disaster stories, in that he is determined to carry on; and to recover, as much as possible, the advances of civilization which are in danger of disappearing with the loss of most of the human race. Ish finds himself the head of a community and extended family; and though he is strong, educated, and resourceful, he finds nothing but frustration in his efforts to pass on his values to the next generation. His children and grandchildren have little desire to produce goods for themselves, having become dependent on the things left behind by those who died from the plague. He is unable to inspire them with his vision for keeping the great accomplishments of humanity alive.Something unique about this story is the occasional vignette describing what happens to the world around Ish, now that the human race has essentially become an endangered species. If you've ever watched the History Channel's \"Life After People\", you'll get a sense of that here - and see how these things directly affect Ish and the other survivors.I'm discovering that those classic novels which I can read many times throughout my life, and which say something new to me each time (see my reviews of \"1984\" and \"Fahrenheit 451\"), are those in which I recognize the signs of true works of genius. This is only my first time reading \"Earth Abides\", but I already wonder what it will say to me in five years, or ten, as I raise my children, or lead kids in my community, and try to impart my own values and experience to them. Will I be able to pass on those things they need to survive, or will I find myself, like Ish, disappointed, or having to realign my expectations?An engaging read, with all the hallmarks of a true classic.","I have read and reread this novel many times over the years, and this was just one of many copies I have bought to share with friends. It is the easiest reading but most thought provoking apocalyptic novel I have ever had the pleasure of reading.","This book is an interesting read about the end of civilization and rebuilding...but honestly nothing really happened in this book. The whole book seems like a huge buildup to some epic conflict/event that is going to happen, but never does.Maybe it's just a sign of the times that today's reader expects action, I always have a hard time with books written in the 50's.","This great book addresses one of the age-old curiousities so many of us have: What would I do if one day suddenly I was all alone in a world wiped clean of almost every other person?Ish, the main character, is a non-descript every-day Joe who finds himself in just this scenario. There are a few other survivors along the way, eventually forming a \"tribe.\" They all have their flaws and eccentricities which makes the story all the more believable. If you plucked a random selection of humanity and put them on a desert island they wouldn't all be super heroes! They would bumble along and learn how to survive as best they could within their limited capabilities.It was the way in which the author wrote the book that made it so great for me. The little interjections within chapters describing the changes in the Earth away from the human plot were great, and they provided context and realism to the human story. The progression through the 60 some-odd years was expertly crafted by singling out the years with momentous turning points for more detail, and speeding through the fascinating \"quick years\" in between. The descent back to a stone-age type existance twists the emotions. Sad for one who is familiar with the conveniences and comforts of modernity, but understandably necessary for the new human condition.A great novel that is considered a classic of post AP for very good reason.","I thought it started a bit slow, but in time I was certainly hooked. The writing style seemed a bit formal but I grew used to it. I found it easy to forget while reading that the setting was decades ago, as I could easily envision it happening in these times.By the middle of the book I was considering it \"required reading\" and thinking of family members I could loan it to. It definitely gains steam as the story evolves. Loved the ending, both powerful and moving.I can see that Stephen King must have been inspired by several different portions of this book to write the Stand. I consider this one better. I would have liked maybe to see it longer, with more character development of the younger generations. I suppose 900 page novels were uncommon in the time it was written, so we are left with what it is. A great, and thought provoking novel.","This book should be considered right up there with the classics of the genre. It's a wonderful and complex narrative that pulls you in and slowly pulls you along. It's not action packed but it is a very realistic look at a future where mankind has suffered a terrible tragedy. Highly recommended!","In 10th grade we read a story that dealt with the end of the world in our English class. I was intrigued. As i spoke again of this story a year later my 11th grade english teacher suggested that i read \"Earth Abides\". I shrugged off the suggestion being as though it was from my teacher (one of the lesser evils in my life) and it wasn't untill later that year when i found it on the library shelf that i finnally picked it up and began to read. I managed to rack up over 30 dollars in library fines because i litterally refused to return the book to its rightfull home. After reading it straight through three times in a row, I began to keep it under my pillow. I would pull it out at night and open it up and read randomly wherever the pages led me. Earth Abides may just be the most inspiring book I have ever read. I am now a Senior in Highschool. I since have bought a copy of Earth abides to replace the library's copy so that i could keep the copy that i had grown so close to. It is not so much the story or the people in it that i have attached myself to. The understanding of human nature and the way we react to crisis, and the way we move through life never ceases to amaze me. As I prepare myself to go into a career in Pyschology Stewart continues to be a constant inspiration in my search towards understanding of human behavior and human emotions. Also I am inspired as a writer. I can only dream that someday i will be able to write as well as Stewart. To be able to convey my thoughts or create and develope a character as well as he does would be beyond my imagination. Earth Abides leaves one person in awe and leaves them dying to read more but afraid to turn over the last page, for fear of ending the story. A wise person once said that finishing a good book is like losing a close friend. This holds true in Earth Abides. Whenever i read that last page my best friend dies with a simple punctuation mark. But as the book continues to remind us, Men go and come, BUT, earth abides.","The characters in George R. Stewart's Earth Abides symbolize many biblical people.Isherwood, the main character, is referred to as Ish throughout the novel. \"Ish,\" however, can also be a shortened form of the name Ishmael. Ishmael was a biblical wanderer who allegedly founded the Islamic religion. In the first half of the book, Ish is a wanderer, venturing all over post-apocalyptic America, eventually settling down and founding a tribe.One of Ish and Em's children, Joseph (who is referred to as Joey), is representative of the biblical Joseph. He is very gifted intellectually, and has the ability to see the deeper meaning in any situation, much like the biblical Joseph's ability to interpret drams; unlike the biblical Joseph, however, his talent is squelched, when he is stricken with typhoid fever, and dies as a result.The mentally-handicapped Evie has a name similar to the Eve, and is nave, much like her biblical predecessor. Eve is targeted by the evil serpent, and is expelled from the Garden of Eden when she partakes of fruit from a forbidden tree. Similarly, Evie is targeted by Charlie, a greasy character who lusts after her and plans to take advantage of her innocence. Before actually seducing Evie, however, he is executed by the others in Ish's Tribe, for Evie's well-being. Likewise, the serpent from the Bible receives his comeuppance in the form of expulsion from Eden and being made to walk on his belly for the rest of eternity.Ish's wife, \"Emma,\" is referred to as Em throughout the novel. This also ties in biblically, for \"Em\" can be short for \"Emet,\" a name meaning \"Truth.\" Emma is characterized throughout the novel as a strong-willed individual who helps hold the Tribe together. After Joey's death from typhoid fever, Ish asks Em if there might be a God taking vengence for Charlie's execution. Em responds, \"If there is a God who made us and we did something wrong before his eyes... at least we did wrong only because we were as god made us, and I do not think that He should set traps.\" (258) She speaks her mind, and she speaks the truth.Ezra was a biblical prophet who chronicled the return of the Jews to Jerusalem after their expulsion by the Babylonians sixty years prior. Likewise, in the novel, Ezra speaks with great foresight-much like a prophet-and lives to observe the Tribe's rebuilding of civilization.These and other biblical parallels make Earth Abides one of the most symbolic modern-day books.","I first read this book nearly 40 years ago, and loved it. I go back and re-read it about once per decade, and I never tire of it. This was the first &quot;post-disaster&quot; novel, and in some ways still the best. Because it was written in 1949 it's a bit dated in some ways, but the human element is so strong that it still holds your interest; you really CARE about the characters! One of my all-time favorites!","I don't think I've never read another book like this, so I'm not sure how to describe it. Very slow paced, not a lot of character development. Not a lot of explanation about where everyone went, I just didn't think enough how and why questions were answered early on. Interesting, but I really found it easy to put down. I also found some of the main character Ish's point of view about non-whites curious, yet somewhat disturbing. As if that was the way people viewed each other in the late 40s, and quite obvious lack of communication/knowledge about each other. There are some very interesting plot twists in here, none of them gory where they could be. Seems as if Stewart withheld gruesome details to focus on Ish's response to a completely changed world (no complaints here). I just find this book hard to recommend, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading this either.","I read this book years ago, lost my copy and when I heard the old time radio adaptation I got another copy. My first reading I was waiting for the clashes with other survivers, the cannabiles trying to eat them, you name it. Now after many years and another reading I understand Ish and the other survivers better. People cling to what they know, what is familiar. So did Ish. He was a bookworm, maybe even a geekish type. He loved the Hills, being solitary, studying. He was even in a profession that may have regarded less educated people as stupid (highly skilled science/engineering types come to mind) He was the last person to be chosen to kickstart humanity, to lead it back to greatness. He had the courage to drive cross country,alone, but not to keep the children in school or to take the books from the library.I liken the little colony to an office load of people who have never had to face a deadline, a change of upper management, or a takeover. They plodded along doing things the way they always did until circumstance forced an issue- the water, the visitor, there own need to bring in new blood. Ish knew what needed to be done but he lacked the wherewithall to motivate the others. He was not the charasmatic leader found in later novels. Those by S.M. Sirling come to mind, or Alas Babylon! Ish held the colony together and prevented their complete loss of civilization. He enforced rule of law when necessary, and made hard decisions.As others have pointed out, this book will continue to be debated as long as there are two people who have read it and thought about it.","I read this book aeons ago when I was in high school - of course back then it was a lot heavier (chisled in stone). It's a great book - though a bit antiquated and an interesting twist on the post-apocalyptic genre. The symbol of the single jack hammer has stuck with me through the years to the point that I never pick up my one handed sledge in the garage without thinking of the story. If you've never read it, you are missing a real treat.","I first read this in college for an English class and it really caught my imagination. Overall, the basic plot line of the book is very interesting and thought provoking, though the writing is not what I would call first rate. I like the fact that the book focuses on the fate of civilization in the wake of an overwhelming catastrophe without resorting to the seemingly inevitable appearance of zombies or other un-dead as is the case in so many other post-apocalyptic stories. I also like that the story balances optimism and pessimism, rather than going totally pessimistic a la 'The Road'.","I won't quibble with the author about such things as the shelf life of gasoline. I found this novel an intriguing insight into the era in which I was born. The author draws conclusions about post-apocalyptic civilization that, while I find them disturbing, are certainly possible. He casts the role of the antagonist not as the greed, lechery, or lust for power among others outside his tribe. Rather, the antagonist is the lethargy of a group of survivors who live by scavenging and whose creative urges never develop as a result.Personally, I find that a depressing scenario...perhaps because I also see it as a possibility. The main character, even though the tribe considers him their leader, is cast as one who stands outside the group. Instead of directing their energy toward creativity, he continues to see himself as an academic...an observer. Inevitably, the \"tribe\" is reduced to being a combination of scavengers and hunter/gatherers. Mr. Stewart does a good job of chronicling this decline. I simply think he (and his protagonist) accept this fate too easily.This is a book review, however. It is not a social commentary. The novel, itself, is well written and very effective in its' message. It's a worthwhile read, even if only undertaken as a study of the Amercan culture during the time period in which it was written.","So good. The good beginning and the good ending more than make up for the sometimes-boring middle. The whole, of course, is poetic. The author intended that and he succeeded. And he succeeded in making a post-apocalyptic story that is not dystopian, as so many of these contemporary stories are, and moreover is actually hopeful and, in the end, optimistic. And Stewart is to be thanked for that, as much as for anything else he has done here. As others have said, the novel certainly is worth reading again and I will do so.","At first, I found it hard to get past what I considered the author's naivete. Afterall, 99% plus of the world's population dies out, but there are few bodies...a plague of rats with the same result...the streets, even within the population centers, are virtually clear of stranded vehicles, etc. But, then I realized, this book was not about personal survival, it was about the survival of knowledge. Armed with the world's knowledge and a fine brain, Ish is only able to bequeath to his survivors a hammer, archery skills and the ability to make fire without modern means...despite his best efforts. This scenario of lost knowledge is even more probable today with Wikipedia taking the place of public libraries for many of our youth. An anthropological masterpiece! A must read for those planning to rebuild civilization after its collapse. (It's hard to believe this was written in 1949)","Earth Abides is a 1949 science fiction novel by George R. Stewart. When a plague all but wipes out the human race, a young introverted intellectual decides to observe the way the world responds to the sudden removal of humans, and, later, works to reconstruct certain aspects of civilization while battling to keep education alive.This is a thoughtful book: one of Stewart's primary themes here is a philosophical take on civilization: its pros and cons, what is gained and lost through starting over, and whether parts or the whole are worth rebuilding. Stewart, with the world's last scholar as his main character, does a wonderful job with this.But while Earth Abides is all about ideas, Stewart mostly punts on the moral and theological ramifications, as his characters move on quickly when these themes present challenges. In a world where people can't help but focus on death, that's a missed opportunity.In addition to the book's philosophical emphasis, Stewart's post-apocalyptic world is generally free of unrest and violence. While this allows Stewart to focus on his themes of rebuilding, his characters are rarely in much peril, and there's never much suspense. Yet as Stewart charts the life of his protagonist through the years and decades, the reader becomes invested in and attached to the character, passive and powerless though he may be, and this is why the novel is compelling, and why the reader will not mind the book's many philosophical detours.On the whole, Earth Abides is an intelligent, poignant and melancholy novel, and one of the finer and more influential works in the genre. Bonus points for an interracial relationship during a hostile era.","\"At the funeral of Homo sapiens there will be few mourners.\"I loved this book. So many end-of-the-world tales center on violence, war, superhuman heroes and unrealistic resolutions. Earth Abides is unique. It follows the story of \"Ish\", a biologist who was busy doing research alone in the mountains of California when a virus swept around the planet wiping out all but a few members of the human species. Immune to the virus, possibly because of a well-timed snakebite, Ish proceeds to explore the empty world. He travels across the United States, returns to the west coast, and helps establish a small community with a handful of survivors.Earth Abides is special because it all seems so real and down-to-earth. Ish is a scientist who makes keen observations and comes up with brilliant solutions to problems. But he is always very human. The character never drifts in a formulaic larger-than-life hero who can save the day. I also like the realistic mix of survivors. No, they aren't all Mohawk-wearing rapists and murderers. No, they aren't all highly intelligent saviors of civilization. They are an assortment of people one might see walking down any sidewalk in any city. Some smart, some dumb; some nice, some not so nice.Earth Abides covers a lot of ground, stretching out many years beyond the disaster. It is fascinating to read the author's description of crumbling cities and vanishing highways. It reminded me of the fine nonfiction book, The Earth Without Us.This book was a pleasure to read and I highly recommend it.\"At least,\" he thought, \"life is quieter.\"\"Yes, a tribe is like a child. You can show it the way by which it should grow up, and perhaps you can direct it a little, but in the end the child will go his own way, and so will the tribe.\"\"Men go and come, but Earth abides.\"","Earth Abides is a great book. It has always been one of my favorites. George Steward makes it easy to put yourself in the situation of being the last man on earth. This is the kind of book that you will read over and over through the years.","After reading this book in a college Sci Fi class at Berkeley almost 20 years ago, it remains one of my all-time favorites of any genre. It is positively amazing that it is almost 50 years old because it reads so thoroughly modern and relevant. The story grabs you right from the outset and doesn't let up. What makes &quot;Earth Abides&quot; so special is that it can be read on many different levels. While reading it for the first time, I often had to peer out the window to make sure there were still people around! Don't miss this sure bet","As a fan of non-alien, post apocalyptic novels, I sometimes struggle to find truly good books to read. Well, Earth Abides is a truly GREAT book, and you will not regret this choice. The book is well-written and unforgettable. It was written in 1949, but wears its age well. I was even able to enjoy its social perspectives toward women and race. George Stewart, like Mark Twain in Huckleberry Finn, really struggles with the social beliefs of his time, and questions both racism and sexism without overpowering his remarkable story of survival.I'm an avid reader. I especially like realistic science fiction, but don't limit myself to the genre. I rank Earth Abides in the top 5 of ALL the books I have ever read.","Earth Abides, written in 1949, tells the story of the fall of civilization from deadly disease and its \"rebirth\". It is actually three books in one: the disintegration of the world, the establishment of a new collective culture, and the moral weights of leadership. I initially read it as a post-apocalyptic novel and was rewarded with a philosophical treatise on the loss of a way of life and the dangers of man oversimplifying himself. The development of the tiny band's subsequent generations is more terrifying than a plague wiping out the planet. It is a story of 'what man wrought' but not in the way one anticipates. Originally classified a \"science fiction\" novel, now, with time, it must be categorized as literature.","\"Between the plan and the fulfillment lies always the hazard. Between the plan and the fulfillment stands always the frail barrier of a human life\" - George R. StewartIsherwood \"Ish\" Williams is one of the last people on Earth! How will he survive, how can he go on?\"Earth Abides\" is a book that I have owned for quite awhile & a book that I have always planned to read next, but never did. Finally I read the book and I was not only thoroughly impressed, I was in awe of George R. Stewart's ideas about how it would all end and how we could possibly go on.I'm amazed at the amount of the poor reviews for this book, I think most people are expecting moreI Am Legendtype material. This book is not that at all, there is some violence, not alot, there are no zombies, only people & animals. Many reviewers state that Ish should have done this, he shouldn't have done that, forgetting that this masterpiece was written in 1949. The book is so far ahead of it's time, it's baffling to me how George R. Stewart came up with some of these things. Would it be much different it this novel was written today, well obviously yes.Stewart's theory of how each animal will thrive before it's numbers level off really made me think. The everyday things that you never give a second thought, Stewart brings them to the front and makes you think, what do we do now, how do we get past this?If you like to read post-apocalyptic novels, if you've readThe Roadand enjoyed it, read \"Earth Abides\"This is the road that no man finishes traveling. Men come and go, but Earth abides!Enjoy~","How anyone could rate this book poorly is beyond comprehension. This is a well written, fascinating study on human thought and action. As much a intellectual simulation as a study of the time and attitudes of that time in which it was written.","George Stewart's \"Earth Abides\" is a tale of the end of the world by way of a plague that handles the subject in a way much different that similar tales. More thoughtful, deliberate and slow than I expected. More than anything it is a look at how man's conquering of mother nature is temporary at best. Take away man, and the Earth's memory of man will be soon forgotten. At the same time, it deals with civilization - what are the fundamentals of civilization, what keeps people together, and what prompted the creation of tribes, religion, superstition, and war.Without question, I enjoyed this a lot. One of the better takes on a post-apocalyptic scenario I have read to date. No Mad Max BS, no metaphysical The Stand mumbo jumbo, no b-grade nonsense ala The Postman, just pure introspection regarding how mankind would move on, and more importantly, how the Earth would move along as if we were never thereMandatory reading.","Some interesting ideas explored in this novel, such as the true worth, or otherwise of what we today term 'education'. Stewart asks the reader to question the validity of many of our modern values upon which today's civilization is based as well as pointing out how swiftly these would erode in the aftermath of some holocast. I am not sure if Ish made the correct decision when he completely abandoned the school for the children. There was only the one chance to pass on the knowledge of reading and the communication value it holds, and once lost it would be gone for ever. Also, the future survival of 'The Tribe' would have benefited enormously if future generations had access to much of the knowledge contained in the library.Another interesting point was how &quot;The Tribe', or rather 4 of its members, so quickly decided on the death penalty for Charlie.There appeared to be a complete lack of any real emotions in any of the characters. This was particularly noticable at the start of the novel when Ish looses not only all his friends, but his family also. There seemed no grieving process, and although he was certainly sad at the loss of Joey and Em, I did not feel his pain.Stewart could have written a far longer novel without loosing my interest and much more could have been included. The 'Quick Years' passed too quickly for me and I could have handled a few more hundred pages without loosing interest.Altogether an excellent read. We are asked to question so much of what we today hold as important. He questions our complacency, which is always a good thing.","Do you know the joyous feeling you get when you just happen upon a book quite by accident, read just a few chapters of it, and realize that it will be of great signifiance to you? Well, that was my experience with this book! I can't believe that I was not introduced to this book before now. It is with some sadness that I just completed reading it.My degree of connection with the main character, Isherwood Williams (Ish), astounded me; therefore, I must admit that my reaction to this book is quite subjective. It as is though the author looked into my mind and wrote a book about me in a post-apocalyptic world, including my greatest virtues and worst vices. The descriptions of the thoughts, triumphs, failings, joys, and frustrations experienced by the main character are poignantly honest and real. Metaphorically, this story seems to describe, with regard to many things, my existence in this, our so-far non-apocalyptic, world. For example, I find that I constantly struggle to define what I think to be the appropriate balance of individuality and community/state in our world. If you are one who consciously ponders such things or pursues a study of philosophy, I believe that you will view this book as a masterpiece. It just made my top 10, that is sure.I feel that I have gained much in my reading of this book. Mostly, I come away from this reading experience with a renewed feeling of peace and a reassurance in myself and the human spirit. I will no longer, I think, become quite so frustrated with regard to certain things or people in this world.&quot;Am I happy? Yes, I am happy. Things are as they are, and I am part of them.&quot; - Jack, great grandson of Isherwood Williams (Ish), the Last American.","This really great fictional accounting, by G.R. Stewart, of what our future might be, remains my favorite of the genre. I've just reread it for perhaps the third or fourth time - with some years in between. And although just a little dated it retains the vitality of adventure, promise and hope within a story of global tragedy. Considering current media hype about a possible Bird Flu pandemic this is an enlightening and enjoyable reading experience.","George R. Stewart's &quot;Earth Abides&quot; was written in 1949, so of course there are some anachronisms that occasionally jolt the reader. The Giants play at the Polo Grounds and the Dodgers at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. There are no interstate highways and radios all have vacuum tubes.These minor historical curiosities aside, what truly amazes is the timeless of Stewart's story. How many science fiction novels from 1949 still rate the glowing reviews of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; you will find here? By comparison so many modern sci-fi stories are formulaic, written with short, choppy sentences, shallow characters, and action sequences ready made for transfer to the screen.Stewart's vision of the future, where education and especially reading, slowly fad away after an apocalypse applies more to today's world than that of his own. His characters have little ability to bring back the technological remnants of the dead world, and truly, if 99% of the people on the planet were to disappear how many of us have the skills to keep the power going, the water flowing, and automobiles running decades after the disaster? His characters adapt to their environment in the most natural way.In the nearly four decades I have been reading books this is one of a handful that has made a memorable impression and which I consistently continue to recommend.","Earth Abides is a fantastic book. When I noticed it was written in 1949 I was a bit concerned, but it was not dated at all. The simple synopsis of the story is that everyone on the planet dies in a plague, except for a few hundred people. The story follows Ish, who was a ecologist or something and is now forced into the role of designing plans for rebuilding civilization. Along with a few others he meets and adds to his community, the book follows Ish's &quot;tribe&quot; for about 60 years. During that time the human build infrastructure deteriorates along with Ish's hopes of quickly restoring an active civilization. I would like to especially credit Stewart for including two long chapters he calls &quot;Quick Years&quot;, where he moves ahead 10 or 20 years. A less confident author would fill that 20 years with the same nonsense over and over making this a much slower and longer book.","It is a mystery how anyone could read this book and feel it is poorly written. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is a heart-breaking, gut wrenching , beautifully written novel. The only fault I had was its' length. I wanted it to go on and on. That is the highest praise I can give any book. Stephen King's Stand is a very good novel, too, but doesnt hit the emotional chords as well as this one does.","&quot;Earth Abides&quot; deals with the collapse of society after a plague has killed nearly everyone in the world. Isherwood (Ish) Williams was in the mountains when this happened, so he was spared the trauma of seeing everyone die around him.&quot;Earth Abides&quot; is probably one of the more realistic apocalypse books. A plague is tidier and more envionmentally friendly than a nuclear holocaust so the world was quite lucky. The survivors who band together are just ordinary people. No military strategists, scientific experts or specialists. No engineers or architects. They have to cope with life in a world without medical services, police, government, or farmers.Over the years, 20th century life is slipping away and Ish's tribe can't bring any of it back. Decades later San Francisco is a jungle and Ish is the last of the old race. The new race are illiterate hunters but they are also a more decent people. They treat the animals as equals, they are happier and have none of the hangups that affected 20th century society before the plague. They'll never know how to split the atom, build missiles, or damage the ozone layer.Because history tends to go round in circles I don't think civilization really died after the plague. It just went to sleep. One day it will come back, maybe in a few centuries. Something new and better. A rejuvinated world, fresh and clean.&quot;Earth Abides&quot; was a good book. It probably wouldn't work as a movie, though. Not after the criticism that &quot;The Postman&quot; got. But I thought Kevin Bacon would be good as Ish. I'm not sure who would play the other characters.","I was really looking forward to this book, and was left feeling really disappointed. I have now read all of what I consider the \"big-4\" of 50's PA literature, I found Alas Babylon and \"Canticle for Leibowicz\" excellent, \"on the beach\" overly depressing and unrealistic (but I was 16 when I read it so my opinion might have changed by now) but Earth Abides left me un-impressed.I thought the central character was so devoid of likeability and compassion it made him entirely unrealistic, in fact he came across as some sort of post-apocalyptic Daily Mail reader who spend a significant proportion of the first part of the book traversing America deciding if anyone was \"good-enough\" to share his planned new civilisation, but found the survivors too emotional, too provincial, too poor, too black, too uneducated etc etc. \"Ish\" would have benefited from a good punch in the face, and the only character who might have offered to give him one was executed for bragging about his carnal adventures whilst drunk.His long suffering and dignified wife Em, also had to make the startling confession that she was of mixed race and was beside herself with gratitude that Ish didn't then and there string her up from a nearby tree (like Charlie).The pace of the story is languid and the descriptions interesting, but for me, the entire book was held back by the attitudes and small mindedness of the central character.I am generally not a fan of the \"marauding biker gangs\" type PA style but in this case, if the Toecutter had rocked up at Ishs' house and decapitated him with some sort of boomerang, then the community and post-plague America would have been done a great service.Sadly, the attitudes of Ish probably just reflected those extant in America in the 50's but that means that the story has dated particularly badly, and although Alas Babylon also suffers from the same malady, the central character in that book is much more human and flawed and this makes that book a more engaging read.I am currently reading \"Summer of the Apocalypse\" which borrows some elements from Earth Abides, but is a much better fit for me in terms of what I like in PA books.","I first read this book when I was twelve and lived very near Berkeley. It was the first time I had seen the word \"ecologist\". The book has stayed with me for the last 59 years. I have reread it many times, and have used it as a basis for many earth sciences classes. While it is in a sense, apocalyptic, it is not preachy, or sensational, but a gentle, detailed reminder that in this day of climate change, it is not earth that is in danger, but our own and related species. That Ish, the protagonist , is an observer rather than a charismatic leader, gives us, as readers, a chance to observe with him the deeply meaningful theme that, \"men come and go, but Earth abides. One of my all time favorite reads.","Man has passed and what remains are the things built to sustain us; our cities, bridges, highways, grocery stores, street signs, power plants and dams, parked cars and canned peaches. These things do not simply disappear. Yet with enough time much will be lost to the weeds, the earth will take it back and intermingle our fallen silver coins with the pebbles of the riverbank.***As one of the founding novels of apocalyptic fiction, \"Earth Abides\" is not only a tale of what comes after global disaster but what is means to be human in the simplest and grandest sense. Although written in 1949, it continues to be praised decades later and for good reason, it is a captivating book that reaches beyond the genre of science fiction and into the heart of humanity. On the surface, \"Earth Abides\" is the tale of Isherwood Williams' survival yet it such an expansive novel that the tale of one man becomes that of all mankind.In our contemporary world we tend to forget (or deny) that individuals are entangled within society for better or worse, but the truth is that we cannot be separate from our culture, our history, and our way of life. I found this novel to be a mindful mediation on what it means to be a part of a community and a sort of Anthropological study of civilization.I was surprised and actually relived to find there were no zombies, no riots, no constant struggle to fight hordes of panic stricken survivors, but a rather calm and quiet end to the human race as it once existed. To be sure it seemed quaint; this notion of a peaceful ending in spite of sudden pandemic and inevitable death, but it was surprisingly optimistic without being wholly nave. Many people would likely continue to follow the rules of society even without the enforcers of law for a while, but with time, these things would matter less and less. And despite many who choose to do no harm to their neighbors, there will always be some men who pose a danger to his peers in malice or self-preservation.","I was surprised how well \"Earth Abides\" held up as a post-apocalyptic novel being read in 2010, even though it was published in 1949 - over 60+ years ago. It was remarkably current, in my opinion. Yes, there were a few politically incorrect/outdated views on women, race and retardation - based on this day and age. But if you read it based on the reality of 1949, some of the ideas put forward by Stewart were actually ahead of his time.This novel is not an action packed, shoot em up, zombies control the earth PA novel. It is a character study on how different people or small groups of people react or shut down in a disaster. And the way they act and react may not be what we would consider to be the best - for the individuals involved or for the salvation of mankind. But I can actually see the events in \"Earth Abides\" happening. Scary to think of but imaginable. This book stands the test of time.","I ordered the audio book based on an article that called it \"one of the best post-apocalyptic novels\". I expected a plot that would detail the heroic efforts of the protagonist to survive and thrive in the world after most of the human population dies. I did not expect the protagonist and his band of survivors to do the obvious - to be scavengers upon the bones of civilization, and to give up or not even try to keep or advance civilization's progress up to that point. The slow realization that the path of least resistance would be the course of action was one of the most depressing and poignant moments I have had in considering the future of humans on this planet. I felt I was personally witnessing the de-evolution of mankind.Of particular interest to me was that the author, George R. Stewart, chose to use a virus as the vehicle that killed most of the inhabitants, not the obvious nuclear holocaust. The fact that atomic bombs were capable of killing off the bulk of mankind was still very fresh in the minds of his readers in the late 1940's. Viruses as agents of destruction seem to be one of the very real swords hanging over our heads today, making us relate to this book even more.","George Stewart's \"Earth Abides\" is regarded as a classic of the overcrowded post-apocalyptic genre, and for good reason. But the book achieved classic status only because its post-apocalyptic setting is a secondary feature of the narrative.Stewart didn't write an adventure story about a loner/survivor who must fend off attacks from marauding mutants. In fact, given the context, there is surprisingly little action at all.Instead, \"Earth Abides\" puts you inside the mind of the main character, Ish, for an extended meditation on the nature, specifically the frailty, of human existence.Stewart ranges far and wide, if not deeply, into an astonishing array of issues, from the personal to the universal. That said, there is a core idea, which the title expresses in part:Earth abides. The dude does not.It is a pagan formulation: Earth 1, Humanity 0. And while I would put it another way, I'm at least grateful that Stewart made me think. Who needs marauding mutants?","This book has been torpedoed by some readers because it isn't \"The Stand.\" While \"the Stand,\" is one of my favorite books, what happens after the world is wiped out by plague becomes highly supernatural. Much as I like that, Stewart shows a much more realistic side of what would happen to whatever few survivors this world might have if a plague took most of us out of circulation. Any possible community would be small, and battle dogs, ants, rats, diseases, and the like. The characters here are never to be forgotten--Ish, Em, Joey and Charlie above all, and the plot stays with you long after the book is finished. I read it in the '80s when I worked on a book assembly line. Imagine my delight that it is now available again. This is up there with \"Alas Babylon,\" and just a bit less depressing than \"On the Beach.\"","If almost all the people in the world were dead, and you had to spend your life with an egotistical, chauvanistic, racist white guy with absolutely no redeeming qualities you'll love this. Archie Bunker would have loved this guy. I, did not.Old does not have to be disfunctional.","Stewart's Earth Abides has long been considered a classic in the sci-fi genre and a classic apocalyptic novel (it even helped to inspire Stephen King's The Stand). And it is no wonder why. Stewart has a highly believable, excellently written story here. Though it does lose something in the the third part of the book, when Ish is an old man. One you should definately pick up.","I think I first read this book when I was about fourteen, and it made a powerful impression on me then, so much so that I could still remember almost the entire story some forty years later. But, given that youthful impressions are sometimes not all that accurate, I decided to re-read this and see if it is really as good as my memory said. It is.The scenario is simple: what would happen if a new virus suddenly wipes out almost everyone? And this is no ordinary disease, as the fatality rate is incredibly high, leaving (at most) perhaps one person in 100,000 alive. With this as a starting point, Stewart looks at his new world though the eyes of Isherwood Williams, who is something of a loner, intellectual in outlook, an observer, rather than a doer. This outlook stands him in good stead in the immediate aftermath of the great die-off, as it gives him a reason to live, to observe just how the Earth will react to the sudden removal of that pesky, environment-changing species called man. And reaction there is: ants, rats, dogs, cattle, cats, wheat, corn - each has its fortunes drastically impacted. Many of these changes are detailed in some interstitial material that is told from an omniscient viewpoint, very reminiscent of the similar technique Steinbeck used in The Grapes of Wrath, and perhaps these sections are just as powerful as Steinbeck's, though they don't have quite the great prose-poetry that Steinbeck had. By detailing these changes in this manner, Stewart makes his scenario both highly believable and very immediate.But Stewart's main focus is what happens to the very few people that are left. Ish eventually finds some other survivors, most especially the lady who will become his wife, Em, and here we find some buried social commentary that probably made this book quite controversial when it was first published in 1949, as Em is not white, a point made very subtly and never directly stated, as one of the clear messages here is that race, looked at from the standpoint of long-term survivability, is of absolutely no consequence.Another point of departure for this work from the standard disaster scenario is that there is no world-saving hero; mankind cannot get back on its feet in short order and re-establish civilization, and that the great majority of survivors would necessarily live off the leavings of the old civilization, for the simple reason that it is far easier to open a can of tomatoes than grow your own. That this same attitude of doing the minimum to survive would carry over into other aspects of post-disaster living, so that there would be little or no effort to teach children how to read or fix some of civilization's infrastructure as it slowly fails, such as electrical power or water supplies, is perhaps a debatable point, but Stewart's depiction makes this very logical and believable. Right alongside of this portrayed attitude is what do people do when there no longer is any `law': what is right and wrong and how do people cope with actions by some that threaten the survivability of the Tribe? The answer Stewart shows to this problem may disturb some people, but it strikes at the heart of the whole concept of `for the good of the many' and what personal moral responsibility is.Some have commented that this book is `dated', and there is some of this, as tube radios and phonograph turntables show just where technology was at the time of publication, but any serious reader will quickly realize that the specifics of the technology are immaterial to the thrust of this work. And perhaps somewhat ironically, there is one item detailed here that is as current as tomorrow's headlines, when Ish pulls down a book from the University shelves which details imminent climate change (keep in mind when this written!) and decides that this, too, is irrelevant to his current needs - the climate will be whatever it is, and mankind will just have to live with it.The last section of this book paints a very powerful picture of just how gods, legends, and social mores become ingrained in a society. Perhaps it's not the prettiest picture of where mankind is headed or how well he'll deal with problems, but it is remarkably plausible and will produce strong feelings of melancholy, despair, and (perhaps) subdued pride.A remarkable work which avoids just about all the pitfalls of typical post-apocalyptic works, and has a great deal to say about just what makes man man and what is truly relevant to the daily business of living.---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)","A virus wipes out 99.9% of the population, leaving the few stragglers left to figure out how to survive, organize (or not), etc. Don't be fooled into thinking that because this book was published in 1949 that it somehow won't be 'with it'. It's pretty well thought out, both in terms of what happens to the people AND everything else (dogs, cats, cattle, crops - things which other authors might leave out entirely), and in a departure (which I won't reveal here) from the usual 'we'll survive and things will eventually return to normalcy' plot so often present in this type of book.","Stewart's novel begins with a science fiction premised used by Stephen King in The Stand -- a virus quickly wipes out most of the world's population -- but from that point on, the two books (and others that have used this idea) are completely dissimilar. Stewart has little interest in the plague itself, and it is covered in a short part of the book. Rather, his interest is in how people react to being deprived of modern civilization. For years, his characters try to keep things going by teaching their children to read, and keeping memories of the old world alive. However, the drastically changed circumstances of their children's lives make this impossible, and the small group of survivors descend to a hunter-gatherer civilization.Stewart also addresses the question of what would ordinary people do who find themselves deprived of the protections of the law, and thus having to make their own difficult choices.Those who read this book expecting a typical science fiction novel will be disappointed. Stewart uses science fiction themes to explore significant issues in much the same way that George Orwell did in 1984. An excellent novel.","Apparently many of the reader-reviewers are science fiction or horror fans and thus compare Stewart's novel with that genre. Those readers are not likely to appreciate the ideas expressed in &quot;Earth Abides&quot;. Stewart was one of the first fiction writers to deal with ecology and human's place in the balance of nature and his extrapolations from anthropological thought of that period (1940's) are exceptional. It seems that many of the readers, without realizing it, got so caught up in the novel that they criticise the protagonist's character flaws as though he were a &quot;real&quot; human wanting him to be &quot;more insightful&quot; and less of a pedantic man. Those flaws appear to make him more authentic.Although classified as science fiction, the term speculative fiction is a better fit. It is interesting that the period of time covered, approximately 1948, to the present day, and although it was written in the late 1940's, it is still fresh today. Looking back, if there had been a catastrophe at that time, we would very likely today be at the point where the novel ends. A hundred years from now the novel is likely to be a classic and hopefully be on a shelf not labeled &quot;Science Fiction.&quot;","I know this is considered a classic, but, in my opinion, it does not pass the test of time. None of the characters, including the narrator, Ish, is engaging, and the passivity of the survivors is hard to accept. I don't need zombies to make PA fiction exciting, but reading about survivors who basically just live as if nothing has changed, happy to eat canned food is dull and depressing.","Well what can I say - if you want a book that will make you think about it not only whilst you are reading it but for a long time afterwards, then this is the book for you. The story is great and I thought Ish's character was great too - I know some people didn't like him (including my husband) - but I think that is just the point. He is a young man with little experience who thinks he knows everything because he has been to university, but really doesn't know that much at all. Sure he's not perfect but who is! He does the best he can and whilst we may not always agree, at least he is a believeable character. It has been a long time since I have read a book and thought \"wow\" when I was reading it and wanted to debate it for hours afterwards. The only other memorable books I can think of are \"Wild Swans\", \"Watership Down\" and \"Day of the Triffids\". This beats all of them! I followed \"Earth Abides\" with \"Timescape\" - which made me appreciate even more just how good \"Earth Abides\" really is.","\"...and the government of the United States of America is herewith suspended, except in the District of Columbia, as of the emergency...\"With those ominous words begins a classic tale of the end of human civilization. \"Ish\" (a graduate student whose given name is Isherwood Williams) is the barely tolerable protagonist who survives a rattlesnake bite (and possibly some strange infection) only to leave the forest and find a world of ghost towns. As Ish discovers, while he was in seclusion, engaged in fieldwork for his thesis, a virulent plague broke out worldwide and eliminated virtually every other human being from the face of the earth. Instead of descending into a drunken madness like one of the few survivors he meets, Ish roadtrips across the country looking for a vestige of the learned civilization he remembers. Alas, his quest comes up empty-handed, for, as he discovers, not many people have survived the plague, and those who did are (understandably) not too interested in higher education or high culture, preferring instead to focus on subsistence and maintaining their sanity. Along the way he picks up a loyal friend in the form of a dog, and finally returns to the Bay Area of California, where he meets a group of survivors and sets out to re-establish some kind of human community. In the second half of the novel, we follow the growth of this community and are faced with Ish's growing apprehension about humanity's future. Much to his chagrin, the aspects of civilization he prizes so much--music and art appreciation, reading and literature, mathematics and philosophy, etc.--seem to have no place in this new world where humans are once again a part of the natural order and not her proud conquerors.While the novel itself is quite a good read, filled with interesting speculative insights into human life after the collapse of modern civilization, Ish provides an aggravating example of the 1940s American white male ivory tower academic (his character's qualities definitely date the novel). When he encounters black survivors in the South, he muses about the possibilities of exploiting them and establishing his own little fiefdom. He continually considers his cohorts in the new community as his intellectual inferiors, even as they manage to carve out a new life in the face of this overwhelming calamity while he reads his books. That he spends more time worrying about the restoration of high civilization than about the very real issues of day-to-day survival that they face was also incredibly infuriating. Ish is at his most distasteful when he contemplates his son Joey, a boy whose sole worth seems to be the fact that he is bright and can read. Somehow, though, in spite of all his character flaws, Isherwood Williams ' arrogance and detachment are finally overcome by his circumstances, and he has, if not a complete change of heart, then at least an acceptance of the reality that \"men go and come, but earth abides.\"","This post apocalyptic book starts off strong with somewhat of a new twist on the traditional post-collapse civilization, as told by one graduate student and his struggle with a life after modern conveniences are gone. He is an observer kept alive as the second wave of deaths wash over the world by a mere need to observe and discover. I'll never forget reading as if with him while he waited for electric power to finally fail. The lights dim slightly and with this realization he waits up as a long time friend passes into oblivion. Several of the concepts are quite dated (the copy I read was re-released in the 70s but still referred to household items long since out of date and probably belonged in the original publication from '49).The main character is faced as being the only intellectual left in a small band of survivors he later deems \"The Tribe.\" This is the placement of the majority of the book and faces the questions of what humans would do with so much time on their hands? How they would adapt to a life with everything they need laying about them, but no deadlines to push them to reestablish a civilized world? It also conicals several things other books leave out, such as the adoption of odd superstitions about \"Americans\" by children who have never known a life with organized government or life outside of their small Tribe. I would give this part of the book a higher score, but the later portion fell short of my expectations and the standards set by the rest of the work.As the book continued it became quite redundant and predictable, and though I had high hopes the book would somehow redeem itself and return to it's previous glory, I was left disappointed. If you are looking for a book with a strong resolution upon completion, this is not a book for you. While I am glad I finished it (the first half was quite good), and several major problems were resolved, a larger picture of what would happen with the passing of the main character was left unsaid (though a general idea was obvious and alluded to several times). This portion of the book brought down the overall rating I could give.I would recommend this book as an easy read with an interesting take on the traditional end-of-the-world concept.","Earth Abides from George R Stewart is a good book about what would happen if suddenly the entire world population, except for a few, would die from a disease. As such, the book is remarkable as one of the first post-apocalyptic novels in existence (dating from 1949). And it is a very well thought through one too. Aiming for realism, exploring the various effects and problems the survivors would face, it renders the many successive post-apocalyptic stories as merely unrealistic popcorn stories. However, don't expect the story to \"draw you in\". The events are typically kind of boring, and even though there is a distinct set of characters, they never really develop. Further, the writing style is not always really gripping, but rather unexciting. Also the dated moral reflections might be a let down for some, but I suppose that is mainly caused by the time the book is written.The book details a number of time periods: just after the epidemic, 5 years later, 20 years later, and 50 or 60 years later. The time in between is sketched very roughly. The story centers on Ish, a survivor of the mysterious epidemic. Ish is an academic, working on his (PhD?) thesis in Biology. We learn later that if the epidemic would not have struck that Ish would probably end up as a professor (like the writer). Ish is, apparently, the only 'thinker' left on the world, and all the people he meets are about (or under) average on IQ and ideas, but not necessarily in other practical matters. Ish is an observer, not really a natural leader, and he does his best to plan a safe way for the remaining people towards a new civilization. However, it becomes clear, that even though Ish knows a lot and has many skills, that a lot of work and ideas hardly influence the people in his community and that he fails on many great planned things, even though he also has some unexpected success with small but eventually rather important things.The good part of the book, what makes it a classic, is that it explores most issues you can think off about what would happen if such an epidemic would occur. It explores the psychological effect in the beginning, the scavenging of the stores for existing goods, the mingling of very different average people in a group, the effect on the rest of the ecology by the sudden disappearance of men, the effect of aging on materials, infrastructure and goods, the way the average people would face these changes, (small) group interactions, diseases, unnecessary skills (e.g. reading), the automatic development of groups of people, and the limited effect of the ideas of the intellectual few (maybe dealing with some of the writer's own frustrations). And probably I forgot a few explored ideas as well.However, the book is not perfect, and not a classic in the sense of some Heinlein, Clarke or Asimovs that I have read. Some flaws: characters are rather stereotypical, the main character seems to be a bit thick and single minded at many points (irritating sometimes), all characters have a great lack of initiative and many times things just stay as they are, but also not all ideas are fully (satisfyingly) worked out. Also some logical plot holes exist, and timescales of things happening seem to be bended a bit to fit with the lifetime of the main character.However, in spite of the many small flaws I shortly pointed out, I can still recommend the book. It is not for everyone, and certainly not for people that look for a really exciting story, but the discussed ideas and the thoroughness in which many of those are explored (making it a kind of hard-scifi book), combined with the historical value of this book as a very early post-apocalyptic book make this book really valuable and read-worthy. If you are not immediately letdown by its flaws and if you are interested in idea-books and speculative fiction, I would certainly give this one a try.","Some good ideas. Some interesting speculations on the nature of man and society. Some interesting predictions of how the earth would respond to a die-off of humans. Ruined by needless wordiness, 2 dimensional characters and very little to say of a philosophical nature. A bore and a disappointment. Skimmed the last 100 pages.","Glowing reviews, word of mouth praise and the subject matter all left me eager to read Earth Abides. Unfortunately this book fell far short of my expectations. The premise of a global plague is truly fascinating (and frightening), especially in light of recent world events, but the story drags on in such a depressing and mundane fashion that reading the book became a chore rather than an adventure. The lead character's over inflated opinion of himself is so prevalent through out the book that it prevents any character development on the part of any other survivors. Over 300 pages and you barely get to know any of them. That would not have mattered so much if the author had done a better job of portraying the aftermath of the plague. Too little attention was paid to what would happen to the local environment. Impacts are generally glossed over in short, simplistic passages. Survival was no more difficult than raiding the local grocery store and opening a can of beans, even after 20 years. I never felt the horror and struggle for survival that one would expect with such a global catstrophe. The technology in the book is certainly dated but I didn't find that a distraction. This is not an enjoyable read. Better classics on man wiping himself out include \"On the Beach\" and \"Alas, Babylon\". For a more up to date adventure try \"Ill Wind\" by Anderson & Beason.","I love to read, so there are very few books I don't finish. I usually slog through even the bad ones. Here's my take on this book. I was looking for a novel about how people came up with creative ideas about how to survive in a world after civilization is wiped out. This book dealt with that facet somewhat in the first hundred pages. After that most of the book deals with moral issues. \"What are the moral or ethical responsibilities of survivors\" is the main theme of the rest of the book. After an ok start, the whole rest of the book seemed preachy and a little like the author was trying to coerce me into agreeing with his point of view. Three-quarters of the way through the book I quit reading, because there were no characters I was interested in enough to care what happened to them.","Written by a self-righteous professor of English Lit from Berkeley. The authors preconceived notions about the ignorance of rest of us comes across pretty clearly, as his protagonist constantly judges everyone based on his perception of their intelligence. Book was very poorly researched....the protagonist and his children live mostly off of 20-30 year old canned food for most of the book (something that would probably kill you). He fixes up a jeep and then fills it with 20 year old gasoline (which is unusable a year or two after its refined). He raises his offspring in total ignorance...his greatest achievement being to teach them how to make a bow and start a fire (teaching them to read was apparently not important). Worse end of the world book I've ever read.","The plot in Earth Abides is very simple. It is basically the ongoing struggle one would face in creating a perfect society. The setting is in San Francisco, California after a great disease has struck and wiped out 99% of the human population. The main character is a survivor named Ish. He survived the disease an interesting way, and then sets out to build a new society. Through his trials and errors you find out the complexity to people and modern society. You understand the restraints that society has on a person, even if it is not present. For example alcohol is a big part in the novel. Without anyone to stop them, people begin to drink themselves to death.Earth Abides' plot is thin, and dragged to eternity and back. The author spends the majority of the second half of the book reasoning about worthless issues. They were worthless because they do not apply to the main theme of survival. This makes you very confused, as the book is already hard to follow. He also spends a good deal of pages with Ish's inner thoughts, which are basically a bunch of complex nonsense. It is very hard to put your self in his place, and understand his thoughts. He becomes so paranoid with every decision he makes, that he becomes overly analytical.This book could possibly be amusing to very patient adults. It has close to zero action, and does not keep you turning pages. In reality it is the exact opposite, it puts you to sleep. Anyone who likes a book that keeps you interested, Earth Abides is not for you. The only person I would recommend this book to, would be an insomniac who needs to find a way to get to sleep.","Not really SiFi. Fiction and Apocalyptic yes, but after a very few chapters to grab your interest, author drifts off into non-related daydreaming, repetition and his personal philosophy on various character's lives. I'm betting that he was a self proclaimed authority and certainly a pipe smoker.No science, little innovation, but it goes on and on. You keep hoping it will get better, but unfortunately, it doesn't. How it won any award remains a mystery to me. If you are looking for an exciting science fiction work, sorry, but this isn't it.","Having loved this story 20 years ago as a teenager, it pains me now to find that it is surely the worst novel on my bookshelves. All the characters are two-dimensional. The dialogue is uniformly stiff and amateurish. The story's hero is arrogant, aloof and dismissive of anyone he perceives as inferior. Since he actually perceives *everyone* as inferior, the book quickly becomes very tiresome. Perhaps the saddest aspect of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that the story is clearly and shockingly the fantasy of someone who dreamed of existing in a world without people, or at most with just a thin sprinkling of simple folks over whom he could rule as their intellectual master. &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is a truly awful book.","I love a good post-apoc book, but this one just wasn't that great. Other than the narrator, the male characters aren't very well developed and the female characters were even worse. The jumps in time threw me off and the overall plot just didn't grab me.","I'm surprised so many people rated this book so highly. It's hideously dated, both in language, and in writing style. Not even in the same ballpark as something like The Stand. It was interesting to think about what path civilization would take without a unifying threat after an apocalypse, but the writing just ruined it for me. No great character development at any point, a lot of cliches and brushed over details. It kept me reading, barely, mostly to see if it went anywhere. Pretty disappointing though.","I am a fan of similar themed books. But this one just does nothing for me. The only interesting aspect is the (almost consuming) focus on how other animals in the biosphere react to the human population crashing down.But that doesn't make up for these huge flaws:1) The interpersonal aspects are awful.People just don't relate to each other the way the author describes.2) Dominated bi sudo-Christian bible verse that gets added in to say something meaningful is happening3) The storyline takes place so long ago that it is hard to see it as anything but a time-piece.4) Racist, sexist views embedded very deep in the assumptions5) Overall a very boring story line. No emotional growth in the characters and no growth in the community or plot. Just terrible, really.","This is one of my favorite books. Written in 1949, it's remarkably contemporary and accessible. I love the references to hifi. It seems to me more of a work of philosophy; a meditation on humanity, relationships, change and civilization, which is precisely why it's so timeless. It's also something of a love story and there is a gentle tenderness pervades the entire story. Ish is a wonderful character. As the world is completely and unalterably transformed around him, he strives for continuity and permanence. In the end, his striving is for naught, he's failed. But there is no bitterness and remorse but an acceptance of the world around him and the love that expressed itself in his relationships with others. The story wasn't anything like I thought it would be, much better.","Earth Abides was written by George Stewart and released in 1949. The story follows the main character Ish, short for Isherwood, as he is one of the few people to survive a pandemic that kills the majority of the human population. Ish has an interesting perspective on the incident as he has an academic background and tends to view events through in a very historical, geographical way. Ecology and population dynamics are frequently discussed throughout the story. Stewart explores population fluctuations in nature in comparison to the die off of humans. Much of the story takes place in California, near San Francisco and follows Ish through most of his life following the outbreak. On a practical level, this book contains more generalized preparation information such as the durability of canned food, hunting and gathering methods and the continuation of life without public water and electricity. While Earth Abides is certainly entertaining, it also provides a very unique perspective on the end of civilization and it will leave you with some very interesting ideas for your consideration.","I read Earth Abides months ago, and I still find myself thinking about it often. Some of the reviews I read before I read the book mentioned the book remaining with the reader for years and years; I didn't expect that to be the case for me, but now I think it will. We take so much for granted, both things and people, but what would we do if life as we know it basically vanished? How would we manage alone? What abilities would we need which we don't have now? So much to think about!","This book is not so much about the end of the world itself; instead, it uses the end of the world - the end of most of mankind, anyway - as a plot device to explore how a new, small, totally contained society would develop out of the leavings of the old one. This task it accomplishes quite well; the growth of the Tribe in San Francisco and their mythological beliefs, traditions, and practices is fascinating, if a little slow-moving in several parts. But because societal development is the primary concern of the novel, the little details are simply glossed over, and there are so many technical errors or things left unexplained that it had a tendency to lift me out of the story and re-engage my disbelief. For instance, most of mankind is wiped out by a mysterious, very viral disease, but it's never explained what the disease is, where it came from, or why some people are immune. In fact, the main character of the book comes down out of the hills after it's all over, having no idea what was going on the \"civilized\" world, but he shows a total lack of curiosity about what happened to everybody that I found unbelievable. And when several survivors get together, they never discuss where they were or what happened to them when the Great Disaster (as it's called in the book) went down, which I think goes totally against human nature. And the survivors continue to live off the leavings for forty or more years afterward, eating canned food that must have long since gone bad and even smoking cigarettes that had to have been unsmokeable after at least a year. They never bother to start even a rudimentary garden - an idea which I think would have occurred to just about anybody - but somehow manage to live in nearly perfect health until old age without eating any fresh fruits or vegetables. Again, I understand that these details weren't important to the author, but they were important to me, and so these little problems served to disrupt what was otherwise a well-written, intriguing take on the old end-of-the-world plot.","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it.

The internal debate and conflict and the final resolution are wonderful. The characters are personable and easy to relate to. More importantly, in the time of the H1N1 virus and other diseases, a harsh and jolting wake-up call to humanity and civilization. Worth every cent.","This book is amazing in that it was written so long ago (1949). I have had dreams for as long as I can remember that resemble this story, but I only read it this year. It's a quick read but one must pay attention to keep up. Some things that were not accomplished by the people are disappointing, but since technology has changed the way we live in the last 60 years so greatly, who's to say what he would rewrite today. Overall I really liked it. I started reading this at a friend's house and just had to buy to reread again.","One of the best realistic future novels I have read, I enjoyed reading it many years ago,and reading it again was just as enjoyable, couldn't put it down, its not the usual science fiction story, but a realistic account of how ordinary people would react in these conditions, I highly recommend it I.M.J.","Science Fiction books are hard to remain classics given our growing understanding of science and technology. Earth Abides is an exception because it is written from the perspective of an anthropologist trying to cope with the fact that his world has been destroyed. Like many readers this book changed my life&gt; I read it in my teens, in my 20's and I guess it is time to pick it up again in my 30's.","First of all, I think D.D. Shade's analysis of today's society on Earth Abides is unsubstantiated. This book is still a great book today because it is a classic. A classic, by definition, relates to all time. The assination of JFK or MLK would not have had any greater impact on this book. This book, like Ish, will continue to stand the test of time because of it's overall classical themes. That man is the complicating variable on the planet earth. Regardless of if a man or men die, the earth abides.","I read this book in High School in the 70's in Saratoga Ca. I have a teenage daughter and I can't fathom that she is not required to read these types of books anymore. My mind constantly wandered with Ish. I dreamt of what I would do in that situation, of how I would react. Needless to say I finished the book in one weekend well ahead of my classmates, and decided to just start it all over. I recomended the book to my Mom, and she also fell in love with it. Ever since we are both on the lookout for others like it. I have read most of them (The stand, postman, alas babylon, on the beach, SWAN SONG (the best), plus mony other forgetable tales), and thank Earth Abides for my passion for these books. I wish someone would write another that is as good as this.","I have only read 2 books more than once - &quot;Earth Abides&quot; by George R Stewart, and &quot;The Quest of Aah&quot; by Alexan Farelane. If you read one book a week for 70 years, you would only have read 3,640 books in your lifetime. There are millions of books you will never be able to read - even with the Reader's Digest versions! Life is way too short to read the same book twice - except for books which can change your life. These 2 books are &quot;Life Changing&quot; books. The thing which most appeals to me with &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that our hero is just an ordinary guy and his failures are at least as impressive as his successes. He starts off with the best of intentions, becomes an unwilling leader by default, and is unable to persuade the other survivors of the need to maintain and/or restore the facilities and civilization we have come to take for granted. I KNOW that this is exactly how it would happen for me, if I was in his place! I know what I'd want to have happen, but circumstances would prevent me from being able to make it all happen.&quot;The Quest of Aah&quot; is a fantasy about the seven levels, the seven valleys, higher planes of existence, stages on the journey from Earth to Heaven, some of which any spiritual person can relate to, and anyone on a secular plane can be entertained by. The novel is presented as a memory, and is the way we hope it will be when we reach the end of our lives. It is completely different from &quot;Earth Abides&quot;, but if you like speculative fiction, then it is worth a read (or TWO!)","This is a story of the first years and the ensuing decades in the lives of the very few survivors of a natural plague. At first, there is a detailed overview of one survivor's (the main character and often narrator per se) actions in the first several months after the plague. This account of the &quot;short-term&quot; impact of a plague has been seen in other SF stories and might seem repetitous. But where this story is different, and where this novel is in a class of its own, is where the plot goes when this survivor meets others and small families begin and a community develops. The challenges which are faced by and met with by this group are detailed, yet are those involving environment and illness which are perhaps expected. But more interesting is what new moral values that arise and what &quot;holdover&quot; values (school, religion) which are attempted to be maintained, but are not or can't be embraced by the new generations which follow. The book follows the community though several decades, jumping years and stopping to go into detail about an event or time period -- but giving several pages in between as a summary to provide a good junction between sections...thus keeping the story flowing. The book ends with the natural death of the main character and seeing that the new generations have embraced a &quot;new and different&quot; value, knowledge, and societal system which is suprisingly similar to another culture -- and perhaps quietly challenging the reader to ask whether or not such the result is good or bad; and, whether or not the result was destiny, or the result of proper or improper actions of the original group of survivors. For a book written in the late 1940's, it was very, very far ahead of it's time.","After reading Earth Abides in 1968 as a 10th grader, I have read it six more times, getting a new insight of the book each time. My son (11yrs of age) has now read it twice with the same enjoyment as I have. It is a book that makes the mind think, wonder and dream the &quot; WHAT IF&quot; and &quot;COULD IT REALLY HAPPEN&quot; questions. Read it, sit back and think it. After the hair on the back of your neck sits down. Then read again next year.","I first read this book when I was 14, having borrowed it from the school library. I read it twice more in the following year. It affected me deeply and since then it has quite often crossed my mind to find the book again and re-read it. How surprised and happy I am after idly checking this website to see if that title would come up! I plan on ordering the book so I may savour every word of it all over again!","When my teacher first informed our class that we were going to read a science fiction book, my heart sank; I hated science fiction books! However, when I started to read Earth Abides, I found myself becoming engrossed in this book. The plot and the characters were something new and fresh to me in this age of quick storytelling. This was actually the first book I didn't skip to the end to read the final chapter because I was bored. It held my attention the whole time, and I was disappointed when it ended. This book reminds me of the movie &quot;Deep Impact&quot; because of the armageddon plots. I hope this is turned into a movie because it will probably be just as good as the book!","Of the novels written on this subject, I think I have read them all, this is by far the best. Most interesting is the authors attempt to regenerate civilization. Methodically covers natures reaction to the demise of man, fascinating! &quot;The Stand&quot;, &quot;Alas Babylon&quot;, &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; are all outstanding; &quot;Earth Abides&quot; stands alone!!!","I have read this book at least 6 times over the years. It ranks in my judgement with Jules Verne's, &quot;Mysterious Island&quot;, and Johann Wyss', &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot;. I have also read these books at least 7 times as well. I feel the three books could be invaluable in a survival library. They all teach survival in different circumstances!","Hello,The main character, Ish, manages to spend over 20 years mostly clutching his worry beads and freting. By the end of the book you just want to slap him and ask, \"What the hell is wrong with you\". His character is indecisive, and whiny. Over 20 years and the most productive thing he did was teach the kids how to make crappy bows and dig a well. If the characters in this book are supposed to be examples of the best way humanity could cope post SHTF we are probably all doomed. The only thing I can think of is that among the characters all had IQ's of 95 and Ish had an IQ of 100. This is more a human drama story (written in a most boring way) written around an apocalypse than it is anything else. If your interested in realistic post SHTF stories don't waist your time here. If your interested on how a small community could waste +20 years post SHTF in blissful denial with only one character recognizing the denial but doing nothing but hand-wringing about it than this is the book for you.","I found this book sitting on my mother's shelf, and after reading the description, couldn't wait to begin delving into it. The description of the book makes it seem like it's going to be very intriguing and exciting. It failed in that area. (And it's rare for me to dislike a book)In general, I really dislike the character. He shows no real or genuine emotion and is very full of himself. He is a geographer, but thinks of himself as a philospher. Which in his book, I guess that means spending a lot of time thinking about how unintelligent and hopeless everyone is. Including his wife and children. In fact, he had around five children, but you only learn about three of their names, and he spends his time only liking one of them. Since this book was written in the 40s, there are some racist and misogynistic undertones.The first two-thirds were mostly boring to me. He spends the majority of his time traveling across America and describing the scenery. When he's not doing that, he's judging people.Overall, I only like the last third of book, and that had nothing to do with the character. Instead, I enjoyed the process that could happen if civilization were lost, and the reforming of it.","I first read this book when I was 19 years old in 1974. At that time, most novels in this genre were post-nuclear where the United States and the Soviet Union were foolish enough to unleash their hellfire. This one takes a different approach. There are no mutants, no zombies, no cannibals. The end comes, as it has for so many human civilisations, from a disease that was not created in a lab but evolved from an earlier less virulent agent. Think avian influenza.It is based on the premise that any species that becomes so very numerous and lives in such dense number is vulnerable to a sweeping pandemic that kills many or almost all of the species. In this case, humans have skated by since the Black Death hit Europe and killed one third of the humans in Europe. A disease appears, but owing to the mobility of our species with rapid global transport, it manages to sweep the planet before anyone is really aware it is there.As with all pandemics, there are generally some individuals who survive either by peculiar circumstance, slight differences in genetics, or just pure luck. In Ish's case, it was more a combination of circumstance and luck. He has gone to a cabin to rest from the stresses of life and is not even aware at first that a new disease is abroad in the world. He just happens to be hiking and suffers a snake bite. The story suggests that he became ill with the disease at the same time and that venom and the disease basically worked against each other; thus, sparing his life. Once he recovers, he discovers a world empty of people. He takes a trip across the country from his starting point in California to New York City then down through the South and back to Los Angeles. This is where the first clear difference appears between this book and most all others. In this story, there are small numbers of survivors, but most are too shell-shocked and skittish to approach. So North America and presumably the rest of the planet is beginning to restore its natural balance, and the marks of humans are slowly being swallowed up.The second difference is that this story demonstrates what I think is the most realistic outcome for the survivors. Most do not have the skills to survive from nature and starve or die from injury, but some begin learning to survive. Ish is one who does. It follows him through the remainder of his life and the one or two generations that are borne from the small collection of survivors who collect around him. Unusual intelligence is not something that results from all matings. Mostly it is average intelligence sufficient to learn survival skills from the parents. Ish will make efforts to ensure some civilisation survives such as reading and writing, but even with that humans change. Domesticated animals survive in feral forms or die out. Predator and prey balance is gradually reestablished. Suburbs gradually revert to forest or grasslands. Natural fires become part of the norm, again.This book is an adventure but not in the same way of a story such as Alas Babylon or the movie 2012 (abominable science in that one). This is an adventure in that the world returns to a form that produced humans in the first place. This is a book for mind and heart more than the thrill. It has stood without becoming as dated as most of these books do. The words 'computer', 'radiation', and 'desperate' do not appear. I think more than anything, the survivors take a while to realise that their lives are not going to return to the way they were. I give this novel all the stars allowed and would give it more if I could.","I really enjoyed this book, George Stewart uses an interesting writing devise to describe time passing without you as the reader feeling as if he is grasping for ideas.Right from when people start dieing and the world changes the whole pace of life changes and this is captured really well and I feel is conveyed very effectively.I also loved the insights into what happens over time to various things that we are accosted to, cats, dogs, corn and cars. I know, I know I sound a little weird but it works !At only 337 pages this is not a taxing read, its definitely worth throwing at your younger readers in the home wanting something that is a little more challenging","I would like to say that in reading other reviews here that dislike this book, the people in this book remind me greatly of many people I have known. Yes, they didn't seem to try very hard to continue civilization, but then he explains that and ponders that at great length. Yes, the main characters were annoying and all too real. All the people that say, \"I would have done this!\" or \"they should have done that!\" are just getting what the author wanted you to do, think about it.They characters in the book, the few rag tag remnants of civilization, fail to even prepare for the inevitable illness that befalls them, typhoid. Just like all of humanity in 1949 failed to prepare for the pandemic that wipes them out. And just like we have still failed to prepare for the coming pandemic of today.This is a cautionary tale that is enjoyable to read. What I would say the the people who don't like it is, And what exactely have you done lately to prepare civilization for what the World Health Organization has recently stated is \"inevitiable\"?","&#8216;Earth Abides&#8217; by George R. Stewart comes with a considerable reputation. First Published in 1949, It was the first winner of the International Fantasy Award although it is clearly science fiction of the world catastrophe kind. That said the book isn&#8217;t extra-speculative in approach, it is set in much the same time as it was written, in an America of that late 1940s early 1950s. The main character, and narrator, of this disaster novel is Isherwood Williams a post grad geography student, Ish is one of the few survivors of a plague which has decimated the USA (and by inference the world). The book tells the tale of what happens to civilisation after the fall and describes Ish&#8217;s attempts to preserve some of it into the future. The story is told and progressed in a series of accounts, the exploration of the USA, the founding of a community, the growth of that community etc. It is written in a straight forward narrative style, with an occasional aside to speculate on the ecology, and traces the life of Ish from the time of the plague to his death. Through this journey Ish will face loneliness and find love, the small community he gathers about him will both flourish and suffer tragedy, and all along Ish chronicles things with his eye on history and ecology.For me, one of the main strengths of this book is that Ish is one of the most relatable protagonists of just about any book I&#8217;ve read. Ish is the sort of person who we&#8217;d like to think we would be in this situation. This is not to say Ish is perfect and he&#8217;s certainly no hero. He has a methodical and intellectual outlook to tackling situations, but he suffers as many failures as triumphs. This gives the book an emotional depth uncommon in a lot of SF and it is this humanity within the characters and their simple plight which drags you into the story. I think this is the book&#8217;s secret, it has the ring of truth. The characters send you through a gamut of emotions from nostalgia to anger, we care about them and are emotionally invested in there future.I don&#8217;t often read disaster novels and it took me some time to build up to read it, I wanted to read it because of its reputation but somehow I always seemed to find another book I needed to read first. Finally biting the bullet I found after only a few pages it had become compulsive and it ended much too soon. Whilst I have read some high enjoyable and great books both before and since, it is this book I find that sticks in my mind and the one that I contemplate upon. This book deserves all the praise it has received, and it has widely been proclaimed a masterwork. That it isn&#8217;t more widely known today is a shame. This book has probably become, even against my will, my favorite SF novel.","The premise of this novel is that mankind suddenly experiences a biological holocaust in the form of a new disease--a form of super-measles that wipes out all but a tiny remnant of mankind. The author explains that &quot;mankind had too long been rolling an endless succession of sevens&quot; and that like all animals that had multiplied out of turn, the sudden catastrophe was inevitable to set the balance back to what nature intended. This novel tells the story of a very small group of survivors, and suggests what life would be like under in the aftermath, and perhaps, more profoundly, what such a scenario might mean for mankind.The author's premise is that little or nothing of civilization would survive such an event. In the story **very minor spoiler** although the survivors make attempts at preserving the skills and lessons of civilization, this eventually becomes impossible against the tide of events sweeping mankind back not just to barbarism (in which some skills and beliefs might have survived) but to downright savagery and superstition. The most profound thought that the author successfully imparts is that all of the traditions, skills, and manifestations of our civilization could--and would--be lost in a single generation. Unforgettable is when one of the characters in the story looks out at the ruins of the San Francisco Bay Bridge (before it too passes away) and asks--&quot;who built this.&quot; The protagonist thinks for a second and answers: &quot;the Americans built it.&quot; The next question is &quot;who were the Americans?&quot; I have never forgotten this exchange, which I felt illustrated brilliantly how important it is for one generation to impart the best ideas of civilization to the next, and how easily all our achievements and successes might be lost in the face of a global catastrophe.The reader need not and probably will not agree with all of the author's conclusions about what would happen in this scenario. Would we really lose the skill of a written language? Would we really fall all the way back almost to the Old Stone Age? The author will challenge the reader's own thoughts on this subject, and that is fine. One need not agree with all of the conclusions that the novel contains to enjoy this story.Although written many years ago, upon re-reading this novel recently I found that it had lost little or none of its impact or relevance. It features a bit more prudishness than a modern novel might contain, but in my opinion is none the worse for this. The story is well-told, the prose is quite good, and the storyline moves along all the while capturing and retaining the reader's interest. This is a novel that I would recommend to everyone.","I could almost feel the age of this book when I read it. It is slow, the main character is an idiot (in my eyes), and he spends most of his time thinking about single-handedly saving (well, rebuilding) civilisation. Delusions of Grandeur. No critical thoughts about civilisation as realized in 1940/50 America, either: \"Modern civilisation is good. We need to rebuild it at once. End of argument.\"I took two things from this book - first, sheep are the most stupid animals on this planet. And second, people may come and go, but Earth Abides. The Author managed very well to show me that, by having his protagonist realize a few pages before the end that he isn't the center of the world. Wow. Finally. I was waiting for this for about 200 pages.This could have been done with a much shorter and faster-paced book. Still, the book poses some interesting questions, and it's vastly better than what you get today when being shown post-apocalypse worlds (I'm thinking along the lines of the Mad Max movies, or Waterworld, etc - the book never sells out this cheaply). So, all in all, Earth Abides earns it's place on my SF bookshelf. A serious book that tries to seriously investigate the end of civilisation as we know it, and guide us into the new world that rises out of it.","I could not put this book down. It challenged me, it entertained me, it made me cry.When I run across a copy, I buy it and give it to friends.","Perhaps because I've read several recently published books that deal with life after \"the end of the world as we know it,\" I found this book to be slow moving and even boring at times. However, I enjoyed moments of nostalgia when presented with phrases like \"tourist court\" and \"I pressed the starter button on the car.\" Brought back memories. Sadly, the world as we knew it then has already ended.","I have been searching for this book for the past 35 years. It was a story I have never forgotten since reading it in my teens. I applaude the publisher who has reissued it. Can't wait to read it again and share it with my friends.","Misinterpretations abide, it seems, when it comes to this book. This &quot;disaster&quot; novel merely uses the disease plague scenario as a backdrop to explore human nature. There are many subtle examples here of how individuals develop as adults, how everything people know and believe is dependent on their own life experience and frame of reference. Most of all this is about the myriad of seemingly small things that people take for granted every day and do not even notice, seemingly unimportant things which are really the foundation of society and culture. Here the characters are stripped of all their artificial interests, and are left with only that foundation. The genius of this story is that it will leave you wondering just how independent your own thoughts and views are. There might be many reasons people go in the various directions they go in life, the least of which have to do with independent choices. This book is much more than a disaster novel, it is a fascinating look at sociology in action. And always in the background, amidst all the human trials and tribulations, Earth and non-human life continue as they always have, oblivious to human superiority. Hence the title, and the ultimate humbling message.","One of the better disaster novels to come out in this century, Stewart essentially takes the Robinson Crusoe point of view and applies it to (then) contemporary America, having a plague wipe out most people, even though the rationale that it's because people are too numerous is a little on the shaky side, he should have just taken the Solaris route and said he didn't know. Would have made things more interesting. However, in itself the novel is an excellent and very realistic portrayal of people struggling to live after everyone else is gone. Nobody has any real need for ambition since everything they could ever want is right there. The main character is the only one who can think ahead far enough to see that the children have to be taught so that civilization can come back but when the book ends it's unclear if that will ever happen. The point I think is to show that we're not better than the animals when it comes to civilization and that our intelligence doesn't necessarily make us better, an old point, to say the least but one that should be stated often. Evolutionarily the human race just got lucky and as quick as we rose (a million years isn't that long really when you figure the age of the planet) we can fall just as fast. And the thing that makes Earth Abides so more real is that civilization isn't restarted, to have that happen would seem unreal, a small group of people does not a civilization make and to have them turn into some sort of super-community to go across the US and return society to what it was before would just seem unrealistic and that would have ruined the point of the book. The way it's written now is much more interesting because even though it's so depressing, it feels that much more likely and thus in the end is more satisfying.","I don't think that any of the reviewers have mentioned this, but I think that there are important details in understanding the book. George R Stewart was an English professor (at UC Berkeley), but he has a real strong feeling for the land, landscape, weather and nature. He wrote about storms, the Donner Party, and other geographical subjects, especially relevant to California.The story is set in the East Bay, and has many identifiable locations and views .that add a certain warmth and familiarity to the story, even after six decades. The tribe lived in easily identifiable Oakland/Berkeley hills of the late 1949's.Ish is initially bitten by a rattlesnake in the Sierra, which would have been familiar to many in Berkeley (then and now)-the mountains, not the rattlesnake. He has respectful and loving depictions of the UC Berkeley Library, which Ish needs to break into- Stewart would have used the library regularly. He described the natural changes in animals and plants that would be expected in the hills. He describes a fire which occurs across the Bay, in San Francisco and the northern Peninsula. Finally, the last scene has the tribe walking across the Bay Bridge. That is the same bridge that exists today (although it will be replaced in a few years).BUT the most important thing is his name. Ish (\"Isherwood\") really stands for Ishi., the famous Indian survivor studied by Kroeber at Berkeley in the early 1900's. That is a well-known piece of Berkeley lore, and Stewart was certainly familiar with it. ... Ish, the last survivor of a dead tribe....","A virus wipes out most of humanity within a couple of days. I've read many scifi novels that begin this way, and most of them spend the majority of the subsequent pages describing the ensuing social chaos in dystopian detail. Earth Abides takes a completely different tack. There is no swaggering little Napoleon lording it over a tiny flock of survivors--there are simply too few people left. There is very little deprivation--people can comfortably survive for years on the leftover canned goods in every corner store. Indeed, there is very little drama of any kind.This is more of a character study of two entities. One is the protagonist, Ish, an anthropologist by training who sees his role primarily as that of an observer of the slow, inevitable decay of civilization. He makes half-hearted attempts to save vestiges of knowledge but is mostly content to watch what happens to the environment around him. The question of what would happen to the planet itself--along with all the plants and animals--without its human caretakers, is the true core of this novel. I heard Octavia Butler recommend this book as one that inspired her, and now that I have read it, I can see why. Thoughtful and surprisingly gentle, it highlights the gifts possessed even by apparently unremarkable people to make a life out of what they are given, supported always by the ultimate Mother: Earth.","Being a fan of apocalyptic SF (among other things), I ordered this after seeing it on several peoples's lists of the greatest end-of-the-world/post-apocalyptic novels. It tells the story, of Ish Williams, who is one of a handful of survivors of a sudden plague that kills off something like 99.99% of the world's primate poulation. Earth Abides describes, in linear chronological fashion, the subsequent 50 years or so, following Ish who becomes the leader of a small band of survivoirs and eventually the shaman-like last survivior of the pre-plague people.The book was written in 1949 and feels very dated, in terms of dialog, ideas and socio-political themes. There are distinctly (although thinly veneered) anti-technology, elitist and generic christian motifs running rather crudely throughout, all of which turned me off. In a couple of places, the author's science is arguable or just plain wrong, and some of his plot devices (cars that still work after sitting on a lot for decades) feel contrived. All this aside, the writing itself just isn't that good.The main character, Ish is a neurotic misanthrope. No genius himself, Ish is nonetheless an incredible intellectual snob, judging everyone around him including his loving wife, to be of lower intelligence than he. A young (already lonely and alone) graduate student at the beginning of the novel, this remarkably unlikeable character goes on to comment negatively about the intellectual capacities of everyone who comes along in his life, except for one grandson that he deems worthy to become his successor.There is very little action, and many descriptive passages about changes in the earth and its flora and fauna following the disaster. The latter are fairly interesting, but not as interesting or well-researched as more recent works (e.g., After Man: A Zoology of the Future). The novel is unfortunately, not particularly well written. I guess, being written in 1949, one has to award points for originality, but compared to dozens of novels and a number of non-fiction works published since then concerned with the fate of the earth after man is gone, there is not much here that warrants this novel's amazing longevity.I understand how this novel could have been very popular when it was published. I am, however, at a loss to explain this novel's huge popularity and staying power today. That it remains in print 61 years after first publication is astounding to me, as are all the 5-star reviews. Virtually all of the ideas and themes visited have been done better by others who are much better, and more interesting writers. One particularly acute contrast is with James Van Pelt's \"Summer of the Apocalypse\", that I read immediately after \"Earth Abides\". It is far superior in every respect, although a superficial description of each makes them sound very similar. Nevertheless, they could not be more different.I was very disappointed by this \"classic\" and would not recommend it on any level.JM Tepper","A plague wipes out most of humanity, and one man (Isherwood Williams) tries desperately to save a piece of civilization to pass on to the generations of survivors. The first part of the story deals with his survival of the plague, and his journey around the country looking for signs of survivors.He returns to his home (in the Bay area of California) where he finally meets a woman (Emma) whose courage convinces him to start a family, which becomes a 'tribe' as a few other survivors come to join them. He tries to pass on as much knowledge as he can to the children of the tribe, but his efforts are largely in vain as civilization continues to regress. Ultimately he realizes a way to pass on some very basic knowledge to help his descendants in the future.The author does an excellent job of dealing with the plague, the after effects of such a plague on nature, as well as the slow decay of the cities and infrastructure of our civilization. He also describes well drop into a primitive society that would result from the plague. There is also an interesting moral dilemma when the tribe has to deal with a potential threatening outsider who tries to join them.The flaws of this story are few. There are a few sections which clearly take place at roughly the time when the story was published (1949). As a result, some of the references to technology and personalities make those sections of the story feel a bit dated. This only happens a few times though, and doesn't really hurt the story.This book won the first science fiction award given when it won the International Fantasy Award in 1951. In 1987, it rated 28th on the Locus All-Time Poll of All-Time SF Novels, and in 1998 it tied for 41st on the Locus poll of SF Novels written before 1990.","I read Earth Abides and was stunned with what a great book it was. Its attention to detail was unparalleled, its character development was exceptional, and its plot never got dull. Every part of the book was breath-taking, from the opening sentence to the closing words.Stewart wrote Earth Abides in third person and includes italicized background information which helps the book play before the reader much like a movie. Stewart doesn't just tell the reader the story; it is like they can see it for themselves. The reader is left to ponder many comments made by characters, and is allowed to reach conclusions for themselves. The thought provoking way in which Earth Abides is written was my favorite attribute of the book.Some books can be read and enjoyed, but do not really leave a mark on the reader. This one reshaped the way that I view the world. I have read hundreds of books, and consider this perhaps the best I have ever read. In one word, it was &quot;awesome.&quot;","Do you know the joyous feeling you get when you just happen upon a book quite by accident, read just a few chapters of it, and realize that it will be of great signifiance to you? Well, that was my experience with this book! I can't believe that I was not introduced to this book before now. It is with some sadness that I just completed reading it.My degree of connection with the main character, Isherwood Williams (Ish), astounded me; therefore, I must admit that my reaction to this book is quite subjective. It as is though the author looked into my mind and wrote a book about me in a post-apocalyptic world, including my greatest virtues and worst vices. The descriptions of the thoughts, triumphs, failings, joys, and frustrations experienced by the main character are poignantly honest and real. Metaphorically, this story seems to describe, with regard to many things, my existence in this, our so-far non-apocalyptic, world. For example, I find that I constantly struggle to define what I think to be the appropriate balance of individuality and community/state in our world. If you are one who consciously ponders such things or pursues a study of philosophy, I believe that you will view this book as a masterpiece. It just made my top 10, that is sure.I feel that I have gained much in my reading of this book. Mostly, I come away from this reading experience with a renewed feeling of peace and a reassurance in myself and the human spirit. I will no longer, I think, become quite so frustrated with regard to certain things or people in this world.&quot;Am I happy? Yes, I am happy. Things are as they are, and I am part of them.&quot; - Jack, great grandson of Isherwood Williams (Ish), the Last American.","That about sums it up for me. All others on this theme (with the honourable exception of John Wyndham's \"The Day of the Triffids\") are just cheap imitations. Earth Abides is the real thingCivilisation, and some 99.99% of the human race, is gone. The few survivors, all traumatised by what has happened to them (some more obviously than others, but they all are) either just commit suicide, drink themselves to death, live out their lonely lives in some familiar spot, or, as with Ish and his companions, get together into little \"tribes\".Having already read a few reviews, I get the impression that there are few neutrals on this one. You either love it (the majority, including me) or hate it. For me, Earth Abides' big virtue is precisely what some people seem to dislike about it. Its characters are just dead ordinary. Even Ish, the nearest thing to a brain among them, is too passive and contemplative to be more than a titular head. There are no survivalists who have long been waiting for the day; no jacks of all trades, conveniently endowed with all the needed skills, and above all no \"natural leaders\" (aka bullies and control freaks) out to remake the world in their own image. (Perhaps Charlie had some ambitions that way, but fortunately he is bumped off before the question can arise). They are in fact just a bunch of very average or even below-average people, trying to make a life for themselves amidst the ruins of the world. That, I suspect, is pretty much how such an aftermath would really be.Indeed, on considering the matter, I feel Stewart did a really good job of making his characters internally consistent. They are, essentially, the ones who come through the end of the world - and just react with a shrug. \"The human race is almost entirely wiped out, civilisation's gone and we're all back in the Dark Ages. Now what do I do about breakfast?\" Well, to be fair, Ish does throw up in the sink when it finally \"sinks\" in that his parents won't ever be coming home, but that's where it ends. If he ever considers the matter again, we aren't told about it. The other characters take a largely similar attitude. Em apparently had a family pre-Disaster, but never talks about them, while Ezra and the others have even less to say. They just write off their losses and \"move on\".Well, fair enough. That is probably exactly how they need to be in the situation. This attitude is probably what allows them to come through without being driven into insanity and/or suicide. But of course it has consequences. First off, it implies a decided lack of empathy toward fellow beings. Unlike some reviewers, I'm not particularly disturbed at their willingness to hang Charlie, and to at least consider \"mercy killing\" of the retarded Evie. Given such personalities, this is exactly how they would be. Indeed, it says much for their basic decency that they agonise as much as they do over the first decision, and never take the second one at all. Stewart has made his characters act \"in character\", as an author should.Secondly, however helpful this attitude was in seeing them through the immediate aftermath, it is far less so when it's time to think of rebuilding. Having taken the Disaster itself almost in their stride, they are likewise accepting of its aftermath, and generally take only such action as is forced on them by circumstances. The \"Lewis and Clark\" expedition in Year 22 is distinctly exceptional. And Ish's basically solitary disposition stultifies his attempt to educate the children. The only one he can \"reach\" is an academic loner exactly like himself, after whose death he essentially gives up. Stewart has wonderfully portrayed how the virtues which were such a help at the start of the book have now turned into vices.Loooking back on it (I first read the book at age ten) I have some minor gripes. In particular, the Great Disaster itself seems more than a little \"sanitised\", with mankind dying and all the bodies neatly tidied away, during Ish's two-week absence. Somehow, that does not quite carry conviction. Apart from that, however, my only real complaint is that Stewart was content with a single book, when the theme deserved a trilogy at least.Read and enjoy","Anyone who has read Alas, Babylon or Lucifer's Hammer needs to read this also. The premise is a panepedimic wipes out almost the entire population of the earth. Earth abides, but Man is almost extint. The turning point comes when the main character realizes that civilization as he knew it is over. He then turns his energies into teaching the Tribe to be self sufficient.A very good read, very on point and topical for today's world.","This book was hard for me to read simply because the pain of the main character became my pain while I read. In the aftermath of the end of the world You experience fear, loneliness, pitty, love, hope and finally resolution through the narrator Ish's observations.This is no adventure novel but it is a hard hitting look at just how much we truly rely on the trappings of the industrialized world to get by and how naked we would be without them. Although the book ends on a bit of a hopeful note you can't help but mourn for all that's been lost as well as watching the rest of the world's knowledge die slowly over the generations.This book made me ask what if it were me? A mark of a good thought provoking book.","Earth Abides by George Stewart is an incredible book. It follows the main character, Ish, as he tries to make sense of a world where humans are nearly wiped out by disease. What makes this book special, is that it's protagonist is a deliberate, thoughtful man that brings the story a sense of realism that is rarely seen in this kind of fiction. It is very interesting to see how and if civilization can survive such a \"Great Disaster\". The story benefits by being completely plausible, and even though the book was written over 50 years ago, it is still fascinating today. I highly recommend this reading.","A grossly interesting book, perhaps the actual first, to explore the thought of \"what to do to survive in post-apocalyptic America with little skills and a hammer\" - all avenues are skillfully probed and prosed.The first quarter of the book captivated my imagination with the wandering, scavaging and, ultimately, surviving. The middle half was deeply interesting to see how one man could restructure his life so that Americans could live after the plague. The last quarter was filled with expectation and anxiety, seeing how the family has turned out and whether or not the new Americans will prosper as they had before.","At the beginning of Earth Abides, Isherwood Williams, a graduate student alone in the wilderness and working on his thesis, is bitten by a poisonous snake. For several days, he drifts in and out of consciousness. When he is at last able to drag himself to civilization, he finds that a virus not unlike the common flu has mutated into a deadly strain, and the world is suddenly devoid of people. The rest of the book follows Isherwood as he discovers the strange freedom of the empty world, struggles to find other survivors, and works to rebuild civilization.Earth Abides is a sweeping saga, stretching across decades and roaming across North America. Most of the story takes place from inside the head of its protagonist, at a range so close that it takes us several pages to learn his name, as he simply does not think of his name that often. Stewart infuses the story with concrete details and scientific observations, giving it a strong sense of authenticity. Caught up in and believing the action, we are completely absorbed in the efforts of Isherwood Williams to survive and thrive in this strange new world.One trap lurking for any story, but particularly a science fiction story like this, is that of becoming quickly dated. Things change daily, and what is fascinating and new today will soon be old fashioned. Stewart has given his story a certain timelessness, at least so far, and I think he achieves this effect by incorporating very little medium-range technology. By this I mean that things are either seen close up, as in hands working with tools that change slowly, such as hammers, or are seen at a distance, such as the lights of San Francisco. In the middle distance, very little attention is paid to devices that evolve quickly, such as televisions, radios, and automobiles (other than the venerable Jeep). The result is that Earth Abides does not suffer from a feeling of being out of date, and it could easily be imagined to be a present-day story.One interesting feature to me as a writer was the use of interstitial chapters called Quick Years between each of the three major sections. These bridge the time gaps between the primary sections of the book, recalling the primary events in the passing years through Isherwood's eyes. This device lets the author tell a sweeping story while keeping the bulk of the detail in the activity at the turning points. On first glance, this sudden shift in gears seems likely to distance the reader, but Stewart handles the narrative so deftly that the reader finds the story as engaging viewed at this speed as when it is slowed down.Ultimately, Earth Abides is a masterful work. The author gives us enough detail and character to connect deeply with the story, then stays out of the way, allowing the story to unfold with its own power. The result is a riveting and deeply moving tale about all of us, how strong and resilient we are, but also about how fragile we are, how tenuous our grip on the world is, and how little it needs us.Do not miss this story. But do not, however, try to finish it without a generous supply of tissues. You will need them.","I heard about \"Earth Abides\" from someone reviewing \"The Stand\". In their review, they indicated \"The Stand\" was a one for one rip off of \"Earth Abides\". I decided to investigate this accusation and started reading an old edition of George Stewart's book. This book investigates what could potentially happen to human civilization if most people died from a highly contagious disease. The decay of civilization is seen through the eyes of the main character, Isherwood Williams.First, what was my impression of the book? I enjoy reading sci-fi and have read my share of \"end of the world\" books including \"Alas Babylon\", \"The Stand\", \"War Day\", \"The White Plague\", and most recently \"The Road\". I did not enjoy the writing style of this author. It was not fluid and was archaic. However, the subject matter was interesting as was the thought the author put into the story. Ultimately, the author kept my attention.How does this book compare to \"The Stand\"? They are two entirely different books. \"The Stand\" is more realistic in depicting the immediate aftermath of a plague. However afterwards, it becomes more of a \"good versus evil\" tale whereas \"Earth Abides\" seriously contemplates the state of civilization years after the plague. All in all, both books are worthy reads.\"Earth Abides\" is at times is an awkward read. However, the story is interesting and well thought out. All in all, I recommend the book.","I swear it seems that all the reviewers of this book seem desperate to convince people that they've been able to read for a really long time.\"I first read this book back in Vietnam...\"\"I first read this book about thirty years ago...\"\"When I first read this book, I was only twelve years old, and...\"Great, we get it, you're old, and you can read.Ahhh... Anyway, despite my grumbling, I do agree with the essential point that these reviewers made--that this is a book that pulls you in, that surrounds you with a \"world entire,\" that creates a place that you inhabit completely from page 1 to page 317 (in the edition I have, anyway), that creates a world that you'll find hard to forget.The book, \"Earth Abides,\" tells the story of a man who emerges from a long period of solitude to discover that more than 99% of the planet's humans have been killed by a powerful virus, the man himself having likely survived only because of having been bitten by a snake around the same time.The book's descriptions of the abandoned world are awesome, enlivening and atmospheric, and for some of us no doubt a secret dream come true. It gets even cooler whent the man decides to take a road trip across the newly desolate America--from California to New York City. That's the book's first section, and was probably my favorite part of the book, but the book remains interesting and engaging throughout. The man meets a woman, they have children, they meet others, they form a community, and then--this seemed a bit hard for me to swallow--they basically let all of civilization go, and three generations later they're basically a tribe of primitives who are happy and functional, but who can't read, can't use any of the technologies created by mankind, and believe the sun revolves around the Earth. Yeah, that happened kind of quick....Set your disbelief aside though, and read this. It's well-written, nicely paced, and enjoyable, and the depictions of the man when he's really old seem totally accurate in their depiction of the sort of fuzzy and uncertain warmth of old age, though I'd need to have this book's other reviewers confirm that to be absolutely sure.One of my only complaints about the book would be the 1940s mentality that saturates the main character's logic: at one point he says in a sort of wistful tone that maybe one day they might be able to care about such things as race again, he contemplates making himself king of two frightened black people that he meets, and he laments that the his community's lack of law has made it impossible for them to require that an insane girl be \"put out of her misery.\" At first these comments were kind of amusing in a kitschy way, but then they really started piling up, and didn't make his character more endearing to me.Overall though, this was a great book, and like almost everyone else who's read it, I'm sure I'll be thinking about it for years.","This novel did more than entertain, it made me think. Everything that we hold of value weakens when weighted against what is essential in continuing our existence after such a catastrophe. The main character \"Isherwood\" had such a difficult time with the notion of the \"Old\" world being forgotten. What impressed me was that their continued existence was not dependant on the \"Old\" structure of things. If all the demands of our everyday life are absent what is left?I am pleased to have read this book. I'll be honest I was reticent about reading a sci-fi from 1947. This was well worth it.","This is a great read, but before you spend the $50 for this paperback, go check your local used book stores and thrift stores like Goodwill, I got my copy of the 1962 version for 69 cents and it is in great shape at a Goodwill store.","Several reviews have noted what they call the essential pessimism of the book: Man Has Fallen, Civilization Is No More, etc. Well, yes, that is all there. But what is also there is a profound triumph of the human spirit: Civilization is Dead - Long Live Civilization. I will NOT spoil the ending, but book ends with a rebirth - an obvious societal pregnancy if you will - of a new civilization, one profoundly in keeping with the new conditions of their brave renewed world.One can imagine a sequel, and I wish Stewart ahd written one!I first read this book almost 50 years ago, and have re-read it multiple times. It is one of the best \"transition\" books ever written. I recommend it on several levels.","I love the apocolypse genre - so thought provoking, and Earth Abides is one of the best I've read so far. I was surprised I'd never heard of it before seeing someone on a message board mention it. I decided to give it a try, and am so glad I did. This has now been moved into my books to read again, and that really doesn't happen often.I didn't realize how long ago this had been written until the main character described going into a house and sitting down to rest on the \"davenport\" - how long has it been since we heard that term?Really though, the premise is such that it really doesn't matter when the book was written. The same thought provoking situations occur. Highly recommend.","I enjoy Post apocalyptic sic fi but this was not that entertaining after a while.","With so many books available to read, is this one worth your time? Ultimately, you'll have to make that decision, but I hope my review can help in some way.There are some technology issues with the story that clearly show it was written in the late 1940's; however, these don't detract too much from the story.There are also a few typos in the Kindle edition, which I assume is a scanning problem when converting to eBook format.The two main issues I had with the book are:1. Food - It is unrealistic to think that people would be subsisting off canned food for 20+ years, let alone, 40+ years at the end of the book.2. Future generations - Without ruining the ending, the book makes a plot decision on how Ish decides to pass knowledge on to future generations. I liked two aspects of what he did, but I thought the rest was foolish.I liked the book overall, but I didn't necessarily think it was a \"great\" work.","This review is a spoiler! Don't read on if you are intending to read it for the first time!I had heard many times that this was a classic that would haunt me for life. But I was not impressed, partially because there were things that were left unanswered. I may have missed something - what was the significance of the car on the bridge at the end? Modern man's constructions were all around him...the Golden Gate Bridge, for example. Why the car? Why did they want him to die there, instead of with their tribe? I thought it weird, too, and unlikely, that he saw so few bodies in the aftermath. I liked the hammer symbol a lot - and the fact that he passed it on to the young man he'd chosen - and why. I liked that his gift of leadership helped humanity live on. I also liked the way that he changed his desperate struggle from lecturing - to action...his building of the simple bow and arrows. I loved that he continued to describe the inevitable and looming corrosion of the modern world. That did make him the last American - his final months spent with his oldest friend. Those things saddened me a great deal.I have read another holocaust book that WILL haunt me for life...perhaps because it was on such a massive scale, and yet confined to only one remaining group of characters. The book is The Last Ship, by William Brinkley. I've read it 3 times, as has my oldest son.","This is an extraordinary novel, wider appreciation of which has probably been hampered by categorization as science fiction. While there are some slight anachronisms (the book appeared in 1949) the ideas, and the narrative, are disturbingly fresh. To me the most stunning - and frighteningly plausible - theme was how fragile &quot;civilization&quot; is, and how quickly everything could collapse even though the material and intellectual basis for &quot;civil society&quot; remained intact and available.","In short, I liked the first half of this book - the plot is intriguing and you don't want to put the book down! But after reading 2/3 of the story you expect something more to happen but the tempo goes down, the main character gets more introspective and the flow of the narration starts to falter. The book starts to get boring and you just want to get through to the end to see what the end will be like. With a better pace all the way through, I would rate this book higher.","Chris FitzgeraldEnglish 10Mrs. Cruces5-20-02Earth Abides Evaluative EssayThe novel Earth Abides, written by George Stewart, took place in San Francisco,California. This science fiction novel focuses on a plague that has spread across the NorthAmerican continent and is threatening the human species. The novel contains the life thatan individual survivor, Isherwood Philips (Ish), lives. A majority of the population hasseized to exist. Ish is an important part of the Plague because he is a biologist. Ish goesthrough his life in this novel by bringing other characters into his life. Ish is one of thesurvivors that has the intelligence to form a tribe and become the leader of this tribe. Ishhas a compassionate soul and struggles to help other survivors find their way.Earth Abides is a very interesting novel. This novel is easily enjoyable because ofits connection that it gives of the key characters who are intertwined in a drama that isdealing with a cataclysmic event of a Plague. This makes the novel a good read. Thiskind of event is very possible considering the times that we live in now. This novel doesnot only relate with people coming together to struggle for survival. It also deals with anevent that could very well take place.This novel is great for anyone over the age of about 12 years old, because of theway that this novel is set up to involve thinking and real life experience to understand thetrue meaning of the novel. Anybody who is looking for a good science fiction novel willlike the great novel Earth Abides.","I bought this book based on the overall good ratings.I speed read through most of it, hoping it would pick up. I can't stand the idea that these people weren't a little more intelligent and chose to preserve what they had and plan for the future without technology. They had a whole freakin' University Libary for pete's sake!Out of the whole book I got that Ish was the only inteliigent one but didn't have the teaching skills to subsequently teach the next generations.If you like post-apolcolytipic books, then I highly recommend \"One Second Later\" by Fortschen. The spelling may be off slighly....I don't have the book here. There is a line-up at work to read it. This book scared the hell out of me. And as a professional health care worker I could see the devastating domino effect happening like this book portrayed. Like the book \"One Second Later\" says, \"Its not IF, but WHEN.\"","If they did an audiotape of \"Earth Abides\", only Ben Stein would be up to the task of delivering the text into spoken words. The novel wastes no time getting into its subject matter. Within the opening pages, an unknown plague wipes out the vast majority of humanity, leaving the remnants to either rebuild civilization or bear witness to its final collapse. It sounds promising, but the delivery never comes.The story is narrated in the first person by \"Ish\", a young college student whose circumstances enable him to survive the disaster. Very early on, the reader gets the first inklings that this novel will serve as a sounding board for George Stewart's various preoccupations. The first hint is the dominant theme that nature has some innate sense of population control that strikes suddenly and absolutely on all levels, and this is explored not just in discovering what happened to humanity but also in a number of situations as the story advances.In fact, Ish seems to be merely a mouthpiece for a number of observations, ideas, and insights postulated by Stewart. For a work of fiction, \"Earth Abides\" reads more like an apocalyptic version of \"Future Shock\", the landmark Alvin Toffler sociological study. Unfortunately, it reads as dryly as \"Future Shock\" as well. All of Stewart's ideas are presented in a dry, impersonal manner, which precludes any emotional connection with the story itself and thus lessens the impact of these insights in the end. Recommended only for the most voracious of sci-fi readers.","\"Earth Abides\" is one of the best books I have ever read. Even though it was written in 1949, it seems to me like it could have been written yesterday. Very thought-provoking and memorable. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who desires a good read. I couldn't put it down. I finished it several days ago and it still stays in my mind. I bought this book for my Kindle, but I think I am going to order a hard copy too - it was that good.","I found this book totally by happy accident, and it remains one of my all-time favorites. What is chilling is that the basic premise of the book is quite possible and believable, given diseases like Ebola that are out there. He gave real-life examples of other species that became overpopulated, and then were nearly wiped out by a plague. What is man but another species of animal on this planet, and we are not immune--look at the Black Plague, for example. A truly unique look at what might happen to the earth if we are nearly wiped out, and what might happen to the people left to survive afterward. A great read!","As always, interesting to see the vast number of five star review for a book deserving of maybe three. Would be quite fascinating to easily see a breakdown of reviewers' ratings showing number of reviews at each star level - would we see most people rate things at 5 stars?I just finished this book, and have been thinking about why it was so bad. It never captured my interest, the characters were cardboard, astoundingly enough the plot was nearly nonexistent and worst of all, no conflict/tension!After the initial collapse, our hero drives across the country, from San Francisco to Manhattan, making trivial contact with a few people apparently for the purpose of seeing an empty New York City. He then returns to California, where he proceeds to settle down for the next 20+ years without doing anything except mosey down to the local abandoned grocery store to snag some canned food.My big insight from reading this book was realizing most people were essentially lazy before television was invented.There are so many other better genre books, including _On The Beach_ and _Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang_.","The book, first written in 1949 tells a story that could be just as true today. A pandemic that sweeps the contenent leaving few survivors. Isherwood (Ish) Williams is the protagonist. His life is the focus of the story, with interaction with a gradual collection of a few other survivors, that results in a slowly growing tribe. Well worth reading and rereading a few years later.","This book is great and I found it on Amazon at a great price. it shipped promptly and arrive in great shape.","Written in the 50s, it talks about ecology when nobody even knew the word. Ish watches the world spasm itself back into equilibrium after man is removed from the equation. Add elements of anthropology and sociology and and you have a truly remarkable book. Read it. NOW!","First published in 1949, Earth Abides is George R. Stewart's take on what would happen if all of the human population of Earth, except a few scattered survivors, were killed by a vicious disease. The tale is presented entirely through the thoughts and experiences one man, i.e., Isherwood Williams. Ish is a graduate student when the \"Great Disaster\" leaves him alone in the Oakland CA area. He eventually finds a few other survivors, including Emma (Em) who becomes his partner and the mother of his children. Ish and Em and their small band of survivors create a fledgling community that struggles with immense hardships to survive. However, they do survive and their community \"The Tribe\" grows slowly. Ish, as the only educated person among the group, becomes a leader and eventually becomes revered almost as a God after many years. Ish remains a thinker throughout his life, and a worrier through most of it. The book is very interesting and presents much credible (at least based on the 1949 knowledge base) information about what the world would be like and how it would change if humans cease to be a significant force. It also presents much logical information about how a very small human community would struggle to adapt and develop a simple but functioning social organization. Much of the book presents Ish's thoughts about how to help his tribe survive and also how to motivate or manipulate them to develop skills and knowledge that might enable them to develop a new civilization in the future. At times, I did not like Ish, but I usually understood the logic of his thoughts and actions. Although things did not work out the way Ish wanted, he finally realized that the tribe and Earth's changing environment would interact to determine the future without his help. I found this book to be a slow but interesting read. It was also intellectually stimulating and engendered much emotion. Reading this science fiction classic is well worth the effort.","I have read this book multiple times and have totally been immersed in WHAT IFS. I have talked more about this book than about any other book that I have read except for The Source by James Michener.. The idea of the world actually existing after most of the people have died from an unknown cause is so thought provoking. Most people I have talked to and let read my book have been as impressed by Earth Abides as I have been but then there are the very few who thought that they could do better if they had been in the same circumstances. I always thought that I would eventually have to go back to cave man status. It is a book that should be read in college. I would totally recommend it.","This book is less about an apocalyptic event that kills most humans and more about the reemergence of society and the influences that geography, history, and personal beliefs have on it. Ishi, the main character, strives to bring back the scholarly lifestyle he values, but is faced with convincing the new generation of its value in a world where his children are free from the society he knew.","One of my favorites that I surely will read more than once. I loved how you got to read about the main character from the age of 18 to his death. The book is amazing at telling the story of how they all survive and how mankind seems to revert back to tribal and superstitious beliefs. I almost wanted to jump in and live this life with them even though their hardships seemed too much to bear.","See this movie and gain a perspective on where we came from. Who we are and where you are going. Buddha jesus all the same guy. Whi knew?","I stumbled across this book a few decades ago when living in Japan for over a year. I was hungry for English words in a good book. It surpassed my expectations! The plot is beautifully developed and makes a surreal world believable. The human struggle and resourcesfullness was absolutely heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time. I cared so much about the outcome of the characters, I couldn't put it down! Very few books lure repeat reads like this one did. After misplacing it during my returning to the U.S., I hunted for a another copy everywhere to no avail. Finally, when it appeared in the dark corner of a small used bookstore, you would have thought I struck gold. Years later, at the end of a job interview, I was asked to name my favorite book--probably to ensure that I was cultured reader. Without hesitation, I recommended \"Earth Abides\" in full glory. The irony is that I'm not typically a science-fiction reader, leaning more toward drama and suspense. Well, that's exactly what this book offers as no other! If you have time to read only one book, make it this one!","I like reading older books, and this one certainly fits the bill as it was published in 1949.It was written in an older style with minimal dialogue. It's also written in the first person which makes it very subjective.I found Ish, the main character, at first, bland and uninteresting. But as I read he grew on me.I would recommend the book as one version of how things may evolve after a widespread plague and only a few survivors.It is well written, although in some scenes I found the dialogue a little too 'bible-ish'. I also found some plot developments a bit unrealistic. I believe it is an ingrained characteristic in humans to want to survive, to lash out at fate and try to beat it. I don't think that, as in this book, people would just give up and live off the remnants of the old world forever (or until the next generation picks up the ball). I think people would automatically try to herd cattle and sheep and try to start gardens and orchards.Another weak point is how the author seems to avoid the harder scenes in the book. When something is done about Charlie, when Joey contracts the disease and it's outcome, and when Ish's wife finally dies. All these main moments in Ish's life are avoided by skimming over them.All in all I do recommend this book, but it is not for readers wanting action. It's for readers wanting to think.I'll remember for while the passage in Chapter 2 of the last secion where we discover that Ish did make a impact on the outcome of the tribe. It reminded me that sometimes just by doing what we think is right we affect the outcome of our own immediate environment, our tribe.","Maybe today the plot of \"Earth abides\" is nothing new, but when it was written, in 1949, it surely was. Professor Stewart's only book in science-fiction quickly turned into a milestone concerning apocalyptic themes. William Brinkley's \"The last ship\", Pat Frank's \"Alas, Babylon\", Nevil Shute's \"On the beach\" and Stephen King's \"The stand\" all come to mind as having similar ideas, although each of the five books mentioned have their own characteristics and deal with the subject of \"end of human civilization\" in unique ways.\"Earth abides\" is more like a one-man chronicle. Isherwood Williams, a reclusive geology student, finds himself a survivor of an unnamed \"Great Disaster\" that has wiped out 99% of humankind. During the course of the book, Stewart tells the reader how Ish, as he calls his main character, learned to live again, without all the comforts of civilization, forming a new family, than a new community. Ish thinks of himself as \"the last american\", and Stewart explains very well why that is so.Although not overtly a \"dark\" science-fiction story - like \"On the beach\", for example -, \"Earth abides\" has a subtle way of making the reader very uneasy and impotent as he turns the pages. This book was written almost sixty years ago, but has a very modern feeling about it - not scientifically, of course, but if we think about how Man deal with his peers and with nature, Stewart's book will ring some known bells.Grade 8.7/10","I fully expected to enjoy this book. I've read piles of books in the same genre - The Stand, The Road, Plague Journals, etc. This is notably different in that there is absolutely no faith or hope - there is no striving for better, there is only just getting by.I was very put off my the narrator's belief that no one else possessed any intellect. I've met loads of blue collar workers who would have done a much better job in getting things started. I simply can't imagine a group of people who would settle for canned food instead of growing their own. Who would settle for no electricity? I can't imagine having access to a library and not researching how to start a power plant back up. There was no planning - just living day to day.I guess I have a different belief about the nature of man. And, as others stated, I don't know that the author had children or interacted with them. They are sponges and want to learn. They can be inspired - he was simply ineffective - it was his fault then that he couldn't get them motivated.","After reading Earth Abides (for the second time, in the early 1960's), I was moved to write to GRS, which I had never before done, with any author!My letter was passed on to his address via his Literary Agent in London, and arrived in San Francisco three weeks after his death.I received a treasured return letter from Theodosia Stewart, his widow, and after a few exchanges of letters, she invited me to come to San Francisco to meet her and that she would give me access to all of his notes and work in the archives at The Bancroft Library at Berkeley University.I took up this offer, and in 1985, travelled to California - my first flight!!!I have written an account, with photographs, of the people I met and the places connected with GRS, many of whom I am still in contact with, and will some day publish this account, but the above serves to show what an effect this book had on a young (38 years) englishman, to pull me across the world.The high points of my visit were meeting Theodosia (Ted) Stewart, visiting \"the house on San Lupo Drive\", and standing on the smooth slabs at Indian Rock Park.All of this came from reading \"Earth Abides\".","I hate to add a note of dissent to all the glowing reviews but this book really frustrated me. It`s not that it was badly written though I found the style a little clinical. I guess that is just a reflection of the personality of Ish, through whose eyes we see the unfolding of the years following the devastating plague. Myabe it was his character that annoyed me so much and basically put me off the book. He seemed to consider himself so superior to those about him and become almost unbalanced in his lofty plans for his favourite son. I found it hard to believe that everyone else in the community apart from him was so darn thick. I also found it very sexist, even though i know that only reflects the time it was written. The author`s attitude to race relations was dedfinitely more forward-thinking than towards women, who were mainly portrayed as baby-obsessed brood-mares. Even Em, the main female character was seen as reacting to events on an instinctual rather than intellectual level.The apathy of the community also bothered me - would people really be this unconcerned about their children`s future? Decades later and they hadn`t taught the children to read so they could learn how to do all that stuff they`d eventually need - like how to make candles, when to plant crops, how to weave fabric, etc etc. I can`t believe they were STILL living off tinned food all those years after and hadn`t even bothered to domesticate any horses or grow vegetable gardens! I prefer the English series Survivors, which I feel tackled the practicalities of having to provide and produce absolutely EVERYTHING necessary to life for yourself much better than this did.","First, as a story, the character development is poor and any drama is virtually non-existent. There are a few opportunities for drama, but in each case, the author fails to draw in the reader and make them care. Similarly, there's little to cause the reader to become invested in the characters. You could read abstracts on the characters and get as much out of them as reading the novel.Secondly, the \"hero\" is annoying and a bit contemptible, but perhaps this is the author's goal. Regardless, it made me like the story even less. In short, the hero prefers to sit around and do nothing while he complains inwardly about the dullness and laziness of his \"tribe\". This goes on, and on, and on... In short, I eventually got tired of the hero's endless elitism and hypocrisy.Perhaps the author's message is that the hero didn't understand while the simpletons did. Perhaps his message was that civilization is overrated compared to a simple and primitive life, we should stop worrying, live in the now, leave the rat race, etc, etc. If so, his delivery of that message is painfully boring and repetitive for the reader. At the end of the book, I really didn't care if there was a message or what it was.On a positive note, the prose used to break up chapters was often well-written. It just wasn't enough to make up for the bad execution on the actual story.","Every time the protagonist passes judgement on other characters, have a drink.Every time the protagonist compares himself to a god or demi god, have a drinkEvery time the protagonist says \"Oh! Mother of Nations\" or \"Oh Joey!\" have a drink.Every time the protagonist refers to himself as the last American despite there being evidence that other communities of survivors have formed, likely with their own elders, take a drink.Every time you find an editing error, have a drink.You may want to take it one chapter at a time so you are not utterly intoxicated. The book was most interesting for the interpretation of what post pandemic America could be like. However, the story moves slowly and the dialogue is stilted and awkward. Not as good as I had hoped for.","I know this is the grandfather of post-apocalyptic fiction but some of the attitudes expressed in this book are so dated and unrealistic that they pulled me out of the story. There are lots of poetic passages and lyrical writing but the hero is surprisingly unsympathetic and uncharismatic for my taste.","The premise of the story is interesting, especially in our time of ridiculous overpopulation of this planet and the ability for any virus to move worldwide in a short time, but the story wasn't especially well written. I really can't see so much of current civilization being lost as Mr. Stewart expects. Also, there wasn't very much character development.","Long ago, when I was about 12, I read a book by George Stewart called Fire. I remember enjoying this book. When I came across The Earth Abides last year I remembered thinking that I might enjoy this one based on my prior experience with his earlier book. Besides I liked the title. Well my enthusiasm started to wane after reading the first 100 pages or so. I started to think that perhaps my taste had changed in the intervening decades. In Fire, I had found interesting his asides where he described the fire and its growth. Here, when he interrupted the story in an aside describing changes to the world and the decay of mankind's works, I found it distracting and thought it broke the narrative flow. Several times I found myself saying \"that is not the way people would behave\" and second guessing the author- fighting against the direction the author was taking us. I thought that perhaps the story, being written in the late `40's, was dated. However, about two-thirds of the way through the book, right about the time when a couple of the colony members were sent on a cross country trip to see what was going on in the rest of the country, I had a major change of heart. It was like a log jam breaking. I suddenly let go of my preconceptions and opened my mind up to his vision, his story. I found the story suddenly compelling and the characters believable, and the writing, while not on the level of a Saul Bellow, moving and effective. I found his description of civilization slipping backward, and the growth of the colony into a tribal, superstitious society, in contrast to the protagonist's scientific \"modern\" leanings, very powerful and imbued the story with a powerful melancholy. However, the book is not necessarily all depressing. Indeed it makes clear that mankind would survive- and the earth would abide until his eventual return. Looking back, writing in the first person was very effective. The final chapter is a beautiful and fitting ending.","I don't think I've ever read a book where the author has done more research than Stewart has done for this one. Not only did he have to do all that research, but he had to sit down and think things through: the rise and fall of ants, the mountain lions running out of food in the mountains, the sheep being lost. It was truly amazing. It also brought to light several things that would and would not happen if man were gone. Some of them are bad and some are good. Stewart gives a fair, unbiased (and likely acurate) picture of an Earth where most humans have suddenly dissappeared.","I found the premise of the book interesting and, for the most part, it was well executed. However, the characters' passivity and lack of ambition is very frustrating. The people who survived the plague seem to have lost the will to achieve! Stewart seems to deliberately portray all characters except Ish and Joey as somewhat limited, despite the fact that they actually contribute more to the continued survival of the community that the \"smart one\". Ish seems content to just go along and then regret that things haven't advanced. Ish doesn't ever seem to gain any understanding that he could have taken the initiative to broaden the scope of the community. Even in the context of the time the book was written, the women are treated as objects. There is no indication of deep thought or emotion from any of them.","I first read this book when I was a teenager and read it again last week (30 years later.) I was surprised at how much I remembered from it (I have completely forgotten books I read 6 months ago!)Of course the book is dated, it was written over 50 years ago and of course technology and social attitudes have changed. Of course the main character is flawed and of course we think we could all have done better, but wouldn't fiction be boring if every character were perfect?I loved the descriptions (in italics) of the breakdown of civillisation, about how plants and animals evolve when \"man\" dissappears.I've looked at some of the reviews for this book and am not surprised that most enlightened readers have given this book 5 stars. Neither am I surprised to see the occasional reader give it one star and to read their vehement reviews. These show that the book has worked and all its readers have strong opinions about it.","This book is with out a doubt one of the best I have ever read. Stewart portrays the end of our world, as we know it and tells the story of a man's need to survive in a world he no longer knows and trusts. This novel is not one of action and amazing death defying feats, but one of a man's introspective thoughts and of the will to live in a world that has been brought down by it's own ignorance and naivet&eacute;. This book is like a huge juicy red stake, there is almost too much meat to handle. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to think, and think seriously about what it means to be human!","A must read for fans of apocalyptic fiction. Even though it was published in 1949 nothing about the book seems dated. It deserves its ranking (by David Pringle) as one of the 100 best Sci Fi novels of all time.","I read Earth Abides the first time over 35 years ago. It is one of the few books that genuinely presents an &quot;end of civilization&quot; as we know it and does it well without a lot of fanfare. This is a discriptive story that I plan to read again.","A friend lent me this book many years ago. I loved it. But I forgot the title and author and when I recently wanted to reread it no one was able to help me. I searched and searched for it to no avail. Finally someone on a sci fi newsgroup was able to help me. This book is fascinating. It is one of my all time favorites. The author has an incredible imagination and you really believe this is what would happen if civilization were to die off. It is so full of vivid details and really makes you think.","This is a book everyone should read; a book worthy of being read over and over during a lifetime. I've read it twice and will probably read it several more times. The subject of a disastrous plague almost wiping out civilization is written in such a way that it's entirely believable. It's fascinating to see how Mr. Stewart's characters face survival. The very last part of the book is a bit confusing, but then life viewed from the point of a very old person may be very confusing.","I throroughly enjoyed reading The Earth Abides because it compelled me to consider what motivations there are for the individual to continue living. I felt the most interesting part of the book was the notion that the individual must actively define what direction his life is to take, the setting of the story added to the importance of this decision and entertained different options and the validity of those decisions.","An aging story. I liked the book on a whole, but the middle and end dragged into tedium.The first half of the book was very interesting to me, and I enjoyed the writing immensely. The last half of the book, on the other had was very, very slow.By the time the end came I was ready for it to be over, and did not much care what happened to everybody after that. good riddance.","The book must be praised for being quite different from most sci-fi of its time. Much of the narrative is spent taking a look at the details of the slow collapse of man's works after he is gone. If you enjoy \"Life after People\" you will enjoy this. However, Stewart's Apocalypse is a gentle one, with little evidence of panic or struggle as mankind fell.I also love that the timeline spans many years, interspersed with important episodes from the anti-hero's perspective. Having a hero that was not a superman was definitely different for the time, as was his pessimism. I loved the cross country adventure and the gradual expansion of the Ish's tribe as it met others. The book felt a little like Asmimov's foundation, which is a good thing.I thought the ending sequence [minor SPOILER alert] concerning how old age affects one's cognitive abilities was particularly well done.This could have been one of my all time favorites, if not for two things :1) the main character's egotism was hard to swallow. Perhaps the author expected he would be disliked? I doubt it however.2) Dated 40's attitudes. It feels racist AND classist (in the author's/Ish's description of the other survivors).I do highly recommend this novel, but with the grain of salt.","I have just finished reading \"Earth Abides\" for the fourth time. The first time I read it I was in my early twenties after having been lent a copy by a friend. Like so many readers, the story haunted me and many years later I decided to buy a copy of my own to read again. It was out of print in the UK at that time but I did eventually manage to obtain a copy in the States. I read it again and again. I am now 59 and the member of a book club which had \"The Road\", another post-apocalyptic story which has recently been made into a film, as one of its reads. This had a rather mixed reception from members and so I told them about \"Earth Abides\". I am delighted to say that every one of our members has read \"Earth Abides\" and enjoyed it.I notice that, like me, 90% of reviewers are happy to give \"Earth Abides\" 5 stars. Out of curiousity I have read the reviews of the minority who give it less than 3 and I have the following comments to make. Those who say \"what happened to all the dead bodies?\" need to read the book again. There are numerous references to what happened in the final stages of the epidemic, the way that they dealt with the dead and the dying, the emergency centres that were set up and the subsequent places that Ish avoided on his travels because of the smell of rotting corpses etc.Another popular criticism of the book is the apparent inability of Ish and his tribe to be creative, to teach the children to read, or to make any progress in salaging anything of the previous civilisation. I have had about 30 years to think about this one myself and I am not convinced that given the small, random group of survivors that Ish had at his disposal, and the lifestyle that they had gotten used to, that things could have turned out differently. For me the whole point of the story was that in a situation where the population slips below a certain threashold it is not possible to hang onto civilization as we know it and that a new civilization has to be born. The children of the tribe instinctively knew this and taught themselves the skills they would eventually need to survive. Think about what happened to previous so-called civilisations in our history to what happened to them in times of climactic change - they disappeared.The haunting part to this whole story is the question what happened next? For me \"Earth Abides\" will be one of the best books I have ever read or am ever likely to read.","Audible.com recently recorded what I think is the first ever audio version of George R. Stewart's classic novel, Earth Abides, so I decided to give it another read. I've read it before of course, but it's probably been almost 20 years since the last time, so I was excited to get into it again.Written in 1949, Earth Abides, is probably the earliest \"modern\" example of a pandemic post-apocalyptic novel. It follows Isherwood Williams, known as just Ish, for a period of about 50 or 60 years, starting after The Great Disaster, an unknown plague that wipes out all but just a few pockets of survivors. We see The Tribe, as they call themselves, started from just seven survivors, as it develops into a group of over a hundred people in the hills of San Francisco.There are hundreds of reviews of the book around the web, so I'll just stick with a few thoughts. It' definitely a good book (it won several awards and is credited by Stephen King as an inspiration for The Stand), and I really enjoyed it myself, but I can see how if you're not a super-fan of the post-apocalyptic genre, you might think it's a little slow in places. The first third or so feels like watching Tom Hanks in Cast Away; there's basically zero dialog as Ish travels around the country looking for other survivors. Even when a few of them gather to start a community, the writing style is mostly descriptive, without a lot of talk.But the material that's covered is perfect for anyone who wonders about how civilization would fare after an apocalypse. Would the children born into the new world be curious about the old one? Would they care to learn to read or to carry on the knowledge of the \"Old Ones\"? Would they view the Old Ones as people like themselves, or would they look on them as gods who created all the indecipherable wonders they see around them?Ish struggles with the answers to these kinds of questions as he tries to preserve and pass on enough knowledge to keep some semblance of civilization, if not simply his people, alive. They face actual dangers, such as wanderers bearing disease, but the greatest threat to the future of The Tribe is their apathy. The few from Before are comfortable enough in their current existence to not want to bother reclaiming the comforts of the old world, and those born after don't know enough about what they're missing to care either. So they live off the corpse of the old world, eating wild animals or out of cans for decades, not bothering to learn how to plant their own crops or keep their own farms.So, if you're looking for a primer on how to keep a small community alive in an urban environment after the collapse of civilization, this isn't it. This is almost an anthropological study, seen as it's happening, of the recreation of society from scratch, and as it goes on, we're not sure if that society will turn out to be recognizable to those of us left behind or not.So like I said before, if you're not a fan of the genre, or are looking for a more action-oriented story, this might not be for you. But for a true fan, Earth Abides is one of the \"Big Ones\", on most every list of the best post-apocalyptic novels ever written, so if you haven't read it yet, you really should.","I first read this book in the 60's as my husband and I were in university. I carried it for about 20 years and lost it and life took over and I never replaced it. But my mind has continued to reflect on passages, in fact, I will tell someone how racial prejudice starts and I got it from this book. It covers a frightening time but the ingenuity, focus, and just \"I will not die\" leaves in the reader ideas that will live with you forever.This morning, I couldn't stand it and went to look for it and found it here at Amazon. Thank you, thank you.","I haven't read this book in at least 35 years yet I feel like I read it only last week. This story was unique in it's treatment of humanity and it's approach to the end of the world. This is not a Man conquers over all obstacles story. The future is bleak but the characters are real humans faced with the end of their civilization. They abide, after a fashion, but not near the same as the humanity we know. I wonder how this might have been done with man's dependence on technology even greater today. This is a classic and deserves more attention.","While doing research in a remote cabin, Isherwood Williams is bitten by a rattlesnake. Emerging from a short delirium, Ish returns to civilization only to find that a new virus has wiped out 99.9% of the Earth's population. Ish sets out to see if he can find any survivors.The story is told in an irregular fashion, slowly detailing Ish's immediate experiences, then speeding into the future only to slow again for years that are more important. I enjoyed the haphazard narrative, but wished that the author had focused more detail during several essential emotional scenes regarding birth and death.The focus of the story revolves around Ish's struggle to preserve the American society against superstitions that threaten to govern the new society. The author touches on many of the possible earth changes that might happen in such a catastrophe. Some systems immediately fail while some last for many years. Fans of Stephen Kings \"The Stand\" will enjoy this similar, yet simpler tale.","Earth Abides was a great book. It is not what you would call an action-packed sci-fi novel. Rather, it is extremely thought provoking. It makes you think about the meaning of life, human relations with other men and with nature, your place in the world, and the value of what you do. Although written in the forties, it is still very relevant because it also makes you question the value of our increasingly faster and busier lifestyles and constant striving for more advanced technology.Yes, like some reviewers did, you can argue with some details, but if this is your main concern you are taking quite a shallow view of it and not seeing the forest for the trees. The beauty of this book is not so much in the details, but in it's enormous scope and ambition.This was a book that I could not put down and one that I think will long influence me.","Earth Abides is an interesting take on the human condition. Whether you agree or disagree with what the author is trying to say, it is definitely a book that makes you think about the story line and characters.While I disagree with most of Stewart's assumptions, it is well written and thought provoking. Definitely a classic that should be read again and again.","\"Earth Abides\" is NOT a science fiction novel, which is probably why many readers...have been disappointed. It is much more a social commentary, a critical examination of the human race, and a thoughtful analysis of where the human race really rates in the grand scheme of things. Thematically, the novel has more in common with Daniel Quinn's \"Ishmael\" than King's \"The Stand.\" Stewart asks us to consider the true meaning of \"civilization\" -- is it all about electricity, running water, and refrigeration? Or is it more about community and survival? Stewart's main character tries valiently to convince the new race of Americans to work together to reform the kind of civilization that led to world overpopulation in the first place (and that overpopulation, he theorizes -- in very Quinn-like reasoning -- results in a very natural plague that wipes out most of the human race). The lessons learned in this compelling novel are both profound and frightening. Could it be possible that some day our ancestors, generations in the future, will look back on us as odd and strange creatures who depended too much on invention and not enough on ourselves? In some ways, the novel is about the conflict between intellectualism and naturalism. In other ways, it's about learning to deal with change. However you read it, \"Earth Abides\" is a terrific book you won't soon forget.","This is one of the great books of the 20th Century. Unfortunately, a poor job was done producing it for Kindle. It seems to me that the print edition was scanned using Optical Character Recognition software and not proofed. It is full of misspellings and incorrect words due to the software limitations. If Amazon expects us to pay for this, they should make some effort to be sure that their product is correct!","The start of this novel was magical for me - so engrossing and so convincing. But then it descends into the comfortable and the suburban. Is this the fate of all human communities? More disappointing was the ugliness of some decisions made by the community - and for me these were far from inevitable or even justifiable. These were presaged on p132 of the SF Masterworks edition - '... except for Evie, the half-witted one, who should never be allowed to have children.' How attitudes have changed since 1949 when this book was written!","This book is about what is wrong with us as humans. The beginning of the book is very interesting as the main character, drives around the country to see what is left in the aftermath of the disease that has wiped out most of the population. After that the book goes downhill. The characters are not that likable. The children are brats, and the adults lack the conviction to make them better people. The items which are in the story aren't realistic (it is very unlikely that gas would not be usable after 20+ years even if stored well), and overall the story just wasn't very interesting to me.","Was disappointed in this book. Expected there to be more action and survivors to be more aggressive in making a better life for themselves. In my opinion people would not act this way in a disaster. They would try to make things better.","This is one of my favorite books of all time and one of the few books that I can re-read. Oddly enough I almost find at times I want to live in the horrible world that is created in the story. Maybe that says more about me than it does about the book though.","I have read this book several times over the years, I really favor this type of fiction (science?) This book is so well written it has stood up to the test of time, as good as any newer fiction of the same genera. Give this book a chance, you won't be sorry. You don't have to buy it, I saw a couple of copies in my local library, I'll bet most full size librarys have a copy. Happy reading.","I loved this book from front to back. Its a beautiful story with characters you can invest in. I have passed it around to many friends and they agree its moving.","This book stands the test of time! A great survival/end of the world book that entertains as much as WWZ (without zombies). Like \"I Am Legend\", Earth Abides tells a great tale of survival of a lone man on earth (without vampires). Love the progression/deterioration of the man made world described here as well as how society evolves. Epic in scope this book covers an entire lifetime, not just a few months or years. I've read this several times and will again one day I'm sure.","Apparently, Amazon shows when a book was last published in the details section, but not when the work was first published. Earth Abides was written in the 40s or 50s.It's an interesting read, but coming with 21st century sensibilities, with ideas of the horrifying chaos and violence should civilization fall from the likes of 2012 (the movie) or Stephen King's The Stand, Earth Abides seems very pastoral and unrealistic. I won't spoil it with too much detail, but two examples are 1) one character is able to drive from California to New York after 99% of humanity had perished. Wouldn't the roads be full of abandoned cars? 2) There's no horrifying killings, rapes, cannibalism, robbery, diseases among the survivors ... something that we know does happen when authority breaks down from real wars in Africa and elsewhere, but in this novel, the only dangers are from failing electricity and running water.I'm not being fair. Stewart is probably reflecting the more naive era of the 1940s or 50s. The book does flow very nicely and I especially LOVE the very nostalgic and melancholic last few chapters of the book.","One of the handful of true classics in the Apocalyptic genre that are Must reads. This account follows a survivor in a post-pandemic world that decimated the human race as he seeks out other survivors and begins to rebuild. Excellent read from page one!!! Solid and believable story line, great characters, and very entertaining! Includes \"year zero!\"","Recently I took it upon myself to read the twelve books describing end of the world scenarios that are being recommended by Amazon in one of its lists. Of the twelve that I read, this is by far my favourite book. George Stewart wrote a story that is both believable and entertaining. In fact, with only a few minor historical references to culture in the 1940's, one could easily think that this book was written yesterday. I regret that the other books written by Stewart are not widely available. I think he's an amazing writer. Buy and read this book. You will not regret your selection.","Though it feels a little dated having been written over four decades ago, &quot;Earth Abides&quot; deserves its place with great 1950s era end-of-the world books like &quot;On the Beach&quot; and &quot;Day of the Triffids.&quot; The scenario is similar to the one Stephen King used in &quot;The Stand&quot; though the plague wipes out a much larger number of people and there is little spiritualism here. What affected me most was the latter part which shows the years passing in the life of the main survisor. I rarely get emotional while reading, but this story did it to me.","Global plague vectored through air travel has beenfeatured in recent films, television specials, andthe news. Set between the European Black Death ofthe late 1600s and this decade's African Ebola,Earth Abides deals with the hope, struggles, andresignation of modern-day plague survivors. Withfewer than one percent of the world's populationsurviving, how would you fare? What wisdom wouldyou pass on to those younger than you? The Centerfor Disease Control intimates that world-wideplague is more a question of When, rather than If.So... how do we begin the day after?Over the years, I've read this provocative bookseveral times, and have enjoyed it more each time.For those who enjoy Crichton's works(Jurassic Park, Congo, or Eaters of the Dead),Earth Abides is a rare find. Kay O'Cullane.","Stewart did an excellent job of putting your hand on thehammer! Classic tale of &quot;What if I were the last man onearth?&quot; Best read out loud at least twice in your lifetime.","I dont write too many reviews any more and I dont want to make this into a flame session but let me get this right Corie (from your review).The book is literally about the last man on earth, and you're indifferent to the character's guarded and self preserving manner. I think you are completely out of sync with the theme, let alone the character. This is a brutally honest portrayal of a human being (with all his short comings) in the wake of oblivion. Not a butterfly in the midst of smoke. It's a reactionary tale, one of struggle and survival. You seem to see it as moment for liberation and righteousness. If anything Corie, you have imposed yourself on this character, in the same vain you speak of.This is the individual, warts and all, and merely hating him does not render this book yucky.As for the racial tone that you claim, as quoted by Powell Timothy \"...its revolutionary (for the time) treatment of racial issues was particularly powerful in the mid-20th century when the book was published, and influenced many contemporary artists, most famously Jimi Hendrix. \"Earth Abides\" was Hendrix's favorite novel, and inspired some of the songs on his first album\"Perhaps, if some of you better relate to decisive characters, you should watch the post apocalyptic TV soap drama, 'Jericho' instead. There you will find your cliche depictions of heroes and villians.","Okay let me tell you how I really feel. WOW!!!I hesitated to buy this book after hearing it did not have much end of the world violence, no undead or lots of dead and has a more clean antiseptic air about it. They were correct but what it lacked in that area was more then made up in the quality and depth of the characters and the uncanny ability of the main character Ish to pull you into the story and carry you along in his experiences. I would compare Earth Abides to a movie from the 30's or 40's where there was more dialog and depth as opposed to many of today's films/books based more on spectacular visual effects and lots of gore but lacking in most every other area and are soon forgotten.(And I like some of those books and movies).Earth Abides has a much stronger human touch or bond as you see Ish from a young man dealing with a plaque that wiped most of humanity away and his final death at old age. What transpired between youth and death for Ish is something I guarantee you will remember for the rest of your life. I have read numerous Sci Fi books and rarely has any reached a level comparable to Earth Abides. This book is a keeper that I will definitely read again in the future.","This book reaches across time and avoids the technology trap. It hits home in many circumstances and is an excellent read. I liked its energy and symbolism. It avoids being grim and actually gives you hope for a disastrous future.","A worldwide virus has killed off nearly all the world's population. Ish starts exploring a world with no rules and few people. He finds some other people and they form &quot;The Tribe&quot; to restart their civilasation. Interesting book, and it actually survives pretty well considering how long ago it was written. There are very few passages in the book that date it significantly.","Earth Abides by George Stewart is one of many post-apocalyptic novels written during the height of the Cold War. However it is quieter and more introspective than most of its peers, something made evident by the manor of disaster that devastates mankind in the novel. Instead of a nuclear inferno, a viral plague almost eradicates humanity. Isherwood &quot;Ish&quot; Williams is trapped in an isolated cabin recovering from a snakebite when the epidemic is unleashed. When he heals and ventures outward, he discovers the near extinction of his species and begins a search for others who immune to the disease.That section is interesting but Earth Abides becomes a truly outstanding novel when Ish discovers others and they found a new society. Stewart takes a sociological approach to this development. He gives a fascinating account of a community completely isolated from other communities and a generation living in a Garden-of-Eden-state, completely isolated from its own past. One of the novel's best moments occurs when an untrustworthy visitor comes to the area and Ish and the other elders must decide what action to take. Their decision will surprise you. Both in the post-apocalyptic genre and the field of science fiction in general, Earth Abides is a gem.","I 1960, I was nine years old, I remember staying up all night during summer vacation to finish it, I still love this book!","I was very disappointed in this book. It was slow, boring, filled with uninteresting characters, and the writing was extremely stilted. And I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to accept that automobiles would still operate after sitting around with gasoline in their tanks for thirty years. I skimmed through most of the book hoping something interesting would happen, but I was utterly dissappointed. There are better books in this genre, don't waste your time with this one.","As I write this, negative reviews of this novel (one or two star reviews) are few and far between. However, I am compelled to join the minority. I could not, in good conscience, recommend this book to anyone. Maybe one needs to be an aficionado of the \"End-of-the-World\" genre to appreciate this book, but I found it to be contrived and unrealistic. The idea that most of the population would die off due to disease, but that the book's protagonist would choose to tool around the countryside calmly musing on a variety of generally immaterial and irrelevant matters seems absurd. Also, for quite awhile, he manages to encounter ONLY unsavory or potentially dangerous fellow survivors. The entire un-dramatic tone of the book seems way out of proportion with the incredible tragedy that has befallen the earth.I very, very rarely leave a book unfinished, and will usually force myself to complete any book I start. But, as they say, \"too many books, too little time\". I could not see giving up valuable reading time on a book that offers so very little to the reader, so eventually put this book aside. For me this is the most gravely negative review I could give a book.","This novel is possibly the worst piece of drivel I've ever tried to force myself through, and I didn't make it. I quit, and honestly I almost never do that. Ish is maybe the most detestable figure I have ever had the displeasure of meeting on the page. He's a passive aggressive psycho, a terrible father and leader, and the last man you would want to rebuild civilization. In this type of scenario, anyone with any intelligence that came into contact with him would disengage quickly. I simply might have shot him for being a drain of precious resources. If the whole point centers on the fact that most or any man would fail in this situation, I would have preferred that Stewart kill off Ish in a 20 page short story.","I see many people loved this book, but having just finished it, I just don't get the appeal it has for so many people. I found it incredibly boring and tedious. I do not exaggerate when I say I spent an afternoon struggling with it, nodding off to sleep every two or three paragraphs. To his credit, Stewart raises a number of issues about science and human nature, but it is done in the context of an uneventful story. The first book in years that almost made me abandon it halfway through, but I fought it out to the end. I remained disappointed.","Wow I can't remember the last time I started to hope something bad would happen to the main character in a story. Worst main character in a book ever. Annoying, Lazy, sexist, racist, boring and anti-religionist. Maybe it was the slow story line. Maybe it was the fact that NOTHING happens to the characters after the first 100 pages. I don't know. But I hate this book. I felt like yelling \"Get up and do something!!\" The power goes out and he sits. The streets start to flood and he sits. The water stops running and he sits!! Then he starts to think of himself as a god!! haha. The best part of the book is the end. Why? (spoiler)he dies and you don't have to read anymore.Sorry to ramble but my mind is cloudy now from finishing that \"book\".Do not buy this book. Get it from the library read the first 75 pages then take it back.","This book is dull, slow, and predictable. I read most of it hoping that it would pick up but it never did. I usually like these type of disaster books too. Lucipher's Hammer is ten times better than this one. I really have no idea how this book could have 5 stars.","Having skimmed the other reviews, it seems that one had to read this book as a young person and use those glowing memories to enjoy it. Since I approached the book fresh, the flaws are glaring.The main character, Ish, is pretty dull. There isn't much dialogue in the book, so most speech is communicated through his hearing others and describing what they meant. Since he's not particularly insightful, reading is slow and the pages creep by.Civilization seems completely lost despite the fact that books, machines, etc. remain intact. Ish rules The Tribe, who are a step or so above a Neanderthal group. They even walk from place to place like hunter-gathers. How about using the million and one bicycles laying around if you can't figure out how to get gas for a car?The book is not poorly written, just improbable and boring.","The concept of how civilization slowly succumbs to the forces of nature was an interesting concept. That part of the novel was very good. Ish the main character of the book was the leader of a small community of survivors. He sees himself as the most intelligent of them all and for some reason wants to keep it that way. He locks up a library and only he has access to it. Once children are born and old enough to go to school he cancels it, no children of the new world learn to read. Nobody seems to want to become self-sufficient but relies on the products of a past civilization. A stranger comes to join them and Ish murders him out of jealously that his role might be challenged. From then on he carries the hammer he killed the stranger with, with him all the way to his death. No interest was ever sparked by anyone to learn to read, farm, make things or anything else. Everyone lives off of canned goods for 20+ years. I won't say anything more in case the reader of this has not read the book and would like too. Ultimately I was disappointed but would recommend it anyway.","Earth Abides is a book about no matter what happens to the race of people, Earth will always abide. A Man named Isherwood Williams somehow survives this fatal virus that is going around killing the whole human population. Ish then spends almost the rest of his life driving across the country searching for survivors. When he finally meets a group of survivors he \"marries\" one of them and has about twenty children with her.Ish does find a few survivors, however it was definitely not enough to keep me interested in finishing the book. I thought this book was long, drawn out and sometimes too boring. If George R. Stewart, the author, would have spiced it up a bit with more science fiction things happening. For instance if more abnormal things happening to the humans than just death like it was a flesh eating virus and then something else happened with the virus. The genre of the book is Science Fiction. The plot this author had in mind was a god idea however if it was only about one hundred pages shorter and the ending with the twenty children was cut then it would have been easier to keepinterest.So all in all the book had very few parts that could have beenedited out and still would have made sense. The idea of the book and the plot of the book was good. I like the little reality the book had in it. Again if there were more science fiction, and less pages, it also might have been better. So that is why I gave the book a measly two stars out of five. I think this a reasonable amount and I commend the author on his work. I would recomend this book to someone who loves to read and is interested in books about little science fiction and little reality.","The protagonist is arrogant, lazy and stupid. He likes to sit around smoking cigarettes and thinking about how much smarter he is than all the other survivors while his wife cooks him meals and takes care of his children. He doesn't bother to teach his children to read, and he doesn't bother to learn anything medical or mechanical or any other potentially useful skills in a post-apocalyptic world. At one point he runs across some other survivors who are Black, and he thinks about how he could stay and \"be king\" of them because he is white. The ultimate self-absorbed old white man fantasy.","I read this book based on other reviews - having searched for good post-apocalypse novels. After reading Cormac McCarthy's \"The Road\", I was preparing myself for a depressing, yet thought-provoking read. \"Earth Abides\" was a thrill to read, and I kept turning back to remind myself that it was originally published in 1949! I thought the complete absence of any \"modern\" references to today's highly computerized world would make the story instantly outdated, but in fact, the opposite was true, for if we lost power, we would have to revert to very basic skills, just like Ish and his tribe did. This truly is a book that will stay with me for a very long time. Highly recommended!","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it. This maturity is perceptible all along this work.The story is situated in a world devastated by a sudden pestilence that annihilates most of the humankind. Taking into account the last SARS epidemic that jumped abruptly from China to Canada it doesn't look an impossible scenario.Isherwood Williams comes down from an isolate spot in the mountains to discover an empty world. He starts a search all across USA, from California to New York and back again. He finds only isolate human cells, couples or trios, overwhelmed by catastrophe and in a near catatonic state. Returns to his native town and contemplate with a certain scientific detachment the fading world around him.Mr. Stewart intercalate brief vignettes describing what happens to dogs, cats, cattle, plants, roads, dams, bridges, contrasting them with Ish's daily experiences.Little by little the story grip reader's attention and even if action is somehow slow, the book can't be putted down.Human cells began to draw near each other and a rather feeble structure starts to grow up.This is the story.The author approaches universal questions about survival and extinction; civilization and savagery; social structure and anomie. He also examines religious values, ethics and the ultimate sense of life itself.This book gives the reader a lot of stuff to think about. A very enticing read!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","I read this book over and over, loving it more each time. It gives the reader alot to think about because even though it's ficitonal, it is still possible. It is about a man who goes up into the mountains for some time, gets bitten by a snake and becomes very ill. He rests in his mountain cabin for several days, coming close to death, but eventualy regaining his strength. When he left the mountains and headed back home, he noticed the town was dead...literally. Very well written. I bought a new copy because mine was falling apart. Buy this book.","Like some of the other reviewers, I read this book 25-30 years ago. It changed how I viewed the value of the work we do. Stewart makes a strong case that if we can't maintain the infrastructure of our phyical world (roads, bridges, water works, electric plants, etc.), all our knowledge about the rest of the world is for naught.Stewart also explores &quot;events in nature&quot; and how them affect humans. In his book Storm, Stewart quotes Sir Napier Shaw: &quot;Every theory of the course of events in nature is necessarily based on some process of simplification of the phenomena and is to some extent therefore a fairy tale.&quot;In Storm the phenomena is a Siberian wind blowing south; in The Earth Abides, it is a virus. In both cases the earth is fine, but human are worst for wear.By the way, like The Earth Abides, Storm, and a third Stewart book, Fire, are set in Northern California. Everyone familiar with the great Pacific storms or the forest fires, will find these books fascinating.","I enjoyed this book and appreciated the thoughtful way in which the author depicted how the world could be with only a few humans left in it. Stewart covers a lot of topics (religion, education, environment, race, family, marriage, etc.) and how they would evolve or devolve over several decades. He describes a world where random people are left alive and those people may not be the most suitable people to live under the new conditions. The story moves along fairly quickly and generally kept me interested, if not fascinated.Some other reviewers mentioned how the main character, Ish, seems a little devoid of emotion at times. I agree, but I found another trait in main character more annoying. He spends a large amount of brainpower philosophizing and lamenting the lack of intelligence and motivation in the rest of the tribe. While Ish does some teaching, the children never learn reading or basic math skills. They also never work on any improvement projects or learn to recreate any of the basic disposable items they use regularly. My complaint is that Ish doesn't do any of those things either. I blame him for many of their failings. You could say that his shortcomings are realistic, but it drove me a bit crazy.Overall, this was an enjoyable read.","This book makes me want to explore Amazon's return policy for Kindle editions.Barring that, it has made me learn how to delete items from my Kindle.It has also taught me to pay attention to negative reviews.It is simply awful. Why, then, 2 stars?Well, the story - once you get past its one massively huge, incredibly off-putting major flaw - isn't too bad. Many folks have pointed out factual issues (ever volatile gasoline and canned goods that never go bad), and called these fatal flaws. I attribute them to the publication date: maybe, in 194x, when personal automobiles, gasoline, and canned goods were still fairly new, it simply wasn't known that they both spoil? I don't know, but those details weren't killers for me.What ruined the story, then? The protagonist. Our hero. I've read books with villians who were infinitely more likeable than the main character, Ish. He's a contemptible, amoral, elitist sociopath and I feel dirty having inhabited his mind for the past 2 days.I can kind of understand his elitish judgement of the people around him. Again, consider the context of the 1940s. Even today, college degrees are relatively rare (even though I think many of us who have them forget this fact. They are almost universal in the people with whom I associate, but still only 10% of the US population have them.), and in the 40s they were rarer still. So our disgusting hero was part of an elite at the time, and the majority of the population probably did not possess even high school diplomas. Once I realized that, he became slightly less unpalatable.However, our hero, Ish, views the near extinction of humanity with no more emotion than I view an empty of box cereal in the morning. In fact, I think I have more emotion over the cereal. His reaction to learning his parents have died? Effectively, \"eh, so what. What's in the fridge for dinner?\" Similarly, for no reason, he considers simply shooting the dog that accompanies him and, later, decides to shoot two cows just because. Not for survival or meat, really, just because he had a gun and they were there.He has no qualms about simply looting whatever he needs (a viable survival skill, I'll grant you), but views with contempt a group he encounters on his road trip who didn't move into a more palatial home simply because they could - and who are doing a more effective job of adapting to their new situation.He meets a couple in New York who insist on pretending nothing has changed, and looks down upon him. Yet the rest of the book, he exhibits nearly this exact behavior - living off canned food rather than adapting. He constantly disparages his colleagues in the Tribe for lacking imagination and drive, yet for all his superior intellect and thinking and ideas, does exactly nothing to drive change.I thought, eventually, that the author had made him so utterly horrible deliberately and that, over time, we'd see a metamorphosis in Ish, an awakening in him that he was not the paragon of humanity he believed. There are hints, here and there: his admitting that, though she's stupid, his wife was the true strength in the Tribe, etc. But, in the end, this contemptible human is still full of himself, believing his descendent's view him as a 'god', and, sadly, is still the same, utterly obnoxious, foul human that he started as. He takes pride in this, too, which is pathetic: to have survived the death of civilization, to have had even a weak hand in its rebirth, and to believe that the experience has left you utterly unchanged, that you would have been the same person if society had simply carried on, is truly sad.","George Stewart's super-classic is my favorite SciFi sub-genre--the demise of man by one means or another. Stewart uses a pandemic virus which is a bit cliche--oops, wait a minute, he did it first! Everyone _else_ is the cliche. His writing is dark and literary, brought to life by his protagonist, Isherwood Williams', gloomy, introspective personality. Stewart does not develop the science behind the virus, but given that he wrote the story in 1947, I suppose he can be forgiven. On the other hand, H.G. Wells and Jules Verne forcast many technological wonders in their stories, so maybe Stewart could have gone out on a creative limb just a wee bit more than he did. Nevertheless, the real gem of the story is Stewart's portrayal of the demise of mankind--not the virus that reduced his population to a handful--but the demise of his culture, his literature, his creative energy. It seems we humans are what we are because with great numbers of people scarfing up every last spot of ground and every last resource, each individual has to be ever on his toes just to turn a buck. Take away the people, say, overnight, and the detritus of their civilization becomes easy pickings for the surviving few. No need to grow anything to eat--just open up a can. When they ran out of cans, it was almost as easy to hunt for dim-witted, slow-footed domestic cattle, now living in the wild. But the real casualty was culture. Several generations after Ish, people no longer spoke Ish's English, at least not so he could understand it. Culture too appears to be a product of crowds. Stewart set the bar for this SciFi sub-genre. There have been many since 1949, including my own example listed below, but he has yet to be equalled.--Ejner Fulsang, author of \"A Destiny of Fools\", [...] 2007","This is the granddaddy of post apocalyptic novels. Whenever I read this book I see bits of so many post apocalyptic novels in it. Well written, well delivered. If you like post apocalyptic books then read this one. It wasn't until the release of EARTH THE NEW FRONTIER that I read a better end of the world book than Earth Abides. Both of these are classics in the post-apocalyptic genre.","This is a book that rewards close reading--not skimming. Written in 1949, it is still a haunting and poignant read. Those who dismiss this as cliche must remember that this is the book that gave birth to the cliche, the first truly prophetic biological-apocalypse piece of writing, and all who come after must merely stand on its shoulders. Re-released in the &quot;SF Masterpiece&quot; series, and deservedly so.","Earth Abides is a book concerning a plague that kills off most of humanity and the survivors' attempts to reconstruct civilization. The pace of the book is rapid in the beginning and the reader doesn't have to get very far before they realize something terrible has happened. We are initially with one character, Isherwood Williams, who seems emotionally well suited to survive this tragedy in which 99% of everyone has died in the space of two to three weeks. The story continues with Ish traveling across the country looking for survivors and eventually returning to his home in Berkeley, CA where he meets a woman, Em, and they marry each other. Slowly a group of people calling themselves &quot;The Tribe&quot; forms and Ish tries to lead his small group back towards civilization and away from a more &quot;primitive&quot; existence.Strengths are the good character development as well as interesting asides on how the world is readjusting to no longer having man dominate it. It offers some interesting insights on human nature and societies in general and as a disaster book ranks highly on the list. In a sense it is like The Stand except for that this plague is strictly natural, not a tool for a climatic battle between good and evil. The plague simply comes and kills humanity off and that is that.Some of the negatives are found in the style of writing. This book was written in the late 1940's and the language used is rather dry. The author seems to go overboard on his word usage and sometimes seems to be talking down to the audience a bit.Still, if you like disaster stories you should pick up Earth Abides, it is well worth any effort.Robert Merkamp","When I write &quot;one of the most memorable books I've read,&quot; that's saying something, because I've kept up a pace of reading at least four books a week since before entering Kindergarten and am now 67. I borrowed EARTH ABIDES from the library a year after it came out, in 1950, when I was a 14-year-old high school sophomore, reading everything and anything labeled &quot;science fiction.&quot; I didn't own the book until fairly recently, but it stayed vividly in my memory. I could call up characters like fussy Maureen, stolid George, loyal Em and the tragic genius child, Joey. I remembered the fascinating journey across America, the vague frustration I felt (even so young) over Ish's passive character and the generally negative slide of the tribe from scavenging off civilization into what appeared almost to be an Upper Paleolithic lifestyle at the novel's end--not even qualifying as barbarism.But it's Stewart's refusal to tread the usual Golden Age sci-fi path and make Ish a superscience hero that makes the novel very special. Ish may be a scientist, he's academically bright, but like many people he's low in energy, street-smarts, and foresight. By and large his motley clan possesses even lower survival skills. They aren't much different from the Valley Girls in another good story in the end-of-the-world genre, the movie NIGHT OF THE COMET. Both are based on an understanding that if the human race's average IQ is 100, half the people who are likely to survive a major disaster aren't going to be awfully competent. Stewart certainly knew that, and it provided both the uncanny realism and the rather depressing pessimism of this story. It's fascinating to note that the other reviewers have noted both aspects of EARTH ABIDES.","George R. Stewart weaves at once a beautiful and hauntingly believable tale with this novel, one that I've never been able to forget...or wanted to. Once considered dated, with the lessening of global nuclear tensions, the scenario Mr. Stewart envisions for a possible worldwide catastrophe, one brought about not by bombs but disease, has once again come to the forefront and become the most plausible ingredient in mankind's demise. More even than the fact that this is a truly enjoyable read is the deeper message Earth Abides shares with the reader as it reaches down and touches our very hearts, defining what it means to be human in an inhuman environment. The symbolism involved in Isherwood Williams' desire to keep a hammer with him for the future as a tie to the past is obviously an unconscious comment on his personal hope of rebuilding a fallen civilization. A hope that goes unfulfilled in his life time and maybe many lifetimes to follow. The insight into the human psyche that Mr. Stewart demonstates as he carries Isherwood from his youth at the beginning of the book to old age and finally death at the end and Isherwood's subtle change of attitude during that process, rings exceedingly true and speaks volumes about Mr. Stewart's keen and perhaps unique ability to put into words what it really means, or at least should mean, to be human. I've rarely read a book more than once because I just don't have the time, but I've read Earth Abides several times since I was a teen and I know I'll read it several more times before I too reach that stage in my life that Isherwood assures us won't be the calamity our youth oriented culture would have us to believe.","Due to a multitude of rude comments regarding this review I will edit to please. Here goes... NON-SPOILER ALERTI can't expound upon this book as some of the reviewers have. Nor can I recall in exact detail everything in the book.But I can add value in this way.... I read this book 30 years ago, and I still think about it. I can remember the xxxxxx, the xxxxx that xxxx the main character, the waves of xxxxx xxxxxx after the event... the xxxx, the forced xxxx, the eventual shut down of the xxxxx xxxxx as the xxxxxxxxx started to xxxxx. The shift from xxxxxxxxxx( for years) to xxxxxxx for themselves.The last breaths of the xxxxxxx and the xxxxxx for the xxxxxxx, the xxxx which every year the xxxxxxx took up to the xxxxx and xxxxx the time since the xxxxx.30 Years.... and I still think about it. How many books, movies, songs... etc... do you expect to think about 30 years down the road. You probably wouldn't even remember the title let alone a rough outline.Will I read it again? Certainly! I ran into a young lady reading this on the subway a few years back, and we had a wonderful conversation... it's that kind of a book.SPOILAGE AVERTED --- Skol","One thing that disturbs people about Earth Abides is its incredible humbling realism about the human condition. People who read it come away profoundly unnerved by the idea that civilization is not something guaranteed to come into existence if we lose it and that it requires an enormous convergence of many different kinds of stimulus to create the energies needed within a race of men to bring it into being. Even the most gifted races of people on the Earth can barely hold it together in the best of times, George Stewart shows us how easily it can all fall apart and remain in a primeval condition for untold generations.The protagonist Isherwood suffers from the same disease that afflicts even the best of men - he lacks direction, loses initiative, becomes too preoccupied with the daily stresses of living and watches his life trickle away in the post apocalyptic environment without ever seeming to summon the right kinds of ambitions to carry out his grand dreams of rebuilding the old world.Stewart was quite prophetic considering when this book was written because many modern anthropologists have since confirmed that many previous civilizations have died out precisely because of this &quot;critical threshold&quot; of the division of labor and sheer numbers of vanished races being too low to sustain a breeding population and achieve the critical mass that leads to a progress oriented civilization. Stewart was very perceptive too be able to articulate this phenomenon and even narrate its exact trajectory following the loss of so many people who were vital components in the world that Isherwood regrets the demise of.The most disturbing aspect for me was that I see much of the exact decay of western civilization going on right now all around us and we have not even have a catastrophic plague yet. The same loss of purpose, of drive, of a sense of our own individual worth as a nation and a desire to maintain our sovereignty is slowly giving way to the degenerative notion of a world socialist government of faceless consumers who lack any culture beyond the food court and cineplex.The terrifying thing about the book &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that it is the story of our world and the modern era ... even before we suffer the inevitable collapse of our civilization in the physical sense. The reality is that we see it all crumbling around our eyes into the multicultural carnival of formlessness and we often find ourselves as helpless and feckless as Ish himself in doing anything about it.Highest rating, possibly on the top 100 list of best fiction I've ever read. I consider Stewart to be the author of a modern classic in publishing this book. It is so much more than simply speculative fiction, it contains eternal truths.","As I look at the many Amazon customer comments, I see a real split between very favorable and unfavorable reviews. This seems to be because some readers are looking for conventional science fiction/fantasy or adventure. Much as I love those genres, this isn't it, so if that's what you're looking for, save yourself the trouble and don't read Earth Abides. If you do read it, don't expect it to be something it's not.Earth Abides is a book for people with a strong streak of curiosity, who cannot resist thinking and speculating about the human condition. If this is you, few books will satisfy you as well as this one. It first captivated me when I was 14 - yes, there are teens who would be very excited by this book - and I am now on my fourth reading. There is no other novel to which I have returned so regularly. If you are possessed of this curious, speculative streak, then you will appreciate the protagonist, Ish, who himself is driven to understand the horrible event that has overcome the world and to raise and shape a new world. You will also appreciate the realism of the action and characters, and the underlying drama of the situation and tragic heroism of Ish, and you will not for a minute miss the contrived drama and heroism that make for conventional action fiction.","I read this book in '75. Since then I've been pretty much obsessed by it and other eoc novels (End Of Civilisation). I've looked for a book that had similar 'feel' to it. Unfortuntaly 'The Stand', 'Alas, Babylon' or 'Swan Song' don't capture the same magic. The closest I've come to simulate the read experience that was 'Earth Abides' is Alfred Coppel's 'Dark December' or Brian Hodge' 'Dark Advent'.Out of all 300+ eoc novels I've picked up over the last 25 years, 'Earth Abides' STILL ranks as the best. It's probably my all time favorite novel...I think I'm going to go read it again...","First published in 1949, this novel won the 1951 International Fantasy Award in Fiction (the first one awarded) even though this is not a true fantasy novel. The International Fantasy Awards were originated by four British science fiction and fantasy fans (Leslie Flood, John Beynon Harris, G. Ken Chapman, and Frank A. Cooper) for the 1951 British science fiction convention. The awards lasted between 1951 and 1957. George R. Stewart (1895-1980) was a Professor of English at the University of California in Berkeley. This well-read novel is about life after a plague has killed all but a few people on Earth. Isherwood Williams, a graduate student in geography, returns from a trip to the mountains to find everyone dead. He travels throughout the land and finds a female survivor. They settle down in the Bay Area around San Francisco and a small community grows around them. As time goes by, Isherwood tries to teach the children reading and the knowledge of the past. As the decades go by, he discovers that he is the only one who recalls the greatness of the past. Humans have become a band of hunter-gatherers. History has come full circle. &quot;...men go and come, but earth abides.&quot; Carl Sandburg considered it one of the best novels of its time. It is regarded by many as a masterpiece and was a precursor for many later disaster novels (note that one of the voters of the International Fantasy Award was J. B. Harris, whose pseudonym was John Wyndham and author of another classic disaster novel, &quot;The Day of the Triffids.&quot; One of the earlier reviewers suggested that Wyndham was a better disaster writer. But, &quot;Triffids&quot; came out in 1951, and Wyndham still chose &quot;Earth Abides.&quot;). The name &quot;Isherwood&quot; is a direct reference to Ishi, the last surviving member of a California Indian tribe who was brought to the University by Kroeber of the Anthropology Department (many science fiction enthusiasts are very familiar with Kroeber's daughter, Ursula K. Le Guin). Ishi is still quite famous in the study of native American cultures. This book has had such an impact in the development of the science fiction genre that it is now required reading for all serious students of science fiction and speculative literature.","Very rarely do I finish a book and immediately recommend it to other people. Mostly books help pass the time and end up portraying the same plot; another female FBI agent trying to catch a serial killer who ends up stalking her. However, after reading Earth Abides I called up my brother and told him to pick it up. The book, while written some 50 years ago is still topical. The book takes you on a journey of how a person survives after a disaster that wipes out almost the whole population. It then takes you deeper, you find yourself emotionally involved with the character. And you realize that George Stewart has moved from an tale of physical survival into a tale of emotional conflict. The transition is smooth and the two easily complement each other. If you enjoy reading about a world where civilization has been wiped clean and a new world must start over. I highly recommend this book. The writing was engaging and intelligent without confusing you. The storyline was deep and involving. Overall, the main character becomes immediately identifiable. The book ends; but the world created by George Stewart lives on in our imagination. And, I believe that is a definition of a good book.","As of this date there are 158 reviews of George R. Stewart's Earth Abides here in Amazon.com. I'm not sure that writing a 159th will really add any value or if anyone will even make all the way to #159 to see it. But I feel very strongly about this book and to the intrepid reader who gets this far, I hope it helps you to decide to give the book a try.I was 12 years old in 1968 when my Mother gave me this book to read. She was (and still is) a voracious reader. But she has never liked or appreciated science fiction. Then again, she never considered this book to be science fiction. I read the book in one day that summer and have read it at least a half dozen times in the 35 years since then. And I would agree. Although often voted as one of the best science fiction books of all time, I don't really think of it as science fiction. Stewart was not a science fiction writer. Rather he was more of an ecological writer looking at how the planet behaves in relation to specific circumstances. Two of his other novels, Fire and Storm are good examples of this.One area I differ strongly from my Mom is, I do have a good appreciation for science fiction as well as other apocolyptic fiction. Ray Bradbury, Frank Herbert, Robert Heinlein, Philip Jose Farmer and Issac Asimov have thrilled and entertained me for years. But Earth Abides was what got me started and remains my favorite piece of fiction.Earth Abides is a simple \"what if\" story. What if virtually every person on earth died and only a handful were left? Given the book's publication date in 1949, it was groundbreaking. No one had really written a novel on this topic before this. Virtually all the other books in this genre owe a debt of gratitude to Stewart. Books such as The Stand by Stephen King, Alas Babylon by Pat Frank, Malevil by Robert Merle, Lucifer's Hammer by Niven & Pournelle and Swan Song by Robert McCammon included.Stewart must have had his influences, but not from a book or author of this kind. Therefore the story does not focus on war or technology or industry (or science fiction). Instead it is a tale of how the people might behave under the circumstances, the struggles they deal with, the decisions they make and the decisions they fail to make. It is also a tale of how the earth changes and the previous efforts of mankind are so easily erased.Some reviewers here have criticized the main character Ish as being too passive. But this is a part of the novel that rings very true for me. How agressive would one be after living through a time when virtually everyone else dies? Wouldn't most people struggle to survive, never mind thrive?I won't give away the plot for anyone who has gotten this far. Plus if you've made it all the way to this review, you've seen the plot described almost 158 times. In the end the book is both depressing and uplifting. It is depressing in that most of man's advancements appear to be lost by the end of the book. But it is uplifting to realize that the earth heals itself and in the end man will start fresh.The book is both a product and a victim of it's time period, the late 1940's. Some of it will feel a little dated, after all it's over 50 years old and think what has happened in those 50 years. But remarkably, it still comes across as fresh. And with very little update could be brought up to present day and still be a powerful piece of fiction.All in all this is a great read for most people. For those looking for a hard core science fiction look at the end of the world, go watch the Terminator movies.","&quot;Earth Abides&quot; is a wonderful literary work. It's a shame that it's catalogued as a work of &quot;science fiction&quot; because it is so much more than that. I'm sure that many serious literary fans have failed to pick up on this teriffic book because of that &quot;tag&quot;.The book has a tremendous &quot;hook&quot; line - that being, &quot;almost the entire human race is eradicated by a terrible catastrophe&quot;. The plot is very believable and amazing when you consider that the novel was written in 1949. Author George Stewart is a great storyteller and has created some very interesting characters. The hero of this book, &quot;Ish&quot;, is both a &quot;superman&quot; and an &quot;everyman&quot;. He is both the leader of his tribe, but also easily led. His development as a person and as the head of his people is a wonderful progression throughout the book. His wife, &quot;Em&quot; exhibits all the great characteristics of the strong woman behind the &quot;great man&quot;. And, let me say that the symbolism of Ish's hammer was a very interesting facet of the book.My only criticism (and it's a pretty minor one) is that the book did not go into enough detail regarding the disaster and how other people throughout the country were affected. I think that this would have added some rich &quot;body&quot; to the storyline.All things considered though, this indeed is a book for the ages.It belongs with some of the best works of that era, such as &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot;, &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, and later &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. As an educator, I would really urge school officials to add this novel to their list of great American Literary selections for high school students.But, do yourself a favor - go to the library or your local bookstore get a copy of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; and delve into this great classic with its timeless message about the unshakeable human spirit!","Earth AbidesEarth Abides, a novel by George Stewart taps into people's fascination of being the last one on earth. In this book the main character Isherwood Williams (Ish) survives arattlesnake bite in the mountains and returns to find almost every single person dead from a cataclysmic plague. Ish survives the plague and explores. While exploring he finds other survivors and they try re-founding American civilization. They live above San Francisco Bay in the Berkeley hills.Although this novel is well written and very real, I did not like it. The author put a lot of thought into it but it just didn't interest me. This book wasn't all boring, it hadsome good things about it. One of which is how it was frightening because this could really happen to mankind if we don't watch out, but there was more dull things than scarythings in this book. I also thought that it was weird that Ish and the rest of the community were so interested in caring on civilization instead of thinking about their own survival.The only reason that I finished this book is that it is based in the bay area and that is where I live so I can relate to the scenery that the author describes. If you didn't live in the bayarea then this would be one more thing that wouldn't interest you.I would not recommend this novel. It is interesting at the beginning but then gets boring. It is too long and the author seems to drag on subjects to the point where I don'tcare anymore. If you were going to read this book I would say it is best suited to high school or college students. If a young person read it I don't think that they would understand it.","This book Earth Abides by George R. Stewart is about a man who passes by a massive disease which basically obliterates the US. This man, Ish, has to come to realization of this huge crisis and try to find survivors. It goes on and on about his thoughts and shows the struggles that he faces it the horrid situation. He goes around america finding survivors and ends up making a huge family in the end.This book was basically boring and depressing because it was just lagging on and on about how he thought of everything. It made you want to fall fast asleep at times too. (something that i obviously did) I am one of those kind of people who likes adventure and this book had none. It just was one of those books that wanted to show how horrible things could happen to us if we don't watch it. It sort of chilling and makes you depressed to think that it could happen. George R. Stewart was probably giving a good message out when he wrote this, but in the sense that people want to live there lives without this catastrophe, it is not very good.I would not recommend this book to kids under the age of 12 because it probably is too advanced for them. Also because kids do not have to worry about this sort of horror happening to them at that young of an age. People who need to sleep at night and want to fall asleep fast, please read. If you like adventure and mystery in a book, please go find a different book.","The book earth abides was about a man who passes up a massive disease that spreads throughout america and basically obliterates it.

As the book goes on it shows the will of human survival and the horror of this situation.I thought that the book was a little too slow. I am sort of a adventure book reader and this book had slim to none. It just went on about Ish's thoughts for like 2 chapters at a time. It made you want to just fall asleep everytime u read it. It was dull most of the times, but it does make you think how bad it would be if that sort of thing happened to the country.I would say that this book would not be very appealing to young kids because it is too advanced for them. I would recommend this to people who need to fall asleep at night definately. Also if you like to hear about the deep thoughts of a person who has no one to talk to for weeks, read this book. If you are an adventure or mystery reader who likes action, do not get this book.","\"Men come and go, but Earth abides.\" These chilling words written by George R. Stewart leave the reader feeling bare and stripped in the popular science fiction novel \"Earth Abides.\" A novel I read and still can't decide what to think about it.This book is filled with puzzling situations, frustrating moments, and mind-bending problems that make the reader ask, \"What would I do?\"Plague has struck the world, and people are dying by the millions. A lone survivor, Ish, on a mountain camping trip manages to fend off the disease with snakebite. He returns to a frozen, empty world, and is determined to find civilization and life in the seemingly dead planet. Most of the people he meets are in shock, having seen the horrors of death and destruction of the planet and are stupefied, unable to talk sense or even take care of themselves. One man Ish comes across is drinking himself to death; only eating things out of cans and seems only half-alive. Through his journey's, Ish has a growing urge to settle down and establish life as he knew it again. He alone must save the human race.I thought this book was very interesting, at first. The beginning was intriguing and exciting to think about. But after a while, the idea became old, and boring. Ish just begins to muse over the world's pathetic state, talk about how he's the only intelligent person left, and even starts to become a little snobbish to say the least. The way women were used merely as wombs, though logical in such a situation, got a little annoying also. The detail and wordiness left my mind to wonder away from the book, and I even recall something as simple as a storm drain overflowing taking up two pages to talk about. Ish's endless attempts to get people to think and work for themselves also become a bit momentous and bothersome. It really makes you want to slowly go crazy along with Ish, as you read his \"bible\", page after page of musing nonsense. I really wanted to tell him to start enjoying life and give up on trying to control everyone's thoughts and actions, just to let things go. But there were moments of truly beautiful writing and raw honesty that drew me out of the droning slump. When Ish finds something to believe in, though, it was really disappointing to have it destroyed so suddenly. Ish becomes so obsessed with saving the world, he becomes very self righteous and stuck up, he transforms from a hero into someone you are sick of and increasingly angry with. The author looses his grip on the story and turns the book into a guide of what to do if you find out the world's population has come to an end, and it's up to you, being the only truly sane and intelligent person, to save the planet. The character's personalities fade, and you are left with a bunch of names and occasional dialogue.The novel begins with a bang, and ends with a whimper, which makes the reader want to whine as well. It was not something I'd want loved ones to read, but I would highly recommend the first two hundred pages, and then move on to something else. The people who say they truly enjoyed this book through and through, in my opinion, are liars. It's a thoughtfully written piece, and deserves the recognition it receives, but if you are looking to be entertained, find another book, \"Earth Abides\" will leave you out in the cold.","It's amazing how despite half a century of technological advancement the Earth Abides is largely just an expanded version of the Red Plague by John Steinbeck.","Good story, but a bit unbelievable. Characters reasonably developed.Mostly clean, no gratuitous sex or violence, but some crude language.","Excellent book.. Highly recommend it. Very well written. Takes you through generations. a great read!","Dated but thought provoking aptly describes this novel. Set in post-nuclear holocaust America. excellent.","earth abides may have been original when it came out a zillion years ago but it's dated now and can't compete with stories being written today. the hero is some boob who survives the plague only by stepping on a rattlesnake? wow. and then he can't even teach children to read. why not? there are some good moments here and there, but in the end this book is a yawn.","The idea of an apocalyptic end of our planet and of humankind has always been extremely prevalent in society. From religion to movies, theories of annihilation can be found everywhere. But few books attempt to tackle the subject of life after the end. I think George Stewart wrote this book in the 60's and I wanted to see what his ideas were on that subject. The premise was great, but I was extremely disappointed with Earth Abides because Stewart brings in many themes/ideas but never goes into any of them in any detail whatsoever. There is absolutely no emotional connection with any of the characters,and even less so with Ish, the main character. I felt like I was waiting for something to happen throughout the book, and it never came. The author attempts to tackle way too many &quot;big&quot; subjects at the same time, and in the end,he fails. The only reason I gave this book even one star is because the reader can learn about how the world may deteriorate in the future when man is no longer here.One could say that that is a positive thing.","I'm not going to defend it; excellence stands the test of time, and this one has been around for decades (1949). I would simply ask you to read it for yourself.\"Ish\" came to be one of my favorite literary characters and an inspiration for my own work.","'Earth Abides' is a classic novel of the end of human civilization and it's rebirth. Unlike other apocalyptic sci-fi fantasy novels in the mold of Mad Max, there are no weapon wielding skin headed cannibals roaming the wasteland. In fact the only violence in this novel is an encounter with a pack of wild dogs and the heart rendering decision the community makes to deal with one of the human survivors. In light of recent research exemplified by books such as 'The World Without Us', 'Earth Abides' is astonishing prophetic and knowledgeable. You might say that this novel is an environmentalist's apocalyptic novel 50 years ahead of its time. The novelist's understanding of modern ecology is amazing considering when it was written. The theme of the novel is stated in the title. Human civilization may disappear but earth will abide. A modern classic that should not be missed.","Isherwood Williams is away in the mountains pursuing his graduate field studies in geology. In our iPhone, instant connectivity world it is hard to imagine the isolation this kind of trip entailed in the 1950's when George Stewart wrote his book. Recovering from a snake bite, Ish stumbles back from the hills to find most of humanity wiped out by disease. We follow Ish through the remainder of his life as he comes to terms with a changing Earth--an Earth on which humanity is a barely noticeable presence.The absence of humanity is not only a stark fact, but is emphasized by the author's writing style. Ish is a clear introvert and we experience much of the Earth's change through his internal monologue. Even when he encounters, interacts with, and teams up with other people, this produces very little dialogue. This style underscores the aloneness of the book's characters. It's not loneliness, in the emotional sense, but a continuing reminder that other people no longer play a significant role in the world.The Earth itself becomes an evolving character in the book. We experience the successive rise and fall in populations of insects, rats, dogs and other species as seasons in the Earth's changing life. The diminishing resources scavenged by human beings from cities and storehouses are important to their survival, but also serve as markers of change as the Earth sheds the thin layers of Man's influence. This change is not progress, nor is it overly mourned as decline. It is thoroughly described and documented as inevitable change. Ish observes it and reacts to it. But neither he nor the other characters influence its path or pace.Read and compare this book with two other classics of post-Apocalyptic fiction:Alas, BabylonandThe Day of the Triffids. These works also follow their characters through crises, scavenging, and attempts to preserve the technology and civilization of the past. They are both more optimistic and more social in narrative style and in the strategies followed by their characters. After reading them, return to Earth Abides and appreciate it for the melancholy and aloneness felt by both its characters and its readers. It is a good story, a moving experience, and a skillful integration of message and writing style.","Yes, this is a must-read. I found it 40 years ago and have never forgotten it. Very realistic, this runs rings around today's fantasy and sword-and-sorcery pseudo-science fiction. Countless derivative novels and movies owe this book a lot.","Earth Abides is not a typical post-apocalyptic novel. It doesn't present a world of mutants, giant cockroaches or bands of marauders. It simply shows the slow and inevitable decay of man and all his works, in the teeth of attempts by the protagonist to restore the old ways of civilization. In that it succeeds beautifully and shows us the grandeur of our world and the majesty of what we have wrought...then compares it to the greater majesty of nature and the eternal gaze of time. The novel works best as a family drama, more Swiss Family Robinson than Mad Max, and has no sensational adventures to offer other than the daily tribulations of life. For man may be a great creature, but he is still small and the world doesn't really need him at all...Earth Abides is the most meditative and serene post-apocalyptic novel I've ever read, and it's recommended for more thoughtful readers who won't be easily bored.","EARTH ABIDES is lauded as one of the most noteworthy post-apocalyptic novels ever written. It was originally published in 1949, and its author, George R. Stewart, was better known as a writer of nonfiction than fiction, but EARTH ABIDES is easily his most recognized work--it has been in print off and on for nearly fifty years.Isherwood (Ish) Williams is a graduate student working on his thesis--\"The Ecology of the Black Creek Area\"--in the wilds of northern California when a virulent virus destroys humanity. When Ish returns to civilization he finds emptiness. There are no bodies littering the streets, no signs of struggle, nothing except the surreal stillness of empty towns, streets, businesses and homes. Everything is gone, and Ish doesn't understand what has happened until he reads the bleak, desperate headlines of the last issue of a newspaper in an abandoned magazine shop.EARTH ABIDES is the story of how Isherwood Williams survives the death of humanity, and with it, modern civilization. He is man of intellect--he mourns the passing of knowledge--and he can visualize the future not as an abstract idea, but as it very well may be. Ish chronicles the remnants of humanity as they form themselves into small tribes. They live off what the \"old ones\" left. They open cans for food; they raid sporting goods stores for firearms and ammunition, and miraculously they survive and grow. Ish begins his journey as an observer, but he quickly finds himself a participant of this new world.EARTH ABIDES is one of the most troublesome novels I have read. It is troublesome for two reasons. The first is the writing--style, narrative, and plotting--drove me batty. In a matter of pages it would cycle from being an immensely powerful and energetic story to a dull, over analytical and tiresome diatribe. One of the reasons for this wild and frequent swing was the frequent, every few pages, interruption of the narrative with an omniscient perspective spoiler: It was italicized and, in a very technical and academic style, told exactly what was going to happen in the next few pages. It interrupted the flow of the prose, and generally annoyed me.Secondly, it was a very unflattering look at just how terrible it would be to survive the death of civilization. There is nothing romantic, or eerie, or wholesome, or evil, as in many other popular post-apocalyptic stories--but rather it showed the difficultly, the loneliness and down right miserable aspects of surviving past modern civilization. It read very realistic--the way it would be if our neighbors suddenly died and one or two of us were left holding the bag: suicides, drugs, alcohol and insanity all the flavor of the day.This aspect of the novel was its strength--Mr. Stewart's visions of desperation were apt and vivid. One example of this is when Ish returns to an empty world, and drives through town after town honking his horn, and then waiting for the answering honk that never comes. Ish's loneliness and desperation is palpable and completely understood by the reader.EARTH ABIDES was a roller coaster ride. I enjoyed it yes, but I also disliked it. It is a novel filled with ideas, but its impact is lessened with the over-evaluation of those ideas. If you enjoy a good post-apocalyptic novel EARTH ABIDES may be the answer, but tread warily, because some of its impact and importance has worn away with the passing years.-Gravetapping","Let me preach: I consider it a crime that _Earth Abides_ is out of print. But I can understand why. It challenges way too many of modern man's notions. It is seditious in the quietest of ways.I had never heard of this book till I wrote a review for _I Am Legend_.Some people compared both books and out of curiosity I picked it up at a used book store.Wow! Why is this book not in the canon of great works of American literature? True, it is a 300 page (in the paperback) _meditation_ by one man on the fall and gradual rise of mankind. I can understand why some reviewers loathe the book. It is an observation, not an adventure. The hero's meditations merely travel through time; through space his travels are almost incidental.Our hero, Ish, is no Odysseus. He is no Don Quijote. He is no Robin Hood or King Arthur or Moses. He is an ordinary scholar, a grief-stricken individual trying to come to terms with post-traumatic stress after witnessing the near-universal death of the human race. All he can do is make heroic attempts to _keep track_ of events and time.His meditations and road trip bring him in contact with stoic people, with depressed people, with defensive people and at one point, his Tribe encounters religious fanatics--all isolated groups of survivors trying to cope and remake society in their image.As _written by Stewart_, Ish's burden and character are not those of a civilization builder but rather of a witness to decay, ruin, and eventual rebirth, in which Ish _realizes_ that hubris and a need to control \"fate/destiny/the future\" drove much human action, human culture, and the human spirit.Ish's insights continually bowled me over as I turned page after page. His meditations on technology, progress, humanity, eugenics, government, economics, religion, philosophy, superstition, anthropology, education, and literacy (all man-made institutions) constantly challenged my views and I began an internal dialogue with Ish's character!Ish/Stewart challenges a lot of notions of what we call progress and culture. Amazing. No wonder some people have hated and, doubtless, will hate this book. Prepare to have your attitudes about culture, and civilization,--and what makes a _great literary character_--challenged.It's not one of those, what-would-you-do-in-this-scenario novels, but rather an exposition of what one man _learns_ from his circumstances. Does he challenge them? Fight back? Does he mold circumstances to his spirit or does he go along with them? Is the \"individual acting upon his circumstance and vice-versa\" _question_ some kind of cosmic constant?There are earthquakes, forest fires, city-wide conflagrations. The daily amenities are gone: water, power, fire/police protection, doctors/medicine, etc. You are on your own. What do you do? Responses are manifold. Ish's response and that of his \"tribe\" is just one. That is the brilliance of this novel. You can understand Ish's actions, but would they be yours? Would any actions make a \"difference?\" What is this \"difference\" and who gauges/judges it? Therein lies the crux of the novel. Those who hate the novel seem to resent this existential/metaphysical point.A harsher critic would say that \"events happen\" in _Earth Abides_ in order for Stewart to make his point. Fair enough. Very few characters are developed with fine detail, but that is not the point of this novel. The novel is _about Ish_, the man, his conundrums and his meditations. Not about what we would have done or written or how we would have developed the \"supporting characters.\"Oh, and the pathos in this book is very real. The human universals occur: love, births, bondings/friendship, weddings, tribalism, leadership-rivalry, loss, death. And even a morally ambiguous, ethics-challenging execution.If a few scenes don't bring you to profound sorrow, well...let's just say _I_ experienced the sorrow and emotion of the scene as the novel unfolded.I will not reveal more, but this sad and haunting novel is worth the read. This is a novel that for some reason reminded me of H.G. Wells's _The Time Machine_. Shelley's \"Ozymandias\" and Yeats's The Second Coming\" come to mind as well. Read it and buy your friends a copy. Be a friend. Be well. The Earth Abides.","In my top 5 Science Fiction Novels Ever.Earth Abides tells the story of one solitary man who survives a global, but short-lived plague by pure chance. The novel chronicles his life from that point until his eventual death and is filled with both adventure and introspection. At times the main character, Ish, is hard to like simply because his reactions are so human it's disturbing. He's no hero, and in the post-Heinlein flood of heroic SciFi novels you could be forgiven for calling this novel slow.Earth Abides reaches the lofty height of my number 3 favorite despite the fact that it DID NOT win either the Hugo or the Nebula Award, in fact it wasn't even nominated. Instead I award it this honor because it is the most brilliant example of the post-holocaust theme I've ever encountered, and that theme is a huge one in the Speculative Fiction genre. This is THE BAR, and no one has raised it in 50 years.Superbly poetic and graceful, Earth Abides is undeniably honest, realistic and human it's long, diary-like journey from start to finish. I could easily see myself as Ish... which is both a revelation and scary thought at the same time.","This is such a great book on so many levels, it's a shame that it's being subjected to negative comments from readers who have totally missed key points about the story. First off, the protagonist, Ish, is a geographer, an informed and detached observer and not meant to be a hero or role model. Please don't ladle 21st-century dramatic or politically-correct expectations onto him. He's more real than that. Second, some reviewers here are complaining that Ish doesn't teach his fellow survivors to read etc. But in fact he tries throughout the second half of the novel to do so. They just won't. Ish gradually accepts that his fellow survivors aren't capable of hard intellectual work, that the torch of civilization is going to be mostly extinguished. Ish theorizes that probably the few, functioning survivors of the global plague are going to be doltish people. The sensitive, intelligent ones that survived went mad and were deemed unfit to join the little tribe of survivors. So Ish has the human clay that he has -- simple, uncurious, habit-driven people. He's constantly frustrated that he can't rouse them to live above the level they quickly sank to -- of hunting and gathering cans from supermarkets, talking about fixing up things but never doing it, etc. The whole novel is about the unstoppable descent of the last survivors into primitivism, despite having all of the knowledge of the world at their fingertips in the library.The stopover in the south at the family of the \"negroes\" deserves to be called passe -- the book was published in 1949 after all.","A young man recovers, from what seems to be snake bite, to find humankind has basically been decimated from a strange disease. That's the way Mr. Stewart's work begins. And where does it go from there? Well, the protagonist procedes to explore the remains of the U.S. Eventually he settles down and begins a new life, in the new world that Earth has become.Even though this book might be classified as a sci-fi piece, it is a little less and more than that:- Earth Abides does not deeply explore the \"sci\" in sci-fi. There are not many explanations for the disease that destroys civilization. And there are not too many explanations either for what comes next in the book.- On the other hand, Earth Abides does a great job in exploring the psychological effects on the survivors of the demise of civilization. Moreover, Mr Stewart stretched his work through time to show us the way the first generations of the world (the survivors' sons, daughters and grandkids) would behave. This is really nice.I enjoyed this book. It really did not make a big difference on me the fact that it was written some 50 years ago (frankly, I'm not really sure if the outcome would have been different if this disease attacked us now).I recommend this book to anyone interested in exploring the possibilities and consequences of a decimation of humankind by disease (not impossible considering the bird flu). Regular sci-fi readers might enjoy it, too.Don't read this if you want a hard-core sci-fi book, if it being 50 years old is an issue for you (no Internet and cable TV here...), or if you don't want to share the protagonist's loneliness.Enjoy!","read it in Jr. High and it is still just as great today at age 67.","I found this post-apocalyptic story well written, but a bit slower paced that other titles of this genre. I attribute the pace to the era in which this book was written. I would consider this a must read, especially if you have read On the Beach and Alas, Babylon.","I have read this book several times. Once you start,...it's hard to put down.","I liked this book, though the introduction claiming i would remember the book forever and so on. Well, intro's like that turn me off a bit. It certainly is intriguing in a rather simple way. The later seems to add a certain plausibility which makes it much more believable. It's always a trade off, exchange a little drama for a little more realism. In all, a nice balance. I must say that the book is well written.","An excellent read -- an excellent re-read. The book is both entertaining and thought-provoking. If you like science-fiction with an apocalyptic theme, you will like this work.","great book about the aftermath of humanity and how the world deals with our absence, follows a young grad student from the extinction of man to the establishment of a new human society.","I think this is a post-apocolypse classic because of the unique perspectives the author presents. Rather than focusing on theh flu epidemic that wipes out the majority of humanity, the author focuses on one man's experience of it through the rest of his life as he joins with other survivors and the beginnings of their \"tribe\" come together. There is really less \"action\" than one might expect as the author tells the story of \"post-flu\" life and the subtle, slow changes that emerge as human beings begin living more in balance with the planet. A very beautiful story really as humanity comes to know iteself apart from \"civilization.\"","I did a comparison of this book with Childhood's End for A-level English. Two more different sci-fi books would be difficult to come by and that was the point. Earth Abides is a quiet story, full of the thoughts of Ish and the story of the community he helps found after a plague wipes out most of humanity. There is no scientific details as none of the characters have the expertise to know them. It a human story - not a science one. Some details are given of how the impact of humanity is gradually wiped from the planet and how the survivors - well survive.Don't expect explosive action or tales of daring-do. What you will get is an insightful book - even after all this time - what you will want to read a second and third time. Definitely one to keep - close!!","This was by far the best book I've read in a long time, in terms of pure quality. Coming off a run of John Grisham books before it (and after, I'm reading another Grisham story now), it was amazing how different the quality of the story was, and how much more thought-provoking. Grisham tries for some philosophical stuff in his books, but didn't come close to what you find here.The story itself was Ok...not fascinating alone, though surprising. A few things I certainly didn't expect to happen transpired. But what made it worthwhile was the \"what if\" factor. Imagine living through the apocalypse. Ponder the questions it raises:- What would I do? Seek other people? Focus on survival? How to judge others, and how easily to settle in with them?- How strong are the author's, and lead character's biases in the story? We get their perspective so strongly it's not clear sometimes what the reality is?- What about Charlie? There's no way I'd make the same vote as the characters in the book - so I think. But if I had lived as they had for 22 years, would that change my opinion? How can I know? (answer to that last question - I can't).Is there some deeper answer in the book about what the meaning of life really is? If we strip everything we have today away, we go back to a more primal state where the search for food, water, shelter and safety are paramount in our minds. So how much of what we experience now is a product of civilization and society, rather than our true nature? The memorable line which was something like (I don't have the book for a direct quote) \"I'm happy. Things are as they are and I'm a part of them.\" says a lot doesn't it? Goes back to Buddhist philosophy really - focus on the present. When there's no guarantee of the next meal, when there's no shelter because a fire can burn it all down, when wild animals lurk, how much time do we have to ponder, to worry, to debate? And does that make us happier - meeting our primal drive to just...be?I'd highly recommend this book, my \"top\" recommendation whatever that means. It covers ecology, philosophy, sociaology and so much more...I waited almost two years to read it. It's a shame I waited that long.","Starts off great, slows down too much in the middle but finishes well. If you are looking for a Robinson Crusoe post-apocalyptic type read this is not for you. Nothing like \"The Stand\". All the characters are at best low end of average and manage to accomplish very little over the 42 year span of the book. Somehow, I liked that about the book. The writer gets a little too esoteric though. Still, one of the better reads I have had this year. Written in 1949 and I got a hoot out of picking the small things that dated the book. Everybody smoking is an example.","Typical? maybe today, an age where every scenerio of doom has been played over and over again like some bad rock song. Fear not! This book is good. It was fresh once. . .now it reminds us of what fiction use to be written like. Like a good Doyle or Burroughs. I liked it.","I first read &quot;Earth Abides&quot; in a borrowed copy in the early 1950s ... and many, many times since. My problem then was losing the title --- but never the story. Finally, in the late 1960s, my 15-plus year project of telling the story over and over in search of a title (and a copy of my own) paid off. That copy, well thumbed is well kept. It's on my top shelf, handy for a quick read every couple of years or so. I just finished it again today ... not the first time I've made it through in one sitting and then regretting hitting the last page. In part, the book helped lead me to the East Bay (Clayton) in the 1980s and my time there also makes the story real and special. Now it's back to the top shelf ... the only proper place for this really &quot;great read!!!&quot;","I read this magnificant book over 30 years ago and I still canNOT get it out of my head. I was born and raised in the Berkeley/El Cerrito area. While reading EARTH ABIDES, I could visualize, with extreme clarity, all the areas mentioned in the book. I actually put myself in the possibility of REALITY while: the electricity ran out; the overgrowth of flora/fauna; the animals going wild; seeking tires at dealerships on Shattuck Avenue; seeking other humans in Berkeley, the UC Berkeley library; the creating of another human generation; no racial hostility; etc. I just ordered two more of EARTH ABIDES to give to friends who grew up in the Bay Area. They will be astounded and will love it. Although written in 1949, and what is going on in the world today, was this another prophecy?","Like most of the other reviewers, I too have read this book many times. There is some-thing about this story that stays with you. I can't say I have had the same feeling about any other book.","I read this book over 15 years ago and to this day I still cannot get the story out of my head. I wish I can find another copy so I can read it again and even pass it onto my family and friends.What made this story so remarkable was how logical the story line flowed. Everytime I ponder that faitfull question of being one of few left on Earth, I try to take into account the possibilities of how Earth will &quot;reset&quot; iteslf around me. Would I want to stay in Florida, move back to California, or go on a quest to some distant land and build my own civilization?Anyway, I highly recommend this book for those who have ever pondered the question of being the &quot;last person on Earth.&quot;","I first read this book at 11 yrs old (1965), and have read it 4 more times throughout my life. I continually think about this book and always recomend it to friends. I grew up in the desert with not much to do BUT read,when I finished it the first time I had to start over right away, Ive NEVER done that with ANY other book!!! have fun reading it!!!!!","It was a must read for my Physical Geography class. We were supposed mto read it from a Geographers point of view. My teacher prefaced it with &quot;this book was written in the 40's and it is sexist - so ladies please don't let it irritate you.&quot; I however, didn't find it sexist I found M, the lead female charachter, a strong and wonderful woman. I also liked the fact that there was interracial marriage and poligamy. Forward thinking ideas in the 1940's. All in all it is a good weekend read. But, it is way corny! Especially all the text in italics.","As a long time reader of sci-fi, this novel-EARTH ABIDESs is the single best story ever written. I have read it more than 30 times. From the time Ish begins his relent measures to understand what has happen, the start of rebuiding a social group, the developement years, and the final bridge location with Ishs' final thought of &quot;Men may come and go but Earth abides&quot; stirs thoughts of --how would you perform in a like setting.","What more can be said? Get it and read it!!! I first read it about 35 years ago and it has stayed with me. The book impressed me then and it impresses me now.","When the protagonist entered the Bancroft library at the Univeristy of California, and the author described him handling the books and the care which was taken when he left, was so beautifly described I almost cried. Living in chaos but leaving in such a humanly way left a strong message of the power of books and libraries that needs to be an inhernt value to our culture."],

The second of the trilogy, SHALLOWS OF NIGHT, is a strong follow-up. The protagonist, Ronin, flees the claustrophobic subterranean cylinder world of this novel and winds up in a pseudo-Edo. The feudal politics, well-portrayed Japanese culture and new cast members are an interesting shift of gears. Unfortunately the trilogy stalls in the rushed and shabbily edited third volume DAI SAN. When, halfway through the book, Lustbader discards Ronin's name and begins identifying the character as the Sunset Warrior the series dies before the lengthy, predictable battle scene climax.SUNSET WARRIOR is the best of the three and could be read as a standalone novel even though some of the bad guys survive. The ultra-violent martial arts combat is vivid, jumping off the page. The original characters and novel premise coupled with Lustbader's stylistic writing (mostly his employment of sentence fragments) all combine to make for a good action adventure tale with an inventive twist. And a clever ending.","This book is a must-read for all fantasy readers. It invokes your imagination in a way that you can see the fantasy world clearly,gripping narrative thrilling pace and sophisticate style suited for adults only.","Eric V. Lustbader finds a way for the reader to escape reality, and enter the world of the &quot;Freehold&quot;. Lustbader deftly organizes both fantasy/fiction with the realities of the Martial Arts while keeping the dramatic love scenes up to the reader's imagination. I would recommend this first book of three soley for the first time fantasy reader, because Lustbader makes his &quot;world&quot; so easy to see in the mind of the reader.","This book is a pleasing mix of hardcore science fantasy and simple writing which makes it a quick and enjoyable read. If only all books were this comfortable, perhaps more people would read science fantasy.","Lustbader takes his readers on a disturbing ride through the hellish nightmare of a dieing civilization where lies, deception, and violence are the only true virtues. One man must decide to follow a path forced upon him or look for the truth of a past and a future that might not exist. Lustbader is great at developing a dark forbidding world were nothing is as it seems. The characters are complex and mysterious with overtones of a society were duty is place above all else. This book is exciting, violet, sensual, and disturbing. Together with the Sunset Warrior Cycle it is one of the best books I have read.","Eric Van Lustbader turns samurai fiction on its ear in this SF-tinged sword and sorcery tale. We follow the adventures of Ronin, a gifted, self-conflicted warrior, trapped in a decaying underground community that has been cut off from the rest of the world. With advanced technology increasingly falling into disrepair, conflicts in the Freehold are settled by swordplay, which makes dueling experts like Ronin valuable to the powers that be. The Sunset Warrior is an entertaining mix of political intrigue, love, loss, betrayal and vividly described battle scenes. It's a bit uneven in places, and Ronin is not as sympathetic a character as some readers might like, but these minor complaints aside, this is a fun, fast, exciting read, highly recommended to fans of escapist fiction.","Eric Van Lustbader writes a great fantasy novel!The premise of \"the Sunset Warrior\" (and the trilogy in general) is based on the idea that some great ecological disaster has taken place. People have been driven underground, but so long ago that those that are left have lost the history and reason why they have left the face of the planet. The technology that has supported the peoples of the \"freehold\" is beginning to shut down and the people have split into a feudal, caste system similar to 16th century Japan. There are none left that completely understand how their technology works (not far from where we are today).Enter Ronin, a highly skilled warrior and free thinker and he begins to ask questions.This novel is so very human: it questions the mores and attitudes that most of us just accept as reality. It is about the sacrifice that each of us must make in order to \"fit in\" and in contrast, the sacrifices that we make to be genuinely ourselves. \"Sunset Warrior\" is a wonderful metaphor for questioning the \"machine\" that we all live in today.An orginal fantasy that is definitely worth reading.","If only they made more books like this one. It's very creative and imaginative. A definate entertainer! I can't wait to read the rest of the Sunset Warrior Cycle.","The author creates an interesting and unique world for this novel. The post apoclayptic world that this story takes place in is a combination of a feudalistic society and a one where &quot;big brother is watching&quot;. The protaganist, Ronin, is a brooding anti-hero who I found a little difficult to like, but I guess that's always the case with anti-heroes. Regardless, I really enjoyed this book, but for most part it was laying the groundwork for the rest of the series. I'll reserve judgement until I read the rest of the books","I loved this book, it's the best action book I have ever read. This is one of my favorite books. It's filled with hardcore action and a simple but exciting, climactic story. No book has ever made me want to read the sequel so badly. Wonderful. Near the end I was reading about 5 pages per minute, while before in the story I was reading about maybe at the most 2 pages per minute. Read it and love it. Can't wait to read the sequels.","To me this is one of my favorite books ever, it's flavor is of a futuristic Samurai, Budo Code, I really enjoyed this book, and the complete Sunset Warrior Cycle series.","This book is a pleasing mix of hardcore science fantasy and simple writing which makes it a quick and enjoyable read. If only all books were this comfortable, perhaps more people would read science fantasy.","I had never read this type of book before but after reading this ,I was simply hooked on.The content is very imaginative,the story very gripping and one can not help but dream about such a world.I had to make a lot of efforts in finding the other two volumes of the trilogy since they were not widely available in India but now I have read most of the Lust Bader books.A must for fantasy readers.","If you enjoyed the Ninja series, but also is a consumer of fantasy and or SF, to miss out on this this series of early Lustbader works would be your big loss.I like the roughness and non-refined writing style of this book, it's like a journey not only with Ronin as the sunset warrior but also with Lustbader developing his technique and writing style that later gave us masterpeices like Nicholas, Bourne and McClure series, and when it comes to thie genre, the epic Pearl Trilogy.These early books however has a something the others don't have, ...hard to set my finger on it - but it is something with the dark world thats being painted up, vibrant characters, and a feeling of a unfinished diamond still being worked on (as in Lustbaders writing).To sum it up, I love it."],

      "reviews.text":["FANTASTIC series. Rugged individualism at its best in an apocalyptic setting. This series will not let you down as it is enormously entertaining. I actually went and bought a crossbow after reading the series.","This 3rd novel in a sixpack series is one of the best. A space shuttle is used to penetrate the toxic bubble that has cut off California from the rest of the U.S. Eric Ravensmith - The WARLORD - is in the midst of a battle against his former military boss whom has gathered an army of ex-cons to take over the island of California, and taking Ravensmith's son to rear as his own bloodson. Its up to Eric Ravensmith to once again become the WARLORD to save his son and the fate of the island of California. Plus he has to find a way to get to the space shuttle before the bad guys do! Awesome action/adventure.","In a post-Earthquake California, survival is a matter of who has the bigger gun and more ammo. This is a great read, with great characters. The main hero is a bad dude, but somehow he's pretty &quot;good&quot; when compared to everybody else around him. Recommended.","I thought the book was a great, easy read. Similar to a Mac Bolan book, but much more apocalyptic. I only wish I could find all six volumes.","I was first introduced to the 6 book series with this book..i usually read lots of magazines..im not much of a book reader..but this i could not put down..some scenes can be a little vulgar and graphic but it is still a great book..i urge you to read the entire series..it is worth it..and at only 2 bucks a book..what a minimal investment to so much entertainment"],
