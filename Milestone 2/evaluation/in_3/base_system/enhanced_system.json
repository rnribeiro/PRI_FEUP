      "reviews.text":["DefianceLike your post-apocalyptic heroes with clay feet? We got a bunch here. Also I'll give a quick plot outline since no plot is given in Amazon's book description.Mountain states, mid 80's, sneak attack on the USA by USSR. Not much nuclear. Mainly used to take out USA leadership. Soviet troops fly over the North Pole, seize and garrison a leaderless nation. As the other review said sorta like Red Dawn. Though not much action. Very character-driven until then end. I didn't miss the action; I was too amazed at the characters and their drives.What is not like Red Dawn is our heroes are flawed, very flawed. VERY FLAWED. Yes, I am shouting. Don't get this book if you want black haired Greek gods as heroes.Our Heroes:Failed painter, anti-social outcast, a drunk, who's possibly a lousy father, and directionless.His son, slightly retarded, taken from Pops and placed in a foster care home. Then used as slave labor by Foster-Father. No, he doesn't drink.A self-made, old-time SOB drunken cowboy-type, possibly untrustworthy, defiantly Republican Congressman material.A pair of sniveling \"boys\", who drink, while competing for attention.The inhabitants of the local drunk tank.The Spanish and Indians do come across as honorable. Heavy drinkers but honorable.No, the book is not comedy. This book is very dark, very rich, and very good. Forgiving my above belittling, the characters are well written with human flaws. No broad-shoulder, narrow hipped gunslinger types. Just real people, with a real ending.I believe the author was writing a story about the people and the post-apocalyptic setting is just a tool. The story could have been a highway running through our painter's front yard and his attempts to stop it.Good stuff about the majority of Americans doing what they are told by the authorities. New overseer, old overseer, American overseer, Russian overseer. Gotta have a boss. Living free went out with the Stone Age. Sorry...More survivalists should read this book and not pray for the end of days. It ends badly at the end of every ones' days.Highly recommend!","This story is on a similar vein as The Movie Red Dawn but was written earlier. It's well crafted and interesting. I liked it because it wasn't predictable. Well crafted story.","This is clearly a period piece, the references used almost stink of the 1970s, yippes, malaise, decadence. But this is an extremely creative and well written novel, I read it in half a day, although I should stress that it is engrossing stuff and I am a fast reader. The part about the concentration camp was disturbingly familiar to me. Although I do have 2 small quibbles, somehow I think that in the event of an invasion that there would be more than a half a dozen guys who wouldn't put up with it and the author described MIG 21s as having swept wings. They have delta wings with a tailplane, I know, I have been in one.","I have never issued a 5 star rating before. This book gets it. A good story, well told. Even though it was written more than 40 years ago, the scenario is right up to date and believable. Not many this good.","This intense book tells the story of post-conquered America and the brave few who defied the conquerors. The details may be different, but the situation is uncannily close to what we are experiencing now."],

      "description":"Hell Tanner isn't the sort of guy you'd mistake for a hero: he's a fast-driving car thief, a smuggler, and a stone-cold killer. Facing life in prison for his various crimes, he's given a choice: Rot away his remaining years in a tiny jail cell, or drive cross-country and deliver a case of antiserum to the plague-ridden people of Boston, Massachusetts. The chance of a full pardon does wonders for getting his attention. And don't mistake this mission of mercy for any kind of normal road trip-not when there are radioactive storms, hordes of carnivorous beasts, and giant, mutated scorpions to be found along every deadly mile between Los Angeles and the East Coast. But then, this is no normal part of America, you see. This is Damnation Alley....",

      "reviews.text":["This has a real movie feel about it (but from reading other reviews apparently the resulting movie was a bit of a dog).Spoilers warning.It's a relatively short book that does the movie thing of introducing its larger than life action hero, then giving him a quest/adventure building to an obvious climax. In this case our tough as teak bikie is taken out of maximum security, because of his preternatural driving skills, to deliver vital medicine across to the other side of post-apocalyptic US - LA to Boston. Along the way he has to battle mutant animals, fatigue, betrayal, mega-storms, and, in a classic filmic climax, bikie gangs.The mood is able, as is the setting, although the latter isn't really detailed (post apocalyptic has been travelled so frequently these days: we're in the land of Mad Max). Maybe it received some more critical acclaim at the time because it was still original to have an `antihero' - `Hell' Tanner is a brutally unsubtle device in opposition to clean cut good guys. But these days (and then?) he is deep in the land of stereotype that Bruce Willis or Nicholas Cage or Van Damme or any of a number of `wrong-side-of-the-tracks' sullen heroes could be cut from. Zelazny goes way too far with this, contradicting himself totally in his absurd romanticism of the lone bikie justified by his own code and his raw toughness. He casually throws in that he's a rapist and a murderer of innocents to set up the anti-hero, but throughout the book `Hell' only ever does honourable things, getting downright homey and sentimental with a salt of the earth farm family and their kid, and stepping in as the knight to rescue a bikie damsel in distress. He only ever fights in self-defence or to protect others: the anti-hero thing is pure gloss.","Damnation Alley is a book of epic proportions, set in the future. Travel between settlements have become nearly impossible and that is where the true story lies. You are taken on a trip through a typical voyage accross america in a post World War III land. From strange plants, to odd weather shifts makes for a great adventure. This definitly is a must read.","How can you not love a book about the last Hells' Angel forced into making a mission of mercy by making an extended road trip across a scarred and irradiated post-nuclear America?It's brutal and a little dated at times, but if you're a sucker for the post-apocalyptic fiction genre you won't put it down.","Great title, would have been less gripping if it had been called \"Fluffy Kitten Alley\" or \"Slightly Inconvenient Alley\" .. anyway, you know the plot. My copy was ruined by a crappy cover illustration of what appeared to be a fridge on wheels. We all know that the author must have got his inspiration for the vehicle from Captain Scarlets Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle (SPV), the descriptions are almost identical, even the driving positions and steering via TV screen. Obviously, any post apocalyptic novel must either contain the adventures of some sort of alternate religious cult or mutants/bikers. Roger sticks to the latter, safer territory. Lots of mutants. Some bikers. No mutant bikers though. I always thought that it was annoying that the 2 parts of the US MOST likely to be destroyed in a war (the North East and LA/San Francisco) were the 2 ends of \"The Alley\". It might have been more believable to make it Washington State to Florida or something like that. The ending is pretty cool though, and one of the best written parts of the book. All in all, its a pulpy badly aged bit of not terribly intelligent PA sci-fi, but its good fun and would have made a good film in its own right. Possibly with Kurt Russell.","A post-apocalyptic action story. A criminal is given the standard two choices, really bad things now, or very very possible really bad things later, and, of course, takes the later.The later in this case is a trip across the country to deliver vital medical supplies. He has a few more problems than the standard cracked by snow and ice cheapish US highways though. In this world, they don't call it Damnation Alley for nothing.","This is expanded from a longish short story, and of course was made into that AWFUL movie, but it is a very fun read and really has that early Zelazny sense of a very strange world.","Being a fan of the movie, the novel was eagerly read- Good storyline,but a little anticlimatic and muddled twoards the end. Still, I recommended it as a good read.","This is weaker Zelazny, which makes it better than most novels. If you are looking for a book that has action with out sacrificing literary skill this book is for you.","An apocaliptic book by one of ameriacas best SF and Fantasy writers. The scenery placed in the future after a world war is breath taking and causes the reader not put down the book untill finishing reading","The title says it all! I ordered this book thinking \"well it MIGHT be OK\" but really I wasn't expecting much, I was so happy to be wrong! It was delivered around 3pm and I had finished it by 10 that night. I could not put it down. I didn't want to put it down! I will be sharing it with everyone I know because I feel its so good everyone needs to read it. I cant say enough how much I enjoyed this book.","This would have been a decent book if the reading level hadn't have been for 4th graders or if the color scheme used by Zelazny was suitable for 5 year old's. Even the general plot is fairly juvenile, obviously targeted towards teen-aged males. And what better way to sell cigarettes to teenagers than to advertise smoking in a sci-fi novel targeted towards teenaged boys? This book must have been paid for by the tobacco industry, as there is a sheer ridiculous amount of chain smoking involved (nearly on every page).Zelazny didn't put much thought into the post-apocalyptic plot, besides the lame midwestern monsters. There seems to be ample cigarettes in an America in economic collapse, as is there plenty of coffee and other items difficult to obtain (eggs, meat, etc). In my opinion, this book was just one big tobacco advertisement with little or no imagination.","I read this book after watching the movie as a kid, and reading all the bad reviews. I have to say I quite liked it, the character is much different than george peppard in the movie and I like the spiffy new cover.","Hell Tanner has never got anything. He gives a rat's what others want. The fumes of the exhaust pipes of his Harley Davidson is all anybody will get from him. He's the last Hell's Angel. In this post-nuke wastelands of US he got an offer. A complete pardon of all his past and future crimes if he would be willing to ride across the country in a gauntlet, armored 8 wheel vehicle, from Los Angeles to Boston. To bring a plague antidote for the surviving people. The convoy, motored group of 3, is sent across by land; to battle huge mutant insects, packs of survivors turned violent and feral, and brutal electrical storms that savage the already barren plains, to ravel through the desolate post-nuke wastelands.Damnation Alley takes place in a post-apocalyptic nuclear war where most of the earth has been destroyed. Only a few pockets of humanity exist in Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and Boston. Tanner's experience as a smuggler makes him the best driver available. Tanner believes in impression but somewhere deep down he has something good. The reader is supposed to believe that Tanner changes during the trip just by psychoanalyzing his own thoughts. The narrative is mostly done through Tanner's eyes how he fights giant gila monster, bats, snakes. In a stop or two he meets a crazy biologist, warm surviving family who offer him a little rest in the long journey and Cornelia, a girl from a motorbike gang he had to slaughter. If Tanner is not talking to himself, he has his co-driver Greg, a Native American who's brains he trashed against the cockpit (at halfway of the book), or Cornelia (at the end of book), who gets killed just before they arrive to Boston. At the end City declares Tanner a hero and a statue is erected for him. Tanner isn't around to see these; he has split in the desert.One (1) star. Written in 1969 the year of theEasy Riderroad movie. The story resembles remarkably the movie; iced only with plague antidote delivery. The ramblings of bearded Tanner, who smokes in chain and kills without a second thought, takes a woman, present straight male-macho ideals put on words. The road ride is predictable and descriptions of the surroundings occupy most of the book. With the initial setting, in this radioactive hellhole, there could have been lots of possibilities but unfortunately all the terrain is abridged to monsters and the Road. The few encounters with the isolated people on the way are probably used for break effect in this otherwise monotonous trip diary. Indifferent read.","Well, this one was a fun, quick read, but kind of dissapointing, really. I mean, I expected a bit more. Instead I got drive a little fight a giant mutant bug, drive some more and fight more mutant critters, drive some more and... you get the picture, but it was still fun.","Well this book was a quick read. Punctuated with Zelanzy's usual lean prose.THe plot is quite simple and basic, A con is given the chance to save half of a Post Apocalyptic Nuclear Torn USA.Basic setup for a bad dude to redeem himself.Well this book is quite short, and in all honesty not to bad. It was fun, but its quite forgetable.In the end I would definetly recomend reading something more worthwhile, even Zelanzy has done better than this.","\"The savage classic that inspired the apocalyptic hit science fiction film!\" says the ad blurb.Well, the ad blurb at least got the first part right, eh?However, if it wasn't for the dank 1977 movie and its groovy armored RV, this early Zelazny novel might be languishing out of print. Fourteen years before _The Road Warrior_, another ballsy loner in leather zooms the wastelands of a post-apocalyptic world, one that has gone insane with lurid pulp nasties like giant gila monsters, big snakes, super bats, storms that dump debris from the sky, and roving motorcycle gangs (gotta have those). Our hero, Hell Tanner, carries a shipment of life-saving serum to beleaguered Boston, and the hard-bitten man transforms through his struggles to genuinely care about the survival of the cursed world. The slow transformation never becomes clich&eacute; or silly, especially since Zelazny constantly throws a smorgasbord of action at Tanner's armored fortress-car.A few avant-garde sequences throw the book off kilter, but otherwise the hard-boiled fury of this adventure carries you quickly to the finale.","This is an interesting book-- different in some ways from other Zelazny novels. The narrative was less polished than most of his other work. I read this novel on a Greyhound going through some of the area that the story takes place in. I can see why this was made into a film. It has a sort of visual quality, but I never really felt the character was in much danger, or even really challenged, until the encounter with the bikers at the end. Still, the post-apocalyptic road trip across America was intriguing if not gripping. Sort of an On the Road/Art of Motorcycle Maintenance for SF fans. The first thought I had when encountering Hell Tanner was that this must have been the direct inspiration for Snake Pliskin, and that this book (or the 1977 movie) must have been an inspiration for the movie Escape from New York. There are many similarities-- too many for coincidence. It is entertaining, and Hell Tanner is a solid character, far nicer than he believes himself to be. Like all Zelazny novels, my major complaint is that this one is too short. One question I'd like to throw out is that at the end, the &quot;three days&quot; was mentioned, as well as the islands maybe having survived them. Does that mean this is somehow connected to This Immortal?","After a nuclear war most of North America has become a wasteland known as 'Dammnation Alley'. Hell Tanner, the last surviving Hells Angel and due to die for rape, murder, extortion, etc. is given the choice of delivering a vital vaccine to a plague ridden city or being executed.Zelazny writes a imaginitive and hard edged thriller filled with vivid imagery. I suspect that Hell Tanner was the inspiration for 'Escape From New York' Snake Plisken and its a pity that Jack Smight's film was just a dilute interpretation of the original. I am surprised it hasn't been re-published.","This novel is an absolute classic portrayal of near future but post apocalypse Earth. It is set in a US in which what remains of the population is confined largely to the coasts and separated by a wild and dangerous interior. When the population on the East coast is threatened by a deadly disease, the only hope is for a medical supplies to be transported overland. The book follows one man, unreformed biker Hell Tanner who sets out to cross the badlands.As a setting for a novel this is not very promising. However, the author brings a huge amount of invention and narrative skill to bear and the result is a page turner. Of course, you know from the start that Hell Tanner will reluctantly accept the assignment and that he will face almost certain defeat on the way.Despite that knowledge, you want to keep reading this book because the story is just so well put together. For me, one of the marks of a really good book is the vividness of the images that it creates in my head. By that test, this book was very good indeed.If you like SF adventure stories, then track down a copy of this book and you will not be disappointed.","Sometime after a nuclear apocalypse, there are two nations left in the former U.S. (perhaps in the world); the nations of California and Boston. All the rest is a wasteland of radioactivity, mutant beasts, super storms and violent gangs, known as Damnation Alley.Word comes that a plague has struck Boston. California sends a group of their best drivers across Damnation Alley to deliver vaccine. To lead this group, they shanghai Hell Tanner: criminal, the last Hell's Angel and the best damned driver they have.This was my first Roger Zelazny novel and it wasn't what I expected. The writing was quirky and more literary than I was expecting, given the pulpy storyline and the workman-like writing in so much old sci-fi. The post-apocalyptic setting, lack of details about the causes of the war and unspecified year of the story kept the book from feeling particularly dated (except for thelate-sixties fascination with the Hell's Angels).So I liked the writing (enough that I will pick up other books by Zelazny), but overall I thought the book was only so-so. For the bulk of the book, though we hear what a terrible place Damnation Alley is, it just doesn't seem so dangerous.Once Hell reaches the Eastern Seaboard he is constantly being harassed by raiders (and this section was very well done), but the previous days' driving across the country seemed almost mellow in comparison. I think maybe the book would have benefited a little from a couple of extra chapters and a few more travails.Still, even though I think the book is flawed, it is worth a read. It helped spark a whole sub-genre of post-apocalyptic fiction, as I'm pretty sure Walter Jon WilliamsHardwired, movies likeDoomsdayand theMad Maxseries and game worlds likeGamma WorldandDark Futurewere all at least partly inspired by this book.","Hell Tanner, the last of the Hells Angels, gets a pardon from the Nation of California - if he takes plague vaccine from Los Angeles to Boston. To make it, though, he has to go through Damnation Alley -- what's left of America after a nuclear war. It's a land of giant critters, volcanoes, biker gangs, and storms that drop boulders out of the sky. Along the way, murdering, pimping, thieving Tanner decides he may just like to have a go at being a hero ...This is a fast-paced, very enjoyable adventure story told in prose colorful in every sense of the word. Zelazny himself preferred the shorter novella version. He was right. The added bits about life in plague-ridden Boston don't add much and a poetic, impressionistic section on the source and circulation of the winds that plague the world breaks up the pacing and tone. And, needless to say, there's little in the way of plausible science. Still, those are minor blemishes, and the story is worth reading in either version.","When I read this I was struck by the similarities between the deal offered to Hell Tanner to run the serum thru Damnation Alley to a plague stricken Boston in order to recieve a full pardon for every criminal act he's committed in the Nation of California...hmmm. That sounds alot like the deal offered to Snake Plissken, who seems to share alot of other similarities with Hell Tanner, who admittedly came first in 1969. I have no way of knowing whether or not John Carpenter or Nick Castle read the Zelazny book by the time they wrote Escape from New York but it wouldn't surprise me at all. Being a big fan of Plissken's exploits I can't help but like this pulpy sci fi novel. With a few very slight changes someone could easily adapt this into the 3rd Snake Plissken movie!!!! (Why am I not a Hollywood hot shot with clout, power, influence? Oh yeah, my ambition is handicapped by laziness.)There is nothing on earth that could make the awful 1977 film adaptation worthwile. It has about zero to do with the book, which is filled with great twisted post-apocalyptic imagery: giant bats and scorpions and other fantastic beasties and tornado winds whipping great hunks of concrete and other unhealthy materials thru the malestrom that is \"the Alley.\" And the Land-Master that Tanner drives is super-cool in a James Bond/Speed Racer way; it has flame throwers and grenade launchers and all sorts of buzz saw hub cap weapons.Very cool.","In 1969, Roger Zelazny took a short story he had written two years earlier and expanded it into a full novel.Written ten years before the release of the first Mad max film, lovers of the post-apocalyptic road trip genre will find themselves in familiar territory that most believe first started when Mel Gibson first took to the screen.But before there was Mad Max, there was first Hell Tanner and they are certainly twin brothers of different mothers.In a United States devastated by a nuclear war, Hell Tanner is given an offer he can't refuse: to drive the ultimate survivalist car from Los Angels to Boston to deliver a desperately needed vaccine. Along the way, he encounters rogue motorcycle gangs, monster-sized Gila Monsters, monster-sized bats, killer dust devils and a host of other challenges.Not Zelazny's best, yet for pulp readers who enjoy tales of the end of the world as we know it, the read is entertaining though it will not stand up to hard questioning, for instance, where is everybody getting their gasoline?","I adore Zelazny, and this is one of his easiest reads, imho. It is also a story that was made into a horrible, horrible film. I know the author was disappointed in the movie as well. Read the book! Great, flawed hero! Monsters! Lives at stake! Chase scenes! Redemption!","I read this as a kid. I remember really liking it but not much else.This Is a reread. I couldn't remember details so I reread it to reaffirm my 4 star rating. The rating stands. I enjoy Post-apocalyptic stories and the different paths they can follow. This is post nuclear and leans toward some of the scifi effects of radiation: lingering hot-pockets, mutations, altered weather, etc.The US is split into different nations with most of the population on either coasts. The middle is essentially a dead no-mans land called Damnation Alley. Planes can't fly, the land roams with mutant animals and deadly weather, and the is no radio communication."],

      "reviews.text":["It's fascinating to see how some sf novels stand the test of time and others don't. I still have my old Mayflower pb of \"The Long Tomorrow\" which I purchased as a teenager c1963, and reread it from time to time. Doing so produces most curious feelings, like going through a timewarp of some kind.TLT is a \"Golden Oldie\". Published in 1955, it is one of the huge number of \"post nuclear war\" stories that came out in that nervous era, but is head and shoulders above the bulk of them. It's theme, unique in sf as far as I know, is a future world in which the Amish (or at least a sect more or less \"cloned\" from them) have taken over America.The idea that, in the aftermath of holocaust, the people might turn against science and technology, has of course been used by others, notably Walter M Miller in \"A Canticle For Leibowitz\". But TLT takes a subtly different angle. The New Mennonites are not opposed to education, their children are literate, and they seem to live at an early 19th century level, just pre-railroad. It isn't a Dark Age in the usual sense. But there are strict limits. No electricity, industry or anything high tech. Riverboats are allowed to have simple engines, but land transport stops at the horse and buggy. Above all, the US Constitution has been amended to forbid the existence of any city or town above 2000 people.The central characters are two teenage boys in a New Mennonite community in Ohio. Len Colter (14) and his slightly older cousin, Esau. They discover a radio set, belonging to a passing trader, and realise that he comes from \"Bartorstown\", a secret society out west conspiring to bring back the bad old days, association - real or alleged - with which can result in whipping at best, instant lynching at worst. Fascinated by it (and, in Len's case, by their grandmother's wistful recollections of before the war) they seek to know more. This leads to their having to flee from home, and set out on a quest to get to Bartorstown. This quest covers several years and forms the middle third or so of the book.On arrival, they are in for a mighty shock. These people are the custodians of the last surviving nuclear reactor, and are seeking a way to neutralise atomic bombs, so the power of the atom can be safely used without another catastrophe. This forces the sensitive Len (by now more or less adult) into a crisis of conscience. Is this a wise path to take, or were his elders right all along? The last part of the book is about him coming to terms with this question.Perhaps my strongest reaction, on going back to it, is surprise at finding the Amish (on whom the New Mennonites are explicitly modelled) cast as the Bad Guys. This, I suspect, would be out of the question today. If their treatment by Hollywood (\"Witness\", \"Harvest of Fire\" etc) is anything to go by, they are about the most popular ethnic minority in America. To chide them for holding up \"progress\" would be almost unthinkable.The book shows its age in other ways too, notably its simple 1950s faith in technology. It's now some 80 years since World War III, yet the group at Bartorstown are perfectly happy living next to a prewar nuclear reactor. Even those who for various reasons aren't happy with it don't seem to fear any physical danger, save of course from the neighbours if they ever find out. These days, I suspect few would be keen to live even near an eight year old one. Yet Bartorstown has lasted three generations without even a Three Mile Island, let alone a Chernobyl. Remarkable workmanship.Even the nuclear war itself seems to have left remarkably little damage in its wake, with no deformed babies, no cancer, etc, while Len's grandmother, who experienced the war as a child, has lived to a ripe old age. The only lasting harm seems to have been psychological. Nor does anyone see a problem about restoring civilisation in a world where the oilfields are probably mostly drained. It is just assumed that such things can be got round. This is the outlook of a different era from today.Ditto for the people. There are some who'd rather not be living there, but after eight decades in a country hostile to all it stands for, Bartorstown still hasn't been betrayed or detected. Could anyone really keep the lid on for so long? Quibble, quibble, Mike.In short, TLT is a remarkable glimpse into \"The way the future was\" as of 50 years ago. If it were written today, I suspect the Mennonites would be definitely the guys in white hats, and the young heroes would not merely get out of Bartorstown, but do their best not to travel downwind of it any more than they absolutely had to. This said, however, it is beautifully written, and one of the best books of its kind. Read it as an sf \"period piece\" and you won't be sorry.","Leigh Brackett wrote this interesting sci fi thriller after moving to Ohio, and in Ohio it begins, two generations after the Destruction, a global annhilation by nuclear holocaust. Fear predominates the culture and identity of every individual and it is the fight against the fear of knowledge, that most dreaded, that Len Coulter wages along with his cousin, Esau. A believable piece of fiction for a book written over 60 years ago which is thoroughly relevant to the present-day culture of fear.","This is simply amazing. If you are like me and enjoy well-written post-apocalyptic yarns then this is going to be quick favorite. There has been a backlash and the United States has turned its back to technology and all of its citizens live a rural Amish type lifestyle. Or have they? Solid writing and great concept. To bad this winner is out of print.","Despite its acclaim as an early vision of America after a nuclear war, The Long Tomorrow doesn't have the same impact as the best examples of post-apocalyptic fiction. Leigh Brackett's 1955 novel nonetheless deserves its status as a science fiction \"classic,\" albeit more for the message it delivers than for the quality of the story it tells.After the war, cities are widely regarded as a source of wickedness, although Len Colter's grandmother remembers them with fondness, as places with electricity and indoor plumbing, supermarkets and movie theaters. The people best equipped to survive the annihilation aren't city dwellers but those who are accustomed to living a simple rural life. The Mennonites have multiplied, a trend that is enhanced by a constitutional amendment prohibiting cities of more than one thousand residents. The religious values that inform the Mennonite leaders also (not so coincidentally) work to their economic advantage. The Mennonites, however, have little use for members of another fast-growing religion, the fire-and-brimstone fundamentalists who preach hatred and urge that sinners (including those who advocate urban growth) be subjected to the usual range of biblical torments, including death by stoning.Len has a rebellious instinct that no amount of whipping will extinguish. His desire for knowledge, his will to know what exists in the world beyond the village limits, might be sinful -- the sin of pride, his father tells him -- but Len is willing to accept damnation for the sake of learning the truth. After his grandmother explains that, before the war, the government built a town in the west called Bartorstown, populated with scientists dedicated to a secret project, Len resolves to find it, hoping it will be the source of enlightenment he craves. Thus Len and his cousin Esau begin a journey across a post-apocalyptic landscape. The truth about Bartorstown comes as a surprise and the story takes an interesting turn as it nears the end.Like many dystopian tales, The Long Tomorrow has a cautionary message. This one is about the evils of intolerance and thought-control, the value of independent thinking. The fear of cities expressed in Brackett's novel is really a fear of progressive thinking, a belief that life was better (in modern terms, that \"family values\" were stronger) in the good old days. Knowledge is condemned because it was misused; a retreat from knowledge is seen as the path to salvation. Still, as Len comes to realize, even if we can be cleansed of sin (as his people believe), we can never be cleansed of knowledge -- \"there is no mystical escape from it.\" Deliberate ignorance is not the antidote to dangerous knowledge; wisdom is. Perhaps themes that were compelling in 1955 now seem dated, but the argument that there should be limits to knowledge, particularly when knowledge contradicts biblical teachings, retains a twenty-first century following. The argument that cities were destroyed in a nuclear war because they were \"sinful\" finds echoes in similar remarks made about New Orleans after Katrina.I've never been as appreciative of Brackett's prose as some sf fans. She was a perfectly capable writer, but (at least to me) her style is no more \"literary\" than that of many other well-recognized sf writers of her era. Still, her writing becomes more resonant as the story progresses. On occasion the novel has the flavor of a western; at other times there's a hint of Huckleberry Finn, although Huck's trip down the Mississippi is vastly more eventful than Len's underwhelming voyage along the Ohio River. Other \"message\" novels manage more subtlety than this one. Although The Long Tomorrow doesn't make it into my personal canon of cherished sf novels from the 1950s, it endures as an enjoyable read.","This novel showed the late author's capability of telling a story that relates what could have been. Luckily for us, the atomic war didn't happen. Let's hope it never does.","In the 1950s, a nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union seemed almost inevitable. This is one of several excellent post-apocalyptic novels from that time period, including &#34;On the Beach,&#34; &#34;Alas, Babylon,&#34; and &#34;Day of the Triffids.&#34; This one is less science-fiction and more a tale of survival and of survivors seeking that which was lost in the great conflagration. In other words, it's a great drama set in a post-apocalyptic world reflecting a Cold War outlook on what the end of the world might be like. Incredibly interesting, especially for those interested in studying this fascinating period in human history.","A lot of food for thought. Ms Brackett doesn't seem to have felt things would change much. I recommend this.","Leigh Brackett (1915 - 1978) was a productive writer of SF and fantasy novels, short stories, and screenplays. For all but the final 10 - 15 years of her life she was one of the relatively few woman continuously active in the field of SF. Brackett never labeled herself a `feminist' writer, and most of her works focus on male protagonists. In this respect her contributions and skills as a writer have been marginalized by the SF community, particularly in comparison to consciously `Feminist' authors like Alice Sheldon and Joanna Russ, who (in my opinion) are inferior writers, but nonetheless garnered outsized attention in the late 60s - early 70s simply for being regarded as Feminist authors.`The Long Tomorrow' (1955) is one of Brackett's best novels and displays her skills at setting, characterization, and dialogue. The story takes place some decades after a nuclear war has devastated the US in the early 1950s. Civilization has reverted to an agrarian society akin to that of the mid-nineteenth century. Various politico-religious sects, such as the New Mennonites, are determined to stifle any technological progress in order to avert a repeat of the cataclysm. The main character is Len Colter, son of a New Mennonite farmer, whose curiosity about the Olden Times and their forbidden sciences brings him into conflict with his staid and pious family.Len rebels against the strictures of his rural life and embarks on a journey to find Bartorstown, the rumored last bastion of pre-devastation technology. His search for Bartorstown brings him into a variety of conflicts smoldering around the former US, sparked by dissension between advocates for progress, and those opposed to its dangers. In the latter portion of the novel Len finds himself forced to make a fateful decision between his childhood aspirations, and the unsettling reality of genies re-loosed from their bottles.Brackett never provides the reader with a pat declaration for one side or the other in these conflicts; instead, the narrative often shows some ambivalence about technology and its liabilities when wielded by humans clouded by their fears, beliefs, and yearnings.The narrative is fast-moving and engaging. While she wrote with an economy and skill that are the hallmarks of an experienced author, Bracket was also able to portray her characters with depth and imbue them with distinctive and memorable personalities. The world of the post-apocalyptic USA of `The Long Tomorrow' is entirely believable, and one of the best presentations of such a scenario in what is a very heavily-mined area of the genre.`The Long Tomorrow' is a classic of SF, and a great read for both young people and adults.","What if there was a global nuclear war in the 1950s and the USA \"won\"? What would the USA look like after two generations of the survivors rebuilt ? Ms. Brackett takes a detailed look at life in post apocalyptic America. It is not pretty.The book starts off with the following: \"\"No city, no town, no community of more than one thousand people or two hundred buildings to the square mile shall be built or permitted to exist anywhere in the United States of America.\" --30th Amendment of the US Constitution\"As you can imagine, no cities means everyone lives an agrarian life. Or do they?I did not like the ending and down-rated the book for that. Most others might like it.","This is actually a reprint of a novel long out of print. It is considered a classic, although it is hard for me to understand why. The novel was originally published in 1955, and it has aged rather badly. It deals with yet another post-apocalyptic world (the apocalypse in this case, as in so many other 1950s novels, was a nuclear war). The writing is good, quite above many of the pulpy science fiction writing of those times, but Ms Brackett gets the science all wrong. First of all, she imagines a U.S. with a relatively peaceful (even if religiously intolerant), and relatively prosperous, post-apocalyptic society, only a couple of generations after a devastating nuclear war. Which makes no sense whatsoever. There are much better fifties sf novels about the same subject. For example: A Canticle for Leibowitz, where a new civilization emerges slowly and only thousands of years after the nuclear debacle, only to fall again into the same disaster as the previous one. Or Earth Abides, where there is no new civilization and humans slowly evolve (or rather devolve) towards superstition and ignorance. Or The Long Loud Silence, which depicts a very violent and desperate and disintegrating post-apocalyptic world."],

      "reviews.text":["This is in the post-apocalyptic survival genre and is rated 18+ due to violent content. A new virus has spread through humanity, hardening the skin and dissolving internal organs. Those who are still alive are crippled, cybernetic or immune. Meanwhile, the human desire for power continues and there is a new organization looking to rule the world. It's an interesting look at man and nature.This first volume is very good. The art is excellent. The story is introduced well and in an interesting way. I'm looking forward to finding out not only what will happen to the characters, but filling in what has happened in the past.","Finding out that Dark Horse has picked up this amazing manga is one of the most exciting events of the year. It is one of the best series I have ever read, and I am surprised it took so long to be picked up.It takes place in what could be considered a post apocalyptic age of man, but it is nothing like any other post apocalyptic manga out. It is filled with political intrigue, personal drama, and mind blowing plot arcs. The apocalyps is just the beginning and the canvas on which this story is painted.It follows the life of a boy, Elijah, and his travels through the unique anarchic landscape of a world ravaged by a plague known as the Closer virus. With an ensamble of friends of happenstance, vicious enemies, and mosters, Elijah's world is far from the biblical paradise of Eden.The author builds an array of interesting complicated characters, giving time to them as much as any main character, no matter how brief their life in the comic is. They are people for the most part real, aside from some who have been modified cybernetically.As far as the artistry of the graphic novel is concerned, it is precisely that, graphic. It is not a novel for children, and often attacks adult issues head on. Aside from that, the action scenes are dynamic representations of the climax, either emotional or physical, of that scene. No shortage of blood, and guts, but not so splattered across the page as to be considered obscene.These pictures are only there to support the myriad of plots, sub-plots, serializations and cliffhangers that are throughout the manga, as it heads toward an uncertain conclusion. There are twists turns and, growth, actual full fledged growth of the situations present, which become continually profound.Read this manga for its drama, its violence and its imagination, whose vision of a post apocalyptical world can only be described as human.","Eden is an awesome manga. If any manga has achieved a literary state it has to be this one. For example, it doesn't exactly present characters the way other manga do, by showing what they look like, and having them act out in a way that would be characteristic. What Eden did in this volume was present the setting first, and have the characters interact with that setting. Being a post-apocalyptic tale, the setting is key, and having certain people react a certain way to the setting will reveal a lot about that character. Personally, I thought this was brilliantly done, and I felt that I knew Elijah, the main character, well enough to like him, even though he was only in three short chapters of this volume.The story in Eden--in this volume at least--begins with two teenagers, Enoah and Hannah, as they care for their guardian Layne, who's dying of a disease that hardens the skin and turns the insides of a human to mush. While caring for Layne, these kids learn of their responsibility to human-kind, as well as the tragic past that aided in bringing about the apocalypse in which they are living in. Later, the story moves to young Elijah, a boy whose only companion is a robot named Cherubim, as he goes about the everyday job of survival, including scavenging and hunting, as well as dreaming of girls.Though admittedly the story is slow, and very little is given away as to what direction Eden is heading in, I can't knock it for the simple brilliance in which it is unfolding. Hiroki Endo put an emphasis on presenting the stark setting and conditions of living in the volume, and also made it clear that it is an intelligent plot no matter how slow it is. The back cover states that Eden is \"a brilliant love song to post-apocalyptic survival genre\" and I would have to agree on that. Eden is a smart story rivaling even Akira, and one I highly recommend for fans of darker, smarter manga.","Having read the first three volumes so far, I'm blown away. I haven't found a manga this engaging since Akira. At first glance, what appeared to be a typical \"post-apocalytic\" story is actually deeply fascinating on multiple levels, most especially characterization. The technological elements are as well done as anything by Shirow (Ghost in the Shell), perhaps even better, as they are more clearly explained and shown to be a logical extension of present-day technologies. The future the author has created here is totally coherent and convincing. Like the best sci-fi, you feel like you are simply glimpsing one aspect of an enormous world.The visual storytelling is extremely well done. The battle scenes are clearly sequenced and paced in a way that is very cinematic. I found myself racing from panel to panel, my eyes frequently bugging out at dramatic and gory moments that are perfectly presented in service to the larger narrative and the emotional content.The characters are quite convincing and engaging.This is a fantastic piece of entertainment!","A worldwide plague has struck Earth, and there's no cure in sight. The disease is particularly nasty because your skin hardens into rock-like consistency and then your internal organs liquefy and drain out through your orifices! So you have all these statues of people laying around like so many victims of Medusa. A bio-dome named Eden is constructed under UN control to quarantine uninfected humans from the pandemic sweeping the world. Many years later, all that's left of the once hopeful experiment are two adolescents named Enoah and Hannah, who have genetic resistance, and their dying guardian Layne, who is rapidly succumbing to the sickness. The rest of this first volume fills you in on how Eden, which was once a bastion of Man's hopes, has now become an empty shell of its former self. We're also introduced to Cherubim, a military robot which Eden's now dead inhabitants blamed for their destruction. The second half of the book takes up a different thread, 20 years later as a young boy named Elijah, accompanied by Cherubim, fights to survive in the ruins of civilization.This first volume of Eden had it all: Sci-fi, Violence, love, human fears, religious symbolism, and realism. The characters at times feel like mythological, if not Biblical, figures given human shape, but they retain our sympathies. They are protagonists trying to live in a world that has been destroyed by forces on a different level than themselves. As in all times of chaos, factions arise to take advantage of the situation and take control. It's difficult to see how these characters are going to fit into the scheme of things. The little violence in this book is graphic but necessary to tell the story. Death isn't pretty. The art in Eden is some of the best I've ever seen in a manga and is reminescent of a more refined Ghost in the Shell style-wise. Video Girl Ai is another series that is similar in art. This is a gripping and thought provoking first volume in what looks to be a great series.","All I have to say is that this series is by far the best manga/graphic novel I've ever read... This is not the plotless violence that you see in many manga series', Eden's story line is one of the better plots that I've read in quite some time. This series is absolutely incredible and a 'must-read' for everyone who loves... well... anything.","Eden is simply an amazing graphic novel set in a world ravaged by a killer virus, that wipes out the majority of the population. We start with three survivors on an island. A dying man confined to a wheelchair and two children. From this simple begining we delve into complex subject matter. The concept of sin, sexual desire, explore the meaning of life, question the existence of god and man's role in the natural order. Heady stuff to say the least and then there are the mecha robots, cyborgs, mercenaries and global conspiracies. Breathtaking in it's scope and imagination, Hiroki Endo has created a tribute to the cyberpunk and post-apocalyptic survival genre.","Eden Volume 1 is a great addition to the genre of post-apocalyptic literature. While the scenario of a government conspiracy-related pandemic is nothing new, Hiroki Endo's iteration in Volume 1 is worthwhile reading. This book's intricate plot and great character development give the series a strong start. This review comments on three elements of artwork: scenery, characters, and action. The review then discusses plot and storytelling. Finally, it concludes with brief thoughts on the overall series.The characters are drawn with distinctive features without resorting to over-the-top hair profiles and character designs, for which manga is known. The more subdued character design allows the artist to demonstrate the subtle deterioration in health over time, as the infection takes over a person's body. I believe this is one of the book's most distinctive visual characteristics.The artwork is superior to the average manga, with an emphasis on electronics and machinery in interior scenes. Exterior scenes show an interesting mixture of real-world places and architecture. The setting in first half of closely resembles Biosphere 2 in Arizona, while the cityscapes in the second half closely resemble Hong Kong (i.e. Lippo Center). Seeing these buildings somewhat confused me where the intended setting for this story is, but this is fiction after all! And the scenes are beautiful nonetheless.The characters are well developed. Endo successfully introduces a large cast, and is able to give each motivation and weaknesses without being stereotypical. Character development is excellent, and one of the best reasons to read this volume.Volume 1 has the most interesting plot of the Eden series, with big, visionary ideas and layers of conflict. The pacing is good with well-timed flashbacks, dialogue, and action. Each element purposely advances the story, unlike the gratuitous ultra-violence and raunchy sexual dialog of later volumes. Overall, this volume has great artwork and a compelling story--what more can be asked of a manga? I recommend Volume 1.***However, I do not recommend later volumes of Eden, where the overall series takes a bizarre tangential direction, losing Volume 1's focus of survival in a post-apocalyptic world. Every subsequent volume feels detached, like a different genre all together. Volumes 2 and 3 are simply futuristic war stories, with emphasis on brutality and mutilation. Volume 4 is a coming-of-age Yakuza story. Volume 5 is a ghost-in-the-machine story. Volumes 6 and 7 are street gang/drug cartel stories. And so on...I only mention these later volumes because they feel like completely different stories that simply reuse the same characters. Some of the later volumes are interesting in their own right, but together, the books begin to feel like schizophrenic, unfocused storytelling. While reading the later volumes, I got the impression that the original virus piece of the story becomes simply an excuse to explain the ridiculous cyborg-like weaponry implanted into the bodies of villain characters. I believe Eden's original premise of a pandemic-induced societal collapse is so powerful, but is wasted and eventually forgotten halfway through Volume 2."],

You know what I mean.....","I read Doomsday Warrior and fell into the trap, reading the other 25 or so to follow. They are good enough to read, but definately more pulp than literature. If you like the futuristic doomsday setting complete with mutants, evil agents from other defunct societies, sex, and fast-paced battle you will enjoy the read, otherwise don't even think about it. Pretty run of the mill as postwar books go, but some highpoints.

A machine that will extract every rebel secret and base location and thus mean the end of the American rebellion and freedom","Good book that will keep you reading. Only bad thing is that there's 19 of them. I only read the first one, and want to read the rest but I dont know if I will...","I actually read #3 and #4 before I read the first 2 and I was hooked after that. Its a futuristic battle of good vs evit and it will keep you entrapped until the last page and leave you begging for more. The only problems I had with these books are 1) The Rock can do just about anything except kill the ultimate evil, Col Killov. and 2)Rock gets captured and escapes in just about every book.","Don't get me wrong, I love this genre of literature. the idea for the series sounds great. The problem I have with the series is that it is just too over the top. Ted Rockson is apparently able to do anything in these books and often does, to the point of absurdity. It seems that there seriously is only one man that can save america from the russians, ted rockson! The author of the novels seems to write it so that the only american in the novel that understands combat tactics is rockson, in the 1st chapter of the 1st book he pulls off some stuff that is so insanely over the top that it was real hard for me to continue reading. The author also goes to great lengths to insure that the hero of the story is also the most interesting character in the book, he has eyes of 2 different colors and a stripe of white hair down the middle of his regular black hair. Also the author for some reason thinks that 9mm is the coolest ammo in the world, often having the characters use their 9mm \"liberators\" for uses that the ammo is not designed or good for. The use of grenades by the characters is stupid also, one character is written as pulling the pins on 2 grenades and throwing them at helicopters. it should have been written as he attempted to pull the pin on a grenade with his teeth and yanked out 2 of his teeth and then the helicopter shot him for being an idiot. So if you want a book packed full of miracle shots, a godlike hero completely surrounded by a bumbling renegade american force that relies soley on him for ideas, and idiotically over the top action sequences, this book is for you. or your children, whatever. just don't buy it full price."],

      "reviews.text":["This is a classic end-of-the-world novel. The plot develops with rigourous precision and inexorable realism; there's nothing Brin depicts that would be unreasonable should a global A-B-C war actually engulf the world to-morrow. Scary in its plausibility, and heartening because of its hopefulness, this is a wonderful book.Warning: I'd call this a 'PG-13' book, primarily because of some of the violence.","The movie was ok, but the book was great (how often do you hear that!). This was an engaging look at the life of a man doing what he needed to survive, while giving hope by accident. The story moves along quickly, and I couldn't put the book down. A great buy!","It starts off very well, the story draws you in immediately and I really liked the main character. It could have been a five star book, but for me persnally, the story fell apart in the second half with the super soldiers. The battle, as I read it and drew it in my head, seemed a little silly to me. But through it all I couldn't help pulling for the main character and the hope of a new beginning. If you like sci-fi, this is definately worth reading.","I first read the Postman when I was 18 and I loved it then but it just gets better with age. Kevin Costner's desecration of this book remains one of the greatest cinematographic crimes of all time.","Excellent and uplifting tale about trying to knit at least part of the US back together after a nuclear war. Good characters and believable plot. Ranks up there with Alas Babylon but reads more up to date. If you like stories about what happens after the end of the modern world (with no zombies!), don't miss this one.","I saw the movie first so was worried that i would not finish this book cause i already knew the story. But not the case at all! Nothing like the movie and much better!","Though dated the material holds up well. Quite a contrast to the movie,which is usually the case. Now that women are allowed in battle gave it a touch of poignancy.","I listened to the audio book and it completely pulled me in. Perhaps it was because it is set in a part of Oregon I know and love. Perhaps it was the reader. However, I think what pulled me in the most was the engaging story.Set in a post apocalyptic Oregon, a drifter spends a night in an old, abandoned/forgotten U.S. Mail jeep to keep warm and avoid a gang intent on beating him up. He steals the long dead postman's uniform for warmth and a few letters to read to pass the time. However, in his travels, he discovers the people are thrilled to have a postman around and he invents a story of being a postal inspector from a recovering government. The problem is his lies get bigger and more complex as he passes village to village, fulfilling the fantasies of the people and passing letters around. As his prestige grows, he finds himself at odds with local warlords and maintaining the facade of his creation.Brin writes a very tight story, examining the aspects of maintaining a lie and the inner turmoil of a weak-willed nobody who enjoys the perks and prestige his fabrications bring. I enjoyed watching the evolution into the leader he becomes and the change in his morals. Along the way, unbeknownst to him, he becomes the lie, making it a lie no longer.","I really enjoyed this novel. Brin did a great job giving some life to the main character Gordon Krantz. Gordon continued to fight his hardest to escape the lies he built only to fall deeper into them. With each lie however, hope is given to the surrounding towns and each look to Gordon as their savior. There are not huge levels of Sci-fi, but this is still a great post apocalyptic story.Now moving on to the movie adaptation. I thoroughly enjoyed the book just as much as I enjoyed the movie however, for two completely different reasons. Kevin Costner pretty much read the novel while he was doing work around the house, because he must have taken the script and had at it with the weed whacker, then stomped on it with his golf shoe, and topped it off by using a flamethrower. Whatever pieces were left over he made the movie and then mainlined some coke, then decided to make his own movie/ending. However, as unlike as the novel and the movie are I did really like Kevin Costner's movie, but I enjoy it as if it were a completely different concept involving a postman.","It feels a little odd to review a book so old that even the film version is practically archaic. But a friend only recently got me reading Brin, and this Brin book is my favorite so far. I love this book. For a start, I love the contemplative tone of the writing, and I enjoy following the protag, Gordon, through a post-apocalyptic Oregon. It's pretty fantastic to walk through a broken form of Eugene and a torn-up U of O campus, and then to travel farther up north where a civilized society has reseeded itself. Conceptually, the survival mechanism of pretending to be a postman is a compelling one because it quickly takes on a larger meaning than that of Gordon's survival. People place their hopes in weird ideals, and the postman represents the ideal of a unified nation. It represents the benefits that infrastructure brings to humanity--lofty dreams of education, wealth, and order. While the protag's main focus is to stay alive, the stolen uniform and a handful of old mail--that's it--enliven the people around him to desire more than base survival. The falseness doesn't matter, though, nor does it matter that what is driving the renewed civilization up north is also a facade. Hope (or magical thinking) is just that powerful. Also, I love that none of the romances pan out (unlike in the god-awful movie)--romance isn't the point at all, except in the pragmatic sense that Abby's husband has something to fight for after Abby becomes pregnant from Gordon's \"donated\" sperm. This isn't a false ideal of hope at all, and one that men need, I think, in order to build a society. It has a cyclical cause and effect to it.All in all, the thinky nature of the story is studded with enough action scenes to keep up the tension. I only suffered through a few eyerolls owing to the fact that the evil survivalists (whom Gordon must ultimately fight) live along the Rogue River in southern Oregon. Those who know Oregon will recognize that stereotype--oh, you know, the one about white militias stockpiling weapons. Yup. That was about my only criticism.","The novel the movie with the same name was based on is much better (although I admit to liking the film as well). Gordon Krantz is a wandering minstrel in a post-apocalyptic hell. Robbed by lesser survivalists, he comes across a post-Doomwar US Post Office vehicle with its dead driver inside. Intent on surviving, he dresses himself in the long-dead man's uniform, bringing the \"last idealist\" to a new role: that of a postman representing the Restored United States (a ruse to keep him alive). What he discovers is that people long for symbols to inspire them and unite. That, plus the common cause of stopping a Holnist ultra-survivalist invasion, return a bit of humanity to the long-suffering survivors as they struggle to rebuild from the ashes of the past.","David Brin's \"The Postman\" is a post-apocalyptic novel depicting civilization following a nuclear war which almost wiped out all of humanity. The main character, Gordon Krantz, spent many years following the disaster as a loner, drifting from place to place in search of a leader. He knew society could be repaired, and he wanted to follow a leader. Without giving away the plot, Gordon assumes the role of a Postman and many changes follow.I enjoyed this book because it really showed man at his best and worst. Brin paints a picture of the many ways in which different people react to situations. Some hide, others exist, some rebuild and some hunt and destroy. Gordon's character was a leader despite the fact he only wanted to follow.Brin makes you question your own actions were you in a similar situation. How would you respond? Be a sheep, a mole, a dove or a hawk?The book reads quickly and easily and would be appropriate for high schoolers.","Don't let the horrible movie spoil this book for you; they are very different bodies of work. In fact, if I were Brin, I'm not sure how I would have let that movie hit the screens, but that's not really relevant to this review.This is a post-apocolyptic tale of a survivor who runs across the remains of a US postal worker, and dons his uniform to stay alive. Soon he discovers that the uniform gives him an instant authority with people which allows him access to places he might otherwise be shut out of. He discovers that this authority comes with a price, and he finds himself fighting for his life and the lives of the people he's met and trying to defend against the attacks of an army of ruthless survivalist armies.Brin only briefly describes how the world ended in this book, and that is only over time. Since the reasons for the apocolypse are not very important to the story, it probably would have seemed out of place to have added them. I wanted to point that out because at times fans of post-apocolypse works tend to be looking for a new and imaginative way for humanity to destroy themselves, so be warned you won't find it here.Brin doesn't go very deep into his character development. Other than Gordon, we don't learn very much about the supporting cast, even though a few of them have very prominant roles in the book.The story itself was entertaining for me, and I found it to be a quick read. It was interesting to watch Gordon get himself deeper and deeper into his charade, and to see the desperation of many of the survivors to find something to believe in. I think Brin really captured what life may be like for the early survivors of a world-ending war who remember the past but may not have totally lost hope that the old world would rise again.Also, as Gordon got back into touch with more survivors, he began to morph back from the survivor to \"the idealist\", which often put his life in danger, which was the opposite of how he would have acted before he found the postman's uniform.Mr. Brin does not seem to be a big fan of the survivalist movement, and one of the heroes of the story is femenisim; so if these things bother you, you might want to avoid this book. I was worried that Brin was going to end the book laying this on a little too thick, but in the end it was well put together.I've seen reviews stating that this isn't Brin's best work, but I thought he did rather well. It was concise; perhaps a bit spare on the character development, and I thought the whole plot was imaginative, so I'm looking forward to reading more books by him.I would recommend this book to anyone.","Anyone who saw the movie and thinks they know what happens now so the novel is ruined for them, or who disliked the film for its cheezy and epic required dramatic music etc. (I loved it myself!) shouldn't be put off reading the novel! Although the theme of hope and the symbol of a postman beginning to reunite a nation is the same, (and the occasional character or event) essentially it is completely different...Brin's writing style is enjoyable but not constantly completely engrossing like Michael Marshall Smith (amazing sci-fi writer!)or Anne Rice, for example, but the imagination and scope and detail, the characters and ideals and events that he describes are so real - he really recreates the whole world (well, the US anyway) post-apocalypse and its very believable. Towards the end I was completely enraptured in the events and its a great book!If you've seen the film dont be put off when you're reading by thinking you know what happens next, go into it with an open mind because what happens is almost completely different...","In my experience, if something exists as both a book and a movie, whichever I encounter first is the one that I like best and &quot;The Postman&quot; is no exception. I do feel that the Costner film would have benefitted GREATLY from the detailed explanation of the circumstances which led to society's collapse and the rise of the Holnists which Brin provides in his novel. However, by trimming the fat from the novel (a priesthood of timid computer nerds, a brooding hippie-cyborg)Costner actually created a more believeable story.It has been stated several times that the novel's greatest weakness is that Brin tries to cram too many themes into too small a space. The novel goes from being an engrossing study into societal decay and the power of myth to inspire hope to a treatise on male/female social dynamics in the space of a few pages without us understanding why. Likewise, Brin transfers the source of horror surrounding the evil Holnists from their ghoulish and all-too-plausible socio-political beliefs to an a contrived, overused device of man fusing with machine to create the ultimate evil. Like many others, I also found the ending to be rushed and unsatisfying.However, I overall I really did like this story very much. Try not to view it and the movie as the same story, but two entirely seperate imaginings of how the same story *might* have happened. A very worhtwhile read for any fan of speculative or apocalyptic ficiton.","This is the most thought provoking end of the world novel since Lucifer's Hammer. David Brin takes up the question of what roles government, and leadership take in our society. He points to a need for people to take responsibility. The main character in the novel finds out, quite accidentally, that all that is needed for people to recover from the most terrible tragedies is a sense of direction and leadership. This book gives one of the most candid views on how people respond to our government, and helps to remind us what kind of effort it has taken to build this country.In the novel, the main character finds an old postal uniform with some ten year old letters, and finds out that something as simple as someone delivering mail can bring people hope. He then finds that this helps people remember that they were once part of something greater than themselves. This book manages to be inspiring without droping down to the level of a cheesy disney movie.The only reason this book doens't get five stars from me is that I felt the end cheated in a way that made it lose some its focus. But this hardly overshadows the brilliant bulk of this book.","Anyone who fears a world war should read this book. It is obvious that the author knows a lot about politics and is well read. This book presents an interesting main character, good plot, great setting, and believable back up characters to create a dynamic read overall.","Mr Brin wastes no time in posing the hard questions: What really constitutes civilization? How much of it is illusion? How might that quintessentially american virtue -- rugged individualism -- turn out to be America's undoing? And in asking these questions he lays the groundwork for a philosophical and cautionary tale that might've compared favorably to A Canticle For Leibowitz -- if only he'd been able to carry through with it.Instead, inexplicibly, The Postman changes genres in mid-stream and transmogrifies from philosophical musings to cartoonish action in the space of just a few pages. The big questions posed at the beginning are never really answered. The bad guys, who might otherwise have caused an NRA type to stop and give his philosophy a serious second thought, are all two-dimensional sub-human supermen with no believable motivation for thier bizzare actions. And to top it all off, at the end we're treated with a deus ex machina that would've choked Sophocles.A disappointing ending to what had otherwise promised to be an excellent book.","I found this to be Brin's most frustrating book.The Postman's America went out with whimper, not with a bang. The exact cause is unimportant, and I'm not even sure it's revealed. (Nuclear weapons were used, but they seemed to be a last gasp as nations collapsed.)The true cause of the collapse was the vermin who nibble on the edges of our soul; they caused America to lose faith in herself. When the inevitable rough spot happened people just resigned themselves to the &quot;inevitable.&quot; America collapsed into isolated feudal societies; most of these pocket fiefdoms were ruled by &quot;survivalists&quot; who had pushed the country over the edge with their own egocentricism.Many years later our protagonist arrives in Oregon. He is no hero; instead of fighting to improve his own town he was hoping to find a mythical land of easy living. He's attacked and barely escapes with his life. To survive he takes a postman's uniform which dates to the collapse. He also takes the postman's leather bag.At the next town he approaches cautiously, but a few other survivors of the earlier America insist on seeing him as a symbol of a reborn America. Long delayed letters in the leather bag reinforce his status. Like Moses, he has found his promised land only to be turned away. While many townsfolk know that a reborn America is just a fantasy, others would never tolerate his presence as a constant reminder of how they fooled themselves. He relunctantly moves on to the next town.To make a long story short, America has not been reborn... except in one small area where a reborn United States is personified in an unwilling postman. Young boys are eager to join the new postal service. Families are reunited for the first time in years as townsfolk look beyond their own town borders. The protagonist feels like a fraud and misses the miracle of rebirth surrounding him.Needless to say this rejuvenation is not welcomed by everyone. A survivalist nation-state in southern Oregon and northern California wants to expand its slave base, but it can no longer pick off towns one by one through sheer intimidation.This is a wonderful setup. Will the common citizens newly rearmed with a faith in society defeat the heavily armed barbarians who have a social pecking order so rigid that barnyard fowl seem democratic? Which matters more, steel forged to the human will, or the human will tempered to the hardness of steel?We never learn. The climatic battle is not between two men from different worlds, but between two men with special military augmentation to their bodies who just happened to be on opposing sides. The change could not have been more abrupt if we went to Psychotic Theaters and saw the first two-thirds of a classic Hitchcock thriller followed by the final third of Friday the Thirteenth, part VI.The movie treatment of the book has not been released yet, but I would not be surprised if the superhuman feats of the final fight are emphasized and the morality plays on the importance of self-reliance in the service of the community lost. And that's the ultimate shame. In many ways our country is forming isolated fiefdoms of special interests; instead of asking what's best for the nation our first demand is &quot;what's in it for me?&quot; The Postman is a good cautionary story, but the augmented marines seize the story and leave its broken body trampled in the mud.The first two-thirds of the book are a solid ten. The deux ex machina conclusion would have been interesting in another novel, but not this one.","Read this back in high school. I remember clearly the excitement I felt when I began reading this book. The back of the book and the opening seemed perfectly in sync; in a post-apocalyptic world one-man restores hope and begins to rebuild a ravaged America... Ahhh. Now if that were only really the case.The first 1/3 or so of the book is about the \"postman\" but after that it turns into a weird liberal - maybe \"peacenik\" is a more appropriate descriptor - rant against evil survivalists and the military. The author clearly doesn't know beans about the military mind and the book's climax seems more like a novelization of a Manga plot or over-the-top anime movie. It certainly doesn't seem like the work of so well-regarded a person as David Brin.I really came to hate this book as I slogged through it. When reading a book that promises hope and the triumph of man over hardship, you don't want to suddenly find yourself on the receiving end of a double-barreled harangue on the evils of a military machine run amok.Besides, it is not even a good diatribe. It is basically an infantile rehash of the old saw that the military just wants to kill and kill some more. Frankly, it would be funny if it weren't so off-putting. It just goes way off the rails as it rumbles along to its unsatisfying end. Groups are introduced and hyped then wiped out like they were insignificant. I also felt that most of the mechanics of a post-apocalyptic world were simply ignored.Brin would have had a winner if he figured out how to capitalize on the ideas at the beginning of his novel. Sadly, he didn't. So, save your money and pick something with a real plot rather than just a pretext for inflicting anti-war invective on unsuspective readers. For good anti-war fodder read \"A Bright And Shining Lie.\" For insight into the military mind read Hal Moore's classic \"We Were Soldiers Once, And Young.\" For great post-apocalyptic reading look up \"The Earth Abides,\" \"Alas Babylon,\" or even the short story \"Thunder and Roses\" by Theodore Sturgeon.","Not as fantastic or far removed from the familiar as Brin's other books, the Postman tells a hopeful tale of post-apocalyptic America. True to form, the Postman leaves the reader with more questions than answers.","This is simply one of the best novels I have read in a long time. It's various themes and morals can be felt, not just seen, as one reads this moving novel. It is a must read for anyone who still believes in love of country and one's duty to his fellow men.","Forget the ego-centric mess that Kevin Costner made of the film. This is an excellent book showing the effect of hope and self-belief on ordinary people.","The Postman is a parable about modern America. It plays on a completely different level when you consider that the hero was completely wrong about faking the Restored United States; he was busy creating it. It may have been a lie the first few times he said it, but a nation is a collective figment of the imagination. He began to get people's imaginations thinking about being part of a nation. He created the Restored United States as surely as Jefferson, Washington and Franklin created the original United States. A nation is an idea and ideas are the most powerful weapon you possess.","These novel by David Brin is one of the most inspiring story he has ever written.The Postman is unlike other SF novels which emphasis on technology.The Postman is about hope and redemption.A very moving story.Keep up the good work Brin!","The Postman is an interesting book, yes, but lacks a good ending. It was obviously written that way to make room for a sequel (Which never materialized, by the way).All in all, I enjoyed it. The plot was very creative. It was just the ending that I didn't like.","I first heard about David Brin's postman when the Kevin Costner movie was publicised on &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; (naturally!). Of course, we all know what happened to the movie but that should not deter someone from reading Brin's superb novel. As someone who loves to write letters, I could empathise with the villagers who relished receiving letters - the thought of communications reunifying the &quot;Restored States of America&quot; was a superb concept. Yes, I would like to read a sequel to the novel. Who knows, maybe someone else will have the opportunity to remake The Postman as a movie which has the vision that David Brin's novel has. Maybe a director of the calibre of Atom Agoyan can tackle a remake?","if there really was a war (or whatever) that destroyed/alienated civiliation? What would it be like to not have to live by any rules save the rules of survival? This book truly made me think of whether I would be up to the challenge. Not to be a Gordon Krantz, necessarily, but simply to live as long as he and all the others did in a chaotic and violent &quot;new&quot; world. I almost stopped reading it, though, when Cyclops was introduced. I though to myself &quot;Oh, no, here comes some story about some magical machine that will save the world, or plot to destroy it further!&quot; I won't talk further about it here, so as not to ruin this sub-plot, but if you come to that point and draw the same conclusion as I did, please, just keep reading. Great books leave you thinking and wondering. It's been over a month since I've read this, and the &quot;what ifs&quot; are still lingering in my mind!","I read this book when it was originally published back in the '80s It was and is one of my favorite books. I re-read it once every other year. A lot of your reviewers who dislike it seem to be missing the point of the book. Yes, it is a post-apocalyptic story, but this is not hard science fiction. It's social commentary and, most importantly, this is a story about the power of stories. The details of &quot;how the apocalypse happened&quot; and, to a certain point, the characters themselves are secondary to this. This is a story about hopes and dreams and how they can transform us for good and for bad.A bad story is what destroys the United States, not nuclear war. The words of Nathan Holn are what finally bring down a nation. Now Gordon has a different story to try and bring it back. Words, ideas have more power than actions. Gordon's story of an R.U.S.A., the story of Dena's Scouts and the idea of Cyclops are the tenuous glue that will bring a community together.","For those who enjoyed &quot;The Postman&quot;, I recommend &quot;Earth Abides&quot; by George R. Stewart. They share a post population crash theme and characters that act and react in a believable manner. It is a little dated but thoroughly enjoyable.","One of the greatest relatively short SF books I've ever read. This was my first encounter with Brin, and I was very impressed. It is possible to read The Postman as a straight adventure, a philosophical allegory, or a satire of modern America--so many different messages, I think, are hidden here. Brin sheds light on that strange world of survivalist/neo-fascist militias, and creates completely believable, ordinary characters. It is the perfect liberal humanist response to A Canticle for Leibowitz! If you were one of those happy few who disagreed with the critics about the film adaptation, you'll love this book.","Excellent book. It was different than the movie and in some ways better. I would definitely recommend it. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.","I didn't know what to expect with this book was certainly happy that I read it. All I had ever hear was that it was a bad movie. Now I will watch the movie and see if it really is or not.About the book though... A very deep story that, while not as detailed as most apocalyptic stories, has a really strong and likeable lead character.The complexity of the story is what I found so appealing. The lies that are told from the Restored United States to the Cyclops added a layer to what could have been an average story.I did not like the politics of the book. It seemed to be trying to convey a comment on American history that seemed to be stretching at best. I was also not to fond of the ending. There seems to be something that was trying to be said that would have been better if the author had just came out and said it. Maybe I just didn't get it.Overall a very good read.","I see a book as well worth reading when, years later, you can still remember the characters and plot. This is one of the few books that stands out for me. I can remember scenes in the book, interactions between characters and the premise. I cannot tell you how it stacks up against other of it's genre, because this is probably the first post-apocalyptic book I read and thus had a big impact on me. But it's been years and I can still remember the changes that happened to the main character as he traveled the crazy new world.I am reading a much newer book calledThe Passage: A Novel, now. It's a similar \"throw back of civilization\" type novel. It is longer than Postman, but has a few similar concerns. Good books both of them, if you like science fiction with introspective angles.","I liked the Postman's second half because it delves more into the Holnists and the neohippy Powhatan, and it reiterates the power of myth with the Cyclops and Danaids. The movie covers the first third of the book, mainly a simple message of hope, and patriotic duty, within the context of the Big Cause(Big Lie), but I wish it adhered more closely to the science fiction novel including the second half.","Copyright in 1985 by David Brin. This book survives the test of time. I can't think of any of this genre I haven't read and I recommend The Postman highly. It's an excellent story, well thought out, well written, and believable. The characters are very well developed, and the story line never falters from its beginning to the excellent ending. I enjoyed the movie as well, and although it was true to the idea of the book certain items (not many) were changed. And honestly, I'm glad I read the book last as it helped me understand the film better.","David Brinn does an excellent job at creating a realistic world after a nuclear war. He does this by using two great characters, Gordon and Nathan Holn. Gordon is a survivalist that was alive before the war and frequently reminds us of what we have now that we take for granted. He is kind hearted, very intelligent and has a strong will to survive. He uses his skills in drama to get food and supplies. Gordon is the opposite Nathan Holn. Nathan is also intelligent and strong willed but he acquired power of a large gang of survivalist called the Holnist and uses them for plundering and destruction. Nathan is also knowledgeable in the fine arts and is impressed with Gordon. These charters become enemies. Gordon was taken prisoner by Nathan's men and went to \"boot camp\" to become part of the Holnist. Gordon escapes to find out that he created something very special before he left. My favorite part of the book took place during the beginning of the book. Gordon was sitting down to eat his meal at camp when some thieves ambushed him. He had to run away in the bushes. Gordon had his gun but in the postwar days ammo was spare, so he dare not use it. When Gordon went back to his camp after the thieves left, he discovered that they have taken everything of value. Gordon decided to cut them off up the path. As Gordon went through the dusk he saw a shinny reflection from what appeared to be the thieves hide out. Gordon arrived at the \"hideout\" only to find that it was a mail car from the prewar days. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes adventure or a book that inspires and creates hope.","I had never heard of this book until a friend gave it to me to keep me occupied on a long train ride. I thought it moved slow at first and it took me a while to get through the first couple of chapters. However after a while the plot took off and I found it almost impossible to put the book down. This is one of the most interesting, exiting, and moving books I've read in a long time. Thoroughly enjoyable and highly recomendable.","Even though I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, this is one book that should not be passed up. I highly recommend the book for anyone who has questions about the movie.","I loved this book. Both the setting and the characters were perfect. The plot was excellent and once I started reading this book I just couldn't put it down. This book is a great piece of work and I definately suggest that you read it.","In David Brin's postapocalyptic novel, The Postman, the civilized world has been destroyed by a brief nuclear war and the ensuing nuclear winter, diseases, and barbarism. Set in what used to be Oregon, remnants of civilization exist in small independent towns inhabited by survivors and their offspring eking out a living through agriculture and trades.Gordon Krantz is a lone wanderer, surviving by moving from village to village as a storyteller and minstrel. He finds a dead postal worker's skeleton in the woods and co-opts his clothing to stay warm. With the bag of postage, he hits upon a scam of representing himself as a postal inspector of the \"Restored United States,\" sent to establish post offices in each town and re-establish mail service. He is surprisingly embraced everywhere he travels because of people's thirst for community and communication... and hope. He unwittingly becomes a victim of his own scam and is reluctantly thrust into a leadership role in reuniting Oregon, and by implication the rest of the nation in the future. Along the way, he discovers the way each town coped with the aftermath of the war, makes various friendships, falls in love, and leads the war against the rogue survivalists from the south.I quite enjoyed this novel and found it uplifting in the message of a regular man who had greatness thrust upon him and came to realize that he had to take responsibility. The movie, starring Kevin Costner, is also good but diverges a good bit from the book, especially in the second half. As is often the case, the book is better.","At one point in David Brin's &quot;The Postman,&quot; the narrator intones: &quot;Gordon's appointed postmasters would continue lying without knowing it, using the tale of a restored nation to bind the land together, until the fable wasn't needed anymore. Or until, by believing it, people made it come true.&quot; There is more than a touch of William James here, of making it so by believing in it, of the &quot;Will to Believe.&quot; Certainly, Kevin Costner's movie version demanded a heavy dose of the willing suspension of disbelief from us when an army of postmen rode to the rescue under a restored &quot;Old Glory,&quot; forming an unwitting parody of &quot;cavalry to the rescue&quot; scene in old westerns, as well as of an earlier Costner epic ... the mounted ride-by presented as holy defiance in both The Postman and Dances With Wolves.Because Brin was crafting a book, and not painting visual symbols, his demands seem more reasonable. Despite some stretches, and unlike other reviewers, I did not see the mano-a-mano at the end as &quot;deus ex machina,&quot; but instead a reasonable question -- are we as capable of creating one kind of &quot;superman&quot; as that other, most feared? The fight woven into the endstory is, after all, symbolic of a struggle between Titans (an image and a term Brin consciously employs): competing world views. If we are prepared by science fiction to accept the evil member of the &quot;superman&quot; twins, why not also the good? Is science fiction so jaded, or will it accept the myth of the good in people as quickly as the myth of evil?By using the Postman as the handy symbol for &quot;swell the music, pass around the Kleenex&quot; scenes, Costner buries the underlying irony. The Postman as epic hero.... Brin demands that we attempt, and then understand that it is, faith in such simple images of normalcy, justice and peace that make it so. As his apocolyptic tale has it: &quot;More people died due to the breakdown and lawlessness -- the shatt! ered web of commerce and mutual assistance -- than from all the bombs and germs, or even from the three-year dusk.&quot; It is belief that must re-weave the web, not brute power.Brin's demand, the demand he lays equally at the feet of the idealist, the pragmatist and the intellectual, is more fundamental than the &quot;willing suspension of disbelief&quot; with which we watch TV reruns. We do not allow the show to end, but make it real by our belief that it is. This demand is at the core of a basic rift in philosophies of law which both book and movie drive home. To Costner's credit in an otherwise overwrought and manipulative movie, he did not lose sight of that demand.The Holness and survivalists, in both Brin's work and Costner's, are embodiments of a conception of law as a one-sided exertion of power. Brin comes close to quoting the power-oriented political philosophy of Thomas Hobbes' classic &quot;Leviathan&quot; when he describes the life of women in the new order as &quot;poor, painful and short.&quot; Against this philosophy is one that grounds law and orderliness in the notion of the reciprocal nature of the relationship between people and law, the governed and the governing. Against the power-oriented visions of law and government, Brin has set a view, well expounded in jurisprudential works by the late Lon Fuller, who saw law as an enterprise with an internal morality demanding commitment from both the government and the governed to do things well and right if it is ever to succeed. Law as more than Fascist &quot;Law and Order,&quot; imposed from without, law as good order springing from the better side of people.By the story medium he chose, we should assume that Brin is, after all, making a point in political philosophy. We slip further and further away from our own responsibility for our government and our laws, a responsibility which the Postman shortsightedly fails to recognize as his own when he whines about wanting someone [else] to take responsibilit! y to set things right. The further we slip, the more we silently accept the message of the Nathan Holn and his survivalist gangs. We become mere followers in a world where only a few are willing to take responsibility ... and seeing the free reign they are given, abuse it.Unfortunately, there is in Brin's tale more than a suggestion that &quot;extraordinary individuals&quot; are still required, and that it is acceptable for those individuals to use the &quot;noble lie.&quot; In this one particular, Costner surpasses Brin at least once, when the movie's Abbey admits that she knew that the Postman was not really a messenger from the restored government -- a passing moment of recognition by the &quot;little people&quot; that they are participating in the forging of myth into reality. In Brin's book, only the leaders, the cognoscienti, appear to be smart enough and dedicated enough to acknowledge the Big Lie yet adhere to it as a Noble Necessity.The fundamental message, still, is a simple one, and one that America sorely needs to grasp as one of the central demands of a free and open society. We are responsible for our government and our laws. It is only by accepting responsibility that we can keep alive our part in our government and our fate. There is no Sugarloaf Mountain on which we can hide for long, and the other alternative is passive and slave-like acceptance.","I really enjoyed the first half of this book. The wandering postman poser bringing hope to every town he visits. I enjoy the post apocalyptic genre, and felt the story was proceeding enjoyably without many post-ap cliches. I really liked the hope springing eternal aspect to it.Unfortunately the second half of the book devolved into something that could only be saved by deus ex machina - which is exactly what happened. The characters stopped acting like believable people. Critical events happened that were difficult to believe and never explained (the Scout's plan \"somehow\" was uncovered). Characters were being killed off almost as though the author were afraid that the story wasn't having any emotional impact for the last many pages so maybe if someone we had been introduced to died...I was very disappointed by the end of the book. If it had left the standard \"good guy vs. bad guy climax\" out, the whole story would have been better for it. If you really want to enjoy the book, just stop at the second interlude.","I have to go against the overwhelming tide of opinion that holds this novel to be an excellent work. The first half of the novel isn't bad as we accompany the protaganist and his effort to survive in post-apopcalyptic America. The character isn't heroic. Instead he's a survivor. And then we get started with the postman charade. At first it has potential - the reestablishing of communications to rebuild civilization. The lowly mailman suddenly stepping into a position as savior or at least rebuilder. The mundane civil servant now is heroic. Very intruiging. But then David Brin - ex-NASA scientist - has to bring in technology. Suddenly we have genetically engineered super-soldiers and something called neo-hippie technology. In one quick turn we are in some kind of world involving ressurrected 1960's philosophy! The book wanders around, looking for some kind of philosophical grounding. Why? Isn't it enough to have a story about the rebuilding of the country? Or did David Brin become bored with such an Earthy story and feel the need to go into space - so to speak. No I believe this book suffers from a lack of focus. A good idea, but not carried out completely.","Brin's tale of a loner's midlife journey in a world devastated by warfare, climate change, and disease is exactly what genre-bound science fiction readers expect. The protagonist, Gordon, is an intellectual male whose resourcefulness has helped him adapt to a world whose institutions have collapsed and whose people live in tiny, scrabbling communities. He traverses the (former) Northwestern United States in vague search of something hope for - but accidentally, by way of a postman's uniform he finds in a moment of desperation, brings hope to everyone he encounters. Ultimately he must reconcile himself to the world as it has become and decide what is truly worth fighting for.\"The Postman\" fancies itself an ideological novel, and Brin lays it on thick. Gordon's search for meaning is unceasing, and unceasingly discussed. While his crusade is at first sympathetic, it quickly wears thin under the novel's weight as, instead of developing Gordon's character, Brin attributes his every decision to the increasingly desctructive cause.More than just lazily written, \"The Postman\" can be frustratingly immature. The protagonist's - and the book's - tone toward technology is plausible for the young college student Gordon once was, but inappropriate for a middle-aged man whose life and country have been destroyed by a machine society. Brin's version of feminism seems designed to win bonus points with female fans, but its heavy-handedness and condescension are no less alienating than outright sexism. These flaws, combined with Brin's broad-stroked, barely-serviceable prose, undermine any serious reader's enjoyment.But \"The Postman\" is appealing nonetheless. It's easy to get into, and the action sequences are freqent and page-turning. The plot meanders pleasantly, making the book seem longer and meatier than it actually is, and although the ending is both sudden and predictable, it's not unsatisfying. And ultimately, Brin offers what many sci-fi readers are looking for: a world in which things are different, a new set of rules and a history that comments on our own. This is not great literature, but it's a fairly good book.","I love end-of-the-world fiction. My picks for the best of the genre include &quot;The Stand,&quot; &quot;On the Beach,&quot; &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; and &quot;Lucifer's Hammer.&quot; Unfortunately, &quot;The Postman&quot; just isn't up to the standards set by these works. For one thing, the narrative ark takes some twists and turns into some unusal, but not at all together satisfying directions. For another, several key moments in the plot are based on non-too-plausible scenes of the hero overhearing conversations of his adversaries. Some of the action scenes are not terribly believable, and the ending of the book reads like a cliched Western. Nevertheless, Brin does pack his novel with a number of interersting ideas and notions that at least make it worth reading for those with an interest in this particular genre.","\"You know why we just did that, don't you?\" the reductive shell of a female character knowingly asked Gordon. She had long hair, and the diminished subservient personality of an aged male-virgin's fantasy. Her fearful, yet seductive stare betrayed an author's utter lack of contact with real women. She continued, \"So, both of us understand why that just happened?\"Gordon nodded, and returned his focus to the ambiguous task at hand. \"Well I don't!\" cried the reader, panicked. But the chapter had already changed, and like the anthropomorphized weather, the mysterious dialogue was unyielding.***Several unspecified units of time later, the reader scrambled to find purchase on a new plot line. Gordon scraped the depths of his jaded mind to find obscure, archaic, quasi-metaphorical words to replace the simplest of adjectives. The tone was bombastic and stiff. An impentetrable fog of passive voice and rampant - Gordon chuckled as he acknowledged that some might even say reckless - thesaurus usage.\"For God's sakes, man! I prayed that you would return safely!\" Gordon announced, with the boisterous formalized fervor of an Austonian aristocrat. Although there had been no context, it surfaced over the next few lines that he was speaking to a character previously unmentioned. Had the reader encountered this character before? Flipping back through the last few pages of italicized monologue proved inconclusive. He could not be sure. The character had spawned like a specter from the abyss of a sudden and unceremonious chapter break. This would be all the explanation given. A new chapter began, and the character vanished.***The reader despaired at the unsettling crumbling of a once coherent and optimistic plot, abandoned so many pages ago. Had the brilliant first third of the book been a dream? He could barely remember. Characters and locations now flitted in and out of the universe like confused curse words in a reader's mind. Bitter tears spewed forth, languishing in the protagonist's hypocrisy and wasted potential as the very genre itself shifted violently. Gordon's obsessively-repeated mantra breached again, this time taking on a new, universal meaning: \"Who will take responsibility now?\" Exhausted and exasperated, the reader bid Gordon farewell. Although the meeting had not been wholly unpleasant, they did not meet again.","There just aren't enough epic novels of post-apocalyptic survival. I have enjoyed every one that I've read, and I keep trying to find more to read and enjoy. Now, that is not to say that all of them were good. Many of them were completely ridiculous and repellant. David Brin's &quot;The Postman,&quot; however, manages to be not only enjoyable, but also good.On his way across the fractured, war-wracked Northwest, world-weary Gordon is shot at, robbed, and generally kicked around. That's the nature of life in post-WWIII Oregon. As the story begins, Gordon has been working as an itinerant entertainer, reciting Shakespear for a bowl of soup and a place to sleep. When he stumbles across an old US Postal Serviceman's uniform, though, he decides to try a new scam. The idea of the United States' continued existence, however, is something of a free radical, inspiring anger and defiance against local warlords. Gordon becomes an important, if unwilling, figurehead in the locals' struggle for autonomy and a return to real civilized life.Brin's book is a good read. The story's characters are few, but generally interesting and believable. Several of his sub-plots are iffy, especially his third act treatment of male-female relations. The book was written in the 80's, and his prediction of world events in the 1990s is also so wrong as to detract somewhat from the story (at least in my reading.) Still, it's satisfying, overall, and has both a sense of humor and a moral, not to mention laser satellites and artificial intelligences. For sci-fi fans, this is a fine choice.","Before SF novelist David Brin became known as one of the \"Killer Bs\" of 80s and 90s SF, he penned a serial novel called \"The Postman,\" a post-apocalyptic romp through the Williamette Valley in Oregon. Set in an area dominated by militias, survivalists, and the kinds of folks who like to blame Jewish people and blacks for America's troubles, Brin lampooned the typical, gutsy, survival-of-the-fittest attitude in post-apocalyptic (PA) fiction, creating a unique blend of adventure story and important moral lesson. In an interview, Brin said that most PA fiction revels in the downfall of civilization, creating a kind of macho paradise which would be great if you were a gun-toting conservative white male. For everyone else, it would be hell, and that is exactly what \"The Postman\" tackles.Fifteen years after the Doomwar, a combination nuclear, biological, and chemical exchange between the US and an unknown enemy, Gordon roams the landscape looking for a cause to follow. The largest organization in this atmosphere are a loosely-organized militia-army, who follow the teachings of the deceased Nathan Holn, a racist whose beliefs about life and freedom were a mix of Ayn Rand, David Duke, and a badly warped Charles Darwin. Gordon, a college-educated thinking man, wants nothing to do with the militias, but is inadvertantly forced into acting when bandits steal his clothes and he is forced to dress as a postman and invent a story about the Restored United States to get some food.On his way, Gordon meets towns wallowing in drugs and violence, paranoid people so scared by oppression they trust no one, and an organization seemingly controlled by a computer artificial intelligence. When the militias begin attacking the Williamette Valley in far greater fervor, Gordon begins to organize the resistance, aided in part by George Powhatan, an organizer who has begun to rebuild civilization in his own way.\"The Postman\" makes clear that the downfall of civilization would not be a good thing, especially if you happened to be a woman, or black, or anything else not conforming to the WASP-militia stereotypes. Aside from a good adventure story, Brin's book bucks convention and treads new groud, providing an obvious stepping stone for later SF novels in the genre like \"The New Madrid Run\" and \"The Rift.\" The prose can be rocky, but given \"Postman\" was published serially (and wasn't necessarily aspiring to high literature), this can be overlooked for the far more positive points of its content.Final Grade: B-","&quot;The Postman&quot; is set in the 21st century. A war has brought about the collapse of civilization. America, once a great nation, no longer exists. All that is left are ruined cities, scattered tribes and lawlessness. It has been like this for sixteen years.The hero is 34 year-old Gordon Krantz. He is travelling across the country, looking for something. Some sign of revival, someone who is &quot;taking responsibility&quot;. After being robbed by bandits, Gordon is left with almost nothing. It looks as if he will either starve or freeze to death. Then, by an amazing stoke of luck, he finds the body of a postman. He puts on the uniform, and from that point, even though he doesn't know it, he has a new purpose.He visits different tribes claiming to be a representative of the new government, the Restored United States. Gordon is really acting out an elaborate scam so he can get food and help. But Gordon is also giving people hope. Gordon becomes totally involved in his role, so that he almost believes in the lie himself. He even delivers mail to people as he travels.&quot;The Postman&quot; has a &quot;Mad Max&quot; feel to it. There isn't as much action however, it's more of an intellectual story. This is the only novel I've read by David Brin. Even though we're told it's wrong to lie, Gordon's deception is the catylist for America's revival. The return of technology, a new beginning.Everyone needs something to believe in. It's what keeps us going when times are hard. This is the message I believe Brin is trying to get across.","Actually I can't attest to having seen said movie, but a cursory reading of the plot of the movie shows that they seemed to have played a bit fast and loose with this book, which considering the reviews it got, probably wasn't a good thing. Oh well. To each his own, you're never going to get an exact translation. At least they're restored the brilliant reissue cover, much as one can admire Kevin Costner as an actor, I would have preferred not to have his bedraggled face staring at me every time I go to pick the book up. That all stated, this is a highly entertaining and fairly straightforward book, probably not as deep as Brin would like it to be, but a good try nonetheless. We have a future US destroyed by war, with scattered towns basically living their own separate existences, while an army run by survivalists inspired by a Hitleresque fanatic are trying to take over everything in sight. Our hero enters this mess while trying to escape some roving raiders and finds a postal uniform and some mail . . . from there he concocts a lie to help him get food and stuff but winds up inspiring everyone and restoring hope to a faded nation, regaining his own lost ideals in the process. Needless to say there's plenty to like in this book, Brin's envisioning of a future US with everyone living in the shadow of the past war is great, the story moves at a quick pace, so even when it's not that engrossing you're still reading, and the situations are varied, with a fairly uplifting message that manages to come across as sincere. However, most of the stuff you can see coming from miles away so don't expect &quot;shocks on every page&quot;, with the exception of maybe the main character and some others, most of the people populating the book are a tad one dimensional, sure there's lot of them but very few of them feel &quot;real&quot;. Brin appears to be shooting for the same status that Earth Abides (a really great novel, by the way), Alas, Babylon and maybe even On the Beach have garnered over the years but he defeats himself by making it too science fictional, what worked in those books was a palpable sense of reality, that this stuff could happen tomorrow, Brin's got too many talking computers, augmented humans and fancy future stuff to give the reader a true connection with his future. So in the end what you wind up with may not be an enduring classic beloved by millions but merely an extremely entertaining and diverting SF novel. Which, all told, may be enough.","If you've seen the movie version with Kevin Costner then you know the story, though the novel is even better, as is usual in such things. The story of a post apocalyptic world of warlords and people just trying to get along, it delves into the hopes and dreams of people trying to survive, where a man brings along an idea that the government is trying to reorganize and help them. A great read by a very good writer and well worth the look. Highly recommend.","There are very few Armageddon tales that are as well constructed as this one is. 'The Handmaid's Tale\", the trend-setting \"We\" and \"A Canticle for Leibowitz\" while also being well done, lack the overall atmosphere created in this dystopic novel. David Brin not only creates a believable tale of the future destruction of the planet but he brings so many other concepts into it as well. Women's equal role in society, the possible dark future of technology, the innate bruteness of some of society's males, the roles that hope, responsibility, honesty and altruism play in social structure, and what is necessary to become a 'hero' in a world that needs it most. The ending, in itself, is highly realistic insomuch that we are left with hope for the future that is clouded over by the sadness of the past.Please do not equate this novel with Kevin Kostner's movie of the same title. While both attempt to deal with the same concept, they are as different as chocolate and chalk.......","So far the book is very enjoyable, especially if you like this genre. Now that it is 2011, time of events in the story take a little imaginative restructuring on the readers part. If you have seen the popular movie I still recommend this book, as events are different. Also a little light is shed on things that, in the movie, may have inspired questions.","The front half of this book is great. Gordon Krantz, struggling across the wilds of the Western United States, telling stories and singing songs to earn his keep along the way. A minstrel spinning tales reminding people who they are and what they were before a series of events called only The Doomwar. He continues doing the same but in a broader context after becoming the eponymous Postman.That's the front of the book.The second half, unfortunately, lacks that same power and wonder. The figure of adventure becomes little more than a bureaucrat, and the carefully crafted tale a hairy-chested men's science fiction adventure novel, complete with genre clich&eacute;s and right-wing manifestos. And I like a good manifesto ...","Author David Brin has done a fine job crafting the United States post collapse, however, he has a completely different take on the port events. Inspired by the rigid, extremist survivalists of the 1970's and early 1980's, Brin chose to write a post-apocalyptic science-fiction novel focusing on the potential influence extremists could have on society after collapse.The novel is well written, with enjoyable prose, and a unique take on the genre. As other reviewers have mentioned, and I agree with their assessment, the first half of the novel is much better. It is considerably more believable than the later half, and in my opinion, more enjoyable. I did like the second half, but the story takes a slight turn away towards a traditional science-fiction arc.In comparison with the movie, which I do enjoy a great deal, the book shares similar characters and plot points with the first half of the story, but is an entirely different animal. On the author's website he speaks about the similarities and a genuine fondness for the movie, while accepting that it is a completely different interpretation.After reading this book, I can't help but see the influence in many other contemporary pieces of post-apocalyptic fiction and art. For example, in Fallout: New Vegas, there appears to be a very strong influence with \"The Legion\", their methods of raiding and killing, and even the Roman influence: Cinncinatus and the Holnists (methods of war) in The Postman; The Caesar and \"The Legion\" in Fallout.Overall, I really enjoyed the book. I would recommend it fans of science-fiction as well as those who enjoy the post-apocalyptic/collapse genre.","David Brin's The Postman tells the story of Gordon Krantz, a man who finds himself still struggling for survival some sixteen years after nuclear war has almost completely destroyed the United States. Luckily for him, Krantz had been a bright student before his school days so suddenly ended forever at the age of sixteen, and he remembered enough Shakespeare and other classic literature to be able to earn his food and shelter as a traveling entertainer as he made his way westward from Minnesota.But Krantz knew that his survival always depended on his ability to avoid bands of murdering bandits or sudden death at the hands of Mother Nature. One day his luck ran out. After an encounter with bandits left him with little more than the clothes on his back and in desperate need of shelter to avoid freezing to death, Krantz stumbled upon an old post office jeep, complete with the driver's remains. In order not to freeze, he clothed himself in the heavier clothing of the driver for the night and continued to wear the old uniform the next day when he left the jeep's shelter.Much to Krantz's surprise, the next group of people he encountered was joyful to be hosting a mail carrier, someone they never expected to see again after having lived through sixteen years of isolation and precarious survival. They insisted on sharing past-life memories and stories about the mailmen they remembered from childhood and Krantz did not have the heart to tell them that he was a fraud. But, fraud or not, Krantz realized that he could easily acquire food and shelter by pretending to be a postal inspector sent by the \"Reformed United States\" to set up post offices throughout the state of Oregon. He justified his lies by telling himself that he was offering hope and inspiration to people who probably needed those things for their long term survival almost as badly as they needed food and shelter.As word spread throughout the region, Krantz was soon to learn that the hope he offered created both opportunity and risk for the people who heard his story. For sixteen years those people had managed to survive, but they feared a large group of survivalist refugees from the past who intended to take what they had and make them into little more than slaves. Suddenly, with knowledge that the \"Restored United States\" would one day be there to help them, people were almost anxious to confront their vicious enemy. Only Krantz knew the truth, and he dared not steal the hope that these people embraced so desperately.The Postman offers another doomsday scenario, this one a little more hopeful than most. It illustrates how a man who believes in ideals and morality can make a critical difference if only he has the courage and near foolishness to tackle what seems like an impossible task. Krantz wanted to give up but he could not abandon the people who had embraced \"the postman.\"I suspect that many people, like me, have not read David Brin's novel because of exposure to Kevin Costner's rather lame movie of the same name. Although the movie was based on Brin's book, rest assured that that is where the resemblance begins and ends.","Unlike the movie, this book is not only better than the movie, but it doesn't have Kevin Kostner in it ;)I really liked this book, but then again I have always been a sucker for EOW stories (end of world). If you liked Lucifer's hammer then you will like this book. If you liked Lucifer's Hammer or this book, then you may also want to check out Earth the New Frontier by Adam Celaya (a brand new post-apocalyptic novel that rocks the house!!)If you like EOW books, then get this one. You will not be dissapointed!","The postman never believed he was one until he stood back and saw the effects of his lie. He was a wanderer, a man with no plan that had survived an unthinkable war ending the United States. His calling came on accident and then a lie, but it gave hope to all he spoke with and all those people spoke with. He accidentally started a fight to bring back the United States. This story is truly amazing and makes the book a must read, though it isn't written all that well and is not considered David Brin's best writing. The idea will keep the reader intrigued and is a must read for anyone that likes an adventure incorporating love and hope.","What I find so amazing about this book is how well it relates to current times. one of the main themes in the book is holding together and standing up for our country as well loving our neighbors and sacrificing for things much bigger than any of us. especially after september 11 United States Citizens must pull something from the ashes, must try to right what has been wronged, must hold together for country and the the things we stand for, this is what this book embodies. I strongly encourage everyone and anyone to read this book; it is an experience that will never be forgotten.","Some years ago there was a movie titled &#8220;The Postman&#8221; with Kevin Costner that was loosely based on this novel by science fiction writer David Brin.There is nothing science fiction about The Postman. It&#8217;s a post-apocalyptic story that plays in Oregon.The book was first copyrighted in 1985 and Brin, being a science fiction writer, created an all-out nuclear war that took place in the early 1990-ies and that brought down civilization worldwide.I like to read science fiction written about a time way in the future from the writer&#8217;s present perspective, which also happens to be the present time for me. To do that, you have to not read a new book for 25 or more years.This story takes place in the 2010 to 2012 timeframe, referencing the war that took place 16 years before the start of the story.The immediate aftermath of the war caused a three-year-winter and lawlessness. Massive extinction took crops, animals and people. In the U.S., the government collapsed, and civilization was reduced to marauding bands of violent survivalists and homesteaders who sometimes banded together for mutual support and protection in small communities.Gordon Krantz, the protagonist, is a lone survivor who wandered from St. Paul all the way to eastern Oregon over a period of 16 years, keeping a journal of his travels, surviving somehow off the scraps left by a looted civilization. When the story begins he is robbed of all his possessions by bandits that outnumbered and outgunned him. Faced with imminent death from freezing and starvation in winter in the mountains in eastern Oregon, he must get creative quickly.When he stumbles upon a corpse of a former postman in a Post Office Jeep, he takes the uniform for warmth and the bag as a container &#8211; and then he has an idea that changes his life and that of all the people he encounters.Like in most apocalypse stories, there must be some evil besides just the natural disasters that cause impossible situations for the people. In Stephen King&#8217;s The Stand, that&#8217;s Randall Flagg, the dark lord that takes over Las Vegas and builds an evil empire. In The Postman, the evil people are, ironically, the remaining militant survivalists who concentrated in the Pacific Northwest before the war, digging bunkers, hoarding supplies and ammunition, training in hunting and warfare, with the sole objective to survive in the case of a holocaust. As it turns out, the survivalists, due to competition with each other, pretty much kill each other off, but in the end, after things settle down, they have coalesced into an empire of abuse, slavery, and exploitation &#8211; feudalism in the American mainland. And they go to war against the villages and settlements who try to survive against all odds and build a new civilization.Gordon, unwittingly and not really a hero, through the circumstances he creates for himself, becomes key to the solution of this conflict.The Postman is a captivating read, stronger in the first two-thirds of the book which deals with his discoveries. Things get complicated in the end, and the climax is somewhat quick with a deus-ex-machina-flavored solution in the end.Overall, The Postman is a good, credible and entertaining story of a post-apocalyptic America.","This book reminded me about what I loved about sci-fi when I was a kid. And the location was spot on, speaking as an Oregonian","Having seen (and liked) the movie, I was really pleased with the book. I have read and enjoyed many of the books from David Brin. He is a very talented writer and his character development is terrific. I guess I was amazed at the extent of the detail and intricate plot development offered in this work. In retrospect, It made the movie seem very one-dimensional...","The book is nothing like the movie! It allows your imagination much more latitude to fill in and imagine what you might do in this guys situation and how others totally out of his control affect his circumstances. It was a good read!","I loved this product very much. It makes a very good gift to anyone. would highly recom mend it to everyone.","This is a good read. I watched the movie a long time ago when I was in high school. Back then I had no clue this was a book. I am really into these kinds of stories and it was great. Read it!","after watching the movie and loving it I felt the book would be very entertaining,but for some reason this time the movie outdid the book,while it was a fair read,it was not a book that I read cover to cover or hated to put down,I give this book a three on the scale of five,watch the movie and you decide.","Worth reading for the apocalypse fan, but not a life altering book. The good news is that the story had enough differences from the movie that a reader will be surprised here and there with the happenings.","I bought this book based on how well I liked the movie. I disappointed to find the book was a very little like the movie.One of the few times the movie was better then the book,at least for me.Now having put that behind me,the book was interesting in it's own right.Gordon finds a Postman's uniform and in his desperate struggle to stay a live, he puts it on and the story begins. The clothes give the people Gordon meets in his travels hope that the old days are not gone forever.In this hope Gordon finds the man with in himself that he has all ways wanted to be. Not bad,but not great either.The price point could be better considering how long ago it was published.","Those looking for a novelized version of the infamous Costner vehicle may be surprised/disappointed by its source material. The short novella bears little resemblance to the film other than its title and post-apocalyptic setting. That being said, readers who enjoy day dreaming about the world sans-civilization could do worse than this simple little story with its non-threatening prose and stock characters. Always remember, there is no shame in putting down Faulkner and wasting an afternoon with a little harmless trash....G.R.R. Martin can attest.","I read this when I was in high school and although I understood it, I didn't really take this story to heart. Two questions were finally answered: Could I have survived like Gordon Kranz did? and What would life be like without life's simple pleasures...? David Brin brings to life a normal Minnesota man who struggles with the way things are now versus how they were before the war and the winter. Gordon gets lucky and makes a lie become a truth when he takes on the persona of the Postman and reconnects several Oregon towns while keeping just a step ahead of Holnist survivalists. Brin also ties in the dependency on technology for the survival of a community...Cyclops, as well as the government's military experiments (not in the movie). In the end, because of a simple pleasure, something that we take so much for granted...the mail...a nation is restored. I loved the book, winced at the movie version (although it does turn out quite nicely), and wished that other writers could capture, as Brin does, the very nature of the post-haulocaustic U.S. Read it, understand it, and think... Could I have survived like Gordon did or would I have listened to those &quot;little&quot; voices that told me to quit?","In this book Brin tries to make a point of women needing to understand technology better and to participate in political disscussion. A very valid point. Too bad almost nothing in the story conveys this moral. This is like watching MadMax and then at the end of the movie the moral is &quot;Be Kind to your Elders&quot;. Doesn't make alot of sense. Despite this I thought the book was pretty entertaining. It's just that when an author wants to show us an important point or moral, the moral should be the cornerstone of the story and the focus about which the characters revolve, rather than something thrown in at the end. To do otherwise is an injustice to the moral, and make the moral seem unimportant.","I've read this book many times. It's one of the most inspiring works I've ever encountered. I'm actually avoiding seeing the movie because I'm afraid the story has been changed (a'la Dune) to suit Hollywood. If that's the case, I just hope David Brin got a LOT of money for the rights. (Keep up the good work in print, David.)","I found the book a quick and easy read. The story premise is an interesting one, and in light of the current militia and survivalist movements, it does make one think. But the book seems to run out of gas 3/4 of the way, and although the isolationist tone of the story is the focus, in the end, you wonder, &quot;Yeah, but what happens to the rest of the country?&quot; I can only surmise that in the end, Kevin Costner gets a hold of the postman's badge and the whole thing turns into an utter disaster...","I read The Postman several years ago and enjoyed it thoroughly. The casual references to the end of the world were much appreciated after reading books like lucifers hammer which intricatly describe the end. Brin does it fabulosly! I am sad after seeing the Movie version which leaves out so many interesting things like the College at Corvallis which would have made for an even more hope filled movie. Also, whose idea was it to change the Holnist leader from General Macklin to General Bethlehem. Otherwise, David Brin rocks!!!","Brin makes a case for being top dog in the genre. I've gotta say it...read down a few reviews...the guy from Houston completely misses the point. Go back and read it again...and again.","I found the story interesting. I did not miss the usual gory boring details of the holocast which preceeded the story line. I didn't agree with other reviews written here, you have to remember that this is fiction writen for entertainment. If you sought a moral then I would conclude you could find it here in the people's Hope the postman exploited and which finally they used on him.","one thing many people forget when reading this book is the time it is set in. not only after a cataclysmic war, but when the war happened. the reaction of the townspeoplle are very realistic when you actually apply them to small town america ten or so years ago. this book is a must read, and from what i have seen the movie adaptation will be very good.","In facing the plausable unknown of whole-earth catastrophe, Brin has unveiled simple innate needs of humankind. Maybe too simplistic, but excess detail would only spoil the view.","Rarely are we granted the privelage of reading a book that personifies so much of what we love about the world around us. The Postman, as a story, succeeds where others have failed in that it seizes upon the fundemental ideals that makes us smile when we behold the red, white and blue of &quot;Old Glory.&quot; The ideals of liberty, justice, honor and innocence are held up for us to recognize clearly for what they are in its pages. For reasons that are never clear, we seem to forget and loose the spirit of what is granted to us all by being simply born in America. For all the griping about political graft, scandals and taxes, it is not until times of adversity when the precious jewells of everyday life, such as receiving a simple letter, or sleeping in a warm house, are denied us that we see the truth. That we are enjoying a golden age of freedom and liberty that is rare even in the world today. They say that amputees often reach to scratch at limbs which have been dust for years. When we are healthy and hale we rarely notice the ease with which we move until a limb is lost or broken. Gordon Krantz experienced this same sense of removal and yearning and unconciously attempted to bring some semblence of that lost dream back to life in the lie that was the Restored United States.Although the analogies speak for themselves, I feel that we should all stop, take stock of what we see around us now, and search for some way that we may stregthen our ideals and limbs.The United States isn't a country, a person, or even a flag, it is everyone of us that believes in a just society of freedoms and fairness of an age of optimism and hope. As an American I am proud of the spirit that has manifested itself in the pages of this book. Regardless of what age, color, creed or religion you follow, we all share a commonality unbroken by geographic or idealogical boundaries, we are citizens of the land of the free and the home of the brave.","I read this book a few years ago and to this day it's one of my favorite's of all time. The movie was forgettable, so I hope that doesn't give you a bad impression, because this book takes an old subject but refreshes it in a wonderful way. A very moving story that you won't be able to put down.","This was the first book I've read of David Brin and I was not in the least bit disappointed. The Postman was realistic and the Characters were done great. I found myself feeling for the characters and Mr. Brin paints a post-WWIII America so well that it felt like I was there. This book comes off greatly. Also I plan on reading more of Mr. Brin's books.","This was a pretty entertaining book. A movie based on it came out around Christmas, but I've had this book for years and decided to read it before seeing the movie. It's about a post-apocolyptic America and centers around a protagonist who was in college when World War III broke out. Though things got a bid cheasy toward the end (I won't say how), it was nonetheless a very entertaining read. The story tracks this reluctant hero's treck through Oregon in a bleak landscape of fudile villages and city rubble. His chance finding of a dead postman changes him and is the catalyst behind much of what happens throughout the novel. By the way, the movie, which is now the butt of jokes on Leno almost every night, deserves the jokes - it is a insufferably long, slow movie, terribly acted, with painfully contrived sentimental moments. It's too bad that the book now has this associated with it...","I read all things by David Brin and have yet to be disapointed. With The Postman I started reading it, then passed it around my dorm. The book became quite a sensation (and this is in 1996). As for the movie, well, we all know that the book is usually better, but by no means should anyone be discouraged. I know many people who would kill to see a work like Startide Rising make it to film. No matter, David Brin is truly THE author for the 1990's...and beyond.","The Postman is great. People think it is an unrealistic plot, but I think it is ultra-realistic. Brin has a way of describing people and creating truth-to-life character that react to events how you and I would. A reversion to feudalism is a likely event after such a war, but people would remember democracy. I think that everyone should read The Postman, especially if they have been disillusioned by the movie.","Superb. A compelling story about hope. I read it all in one day - couldn't put it down","Brin creates this universe of the Postman in such a unique viewpoint. I've never seen such an environment described in such believable terms before. I've read it 4 times now, and I hope to again have the time to read it. It gets better and better each time you read it - and it changes the way you feel about life in the process.The best way I can describe it is that every time you read it - you can notice a new aspect of the ongoing story with each reading.David Brin is writing genius with books like Earth, Startide Rising, and with the Postman. I hope he continues to bring us to where no other science fiction author dares to take us..","I loved this book I couldn't put it down. I recommend this to all science fiction readers. I can't wait for the movie","This is early Brin, but one of his best. After a nuclear war, what survives of civilization?What gives hope to the people of America? Answer: The U.S. Postal Service, or is it one man's effort to make sense of a world in chaos.A movie version is currently being filmed starring Kevin Costner.I highly recommend this book.","Brin's best","The Postman is an action-filled novel about post-apocalyptic America. Death, despair, and darkness reign as Gordon Krantz finds and wears a postman's jacket, turning his life from the path of mere survival to one that breathes new life into the people he meets. While The Postman seems to be merely a sci-fi adventure story, I find myself constantly re-evaluating life in light of Gordon's circumstances. In the novel, the United States government has been dissolved, leaving people to fight against the cult-like Holnist survivalists, created by Nathan Holn to wreak havoc, destroy towns, and enslave the people. Gordon is constantly in a fight with chaos and with the Holnists who will kill him for the trophy-death. In this war we discover Gordon's humble strength: he gives people a reason to live. I recommend this novel because of its combination of suspense, action, and philosophical morals. David Brin captures the feelings of helplessness and hopelessness that people in our reality feel daily, and through Gordon allows us to dream and hope once again. He uses the classic science fiction device of physically improved humans but brings it to a higher level, that of chaos against tradition. In The Postman Brin is questioning our society and its ability to reshape itself to survive. If you want a fast-paced story with a deeper moral behind its suspenseful action-packed faade, read Brin's The Postman.","The main criteria for judging a recreational novel like THE POSTMAN is whether or not it kept the pages turning. This one did, which is why I finished it, and which is why you are getting to read this fine review. David Brin offers up a vision of life in the near future after the Doomwar and the ensuing anarchy has destroyed civilization as we know it. What remains is a healthy scattering of small communities struggling to survive the chaos.Some of the survivors are would-be tyrants; the rest of them are decent, but cowed folk who try to get along. You can guess who gets the better end of the deal. The novel follows Gordon Krantz, one of the decent, but unusually strong guys as he tries to navigate the bleak landscape. He stumbles upon a Postman's uniform, and accidentally discovers that he can trade dreams of a restored United States back East in exchange for food and lodging. The question of the novel is whether the myth Krantz is offering is enough to get the decent folks to come together and throw off the tyrants.The writing is not terrific, but the action unfolds at a good pace. We are drawn into Brin's world enough to care about how it all turns out. Along the way, Brin invites us through a meditation about the foundations of civil society. His main question is how a \"civilized\" guy can exercise violence against the tyrants, without becoming one of them. In Brin's vision, the women who live among the despots are treated despotically, and his insight is that genuine civilization depends, in some way, on the strength of women. What he lacks is any good vision of how that necessary feminine strength can be used to civilize the men, and so the end of THE POSTMAN falls flat. My guess is that Brin's failure simply reflects our own society's inability to really understand the nature of feminine strength. Still, give Brin credit for seeing that it is a question.THE POSTMAN is a fine way to while away a few hours at the beach. It might even cause you to pause and muse over a few ideas in the shower, before the whole thing washes away and you move on to your next good read.","Mr Brin is obviously a very gifted writer. I listen/read lots of modern authors, and it is a pleasure to find an author who just plain writes well!That being said, I saw the book on a different level than any of the other reviews I perused. The whole post-apocalyptic setting in my mind, was simply a background against which to analyze the heart of humankind. The post-apocalyptic world made it easy for Brin to cut through a lot of the fluff that clouds our thinking and get to real issues of life, justice, ethics, and finally idealism. Along the way he explores several social models: benevolent socialism, leader worship, feudalism, and separatism. Brin also weaves an interesting subtheme about what it means to be a man, or to be a hero.This book is way more than &quot;a good read&quot; or &quot;highly entertaining&quot; - it will make you think and examine your values. - the sign of a truly good work.","I must confess that I am not a native english speaker and I have read &quot;The Postman&quot; in russian translation, but I do hope that a translation was precise enough and my comment willbe of some value to the other readers. The first time I read this book was over three years ago and since then it became my favourite book which I reread now for the 17th time with a great pleasure. With every reading I discover more and more in it. The tru meaning of this book lies deep inside and it has to be read &quot;between the lines&quot;. Each and every of scene in this book has its own secret and has to be taken almost a philosophical peace of art and has to thought over. The film to my mind was to much &quot;on the surface&quot;. Kind of standart hollywood movie - a lot of shooting and fighting, bad guy and a good guy, and a tipical &quot;happy end&quot; stuff. It does not leave anything to think about aftervards like the book does. I was really disapointed when I found out that there are people who really did not like the book and some of them even say that the movie is better. If I may make a suggestion, I think these people who did not like it do not have to change their opinion because of this review (what is very unlikely anyway) but to try to reread the book, looking on it from the different perspective and even better few different perspectives. This might help you to find something in this book for yourself and maybe even to understand what kind of a man are you.","Some people's only exposure to this work has been through the movie of the same name starring Kevin Costner, and I've heard them call the premise such things as absurd, silly, or worse. How then, am I to reconcile this with the inherent believability and truth I found in it?Basically, the movie was doomed from the start. When considered on its own, the premise of this novel, that one man in the discarded uniform of a dead postman can change what once was a nation, seems implausible. What Brin does is take that premise and make it believable through a story and overarching world that makes myths like these natural. Its not the plot twists so much as the words of Brin that make this story believable.According to Brin, World War III was not the &quot;big one&quot; people have been expecting, instead lasting only a week or so and leaving many survivors. What killed people afterwards wasn't the nuclear or biological weapons so much as the fear and paranoia preventing the nation from reuniting again. Worst of all was the plague of &quot;survivalism&quot;, of deciding that your strength and guns allowed you to do whatever you wanted because you &quot;needed&quot; it to survive. Gradually, society begins to spiral downward into more and more isolated villages, uniting only when a common enemy such as the Holnist survivalists come along.Enter Gordon Krantz. An ex-student from St. Paul, he's been wandering west over the years in hope of finding civilization somewhere, anywhere. After being robbed, he takes the only warmth he can find, a uniform pilfered off of a dead postman. What starts out as a harmless little myth ends up spiralling out of control, as people grab onto the only remembrance they can find of the old United States. But who will take responsibility...?","This is a good modern classic Post-Apocalyptic Sci-Fi story. If you were an adult (or teenager) in the 1980s, you understand the cold war paranoia of the threat of limited nuclear warfare, the spot light in the media of the rise of survivalists & militia groups, the conspiracy theories of various advanced technology \"secret\" military projects and the beginning of personal electronics. Well welcome to the world of David Brin who wrote this book in the 1980's. These themes are seen throughout the story.This is a well written, fast paced story in which you lose track of time as you read it. In the post-apocalyptical US, one man's ideas of survival is to \"act\" as a US Mail carrier and create a myth that the US government has reestablished itself. He uses this technique to obtain his means of survival. There are many plot turns, some of which you anticipate and some that are mildly surprising. To some, this may be somewhat dated due to the 1980s cultural influences in the story line, but overall a very good read.It is a well worth the time to read it and I recommend it if you have never read post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi - this makes a good first choice for this genre.","Yes, this is the book that inspired the movie. No, they are not very alike except in the bare bones way. I never liked Costner's acting but I always liked the premise of the movie, so when I found out it was based on the book, I had to read it. The book is much more stark, more inside The Postman (Gordon Krantz)'s head, and is weighty. The torn countryside, pocket communities, survival mindset, and daily hardships are represented so much stronger within the pages than on the screen. It has some uplifting moments as well, which really touched me (ie the first time in 17 yrs that Gordon sees a light bulb on instead of a candle or oil lamp, he cries for all that is lost even though he thought himself a \"hardened survivor\"). It can get a bit monotonous with Gordon's waffling on helping himself or helping others, but overall - well worth reading.","This is going to be one I have to read every few years. A classic of life during nuclear winter. Civil society in America has died in a slow battle with post-war chaos, hypermilita groups, and famine. It's a wonderful tale of a professional liar, a traveling actor who becomes mired in his deceptions and in the process starts a legend that might lead the survivors back to civilization. The first step is the simple act of starting a postal service. There is interesting musing about feminism in this story. I found this narrative to be make the book worth it alone. Also, the book is a great travel guide through some scenic spots in post-apocalyptic Oregon.","Perhaps better known in the form of the mediocre Kevin Costner action flick, Brin's novel is actually an interesting tale of a society devolved into feudalism and redeemed by an idea. Post-war Oregon, which has been devastated by nuclear warfare, disease, and banditry, is inhabited by isolated villages preyed upon by suvivialists called \"Holnists\". Gordon Krantz is the titular character, a wandering bard who stumbles upon a Postal Service uniform and uses his acting skills to convince scattered villages that he represents the \"Restored United States of America.\" Miraculously, the con catches on, and the communities begin to coalesce, brought together by Krantz's fiction and the existence of a mysterious AI supercomputer named Cyclops.However, the struggling towns are soon threatened with invasion by an army of extremist Holnists. These men have taken the militaristic, individualist, might makes right philosophy of their leader, Nathan Holn, to an extreme. By recreating and improving upon societies like feudal Japan or medieval Europe, the Holnists want to banish the constitutionalism of the Founding Fathers, which they feel perverts nature by protecting the weak at the expense of the strong.Brin blends the grim barbarism of his world with the idea that people, even in the darkest of times, will hold onto even a glimmer of hope. The gritty realism is hampered somewhat by the inclusion of the Augment subplot, but other \"science-fictiony\" elements are seamlessly fitted into the world. Overall, the book's criticisms of survivalist thought may be rather unnecessary with the threat of nuclear war no longer in the public mindset, but it is an entertaining read nonetheless.","I have not seen the film version with Kevin Costner, but that's where I'd first heard of the story. A friend lent me the paperback, and it was interesting and a good, quick read.Gordon Krantz walks through a post-apocalyptic world, trading stories for what he needs, a nation torn apart by war and now divided. His finding of a Postal Service vehicle and its dead driver is his turning point as he moves through the Restored USA, though its restoration is far from done.Brin's attention to character development and detail is excellent--Krantz and the people he meets and comes into conflict with are compelling, and you just can't stop reading to see how it all goes.The back cover talks a little about how this can be compared to \"Alas, Babylon.\" I don't know about that; I agree the style is a bit alike and it takes place largely in a similar situation, but Brin doesn't steal from that.With the world as it is, this could be a cautionary tale. What happens when your universe collapses, and you realize what kind of real trouble you can be in, it makes one think. For me, that's the mark of a fine book!","All too often, when friends discover I enjoy science fiction, there is the qustion of why. I point to The Postman as an example of what a gifted writer can do with the genre. If you heard that this is a tale of post-apocalyptic America, your first thought would be Road Warrior and you could not be more wrong. Its simple plot gives way to complex themes. Mr. Brin examines the relations that keep society together, the relations between men and women and the need for one man to be a part of something lager. In the end, it is hope, fragile as it is, that binds us together. If you do not like science fiction, if you do but are longing for something with a little depth, please read this book.","Brin's novel of a postwar America, and a man who becomes a symbol of hope to a group of Oregon survivors, is a compelling, thoughtful tale. UNTIl, in its last third it becomes a macho, mano a mano action tale. I LOVED the first two-thrids, but was disappointed by the ending. Still worth a look for the engrossing first two-thrids. I'll bet the film will be nowhere near as well-done.","Read _The Postman_ when you're fed up with society. This book made me proud to live in this tragic and wonderful era of history.&quot;I am a member of a civilization&quot;- that simple phrase, never stated in the book, will echo in your head and ring true inside your ears after you finish. This is likely to stay my favourite book of all time- it's the only one I've EVER given a ten so far. Instead of going to the lousy looking movie, I think I'll just stay home and re-read the book. I may just buy a second copy soon.","Amazing. This book is about the depths of despair and the heights of the spirit. It is about how people, no matter how battered, will fight to carry light into the darkness. It is about how a few desperate lies can become the most astonishing, dangerous and beautiful truths. And somewhere in the real meat of the story, it also becomes a book about women; their power, their failings and their responsibility. David Brin has done an astounding job of presenting the reader with a very tragic, terrifying and yet believable account of post-apocalyptic America and the very flawed but very human men and women who fight to keep a dream alive. I can't believe I have not heard of this author before! His writing is beautiful, the story is human, humane, poignant and powerful. No matter what your opinion of the movie was, this book cannot be passed up.","How can anyone say the movie was better? Wow. This book is so engrossing as the story moves along, it's impossible to put down. Someone needs to remake this book as a movie: a movie that follows the book and not someone else's intentions.","One of the best books I've read all year. Brin's story flows with a grace and power little seen these days. His skillfull use of plot device and interludes ties the story together and reveals it's depth. This isn't just the story of a few minor skirmishs in hope-starved Oregon, this is the story of the history, present and future of the world. Brin conveys great personality and belivability in each and everyone of his characters. It will chalenge your way of looking at the world and at history. Highly recomended!","There's a piece of advice passed among fiction writers: &quot;Show, don't tell.&quot;A post-apocalyptic United States is a wonderful setting for exploring the myriad possible deteriorations of human, specifically American, society. A wandering minstrel, who conjures up for awed and wistful audiences the images and profound emotion of Shakespeare's great plays and some of the founding fathers' great speeches, seems to be a rich character for exposing the prejudices, fears, naivete, and nostalgia of the human character suffering under survival stress and attempting to make sense of a lost civilization.Unfortunately, Brin tells far more than he shows.Gordon, as he travels what's left of the American West in an attempt to find what he recognizes as hope and civilization, baldly and often sentimentally interprets the scene for us. His dialog, internal and external, tends toward the mundane, the obvious.The people he meets on his journey are, on the whole, predictable and uninteresting, caricatures of what could have been complex people with complex motives. The dialog given them is painfully trite.Why is this the case? Why does Brin, who is capable of subtlety and indirection in his revelation of character, succumb to pulp technique?One major problem with The Postman is that it is nigh on impossible to believe that the average American has such warm and fuzzy feelings for the &quot;postman&quot;. How many young readers of this book have seen a postal service worker bringing round letters and packages? If the young reader lives in an apartment complex or attends school, s/he probably hasn't. If the not-so-young reader is a working adult, s/he probably hasn't seen such since childhood. The person most capable of feeling such devotion to a postman is someone who has seen the original postal network formed in the United States and appreciates the fact that the postal service was functioning long before the telephone. Brin is gambling on the reader's confusing a &quot;service&quot; with an individual -- the postman -- and uses the emotional pull of the individual, who in many cases is rarely seen, to make a connection between Gordon's self-proclaimed role and the various townspeople he meets. The reader is left watching the story from afar, with no real emotional stake in it.And because the idea is so hard to swallow, Brin seems to feel it necessary to tell us what is going on in the book, not to allow the skillful writing that he is capable of draw us in and compell us, like the various townspeople (who should have been equally hard to sell), to believe in a truly far-fetched ideal of faithfulness, trust, and hope. Gordon wanders through the book with his heart on his sleeve, in conflict with his desires and conscience only in passing moments, and the people he meets try very hard to pass themselves off as exactly who they are -- there is no sense of discovery for the reader, who has everything laid out before him. It's as if Brin succumbed to the well-loved idea that if one says something often enough, it will be true; his intent appears to be to force us to accept what he has on offer not because it is compelling, but because he keeps saying it.A fundamental aspect of this connection between villages and towns -- that communication means power -- is never adequately addressed. It is ironic that Gordon uses the power of memory and sentimentality surrounding his &quot;position&quot;, essentially the power of the press, to establish and maintain his persona, but that no one appears in the book to truly exploit that newly-recovered capacity for propaganda and influence.Perhaps in his next novel Brin will trust himself, and his readers, more than he did in this one.","From the opening pages alone, you can tell that this book is going to be something special. It tells the epic tale(although the book is not epic-sized) of a post-apocalyptic drifter by the name of Gordon Krantz. In the unforgettable opening scene, Gordon is set upon by a roving pack of bandits, who take all his valuable possesions, including his tent. While attempting to head them off and get his belongings back, Gordon becomes lost and darkness falls. While wandering in the certain-death circumstances of freezing temperatures and rain, Gordon finds an abandoned postal jeep. In it he finds hope for a new beginning. Thus starts an incredible novel. David Brin has done an extraordinarily great job of making the settings and characters of Gordon's world believable to a person in our day and age. College campuses, shopping districts, and decaying highways all come alive in Gordon's words. I have read this book many times and each time I re-read it I pick up something new which seems to further spark my imagination. Unlike the other &quot;disaster&quot; novels, this one has a fair abundance of people and towns. But these people have lost hope in the world and although they are perhaps ten miles away from other towns, there is no contact between these isolated hamlets. This book really drew me in and made me seem a part of it's world. I love the way that it makes each setting and backdrop seem real and accessible to our modern day minds. Trust me, The Postman is one book that will stay on your shelf long after it is completed.","For anyone who has seen the film, \"The Postman,\" read the book. It's a great read even if you haven't seen the movie, but to realize how much someone can screw up a book in making a movie out of it, this is a classic example. The Postman (movie) has practically zilch in common with the book - continuity, location, characters, storyline. Wow. Set largely in western Oregon, Brin's novel starts slow but builds to a great crescendo at the very end. Wish Costner had had more faith in following Brin's storyline. It would have made a great movie.","Despite the melodramatic moments and the somewhat hurried ending of the hero's love interest, I really liked this book. A great story about being a man and fighting for the common good.","This was an interesting novel with a little bit of everything. It built on several post-apocalyptic novels I'd read, taking small functional towns from \"Alas, Babylon\" and the envoy wandering hippy from \"Lucifer's Hammer\" and the heroes of \"Patriots: Surviving the Coming Collapse\" somehow became the arch enemy villains of \"The Postman\". (This is particularly interesting because \"Patriots\" was written twenty years after \"The Postman\".)One of the things I liked about this book was that it started 13 years AFTER the apocalypse. When I read these stories I don't really much care how TSHTF, I just want to know what to do next. This chopped off a hundred some pages by just skipping to the interesting parts. Of course, that leaves it with no comments about emergency preparedness, other than some vague ideas that it might be a good idea to learn to use a bow and wear a fanny pack at all times.I know they made a Kevin Costner film out of it, but I haven't seen it. I suspect they kept all the violent parts of the book (lots of bad guys ranging from casual everyday unorganized chaotic evil to Government-Augmented Lawful Evil) and left out the good parts of the book (small dignities making ever-widening circles of larger dignities.)The hero of this book is at his heart a lover, not a fighter, and it was sort of nice to see how arts and intellectual pursuits could re-emerge. Basically, this was a fantasy written from the opposite point of view of \"Patriots\" where everyone left alive gets together to sing Kumbaya at the end of the day. These dystopian novels tend to say a lot about the author's personality as they form their own version of utopia against the backdrop.It was a quick read with some interesting points about how Big Ideas have a role in rebuilding. I would call this a 3.5 star book if I could.","The Postman is part of the end of world genre that I've always enjoyed. 16 years after a cataclysmic event a loner and wanderer stumbles upon a US Postal workers gear and invents a story in which to survive. He claims he is a representative of the restored United States of America and that the east coast will send reinforcements and supplies out west. He of course knows this is not true, but this fantasy brings hope to many people.This independent personality that invented the farce begins to believe his own fiction and suddenly goes from recluse to leader. The story quickly slips into a clich&eacute;d comic book type ending of good and evil. I found the premise interesting but the actions of the individual characters, especially the protagonist's transformation to be far-fetched.","How is this book multi-faceted? Even a grade school student could see that this book has many themes in its presentation. It carries with it three main struggles for Gordon:1) man vs. man: Gordon wanders America while trying simply to survive and to be just. Others are hyper-survivalists and injust. There's the classic good vs. evil.2) man vs. nature: Gordon walks across America, and the only way to the west coast is through the American terrain - thorns, radiation and twigs present day-to-day battles.3) man vs. himself: can Gordon continue to live a lie, suppress a lie and maintain hope for the greater good of mankind?In itself, the book is simple yet thoughtful... elegant yet honest... beautiful yet reality-based. All things fall into place when the story unfolds and the reader is drawn into post-apocalyptic America.","So, that's what the movie was supposed to be like. I wish it had lived up to the book. Post-apocalyptic America in a vision more real, gritty, and troublesome than anything dreamt up by Stephen King. Good Book.If the movie had tried to be half of what the book was, it'd have been a classic. Why is it that Costner stars in these duds made from great material? Are they just hiring the wrong screenwriters?","This is post nuclear war story writing the way it should be done. If we stuck solely with Mad Max we would realy be in trouble. If you enjoy a really good read this is for you even if you are one of those who generally doesn't read science fiction. This one is one of the best entries you will ever find. And if you haven't seen the movie with Kevin Costner yet do so. In some ways it is even better than the book is if that is ever possible with Hollywood. The script is very well written and the acting is superb.","David Brin's The Postman uses the post-holocaust type of novel to send several relevant messages among them: the importance to take social responsibility, the urgent need of hope and the value of things that we usually take for granted.Brin's novel might not be brilliantly written, and it certainly doesn't have any kind of epic scope. Indeed its scope is quite locally limited and the writing is simple and straight-forward. Nevertheless, the brilliant idea of a made-up Postman bringing new light into a broken country and the weight of the messages that are delivered makes this book a fine read to be recommended.","I read The Postman long before that horrible movie came out. Women who have not read the book will be pleased to know that there is more than one female character in the book. The choice of Costner, et. al. to make one character that is an amalgamation of the three central female characters is deplorable, at best.After watching the movie, I had to reread the book, just to make sure I wasn't hallucinating A LOT of actions in the book that never made it to the screen.Don't let the &quot;film&quot; sour you on reading this fantastic work.","I read the book long before I saw the movie, which is why I was somewhat dissapointed. This is not to say that Mr. Costner did a bad job of directing, or acting. In fact a lot of his mannerisms were close to how I pictured Gordons to be. However I think that a closer screen play could have been better. For instance some little things where left out, like his obsession with clean teeth. That would have been definitely more realistic. Also , and I realize this goes against every movie law, but there was entirely to much gut fire. It was pointed out a number of times that this was a resourse that was scarce, and everyone knew it. Lastly the thing that annoyed me the most was the movie character Ford-Lincoln-Mercury!!!! The guy had a real name, does anyone know it? I'll let you read the book to find out.","This book takes place in the future after a nuclear war. Times revert back to the dark ages and peoples hopes are crushed. Terrorist know as 'holnist' cause pain and suffering for everyone in the western states. The a lone traveler comes along in a old postman's outfit. Along with this he brings leadership and hope for the people to rise up against the holnist and fight them off. This is a great book!","I first read this book years ago, probably when it was first printed, and I found it to be a very powerful story of one man's fight against oppression. Granted, we've all heard that before but then what plot hasn't been heard before. There's just something about America that brings us all together when some dictator wannabe comes along to take away our freedom(s) and that's what this book is all about.","Of all the ways in which you might die after a nuclear holocaust,I had not considered the possiblity that something as mundane as periodontal disease might get you in the end. This is a truly insightful, thought provoking book.","I know that many people have panned the movie based on this book, but frankly of the two, the characters in the movie are much better drawn and developed than the book. The movie has its slow moments but the book was more than slow, it frankly just stalled and I had to force myself to finish it. In the end I did not much care about what happend to the characters. The movie is very under rated and is a nice jewel about \"hope\" over coming cynicism. Since we live in a country full of cynical critics that is probably the main reason the movie was panned. I would not recommend the book but would recommend the movie.","Just another post-apocalypse view of the future, and not a very good one at that. I saw the movie and it was even worse. I couldn't believe they made a movie of one of his poorer works. I wish someone would make a movie of this Startide Rising/Uplift War series.","I read this book a couple of years ago and just decided to write this after I saw a commercial for the film version. This book was nothing more than just &quot;OK&quot;. Brin was able to hold my interest long enough for me to finish it and that's it. Not totally boring, but definitely not worth a second read. Here's the story in a nutshell: Gordon Krantz survives the Doomwar and after a particularly close encounter with death dedicates his life to attempting to restore America to its former greatness by lying to everyone he meets. His lies cause the deaths of nearly every really strong character in the book. Yet this deceiver has the nerve to whine on and on about &quot;who will take responsibility?&quot; as though he is the only person left on the blasted planet who is trying to do more than just survive. What conceit! Don't buy it, go to the library and check it out.","Well just finished this book and i loved it. The book i read previous to this was \"World War Z\", So the \"Postman\" was up against some pretty stiff post apocalypse territory here! Well i wasnt disapointed, the story, the characters and the plot all mesh really well.The main character was real, not an ex special forces hero ready to take on the world,thank god im sick of those characters!i really felt for the main player in the book and his plight in trying to stay alive in a world without rule or law, his plan worked a treat and the authour had me in for the ride!My only real complaint was \"spoiler ahead\" the unnecessary inclusion of super enhanced gnome experiment human bad guys and \"hero\" at the last quarter of the book,it was ok , it just wasnt really needed.Why he felt he needed to do this confused me, it didnt need this inclusion, maby the author felt he needed a science fiction type addition, or maby the book has dated a little in regard to dna enhancement, well it isnt going to disappoint the other 98% of a really really great post op book!","My review comes late, since I just now read the book. So I won't give an outline of the whole story, only my reaction to certain elements. Some people liked the first half, but I almost put the book aside after the opening pages.The story starts with action, but our first glimpse of Gordon, the protagonist, is as a coward or a weakling. He let 5 bandits who robbed him run off without firing a shot, though he still had a loaded .38 revolver. He also had a clear shot at the ringleader, but he lets them take off with his survival gear after vainly appealing to their \"good natures\" to leave him some basic items. They left him to die in the cold with no real resistance from him. Somehow this doesn't ring true, since Gordon had the grit to survive 17 years of wandering after the Collapse, and he surely must have encountered other bandits and bloody macho types.A short while later, with an injured foot and weakened by hunger, and not knowing where his next meal might come from, he digs a grave for a nameless skeleton, thus jeopardizing his own survival chances. Again, this is not really credible. The skeleton is all that remains of a mailman he found in a long-abandoned postal vehicle.He dons the postman's jacket to keep out the cold, and later concocts a fanciful tale about being a postman for a \"Restored United States.\" This ruse does gain him some free meals; in one town it even gets him ten nights in the sack with a comely young wife whose husband can't give her a child.He does show some intestinal fortitude when he attempts to rescue a pretty young woman from a brutal captor who wants to rape her, but he pretty well flubs it, resulting in her death, although he does save her now-orphaned young son.It's kind of hard to respect this bozo, an opportunist who's plagued by ineptness and tender scruples at all the wrong times. He does manage, however, to become an accomplished liar, although he consoles himself that he's doing a service for those he dupes.I didn't feel it got worse throughout the story, though there were still many incidents that were unexplained or not really credible, particularly the ending with two different \"Augments\" fighting each other to the death. That was rather fanciful and brought to mind two \"Terminators\" battling each other. I also felt the view was rather parochial in that it's all happening in a limited locale on the West Coast, mostly Oregon. And I felt let down by the rather blah ending.So, why give it 3 stars? It's not terribly bad, and the author does know how to build sentences. He gives us a glimpse of how things might be, given the circumstances, even though he often tries our willingness to believe. And once I reconciled myself to Gordon's non-heroic character, Brin did keep the story moving along. I don't feel the book was a total waste of time, and some parts are better than others. For anyone interested in post-Collapse stories, this certainly isn't the worst, and I could recommend it in that spirit.","The depiction of events in David Brin's The Postman is well-observed, provides great texture, and yet is minimal. Gordon Krantz is studied with care, his inner thoughts communicated very well, yet most importantly his temperament is established through various trials he handles or mishandles. Other characters are touched on, some remaining highly memorable.","If you saw this movie and think the book would be just as pathetic, dont even think about it. Brin writes an interesting story of life after a revolution, a nuclear war and the destruction of our American Culture and the travels through Oregon of Gordon, the man who would become the postman. It is a very good book to read and I do recommend it even if 'end of the world apocalyptic' novels aren't your style, youll find this a good book to finish.","I won't review the plot and I won't say how bad the movie was (although its dreariness was predictable); it's been said before.David Brin, by his own account, writes straightforward stories for his books, and tends to be more mythic in his short stories. The Postman is the exception. It began as a short story which Brin later expanded into a novel, expanding the mythic element as well.I enjoyed the book as a story but what really drew me to it was the political philosophy. What makes one country different from another? What makes a story suitable as the basis of a national character? How did the US acquire its essential nature? How do we teach our children -- and our military -- the difference between service-out-of-duty and service-for-power? By having his hero unintentionally recreate a nation, Brin brings these questions to the fore. We get to look at them, and think about how they apply to our nation's founding. The hero talks about Ben Franklin (good buy) vs. Aaron Burr (bad guy); the Roman legend of Cincinnatus and why he refused the crown; that with freedom comes duty. These are things worth thinking about.Or you can read the book as a simple SF novel. That, I think, would be missing what makes the book truly special, and why many of the reviewers were disappointed.","David Brin did a good job writing this book. Years later it is still a good read. He gets off track sometimes and that can be annoying. But generally he drives the plot fairly consistently.The book is drastically different from the movie. And it is possible the movie could have been better if it had stayed with the original plot. But both are good in their own way.","Its probably my own fault that I didnt like this book. I chose to read it based on my thorough enjoyment of the movie with the same title. I mean, I LOVED the movie. The movie was an inspiring story of accidental hope. A man assumes the guise of a postman in an attempt just to survive and in doing so he inspires everyone he meets to become active participants in changing their collective destinies.David Brin's book certainly illudes to spread of hope, but really its a story about Gordon Krantz's deception and desperation. The biggest game changer for hope seems to be Cyclops and that is all a scam. Gordon is really the only character that I feel like I got to know in the book and I didnt really like him. This is survivalist fiction, and yes- characters in this genre are often selfish and self-focused. The world as we know it ended, its consistant for them to only be concerned with their immediate survival.The story line was well constructed. The plot never dragged, unnecessary tangents werent explored. Overall- its well written. As far as books go- not an awful read. Lots of food for thought even though it is fiction. Just dont read it with the movie in mind. They are completely different stories and you will be disappointed.","To Brin's credit: this book moves along quickly, follows a nice formula, and goes roughly where you expect it to go with just enough twists to keep it engaging along the way.That said, this is also an exemplar of a very average novel about a \"post-apocalyptic America\". It makes me want to see the film with Costner. Just to compare.Also: Brin's attempt at being sympathetic to a woman's plight in this post-apocalyptic scenario? Fell way short. Trust me bro, these broads would be way tougher than you've painted them here. Even with a bunch of survivalist ex-soldiers with rampant genes and hormones.","The novel concerns a wanderer some years after an apocalyptic series of disasters results in the disintegration of the United States. He comes across a dead postman and his letters, and he takes the uniform and letters. People afterwards mistake him for a real postman, and he uses the misunderstanding to his advantage. He eventually establishes postal routes between several towns and sparks hope in the people for the future.That premise is a somewhat interesting one, and it drives the first third of the book. After that, though, the book is not interesting. The protagonist finds a series of villages who owe fealty to a computer named Cyclops. He soon discovers that the computer does not function and that it is a lie just as his own postman hoax is.Even worse is the feminist motif of the last third of the book. The protagonist meets a headstrong woman who thinks the country's women are to blame for the apocalypse because they could have reined in their men. When the Cyclops villages are threatened by hostile forces, this woman organizes a band of women to infiltrate the invaders as seductresses who will, on an appointed day, kill as many of them as possible.The book ends musing about the flaws of man and the virtues of woman. No mention is made of the subtlety that men have the capacity for brutality only because women favor strong and aggressive men.All in all, the book seems to lose the post-apocalyptic feel, it loses the interesting postman ruse, and finds itself in some totally lame feminist screed. The worst part of the book is the climax in which two augmented soldiers fight one another to the death in hand-to-hand combat.Another annoying aspect of the book is the protagonist's constant soul-searching. It occupies the first pages and does not relent.","I love this book, and was one of the books I remember reading until 4 in the morning just because I couldn't put it down. Then came the film, which I actually picketed at our local cinema, I couldn't in all good faith allow anyone who had read the book to see the film. David Brin kindly shared some of his thoughts with me on the matter via the power of e-mail and whilst he was generous in crediting Mr Costner with trying to stick to the spirit of the book, this is definitely a case of \"if it aint broke, don't fix it\". Ok, this would make a better mini-series than a film, but there you go. Anyway, where was I? Ok, itinerant story teller adopts identity of long dead postman, builds new hopes, defeats survivalist army, sets off to California to reform the Beach Boys (it is unclear whether Tom Petty assists him in this endeavour) etc etc. I have begged and cajoled Mr Brin for a Postman 2 (Postman 2 - Not known at this address\") in which a furious Oregon populace get all annoyed for having wasted all their time doing stuff in the name of The Restored United States only to find it doesn't exist, well, you would be a trifle cheesed off wouldn't you? Anyway, book good film bad, and by the look of the economic and energy situation as I write this (October 2008), you will all soon be able to recreate Gordon Krantzs' adventures for yourselves! So in summary, visit the apocalypse before it visits you. I bid you farewell","The only time I can honestly say I enjoyed the movie better than the book. I suppose my biggest gripe is style...the author comes off almost pretentious at times. Plus the thought of \"neo-hippies\" as some kind of scientist/artist/wood elf kind of makes my stomach turn. All the hippies I ever met smell bad and have no job.Also, I guess it might be kind of picky, but count how many times he uses the word \"irony\". It's just about every other page. Sorry. Loved the movie though.","As a post-apocalyptic novel, The Postman is mediocre at best. As a social/political commentary, it's much worse. There are many other books better than this. Give Costner (and the screenwriter!)credit that the movie made a solid adventure story out of a poor novel. Its too bad, the basic premise of The Postman is very interesting. However, the end result is disappointing.","When I picked up tis book, I expected it to be another one of David Brin's interesting novels. And, when I started to get into the book, I hated it. I thought, maybe, that the book would be different from the movie, which I also didn't like, but it wasn't.","As a self-professed post-apocalyptic fiction aficionado, I was very disappointed by this book. It cannot compare to some of the classic apocalyptic novels. Poorly written, very painful to read. The characters are wooden, the plot is simple, the dialogue is artificial, and there is nothing about this book that sets it apart from any other post-apocalyptic novel that you could find in the mass-market stack in the Walmart sci-fi section.Very disappointing. Boring. Do not recommend.","This is one of the worst books that I ever MADE myself read. That's right, I actually forced myself to complete this poorly written book. I kept waiting for the author to redeem himself, but alas I remained dissapointed. The really sad part is that the theme could be quite interesting. Unfortunately, the author creates a probable view of society after a holocast and does nothing with it.What was the deal with the mutunt soldiers? That was realistic (sarcasm). And of course the author couldn't give women too much credit by allowing them to be victorious in battle. Oh yes, the computer, stupid stupid stupid. If the scietists were able to get computers going again, do you really think that they would only repair hand-held children's games?This is a horrible book and a great waste of time. Unfortunately, Amazon has not given me the option of giving less than a one star review. The author owes my life a more than a few hours.","I am an avid reader and a fan of the &quot;post-apocalyptic&quot; genre, but I have to say, this book is utter garbage. I only read up to the third chapter or so... I couldn't take it. Terrible writing, disjointed pacing, awful introspective ramblings, and unrealistic, two-dimensional characters make for great kindling, and little else. It's the only book I've ever thrown away!","\"The Postman\" by David Brin is a brilliant concept. The unifying symbol of a post-apocalyptic America is a man in the uniform of a much-maligned civil servant.Gordon Krantz was a Minnesota university student when the U.S. and the world were hit with a triple-whammy. First a limited nuclear war followed by germ warfare then the deranged fanatics of survivalist cult in sequence destroyed civilization. Gordon became a soldier in the Minnesota National Guard. He had a front row seat as society and government were overwhelmed by catastrophe after catastrophe. He sees the heroism of the men in his unit and others as they lost the battle against chaos.Years later and much farther west, Gordon is a wanderer in search for a home. The US has sunk into barbarism. The few places there is order are ruled by feudalism. There is little technology, little interaction between communities. Occasionally, he finds some isolated communities that will allow him to perform his one man theatrical show. The life of this drifter is changed forever when reivers chase him from his camp. He finds shelter in the vehicle hidden by a dying postman.Like others Krantz knew, this mail man continued to deliver mail months after the US government had ceased to exist. Taking the man's bag and putting on his uniform, he resumes his search for a home.At his next stop, he goes through his usual vaudeville routine in exchange for food and shelter. But something peculiar happens. The people of this settlement believe he really is a mailman. They give him letters for the next town.Gordon conceives a simple con. He will pose as an official for the Restored United States government. What was originally a scheme for food and shelter becomes a great movement. People believe because they want to believe. Gordon finds himself as a leader. In his heart he is an idealist. All he wants is the old peace and order. But he is unaware that his years of wandering have made him resourceful and creative.Order is gradually restored in Oregon. This can't happen too soon because unknown to Gordon, other forces are conspiring to impose an order of a much more brutal nature.\"The Postman\" has a simple message. Sometimes ordinary people can't look to someone else but themselves for their own salvation. We live in comfort and security because ordinary people were willing to pay literally in blood.","I am not a fan of fiction, but I read this book a few years ago when the movie came out and radio personality Art Bell spoke about the book. I read it and found the book to be a pleasant surprise. The book is about Benjamin Franklin as much as anything else. It gives Franklin a lot of the credit that modern America seems to have forgotten about. The Postman also gives a little type of history lesson about early America and how it actually came to be a unified nation that would someday change world history. In a nation without TV, telephones, radio or other communication due to lack of electricity, the postal service is much more important than one could imagine.Brin's book is also a lot about women in American society and how much worse things would be for them in another, tragic, furure society. Brin dedicates this book to the women in his life who have fascinated him and that dedication is evident throughout the book. Brin's ability as a writer takes what might otherwise be only a dark and ugly story of futuristic nuclear disaster, and makes it one of hope for the future and appreciation for the past.As I wrote earlier, I am not a fan of fiction, but I found this worth the read. Forget about the movie, give the book a chance and you may well agree with my appreciation for this particular work of fiction.","David Brin sets out to create a post-apocalyptic world of the near future, a world of villages and fallen cities in the northwestern U.S. recovering from the loss of technology following an almost-all-out-war and surviving threats of political anarchism in the form of self-centered town governments and marauding bands of survivalists. The book's most interesting conceit comes in the form of the main character, Gordon Krantz, a traveling bard who is mistaken for a &quot;postman&quot; while dressed in official issue postal duds he stumbled upon in an old postal jeep. Unfortunately, this is Brin's best idea of the novel and he uses it to excess to carry and deliver a series of philosophical epistles centered about ideas of community, citizenship and belief in doing what's right and decent for our neighbors. The assumed &quot;postman,&quot; Gordon Krantz, creates the fiction of a &quot;Restored United States of America&quot; in order to get a room and meal in a hostile and paranoid township. But the idea takes on its own life as people begin to think again of folks beyond their own town borders and ultimately Krantz finds himself being recreated and &quot;restored&quot; by the power of his own fiction as it catches fire across the small towns of the Oregon countryside.. The &quot;good guys&quot; vs. &quot;bad guys&quot; confrontations lack any originality and wit. The interweave of subplots are glaring in their lack of subtlety regarding outcomes. Readers will anticipate what's about to occur long before the novel does and so one starts reading faster and faster muttering, come on, come on, come on. Mix this with shallow, two-dimensional characters that you've met before in other novels and you have a disappointing work by a writer capable of much better. THE POSTMAN reads like a sci-fi novel meant to teach basic civics 101 to late adolescents. It could have made a strong short story or novella, but it cannot sustain its conceit for over 300 pages. I applaud Brin' attempt to express his own political vision for a recovery of simpler and more elegant virtues and values in a contemporary world that does indeed appear overwhelmed with the ethic of personal aggrandizement and survival. But the power of the vision is lost. The novel ends with a set up for a sequel. Perhaps the next delivery will be closer to what we hoped we would be receiving.","Having not seen the movie, I was not sure to expect. It is a very well written book and keeps your interest from beginning to end.SMOOTH WRITING CONTRUCTS THE WORLD:This being my second David Brin book, my first was Kiln People, I amazed at his writing. As a sci-fi buff so often the description of the &quot;world&quot; the novel takes place in is cumbersome. There are explanations of the situation, technology and social structure that weigh down most sci-fi stories. David Brin has a wonderful way of weaving this into his stories so they are part of the dialogue or the unfolding scene. Trust me, this makes reading his books effortless. I found this to be true in Kiln people as well.A TALE OF A DRIFTER:The story takes place after society is recovering from a major war and social upheaval. Gordon the main character is a drifter moving West to find a better place to live. He is a older survivor, so he knows of the times before the big war and society fell apart. He is accosted by some locals in his travels and while planning to retrieve some of his belongings happens upon an old mail truck. Here he realizes that the world fell apart a bit differently than he supposed and in acquiring the wardrobe of the hapless dead postman, he has taken on the mantle of that title.HOW HOPE CAN BE GROWN:The rest of the story is how Gordon continues his travels from town to town and the saga of the postman is begun. Some of it is driven by its own momentum. Some of it is driven by Gordon's imagination. Mostly it is interesting how a theory can help hope form and become self perpetuating. Here the Postman becomes the icon of a world that is gone. Maybe just maybe, it can be rebuilt.IT IS ALL SO PLAUSIBLE:Ironically, when you read of how the world fell, you can see where we have this potential. It is all so plausible. We have the elements in today's society to create this very same mess.David Brin does a nice job working from that and from the hopes that could rebuild that.","I have never before read a David Brin novel, others here say this is not his best, but I found this novel a very good read. This book begins approximately sixteen years after an NBC war (for those who don't know, that stands for nuclear, biological, chemical) that was called the doomwar by those who lived through it. That war nearly destroyed the United States as a civilized society, but soon after that war survivalists plundered and destroyed most of what little civilization remained. Gordon, the primary character, traveled from one small isolated village to another for sixteen years after the Doomwar and at one point was robbed of most of his meager possessions. Soon he found a United States Postman's uniform and badge, and from there he impersonated a postman from a long dead government, a scam that had unusual consequences to say the least and created a very interesting story, with danger all around.This novel is fast paced and always the human nature side of the story is not neglected, and womens' view of things is well discussed, and as David Brin seems to say in this novel, how can us guys really know what a women thinks, down deep, all the time? This book is rich in descriptive detail without overdoing it. I found this book very easy to read, the words seemed to flow off the pages, well written.","I was hesistant in buying this book due to my unfavorable impressions to the horrible trailers that I saw for the movie, The Postman. The story intrigued me, but I had passed over the book 4 different times in various bookstores. Well finally on my 5th lookover, I decided to buy it and I'm sure happy I did. I took it home and read the book in two sittings. Couldn't get enough of the book and was sad to see it end.It was a fast read, and I liked the fast plotting of the book. I wanted to see how each new town that Gordon, the &quot;Postman&quot;, traveled to would react to him. Great read.Although labeled as a Sci Fi book, I tend to see some Western aspects of the books. There aren't cities anymore, but towns. Plus Gordon is traveling in the wilderness like a frontiersman, trying to rediscover the west. I find the western sci-fi/fantasy genre to be a very unexplored genre. Some books I recommend would be Devil's Tower, and Devil's Engine by Mark Sumner. A nice mix of traditional western with Fantasy.Brin, I sure hope you write a sequel. Gordon still has more of the west to explore!","Book Review by C. Douglas BakerTHE POSTMAN is set sixteen years after a cataclysmic event (presumably a nuclear war although there is room for speculation that it may have been some other disaster such as a large comet hitting the earth) has plunged the world to the brink of a dark age. Trying to survive in Oregon's Cascade Mountains, Gordon Krantz happens upon a run-down United States Postal Service jeep while trying to find a warm place to sleep and spends the night. Taking the leather jacket and cap off the skeleton of his unfortunate bunk-mate, with the full regalia of the U.S. Postal Service as accoutrements, and a sack full of old mail, Gordon sets off to hunt supplies. Thus begins Gordon's almost unconscious generation of a false legend.Attempting to extort supplies from settlement in the mountains, Gordon comes up with a story about a \"Reformed United States\" to the east and the reorganization of a Postal Service. Using his newly acquired postal gear as props, Gordon takes upon himself the role of a \"postal inspector\" who has come to reestablish postal routes and \"inspect\" local governmental institutions. He even, luckily, comes up with a few letters from the mailbag addressed to relatives of people in the community as a ruse to bolster is story. Through this reckless prevarication Gordon weaves his way into the good graces of the people he comes into contact with, simply by being a catalyst to their nostalgic remembrance of a time when the United States was a superpower and the postal service was so reliable as to be taken for granted. Gordon's \"big lie\" offers hope of a return to better times.Traveling around in this persona, Gordon lets the legend grow, even appointing \"postal inspectors\" in various areas as he goes along, creating a loyal cadre of \"followers\". As the legend takes hold, Gordon finds that he cannot tell the truth or back out of the duty that communities impose on him--that being giving them some hope that a better world is ahead and doing something to bring that future about. They believe in Gordon and his\"Reformed United States\" and he cannot let them down.Despite a very promising plot, THE POSTMAN is a bit frustrating. Authors using a lost-holocaust world as their setting must viscerally convey the extent of the catastrophe and the eeriness of a post-technological world. Brin in THE POSTMAN fails to do so. The reader never really emotionally feels the impact of the disaster and the odds facing the main character, Gordon. As a result, the book never delivers the emotional blow that is necessary to make the struggle back to a semblance of civilization satisfying to the reader. Brin is too contrite in his brief descriptions of run down cities, empty wildernesses, and struggling communities. The novel just does not \"feel\" like it is set in a post-holocaust society, despite that the characters and actions take place there.Brin also fails to bring life to his characters. Even the main character, Gordon, is not as well drawn as he could be. Brin does an even less stellar job at developing his peripheral characters. When important persons are suddenly killed the reader does not feel the sense of grief that great authors can convey, because the reader never really \"knew\" the character. This is particularly true of his female hero Dana. Her attempts to save her community and the fate of her band of \"scouts\" does not touch the reader because Brin never fully cultivates the reader's sympathy or understanding for her or her comrades.That being said, I actually enjoyed the novel (surprise!). Despite feeling estranged from the characters and plot, Brin's prose and ability to write action scenes and keep the story moving made it an enjoyable reading experience.","I saw the Kevin Costner film before reading the book, and unlike seemingly everyone else I enjoyed the movie. However I didn't know what to expect from the book, and so I was quite pleasantly surprised. I am of the school that enjoys movies, but knows that the books are almost always (if not always) better than the movies. The only problem I had is that I kept expecting things to happen as they had in the book, but specific details were different enough that it wasn't really ruined for me.There was thankfully no complete answer at the start that fully explained the condition of the world. This can have a place, but its absense strengthened this book. Instead the mystery is gradually unveiled until we find out that there were many wars and attacks that damaged the world. World War III errupted after an upswing out of the 80s depression. Thankfully explanations weren't simplistic and were quite credible in light of human character.Gordan Krantz was a fun character to journey with along the course of the book. Yes he is somewhat of an educated rogue that starts a huge scam to keep himself alive, but as you go along you begin to feel yourself caught up in what others feel when they hear of the \"Restored United States\" and the Postal Service. You cannot help but feel hope for these people, so long beaten down by the brutal Holnist survivalists and harsh post-apocalyptic conditions.If you enjoy science-fiction this book is peppered with enough of it to hold your interest, yet it isn't based of technical specs or diagrams. It is easily intelligble to the non science or sci-fi buff, yet at the same time it doesn't talk down to them either. I found it a very enjoyable story with empathetic characters and concepts that tie the whole together into something greater than the sum of its parts","A few years back I got interested in seeing how many books out there were written about life after either a nuclear war or massive epidemic that wipes out a lot of the earths population. There are many, to say the least.Most are purely trashy adventure novels full of tough ex military types killing each other and nearly non existant plot lines. The Postman, on the other hand, is one of the few that I personally thought had an element of realism and an interesting plot. Earth Abides would probably be another.A word of caution - if you liked the Costner movie 'the postman' and haven't read the book don't expect many simularities - other than some very general ones. Costner apparently thought that his ideas were more 'filmable' or whatever, but it ruined a great story (which I personally think would have made an excellent movie unchanged from how it was written by Brin). The character Gordon is completely different from book to movie, and this may throw you off if you are expecting the warrior minstrel from the movie in the book.4 out of 5 because I didn't like the ending (the part about the females).","I decided to read The Postman because I had heard good things about both the book and it's author, David Brin. I couldn't have been more misled. The book follows the adventures of a wandering loner in a post apocolyptic america, who finds that by impersonating a US postman, he can find saftey and food within the dwellings of the usually untrusting survivors. Along the way, he finds that his ruse has generated an icon that people can follow, to re-build america from the ashes. It doesn't sound too bad, I even liked the idea. Unfortunatley, Brin's writing style is flat, boring and so mundane, that he fails to bring any sense of drama, romance or even interest to any of his situations and characters. An example includes the postman falling in love with a woman for the romance part of the book, and then when he loses her, we don't care, because she was NEVER DEVELOPED as a character...This book is full of &quot;bad sci-fi&quot; cliches, and predictable plot developments. Everything from the Wizard of Oz computer to the characters refering to things like, the &quot;Doomwar&quot; or the &quot;Anti-Tech Riots.&quot; I mean this book was written in 1985? The dialogue and writing sound more like 1955! like Even such small things as how ALL the survivors refer to the Doomwar and the Chaos that followed (Brin's capitals) by the same names, even though we are told that they have all been isolated from each other for 20 years WITH NO COMUNICATION! This tells us that Brin didn't give this world any thought! The book is supposedly full of grand ideas, and in reality they all fall flat, and become cliched, mostly because Brin treats his readers as idiots when his main character, who is delivering mail and bringing hope to the surviviors, stops and thinks to himself, &quot;Gee if there was only a symbol, a person that everyone could rally behind, I would help them if I could...&quot; A good author would have given us this sense of events, (i.e. - the postman not realizing what he is doing, as he himself yearns for hope) in a subtle, interesting way. Unfortunatley, Brin just can't deliver his own ideas, and instead we end up laughing, when we were meant to be inspired. BMAN","this is an ingenius plot....a character to get behind is very much welcome, here it is Gordon Krantz...such an interesting idea, with villains that you actually dislike and you have yourself a good read...ive read this book twice now, and loved it both times...i just love the whole idea of moving the capital of the restored US to St. Paul...and how Krantz plays the role of government worker...this is an excellent book, well written, with a very interesting idea...worth the price at a bookstore? for me it was, others may be better off with a quick pickup at the library, because this is one of those books that you love or you hate","The Postman is an intelligent work with deep concepts. Describing the aftermath of war in America is done beautifully and with enough ambiguity to make it seem plausible. I live in the States, and there is that underlying survivalist mentality when you leave the Major cities. This representation is a good spin on the concepts and the possibility of post-apocalype survival.","I've read &quot;The Postman&quot; some three times, BEFORE the movie. When I heard they were going to make a movie out of it, I was almost aghast, afraid that they'd ruin a great story. The movie was not as good as this book, so if you were disappointed in the film, BUY THE BOOK. I was, however, especially pleased to see that one of my close personal friends played the Sherriff in the movie. :&gt;","I haven't seen the movie, but from what I have heard, it did not pay justice to the book. (Yes, few films do.)In The Postman, Brin writes about life on earth which is a different location then in most of his books. And the communication he writes about is not the touchy-feely kind, but the &quot;Hey I am alive what about you?&quot; kind. The Postman made me wonder again about how really important it is to know what is happening beyond our own communities.If you like science-fiction, but are tried of the usual humoid aliens, try Brin's The Uplift War.","David Brin's &quot;The Postman&quot; is a brilliant conceptualization of the human truism &quot;where there is no vision, the people perish&quot;. With his main character, Gordon, he portrays the plight of an idealist and dreamer thrown into a situation that demands decisiveness and action; in short, a modern Hamlet. Like Hamlet, Gordon is torn between his natural idealism and the terrible cynicism that the reality of his situation forces on him; like Hamlet, he flounders in moral introspection and debate when action is clearly required. It is interesting how natural cynics (call themselves realists) despise Gordon, while natural idealists understand and admire him; both within the novel and on this review site. Like every great novel, it reveals truths about human nature to the extent that the reader is able to perceive them. Keep writing, David! SF has too long been dominated by cynics, sensationalists and technotwits!","Mr. Brin's Postman is the story of the journey of Gordon, which never leads him to an inner life except to ask, who is going to save humanity from itself? The closest we ever get to something beyond the scope of human beings is Cyclops, the computer, who turns out to be the front for a group. The questions I ask are: Wouldn't the farmers have had some kind of worship service to a Higher Power? And, is Gordon going to California to find just more of the same or to find God? To me it is a good read on hopelessness and despair. Cause and effect.","The Postman is a good, quick read, but about halfway through the plot and story start getting fuzzy as Brin uses the story to explore philosophical issues. I'm a big fan of post-nuclear fiction, and the book does not fully exploit Brin's interesting postnuclear view of the world. (the jack-of-all-trades and the master of none syndrome) The movie, on the other hand, does. It has a good, consistent, patriotic story and is everything the book should've been. (which doesn't happen very often) Still though, the book is quite good and I'd read it again if I had to do it over. I only wish the movie was longer and had more time exploring the postnuclear world as it did in the opening scene.","I just could not put this book down! David Brin's short story-turned-novel got me wanting to read on and on- hungry for more. I finished reading within 12 hours just in time before the movie release on Christmas Day implying that a curious non-sci-fi fan can expect easy reading with technical language kept at a minimum. Certainly not Brin's best but possibly his most glamorous and profitable work thanks to Kevin Costner and (ugh)Hollywood. Nevertheless, it is an exciting and thought-provoking reading as we witness the deeply nostalgic &quot;Postman's&quot; inner struggle for clarity. As for the ending, I smell a sequel. It had me visualizing the final scene from &quot;Back to the Future&quot; which, as I recall, had the audience shouting &quot;WHAT?!&quot; Obviously, Brin knows book sales to have written such a annoyingly simple ending. Just make sure not to let that Huey Lewis song enter your mind after finishing this wonderful story. You won't be able to get rid of it!","A reader of the book will see that The Postman (which is not related to the &quot;Il Postino&quot; movie of a few years back) illustrates the power of memes over brawn. From the indications of the advance trailer, Kevin Costner is butchering this book by turning the physically and intellectually weak protagonist of The Postman into a Mad Max hero of the Reformed USA. &quot;Waterworld goes Postal,&quot; indeed, from the catcalls and jeering evident in the theatres where the trailer runs, the movie is set to be as well-received as Waterworld. In the book, the Postman is merely a catalyst - to turn him into a heroic leader utterly destroys the meaning of the story. Can anyone tell me if there's some wonderful story that got perverted into Waterworld?","There are only two things wrong with this book, and if you quit reading this review now, you'll probably miss one of them.The first &quot;wrong&quot; is the fact that the story leaves so much of this &quot;future&quot; unexplored. I'm going to go back and read this one again, just to see what I missed.The second &quot;wrong&quot; is that someone is actually making a movie of this book and it stars Kevin Costner. Oh no! &quot;Waterworld goes Postal&quot;?!?Other than that, this book is a great story and worth your time! Thanks David! Get to work on the sequel (or if there's one out there, email me!)","Through this book, many fictional works have flowed forth.If you have played such games as:Fallout,Fallout 2,Fallout 3: Game of The Year Edition,Fallout: New Vegas, Half-Life, Half-Life 2, you have experienced the reality and atmosphere.The only post-apocalypse book where post-nuclear feminism elements are clear and reformed. Reformed in ways both big and small.How does one prevail when the darkness of man is unleashed and roams freely. This is where Gordon finds himself. Wandering. Not knowing what to do. You see Gordan's soul where it has been repeated killed and repeatedly revived.Gordon wanders looking for something to believe in. Anything. He's seen all the horrors of the post-apocalypse world. Yet he is always wandering and roaming, being unable to settle down.","I've read this twice and it affected me differently each time. For a book that is, ultimately, about hope and optimism and the capacity to rise above, this is an amazingly grim and downbeat novel. But if post-apocalyptic stories are your cup of meat--this is one of the best. It shares with Robert Edmond Alter's novel PATH TO SAVAGERY a strong capacity to make you feel the cold, the wet and the hunger; rather than glorify physical combat, both books convey the fear and desperation of a lawless, dog eat dog world. Kevin Costner's notorious film version isn't as awful as most people claim, but it doesn't manage to hold much interest after the first hour. There are a few things wrong with THE POSTMAN--namely the chief villains, who are a bit unbelievable, but that is just a quibble; David Brin has written an engrossing and thoughtful novel and its well worth seeking out.","You know, without having to look at Kevin Costner, this is a pretty good story. I haven't seen the movie, but I have read many other books by David Brin, and they've all been enjoyable, so I decided to give this one a try. It's a philosophical story more than anything else, but set in a nice post apocalyspe landscape that makes the abstract issues a little more urgent. Is it wrong to deceive people, possibly into giving their lives, if the myth you are pushing might eventually bring great benefits? Is it possible to have a system where the powerful do not abuse their power? Most impressive of all, this book avoided the standard hollywood ending, and left us wondering if there really was any hope, if the myth was really true or not. It's even aged well, unlike a lot of other science fiction books set in &quot;futures&quot; that are already in the past.","I can't believe I never read this book after seeing and kinda liking the movie itself.Of course, the book is far superior in just about all ways as far as characters and storyline.","David Brin's concept is truly remarkable, and his plotting is superb. This is a wonderful story.But in the end, the verdict on this book is the same as the verdict on the Kevin Costner film that takes its name: With such a good story, there's no excuse for &quot;The Postman&quot; to be as bad as it is.Brin's technique, his craft, betrays his own vision. At best the prose is serviceable; more often, it is an excruciating thing to read. The &quot;Damn you&quot;s that constantly bounce around in Gordon's brain are straight out of the worst community theater's Shakespeare festival.Would you like to know why so few people will rightly call science fiction legitimate literature? This is why: most science fiction writers, like Brin, just can't write--and some of the worst, including Brin, are given the most glorious &quot;literary&quot; prizes. Any serious critic would laugh out loud at this book's Nebula Award; the award doesn't compliment this book so much as this book incriminates the award.It is true that many science fiction writers have brains as active as any writer of &quot;serious&quot; fiction. But only a few in the history of literature could be trusted to transfer those ideas well to paper. Read Ted Sturgeon and Kurt Vonnegut for real reading, and then read this and other Nebula Award-winners if you want reading that is imaginitive but atrociously written.","This is great book and I enjoyed reading it years and years ago. It sticks with you, however I found the ending to be greatly disheartening.David Brin essentially has no faith in traditional western values or culture and sometimes it just shoots right out at you. If you are OK with that, then enjoy, otherwise leave it alone.","After coming across the movie one Saturday morning I became inquisitive as to how good the book would be. The movie wasn't the Oscar winning title, but hey movies based off books aren't the best anyways. I knew the book would be better so I decided to read it my senior year in high school.It basically starts up post end of mankind and follows the life of a \"postman.\" The first portion of the book really yanks you in and makes you not want to stop reading. As he travels town to town he somewhat is seen as the hero of the noble guys, yet he is just disguised as a postman to save his life, and his only. It follows intensely into his thoughts and steps as he travels across the leftover states. It sadly doesn't stay like this forever.It abruptly turns into a bad action movie. Excessive amounts of action but no real rhyme or reason. Nothing gets explained fully and makes you somewhat guess about why something is happening. He evidently falls in love with a woman from a town, but doesn't really tell a thing about her whatsoever. So again throws you up against the wall making you guess about things again. Mr. Brin being the scientific man that he is, I guess feels obligated to throw in some high tech parts into the book, that were so out there, that it made it almost unbearable to even read.Yet some parts were good, okay maybe only the beginning, it was overall a decent at best book. So to sum it up, I'd give it a two, out of five stars. The movie is far better compared to this book. I wouldn't recommend reading unless you are greatly bored out of your mind.","Public service prevarication brings realistic results.An ordinary guy who comes up with a scam to get himself through in this nasty postapocalyptic world, after discovering some gear, ends up an important figure in starting to rebuild, and in a conflict. In a society like this it is no surprise that there will be a crazed religiously motivated and influenced ultra-right militaristic fascist group wanting to keep things how they are, and not allow information to again be widely communicated.","If you liked the movie...well, watch it again. It's way better than the book. Brin gets credit for the cool main idea, but it's developed better in the (notably different) movie. The execution in the book just isn't very good--and like most sci-fi, the book's poorly-written. By the standards of sci-fi, I guess it's o.k...maybe alright for the beach or whatever. But really just not very good. I love post-apocalyptic fiction, and even I found myself skimming to the end.","A Nameless man whoses a solitary drifter to a devastated USA, dons a Postman's uniform and becomes a Postman, a man re-presenting hope to Battle General Bethelem and his evil Holonists.","David Brin does not disappoint with this book. Much better than the movie. Although the movie was good, the book was better.","The Postman is an insightful and inspiring story of a man in his quest to protect the flickering flame of civilization from the imposing dark ages of a post apocalyptic world. As Gordon Krantz makes his way across the apocalyptic wasteland, barely surviving among the ruins of civilization, he stumbles upon an old United States Postal vehicle that forever changes the direction of his life. What starts out as a lie to simply gain shelter and food becomes an idea that ignites a revolution. This is a story more about ideas that any particular ideology. In fact, David Brin often presents ideology as being part of the reason for civilization's demise. For instance, the term \"survivalist\" becomes derogatory as some radical elements of the community have embraced the fall of civilization as an opportunity to subdue, pillage and conquer. Don't fret preppers: The Postman was written in 1985, before the more recent, positive culture of self-sufficiency and permaculture which has become more widespread in recent years spreading through good people like Jack Spirko at The Survival Podcast. The power of ideas should not be underestimated. While it is easy to focus on the more negative examples of crooked idealism gone astray such as the case with hitler and the nazis (disrespect intended), Brin proposes that ideas can have an equally positive effect as he presents the United States as a successful society structured upon ideas that actually lead to a decrease in human suffering. Civilization is presented as an idea or a collection of ideas rather than a physical manifestation. The Postman is a substantial work of fiction that will provide you with considerable grist for the mill of contemplation, if you are so inclined. Alternatively, if you are simply seeking a great story with likeable characters, you will not be disappointed.","I saw the movie years ago and really didn't like it. All my friends said to read the book - great EOTW fic.I liked the book - sometimes. Loved the first half, second half was just kind of bizarre and I thought the end was good. YES, I shed a tear. Just one :)I liked Gordon, the postman, and felt bad about his inner demons over his choices. I thought the author made that compelling. On the one hand he was living a lie and wanted out but, HOW? On the other hand he was bringing hope and a sense of patriotism to the survivors. It was truly a moral dilemma.It's hard to talk about the second half of the book without spoilers. What I CAN say is there is a machine named Cyclops. Hmmmm, what exactly is cyclops. I think of Star Wars with those big marching machines. I wasn't far off. The dictionary says -- member of a race of savage ones, one eyed giants. I'm perplexed why this machine garnered that name. Kinda nitpicky I know. It was pretty obvious what was going on anyway. I thought the \"engineered soldiers\" were unnecessary. Too far out there for me. As I said, the second half of the book waded into strange territory -- that was too bad.Lastly, it looks like I didn't like the book. Just the opposite. I liked the premise, I liked the action, I liked the characters, I lied the message. I loved the end of the book -- not your usual shiny, happy people.Recommended highly!","This was an enjoyable book to read. This could actually happen to mankind. The book kept my attention throughtout, right up to the end.","Be prepared for a slightly different ride to the movie. I purchased this after watching the movie and as usual there are differences, but enough similarities to not disappoint if you have seen the movie.I think, as a book, it captures a lot of the struggle of humanity with it's own self destructive tendencies. I found that I kept making excuses to read a bit more and a bit more. I will be interested to read other of David Brin's work and have high hopes that I have found another great author.","At times, heartbreakingly poetic. Brin creates an interesting character and lets him evolve while staying true to the traits. Yet it felt very dated to me, especially the latter half of the book. I felt that Brin's choices with regard to plot were decisions made on the fly, rather than something planned in advance, and that bothered me. A good read, groundbreaking for its genre, but (can't believe I'm saying this) there were times when I wished it were closer to the movie plotline instead.","In a post-apocalyptic future, Gordon Krantz is something of a nomad, drifting from village to village, acting out one-man plays in exchange for food and shelter. While evading bandits he stumbles upon an old postal truck. Krantz takes the dead letter carrier's uniform and, helping himself to the mailbag, begins playing a new role: that of a postman dispatched by the reconstituted government to reestablish delivery routes. There is no new government but villagers fighting for survival and fending off tribes of marauders are desperate to believe him. The question is whether Krantz will live up to the illusion he's invented.I'm a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction in general, but I approached this novel with the thought that it might not live up to its hype. I was mistaken. Brin created a credible future world, and the concept of a survivor feeling compelled to deliver the mail (even if he stumbled onto the idea for reasons that were far from altruistic) is brilliant: mail delivery becomes not only a means of stitching together a torn nation, but a powerful symbol of national unity and pride. Gordon Krantz is more than a bit torn himself, a man of less than heroic stature who, by the novel's end, has grown into not just a hero, but an icon of heroism. Krantz is a fully developed character (a rarity in sf), and his personal transformation is inspiring. The supporting characters are also solid and purposeful. The Postman is a strongly plotted, well written novel, in many ways better than another, more celebrated version of a post-apocalyptic future:The Road.","This small book allows the reader to enjoy Brin's unique style. He is obviously an extra-ordinary thinker. I doubt this is close to his finest work however. I feel that it needed more editing to be considered a master piece. I would give it 4.3 stars if I could. It is quite interesting and easy to finish.This takes place in a post nuclear world. Mutant soldiers wreak havoc amongst the remaining colonies of survivors. Even gold has no value. In these uncertain times, some of us try to plan for different scenarios. The Postman introduces a scenario that is likely to introduce a few curveballs into your way of thinking about a breakdown of the system.We should all hope for the best and plan for the worst. This is probably close to the worst.","In post-apocalyptic Oregon, nearly two decades after the Doomwar, Gordan Krantz, a drifter who trades his skills as an ersatz thespian for room and board in the small hamlets he encounters in his travels, finds a new purpose in life. When Gordan happens upon a long dead mail carrier one day, Gordan takes his coat to help him stay warm on his journey...and nothing is the same again. As he travels from one small enclave to another, the people in these towns respond to the sign of the postal service in an unexpected way. The people in these towns are soon writing letters to loved ones that haven't heard from in nearly twenty years. Gordan gives no promises, but does his best to deliver these letters with the aplomb of a genuine mail carrier. But that's the catch, the people of these towns don't realize that Gordan is not an actual mail carrier. And soon, Gordan is the \"representative\" of the Restored United States...a fiction Gordan creates to give the people some hope. Hope that they are not alone in their small part of what was once a great country. Hope that there is someone else out there...that they are part of something greater than themselves and their small, introverted enclaves.Growing up most of us are taught to \"never tell a lie\". But David Brin's thoughtful examination of how a lie can turn into myth...a myth of a nation reborn...can deliver hope to people where there was none before. And the very act of spreading this myth can make it true, a nation can be reborn if enough people believe it can be. Are there really lies worth telling?I very much enjoyed Brin's concept of Gordan creating this myth, initially out of personal necessity, and then watching Gordan do his utmost to turn the myth into a reality.The only significant qualm I had with the plot itself was that there was an awful lot of \"stuff\" going on around Gordan that, because the tale is told entirely from Gordan's perspective, we never really got to see in a lot of detail. I would have like to have seen the story told from the perspective of those around Gordan, as well as Gordan himself. Nonetheless, when I read a story by Brin I am always impressed with his characterizations, especially the characterizations of the main protagonist...and The Postman is no exception. I would certainly recommend this tale to anyone who enjoys, not only solid scifi, but plain old good stories.","I had not seen the movie when I read this book, so the story was fresh for me. I was looking for a smaller story, I think, of the post apocalypse, but this was an exciting surprise. It is a great adventure and survival story. Good writing, good characters, but it may seem a bit sexist at times, so it should be taken into consideration the times in which this book was written. There was a breaking point for me though, at the ending. I'm not sure why the author made such a departure from the basic plot and tried to go sci-fi.","This is a rare positive postapacolyptic plot with intriguing insight into the what makes the human animal a social being. It's premise is simple but the results are as complex as our society. It is thoughts such as these that give us hope for the future of humankind.","IF I remember right, this story was first released as a Short Story or Novella in a SF mag years ago. It was one of the best short stories I have ever read. Later David expanded it to a Novel - and created an even better story. At the time, I remember telling my friends this would make the ultimate End-of-the-world Movie ever. Well - Somebody finally thought of that. Can't wait for the Movie.","I just finished reading the Postman. It was one of the best books I have ever read. I could not put it down and finished it in only two days. The main character just captures the reader pulling him into the story. All the character and situations are completely belivable. No MADMAX wastelands or Mutant blood sookers. All and All a very good book for SF nuts and general reader's alike. I hope the do the book justice in the movie.","Until I read this book by Mr. Brin I had never been one of his biggest fans. I am now a convert. The premise behind The Postman is one of the most unique that I have ever seen, and while reading I often found myself unable to think of anything else but what was happening in the story. In my mind this is the hallmark of a great writter. Even if you are not a traditional science fiction fan, you will find this engrossing and witty story very enjoyable.","I loved the book. I think I have read it a total of eight times, and it is still interesting. It has a more realistic attitude to it than Startide Rising and the Uplift war, which were both great books, but neither captured my attention like the Postman. I would stayed up for hours just reading the book, and not get bored. A great book. -Ben Presley","This book has its limits in its origins so it may seem disjointed, but not an impossible read. It is classic science fiction because it gives new points of view and it makes you think. It even tried to explore how feminist ideas might survive the apocalypse and that such a society may not necessarily repeat mistakes of the past.If you are looking for a new book and haven't read this one buy it","I grew up in Oregon and have been to most of the places that he wrote about. Lived in Cottage Grove and Eugene later in life and grew up in Florence. Brin's research was PERFECT. I have personally taken the &quot;Trail&quot; from Culp Creek to Oakridge. GOOD JOB DAVID....Rosi Bentley","I found the Postman to be a pleasant surprise. I bought the book because I enjoyed Brin's Sundiver series and his ability to generate interesting story lines. The description on the cover led me to believe that this was going to be a campy, possibly downright silly outing.True to form, Brin finds a way to generate a fresh look at a story line that has been visited before. As I read on, I was surprised to find that he had quite intrigued me. The subtle supporting details resulted in a more believable interpretation of the post-apocalyptic tale of survival than any I had previously read. The scheme initally spun by the title character slowly takes on a life of its own until he, himself, becomes the servant instead of the master.Brin solidifies his reputation as a story teller with this effort.","In the tradition of stories like Alas, Babylon, Brin weaves a tale of hope in the aftermath of a modern world war. With some of the finest dramatic skill I have ever read, Brin takes us on a journey with his main character to find a means of survival and redemption not just for an individual, but for a people.Also in the best tradition of science fiction, Brin demonstrates the effect technology has on human societies in a most poignant way...by removing it. In a time of pragmatism, the last idealist must have enough hope for everyone.The Postman is a story which is so well written that you don't have to be a science fiction buff to quickly claim it as one of your favorites!","Brin's novels tend to be &quot;simply&quot; stories. His short stories almost always have an element of the mythic and moral to them. For this reason, The Postman always seemed strange to me: it is mythic and definitely has a moral. I tracked out the first edition and learned why: the book started life as a novella. If this is the result, I wish Brin would make more of his short stories into books.Humankind did not blow itself up, it sort of sputtered most of the way there -- with a couple of nukes, a couple of biological weapons, and a big push from those descendents of gun-nuts, the survivalists -- and stopped. The main character combined the survival instinct of postWar types with the wonder and intellectualism of the preWar types. He is wandering the US, looking for something. In the end, he himself creates what he has been looking for -- someone who is taking responsibility, who is creating something greater than himself or his village.The mythic and the moral emerges towards the end of the book, and it is for this element that I take this book to my desert island. It becomes a fight between good (those who will take responsibility, however unwillingly) and evil (the survivalists, who won't), unexpectedly involving preWar science and philosophy. The forming of the US after the Revolution, the thoughts of Ben Franklin, and the legend of Cincinatus (look it up, it's worth knowing) are the pegs upon which Brin hangs his moral tale.And, as always, Brin has written a simply good book."],

      "description":"Snowfall features another sharp-tongued, uncompromising heroine, Catania Olsen. She is the doctor for and spiritual guardian of a band of hunters who live at the edge of a great Wall of ice in what was once Colorado. In the country of the Trappers, books are hand-copied so that knowledge may be preserved, but the technology described in their precious pages is mostly lost to their fur-clad readers, despite Catania's attempts at scientific treatment and the Trappers' careful husbanding of ancient metal tools. As a resurgent population moves west and north from the more settled places that had once been the Eastern Seaboard and Gulf Coast of the United States, they drive tribesmen-Cree, Arapaho, and more-before them. On the run and desperate to find new homes, the tribes slaughter entire populations to claim their lands. The Trappers are innocent of this until Jack Monroe, banished years before for murdering a fellow Trapper, arrives, urging them to flee their ancestral home, the Trappers do not listen until nearly too late, until the first enemy arrows have found their marks. The southern flight of the surviving Trappers is a journey through time as well as space. From a frozen northland where summer lasts two chilly weeks through a burgeoning forest where the Trappers taste their first beef to a gulf coast where warm breezes carry exotic scents and sounds; from a primitive life of hunting and trapping to the luxurious Gardens, where people can still weave and make paper, to a bustling trade mart where man-beasts created by unnatural science tread the dirt streets, Catania is shocked to recognize that the proud Trappers have spent generations clinging to civilization with their fingernails. The journey into the warm lands will change Doctor Catania Olsen, mind, heart, and soul. She will gain and lose a love, see great wisdom and greater folly, witness amazing miracles and terrifying science, and, most surprising to herself, become a mother. Finally, she will have to choose between her people and her freedom. At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",

      "reviews.text":["I have mixed feelings about this novel. On one hand, it has a pretty neat premise: The impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy with Jupiter in 1994 perturbed that planet's orbit imperceptibly, yet just enough to cause gradual climatic change on Earth, and hundreds of years later we are in the grip of a new Ice Age. Cool idea! Yet I'm troubled by the fact that such climate change would necessarily result in the catastrophic setback of science and culture depicted in this book. If the climate change had been accompanied by, for instance, a few good meteor impacts, the tribal existence of the book's protagonists would have been far more plausible. Too many questions are left unanswered here, and \"Snowfall\" is left begging for a sequel.That having been said, I still found this novel quite entertaining. I've always been a sucker for post-apocalyptic sci-fi, although there is precious little sci-fi here. Instead Mitchell Smith has painted a rich picture of a tribal community that calls itself the Trappers, living a tooth-and-nail existence just below the Wall Of Ice that engulfed Canada and the northern half of the United States. Having been forced off their land by tribes that have in turn been forced off THEIR land, the remnants of the Trappers must move south to warmer climes and strange human cultures. There are some memorable, well-drawn characters in this tale, most notably Catania, the tribe's doctor and preserver of ancient medical knowledge. Tribal warfare, sickness and death are portrayed unflinchingly here. The book is divided into short, easily digested chapters, each beginning with an excerpt from Catania's journal. Definitely worth a look if you like books of this genre.","Thanks to Amazon.com I found yet another author that I never heard of but writes a novel that sounded very interesting to me. If you like novels in the grand tradition of William Sarabande's FIRST AMERICANS series, or like post-holocaust adventure stories - then this one's for you!Mitchell Smith's SNOWFALL is a well told tale of an Earth that has gone through another ice age and has taken civilization away, leaving cities such as Chicago, with snowdrifts as high as the tallest skyscrapers. It is never told what exactly happened to the earth, but it is told and hinted to a long, long, time ago as the story is taking place.The story opens with a band known as the Trappers, a small collection of families that united and hunt the frozen tundra of what once was Colorado,I think. Their only link to the past is old journals and books that have been re-copied over and over thru time and they call copybooks.The first chapter starts right off with the hunters of the band getting food for their camp when they are attacked by Cree. The Cree are the modern-day equivalent of indians, but most of their bloodline are white, they have just taken to the old indian ways of survival. As the story goes on, the trappers are being forced out of their hunting grounds and being pushed south, along with all the other tribes from the north, like a dominoe effect. Fighting to keep their land, the trapper's, along with an outcast that comes back named Jack, a losing fight ensues and most of the trappers are decimated and Jack finds himself a leader of a band on the run. The band's head doctor of the tribe is a clorful woman named Catania. Catania is much more than a doctor as the reader finds out as the story unfolds. I thought that this book would not have much action and adventure that I'm partial too, but it had it plenty enough along with lots of interesting characters to keep you glued to each page.The adventures and tragedies that befall the running band of trappers as they flee ever southward is an enjoyable read as the reader see's the changes in the land and it's peoples as the trappers go deeper south. The ending is not what I expected, but it was good nonetheless. It read like an epic movie. I recommend this book to anyone.","Set in the future after the next ice age has destroyed most of civilization, this is a story about Dr. Catania Olsen a member of the Trappers tribe, a group by people living in the North at the edge of the glacial wall. Enough time has passed so that most knowledge has been lost. Civilization is still on the fall. It is a brutal time and life is very hard. Catania's tribe is attacked and forced to move.The tribe meets the Garden people, which live in the forest. There Catania meets the rather extreme one-eyed doctor. Catania must tread carefully with the half-mad woman.I enjoyed this story. It is creative and well thought out. We are not presented a world where humanity bravely steps up to and overcomes a challenge, but where it descends back into darkness and merely strives for survival.An interesting story.","In 1998, humanity learned a cold hard lesson about the interrelationship of the solar system. Comets and fragments hammered Jupiter causing a minute, seemingly statistically insignificant shift in the giant planet's orbit. Insignificant to Jupiter turns out to be colossal to Earth as that almost undetectable shift over two hundred years later has caused a monstrous new ice age on the earth.This wall of ice is so big that almost all of Chicago is buried under it and so wide the North America continent is divided in two. Clans barter, fight, and compete for supremacy in a harsh land. For instance, the Trappers are hunters with some knowledge of the past eke a living in the frozen Colorado Mountains. When barbaric invaders from the north attack, the Trappers flee led by Jack Monroe and Dr. Catania Olsen to the south. They seek peace and domestic tranquilly, but only find a vast wasteland of savageness. Still they keep searching for a better life.SNOWFALL is a great apocalypse tale that uses a real solar event to cause an incredible catastrophe on earth that leads to a deep tale of future survival. The story line is very exciting, as the action never slows down yet readers care about the Trappers, especially the lead duo, whose struggles seem so real. Fans of future dark global calamities will want to revise their short term reading plan by placing Mitchell Smith's tremendous thriller at the top of the to read immediately food chain.Harriet Klausner","A wonderful concept, discussing the possible world after a new Ice Age, is ruined by poor characters.The only character I DIDN'T find myself hating ends up...well, spoilers and all that so never mind.In any case, the vision is quite intriguing, but I found the execution severely lacking and it made for an un-enjoyable read.","When the price for the Kindle Edition is more than 3 times the cost of mass paperback, the publishers need to rethink their strategy. I don't expect the publishers and/or authors not to make a profit, however, the profit should be \"reasonable\".","Life after the fall of western civilization would be rough for sure. You can see that in all gritty realism in this book.I got it two years ago and read a bit of it and then quit reading it for a while. It sort of grossed me out to tell the truth. The author made no bones about describing bodily functions and the like. I liked the general premise of the book, though and I only have about a page left to read. I'm not sure I will continue with the series, because I read an awful lot and the competition for my attention is pretty fierce.If you like Sci-Fi, this may not be for you. The action and entire story takes place after the fall of western civilization and there are very few references to any Sci-Fi subject manner. This reads more like a western novel, I imagine.","Having just now finished reading the book and having scanned reviews ranging from one star to five stars, I feel like I have to weigh in emphatically on the side of those who love this book. If you take what this book is and don't try to compare it to the hordes of nuclear war/EMP/comet crashing post apocalyptic books, this stands on its own as a unique and highly engaging far future story in a world where cities and cars and modern civilization is a distant memory handed down through hand-copied versions of books from the distant past.Whether the Jupiter reference on the opening quote page is actually the cause of the new ice age that is the backdrop for this book is of no relevance, and reviewers who are looking for hard sci-fi may not like it, but its just not meant to be a fact-based future but a \"might-be\" future of hard living in a sparsely populated future where summer is measured in weeks and a mile high glacier stretches right across what was the US lifetimes ago.What Mitchell has done so well is create a whole vernacular and way of life that relates to things we take for granted in almost a religious and mystical way. Phrases and idioms that we use every day are, to them, all learned from the hard earned \"copy-books\" that they trade for and value dearly.I won't recount the story (we all hate spoilers), but having read many fantasy books as well as all the standard post apocalyptic literature from On the Beach to Alas, Babylon to Swan's Song to The Stand, this book was refreshing in that it doesn't rehash the same themes of struggle just after the attack or just after the comet hits or just after the virus strikes. This is the far future, survival in a world that, in its own way, is just being born. What is fascinating here is that their way of life only resembles our way of life in a superficial way, and it feels authentic within the world that the author has created. The lives they live are not like our in many ways at all, and the social fabric, social norms and lifestyle of Snowfall's characters will at turns shock you and then ultimately intrigue you.It is true that there is abundant violence and sexual language, however I think it fits within the books world view. This is a true post apocalyptic book that will give you not only a great read but will also make you laugh at the way these future inhabitants try to understand how we lived our lives without any frame of reference. It is well worth reading.","I was surprised by this book. I really thought it was a kind of pulp post apocalyptic thing, but I usually like that so I got it. It was far deeper and intricate than I anticipated. The characters were not cookie cutter carbons but had interesting fragilities. One moment in the book, where the women of the tribe, spend their last minutes shooting arrows into the enemy as their toddlers stood beside them nearly made me cry. Anyway, for pulp Sci-Fi, it was good. Peace to you.","This is an underwhelming story that leads into a very underwhelming trilogy of stories.In this one we're introduced to characters and themes that only serve to move the story from point A to point B without much more than a cursory examination.The more interesting themes in this book are either mentioned in passing, such as the city of Chicago buried in ice, or disregarded after flirtations, a town of tree-dwellers who want to preserve some knowledge and old time manufacturing.It seems as if half way into writing this novel the author totally got lost or bored of the entire Post-Apocalyptic setting and wanted to come to an easy conclusion just to set up another book where everything is different from this one.In a nutshell, a group of people see their whole tribe slaughtered, flee south, kill some of their own, flee again, get slaughtered some more, until there are so few left the only thing to do is split them up with no resolution and start setting up for the next book.Lazy and uninspired storytelling leads to a lame and uninteresting story using only the themes setup on the dust jacket. I also found the second novel in this series to be worse than this one as a whole, I will not even task myself with attempting the third in the trilogy.","Reminds me more of Fantasy than Post-apocalytic. Lots of GRAPHIC violence in the battle descriptions, not for youngsters or those with \"iffy\" stomachs.","Book 1 of the Snowfall Trilogy brings you to a PA world that avoids many of the usual cliches - no nuclear attack, no mysterious virus that wipes out most of mankind, no zombies (not that I object to any of those, but they HAVE been over-used). Mitchell Smith's frozen world 600 years in the future is engaging, the characters complex and the plot never fails to keep you turning the page (or clicking next page).The next two books only get better, so keep reading!","I tried to like this book. I really did. I normally love post-apocalypse-type stories, and this one looked like a winner. Now, to be fair, the writing was not too bad, and the characters seemed well-drawn.Let me tell you why I got 150 pages in and then threw it down in disgust: The insane overabundance of ellipses. You know, when you see three periods strung together... Once in a while, such a device can add tension, etc. etc. But when you use them (and I'm not joking here) every third or fourth sentence, it quite rudely interrupts the flow of the story. But wait! It gets worse! There were several dozen instances where the author and/or editor apparently felt that just one ellipses wouldn't do. So instead there are two or three strung together, both on the end AND beginning of sentences. ......Kind of like this......Annoying, and ultimately unreadable.","The next Ice Age is upon us: imagine the mile-high cliff of ice at your back, with the Rocky Mountains another impenetrable wall of ice to the west, & people from the east, who once occasionally hunted peaceably on the periphery of your territory, are now intent on taking over your traplines & your caves. Where do you go? Into the great, green forest to the South where the snow ends & monsters dwell?Mitchell Smith has created a whole new future, with particular attention to the anthropological aspects of how we might have made it, what things & thoughts might have survived from the Warm Time.I particularly enjoyed the fully realized heroines & heroes, those who die & those who survive. They have keen insights & eyesights that we, today in our citified lethargy, have long since discarded. Each person could have walked in today's world & felt a glimmer of recognition for us modern folks & our modern nation, except...SNOWFALL is a marvelous, richly-textured adventure that allows us a glimpse of what really might happen when our descendants have to grapple with the inevitable change in the Earth's climate. What will happen to Chicago, for instance, when thousands of feet of snow bury the city? What will happen to our store of knowledge, once electricity is no more? What will happen to our society? Who then will be the readers of what books? What will the doctors know? Who will be our leaders? What kinds of relationships will we have?If you read only one science-fiction/anthropology book this year, read SNOWFALL! Mitchell Smith has written a superb survivalist saga, that lingers in your mind everafter, wondering. It certainly deserves a sequel, for I would dearly love to know how Catania makes it to the Sierras & the snow-bound warrior/hunters who live there.","I love post-apocalyptic books but this one fell short of being the least entertaining. It doesn't even deserve to share the same book shelf as \"The Swan Song\" and \"The Stand\" which are two of my all time favorite end-of-the-world books. It did, however, rank a notch above \"Lucifer's Hammer\" as I at least finished reading it. Needless to say, I won't be purchasing the two sequels to this book."],

      "reviews.text":["Templesmith is a master artist and conceptualist, but Singularity 7 shows that he still needs some work on storytelling and characterization. Some of the characters are hard to tell apart, and no character ever comes out as a lead. I have no problem with emsemble pieces, but there were characters that seemed like they were only in the story to serve as a lead, then never got to be one. The boy with the dragon tattoo on his face, for example (those who've read this will understand).Negatives aside, Templesmith's art has always been exceptional, and he does not break from that here. Plus, the concept of the story is extremely engaging, even when the characters are not. It's too bad that this is a self-contained story, because the story could have gone on as a series for quite some time. I have high hopes for his current series, Shadowplay, and hope to see that published as a collection soon.","I will be simple... Great story (it is Templesmith debut as a storyteller), the art is his own kind, very special, I love all the details of his art and this terror scy-fi graphic novel. I rate this book with four stars (instead five) because the quality of the binding is disgusting...","Then this is for you. It's an interesting story about a post apocalyptic world, but the art just threw me off. It was chaotic and a bit jarring. The story was decent, with flat characters and some gore.Wouldn't recommend unless you like strange graphic novels","An awesome story-line, fantastic artwork and a superb mix of horror and science fiction make this one to remember. Highly recommended to anyone who likes the band Fear Factory, as the artist of Singularity 7, Ben Templesmith, was actually commissioned by the band to do their artwork.All in all, worth the money and worth a read. Over and over again","Ben Templesmith has done it again, presenting us with visions of nightmares and violence that insidiously place themselves over our subconscious fears, but in a fun way. Terrifying, but funny. I can see here the beginnings of Wormwood.","Product came with very heavy / prominent creases and one small tear in a page. However, that still made it no less enjoyable as a story - which is unbelievably fantastic i might add - a testament to Mr. Templesmith's ingenuity and to his mastery of freshly crafted ideas. I actually can't remember where the tear was - very small and i fixed with some tape. This sort of thing would usually bug someone as finicky as me but the art/ story really makes up for that. I would really recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Mr. Templesmith or of works of the post - apocalyptic genre.","If you want an idea of Singularity 7, think of the liner artwork from a third-tier industrial band combined with the writing of an angsty teenage aspiring novelist, and you'd be in the right ballpark. This is not to say that Templesmith's art is without some technical ability; it's more to say that it's painfully unoriginal, and the melty surrealist style serves to neuter what little action is available in the book, leaving mounds of mushy exposition to carry the plot.A much better version of a very similar basic story can be found in Snikt, the post-apocalyptic Wolverine story by Tsutomu Nihei, for those in desperate need of a moody, nanotech apocalypse story in graphic novel form."],

      "reviews.text":["\"No Blade of Grass\" stands out from most post-apocolyptic or \"survival\" scifi in that the disaster that starts things off is not the predictable nuclear war or the occasional asteroid hit, but rather an environmental disaster. The first portion of the book, in which various characters sit by and swallow whole the lies being fed them by their government and the media about an innocuous virus that is killing all the rice in China, feels chillingly realistic and all too possible. Although written in 1956, one imagines that the response of modern governments to a similar situation today would be little different. The second half of the book, in which the main characters endeavor to save themselves by making a cross-country trek to a safe haven, focuses on what one individual, particularly a parent, would do under such dire circumstances to survive. The novel is saved from falling into predictability through strong writing and believable characters that kept me turning the pages until the very end.","The idea behind this book is fascinating: how does one country handle a food crisis caused by a virus (in this case the country is China & the virus destroys rice crops)? If & when the virus spreads throughout the world, destroying all grasses & grains, would civilazation survive, or would societies revert back to Middle - Ages brutality?While I do agree with john Christopher that civilazation will not last very long under these conditions, but I don't gree with his black & white attitude toards the events occuring after civlazation breaks down & each man is out to save himself, & maybe the few people close to him.","This is now out of print: cheap paperback editions from the 60's are now selling for forty or fifty bucks. Most of John Christopher's stuff (actual name: Samuel Youd) is for pre-teens, but this novel is for adults -- though it is a short one.This book manages to be both gripping and depressing, but it's not without its problems:1. It seems to take forever to get started.2. I would say that characterization in this novel is a minus. Christopher throws too many characters at you too fast. Since he doesn't bother to distinguish them much, it's a bit hard to tell them apart until the middle of the novel. But once the middle of the novel hits, even more come along.The one thing I liked about this novel was that our heroes, in an attempt to survive, resort to murdering innocent people using an \"either us or them\" philosophy. Since you don't see that very often in the post-Apocalyptic genre, I would recommend it in that respect.","The basic idea of this young adult story is really interesting. A mutant virus has appeared, but it only affects certain plants, not humans or animals. \"Well, that doesn't sound so bad,\" you say? Wrong! The virus destroys all grasses and grains. This not only means brown lawns in the suburbs, but also leads to a total lack of food for cattle and other livestock. Furthermore, it entails a similarly utter lack of wheat and grain, for humans. Within a year, terrible famine spreads throughout the world. Civilization collapses. The few scared, skinny survivors who remain huddle together in isolated valleys, growing rare virus-resistant potatos for food, and fighting off bands of marauding scavengers.The premise of this story is really intriguing and provocative. However, as usual, John Christopher is too preoccupied with creating extremely brutal, murderous, unnecessarily tough-guy characters. He did this in the Tripod Trilogy, he did it in \"The Long Winter,\" and he does it again here. I personally think that characters like this seem to take up residence in a reader's unconscious mind. For literally years to come, they can provide a feeling of justification for all kinds of mean, evil behavior. Why not write about people who make things work out? Why not focus on the good? Or at least, why not write about the scientific elements of this virus, and a scientific struggle to cure it?If you'd like to read some nonfiction about this kind of scenario, I'd like to recommend \"Catastrophe: An Investigation into the Origins of Modern Civilization,\" by David Keys. That book is about similarly widespread famines, and struggles which the author believes may have taken place during the medieval period. Or, you might wish to read \"The New Nuclear Danger,\" by Dr. Helen Caldicott. Anyway, \"No Blade of Grass\" is interesting in a way, but it has too much negativity. One thumb partly up.","I am a big fan of post apocolypse and alternative future fiction, and as this is a somewhat different type of disaster, I pounced on it with eager anticipation. The plot has been covered quite well by other writers here - death to all forms of grass and the chaos that ensues, so I won't add to this in any detail.What I will voice is my disappointment in the book. What I like about this genre of fiction is that it tends to show people surviving under the worst conditions that can be thrown at them, and to a degree this is no different. However, what we do have in this story is a group of essentially decent people descending into barbarism, and whereas this is in all probability entirely what would happen, it doesn't necessarily make for an entertaining read. My preference is for the characters to step up to the unthinkable challenges and become better people in themselves.Added to a relatively weak plot line, these unpleasant characters make for a disappointing novel. It is an interesting enough book, for its rarity and unusual take on the \"end of the world as we know it\", but it's definitely not among the best.","This was and is a great book, and needs to be made available again.A post apocalypse classic.Doc","Christopher has done a good job with this format of science fiction. This novel rates up there with Lucifer's Hammer by Niven. Although it is out of print, try to find it. You'll be glad you did. By the way, could it happen? Hmmm.....","Although quite old (first published in 1956) and not very long (barely two hundred pages), this is a very good \"post-apocalyptic\" novel, which didn't age much and still packs an impressive punch. As the title indicates, the story develops in a time when a deadly virus decimates all kinds of grass on the whole planet - and that includes all the main crops... This causes a worldwide collapse of modern society and this book describes those times in Great Britain, on the example of tribulations of a group of people gathered around an architect named John Custance. The small band travelling through the country to find a safe refuge includes Custance's friend Roger Buckley (a civil servant), a certain Harold Pirrie (a somehow aged gun shop owner - a particularly interesting and important character) and their families.The story of their trek through a country where all civil order quickly collapses is an excellent study on the fragility of complex and advanced societies when the situation forces people to focus on the most basic priority - physical survival of themselves and their families, at all price, in an extremely hostile environment, in which every error, hesitation and/or weakness means a horrible death. All involved will find in themselves surprising ressources and will do - finally quite easily - things they wouldn't even believe possible barely a week before. The transformation of John Custance and his small tribe during this voyage is almost incredible and the way it is described constitutes the reason why this book didn't really age. I believe \"No blade of grass\" will be still as relevant and interesting in AD 2056 (one hundred years after its first publication) as it is today...I do not want to provide too much SPOILERS, but be warned, that this is a very tough book and it can particularly shock women - and especially for any feminist the reading of some of the pages can be life threatening, as in this new horribly barbaric world strong and violent men exerce an almost total power... The ending is extremely sad and shocking, but also very clever and highly symbolic, clearly inspired by some of the most ancient myths, like the foundation of Rome and the Arthurian legends (sovereignty of a warlord being confirmed and sanctified by the receiving of a \"magic\" weapon).","John Christopher was one of a small band of British Sci-Fi writers writing in the 1950s and 1960s who delighted in destroying civilisation in an amazing array of natural and unnatural ways. The results are future dystopias that have given us some true classics: The Day of the Triffids by John Wyndham for instance.This work is not as well known as the Triffids, but in this genre, I think it really should be. this is no formulaic treatment of the subject, but rather was an original, intelligen and thoughtful story set in a world in which grasses are wiped out by disease. Without grasses we lose cereals (when I read this first as a teenager, it was news to me that cereals including Maize are grasses!). Without cereals and grazing land, the food crisis quickly becomes acute.The story focuses on two brothers - well one of them in particular, and his fight to survive and make a new life for himself as society quickly disintegrates. John Christopher writes it well, and I think this may well be his best work (I have read them all).I first read this as a teenager, and I was deeply affected by this book. Definitely a moving story designed to make you think. Throughly recommended. Personally I think its better than Day of the Triffids. Even if you disagree, you ought to enjoy it.","This was a little bit of a slow starter but once I could see where things were heading every sentence was laden with a sense of dread and impending doom.A widow leaves a dreary London behind and returns to her girlhood home along with her sons. She is anxious to reunite and repair her strained relationship with her dad and share the joy of a hillside surrounded by lush green pasture with her boys.25 years later John has taken to life in the city and fathered two children; David has devoted his life to the farm and remained a bachelor. All seems idyllic but then they start speaking of the rabbit plagues in Australia and a virus attacking rice crops in Hong Kong and millions starving and resorting to cannibalism. When David removes a patch of pesky rice grass and discovers it is diseased things start to take on bleak outlook and he tells John to return to the farm before things get desperate. John returns to his life in the city unwisely waiting far too long as things begin to take a turn towards the bleak.Thus begins a nicely detailed onset of the apocalypse and a tale of greed, morality and the breakdown of civilization. The most disturbing thing about this story was just how quickly the darker instincts bubbled to the surface of the characters when they were faced with their own mortality and forced to protect those they loved.This book focuses strongly on the breakdown of society and it is effectively chilling in its portrayal of the desperation for all involved. It truly is survival of the fittest and gets pretty brutal, pretty quickly. Our stubborn city boy is now on a road trip through hell with his young family and some friends, picking up guns and stragglers to strengthen their numbers and attempt to find safe haven. But, really, will anywhere be safe?This was very disturbing read considering the background for this apocalypse, that it affects major food systems and that when the story takes place half the food consumed was imported from other countries. It would be so simple to have a food breakdown nowadays. How many of us are even somewhat self-sufficient? Where would we begin?Some of the most blood chilling quotes for me:\"Things will be hard, but it may not be a bad life. It will be up to us what we make of it. At least, we shall be our masters. It will no longer be a matter of living on the sufferance of a State that cheats and bullies and swindles its citizens and, at last, when they become a burden, murders them.\"\"The country's food position is desperate. No more grain, meat, foodstuffs of any kind, are being sent from overseas. We have nothing to eat but what we can grow out of our own soil, or fish from our own coasts.\"Shudder, I don't want to ponder on this too long when I should be building my chicken coop out back!","Interesting...but not what I was expecting at all, considering the premise of the book. I thought the book would be more about the circumstances that led to the premise of the story than that 85% of the book was the group traveling from London to the farm and the situations they came across along the way. And I didn't really get the end....A good read, a good story, and definitely a classic.","Interesting book. A world-wide crop disease starves most of the world causing widespread famine and the associated breakdown in law and orders.A small band makes their way from London to a safe place in the country.It didn't go as far as I would have liked; it never showed them dealing with the challenges of maintaining their refuge.I would recommend it.John Severson","NBOG has always been one of my favorite apcoalypse books, combining a fast moving plot with well defined characters and thought-provoking questions.Like most post-apocalyptic novels, No Blade of Grass ostensibly focuses on the effects of, in this case, an ecological holocaust, on the lives of a small band of survivors in post-apocalypse Britain. The tale turns on what these survivors must do to reach \"safety\" on a small farm in a protected valley far from urban centers. In this, the book differs quite dramatically from much of the rest of this genre. Rather than dwelling on the problems faced when the world's population is decimated, NBOG poses the much more interesting question: What happens when most of the food supply is destroyed while most of the population remains? Christopher's answers will provoke, even anger you. But, whatever your response, the situations he poses must be taken seriously.This is a book well worth reading together with Earth Abides or Lucifer's Hammer. Though both books take the more conventional route of killing off 99% of the world's population (the first by disease the second by a meteor), they deal with similar questions regarding civilization yet come to different answers. For my money, while NBOG's answers are the most distasteful, they are also the most realistic.","John Christopher writes some pretty gripping science fiction novels about alien invasions (The Tripod trilogy) catastrophic shifts in the earth's weather (The Long Winter) and terrifying tales of the savagery that humans revert to when civilization breaks down (A Wrinkle In The Skin)-- potent stuff indeed. His books share with JG BALLARD a fascination for post-apocalyptic settings but are really psychological character studies about how people change to fit their environments. This book is perhaps Christopher at his starkest and most frightening. A man simply tries to take his family safely out of London to his brother's farm in the North after a genetically engineered bio-weapon gets out of control and wipes out the world's food supply, causing anarchy and chaos to erupt all over the globe.It is interesting to note that on the page the protagonist's actions and \"him or me\" ethos seem to make much more sense than they do in Cornel Wilde's gonzo 1970 film adaptaion, where the main character comes off as much more trigger-happy and casually lethal & ruthless than in the novel; one might say its only a matter of degree once the civilized world has crumbled but that doesn't make it any more palatable. Sounds like a bad review, doesn't it? On the contrary, today almost all of John Christopher's nightmare scenarios seem only a few CNN headlines away...and thus more compelling than ever.","Most apocalyptic novels are marked by spectacular explosions, loathesome invaders, or the like. This one is not. Instead, in a very believable scenario, a rice virus develops in China, and the Chinese government tries to keep it secret. However, when the great famine develops, the UN comes up with an isotope that stops it. But the cure is worse than the disease, for this allows an all encompassing grass virus to come out of hiding.What follows is a civilization ending virus that kills all grasses, including all food grains. So, in one swoop, livestock and grain are gone. The Eastern hemisphere descends into famine and cannibalism. In England, the site of the story, the government decides to use H-Bombs on the cities to alleviate the famine. All well and good, and frighteningly believable.But what isn't at all credible, and what detracts from the book is the tale of a few people who go into a small, secluded English valley to live on potatoes and root crops. Except for a brief foray, the group faces no meaningful attack, and the book ends with the Western Hemisphere intact, and the valley's few survivors planning to build new cities. The ending is a sop to the desire to give some hope where none would exist. Personally, I much prefer George Stewart's much more honest approach in &quot;Earth Abides.&quot;","It's been years since I read &quot;No Blade of Grass.&quot; It's a story that should not go out of print, but has. It has the same haunting quality as &quot;On The Beach,&quot; or &quot;Alas Babylon.&quot; They depicted a world following a nuclear war, with differing results. This story uses a grass blight to achieve basically the same result, a world-wide disaster that presages the end of civilization as we know it.The story itself takes place in England, and portrays the events following the destruction of all grass species by disease, including grains, with the resultant loss of grazing animals and looming human starvation.The main story is the human reactions that follow--how the characters cope with the situation, and how they react and are changed by the anarchy that results. The story promotes thought about how much we rely on external controls in our daily life, and the necessity of individual internal control in our everyday struggle for existence, especially in such dramatic life-threatening situations.A good book, if you can find a copy.Joseph Pierre","No Blade of Grass is even more timely today than when it was written. The plotline is familiar. It shows a very dark view of ordinary people trying to cope with the end of the world. That is well-done but it is the fact that the collapse of civilization is not from nuclear war or such but from a simple virus. The virus kills all members of the grass family. When you consider how many major food crops would be affected and then the domino effect of the loss of feed for animals, you are reminded of how truly vulnerable life on earth is and how easily the balance can be upset. I don't know if John Christopher was being prophetic or simply wanted a different sort of disaster for background, but with today's concerns about viruses, the book is chillingly real.","A chilling study of the start of a new Dark Ages, written in a John Wyndham style. John Christopher's excellent novel charts the fall of the human race into barbarism after a disease wipes out all grass crops. Powerful and unfortunately all too believable. Track down this book and read - it will haunt you for ages after.","The novel is as brilliant as ever and shares an important place in speculative fiction despite its frequent imitators. This is the book that defined Christopher's reputation for creating believable characters and placing them in precarious situations to the pleasure of the reading public. FIND THIS NOVEL and set it alongside the Tripod Trilogy. You won't find that damned movie, this I can tell you.","No Blade of Grass is story of an agricultural experiment gone totally awry. It attacks all grain like produce(oats, wheat, alphalfa, etc)and kills them without mercy. When the worlds best can't stop it and panic across the world becomes the norm. The story ends up following a group of people who join together to reach a farm in Ireland that grows potatoes, one of the crops not affected by the grass killer. I highly recomend this story for anyone who likes good scifi and human conflict tales. I read this book when I was freshman in high school at the behest of my father. And though I resisted at first I grew to like this book as I contiued to read it. This is a book no personal library should be without,","This was published in the USA as No Blade of Grass, but was originally published in the UK as The Death of Grass. An absolutely awful movie, titled No Blade of Grass, was made in the US and did not do well here, nor did it deserve to.It was classed as juvenile fiction or Young Adult Sci Fi here in the US and was never considered a classic or a must-read. A few forward-thinking teachers once had it on their reading lists for teens or used it as an alternate in the middle school grades in the 170s and 80s, ie: the kids could choose between this and other, more mainstream fiction.It is an excellent book, with a believable plot and chillingly accurate details; psycholgical profiles of most characters, for the most part, do not seem intusive, but naturally part of the narrative. These people and their thought proceeses and behaviors, given their circumstances, seem real and unforced.Though, near the end, the rather broad strokes he paints a few characters with---notably the large, stodgy family who are hangers- on, not leaders and who are not cut out for this new world, where people survive by wit and skill---stand out badly in contrast to the rest. A little preachy there, I thought.Why it is that this book has not been reprinted or made more easily available to all readers, regardless of age, I will never understand. I did read somewhere that the author, who writes here under the pseudonym of John Christopher, had stated, long after its first publishing in the UK, that he did not wish it to be reprinted (but as he does not own the full international copyright, I am not sure if that alone is enough to prevent it). The author's real name was Christopher Youd. [...]Unlike On The Beach, which was published in the same vein and time period, it begins not with a devasting man-made accident, but an event completely natural and more realistic---a disease affects all the graminae--grass---plants.Sounds simple, right? But as the disease organism naturally fights to survive, it mutates, as do many naturally occuring molds and viruses now. Man unintentionally worsens the advancing disease, as they interfere with and ultimately strengthen a strain they hadn't known existed, until its dormant version rears its ugly head.It reminded me a bit of the current medical and scientific problems we face, one example being MRSA vs the current roster of antibiotics. If that nasty little bug ever gets out of control, we'll all need our own happy valley to retreat to.","I found this book at the library. I had heard of it. My father told me it was published as a serialized novel in the Saturday Evening Post when he was a teenager, which caused a lot of controversy. Many people found the novel upsetting. Though somewhat tame by today's standards it is still a potent look at civilization crumbling after a plague wipes out all grass, wheat, oats, and other plants destroying most of the world's food supply. It is great in showing how quickly civilized people very well could resort to violence once civilization no longer exists. The characters and well drawn and intriguing, especially the gun expert. I recommend it."],

They find a lush planet inhabited by a civilization far more advanced than their own, waging a seemingly endless war against a constantly evolving enemy. The Sorans call the pair of them the “Earthborn” and they’re welcomed as heroes, almost as gods. To an audience of billions, they swear an oath to avenge their fallen planet by aiding the Sorans in their war against Xala. But soon Lucas and Asha find Sora just as dangerous as apocalyptic Earth when they’re targeted by the Fourth Order, a rebel collective who decries them as false prophets and harbingers of further bloodshed. Their friend and turncoat Xalan scientist Alpha believes he’s located someone who can help them turn the tide of the war for good, stranded on a conquered colony planet. But landing on the new world, Lucas and Asha find themselves hunted by a violent, mysterious beast, known only as the Desecrator, let loose by the Xalans. Escaping Earth was only the beginning. As Lucas and Asha quickly learn, the universe has worlds and creatures far more dangerous than anything their home planet could have offered, and their continued survival hinges on gaining new allies they never could have imagined.

      "reviews.text":["Earthborn is the story the desendents of those left behind when Colony, the giant mother ship went searching for a new place for mankind 300 years ago. It is a companion book to Skyborn....the story of those raised on the ship before it crashed back to Earth. The charactors and stories intertwine. I read Skyborn first. There are some nice elements of leadership, primate anthropology and civilization gone bad. The Australian setting was interesting. They are simple good reading...bedtime stuff.","Earthborn is one of the more disappointing reads I've had in years. I was attracted to it by the cover art by Jon Foster and by the synopsis written inside the jacket. Unfortunately, the jacket synopsis turned out to be better written than the book.The premise was intruiging enough: a multi-generation interstellar colony ship destined for Tau Ceti ends up instead torn by internal conflict and returning to a post-apocalyptic Earth, and conflict ensues between the imperialist/fascist high-tech Skyborn and the survivalist low-tech Earthborn, with all of the main characters kids due to vaguely described afflictions affecting both societies. But the novel itself is plagued with even worse afflictions: (1) The characters never rise above anything but sketches, with so little description you never have any clear idea of their appearance and with so little identity you don't feel anything when bad things happen to them. In most of the novel they seldom come across as anything but talking heads. (2) The setting is generic throughout, from the generic colony ship to the generic post-apocalyptic cityscape. For a story that's supposed to be set in a post-apocalypic Melbourne, Australia, the details are so sketchy and generic that it could be any low-budget sci-fi movie set anywhere in the world. And worst of all (3) The prose style is passive and distancing, with the author always telling instead of showing, making for a very dull read. The following excerpt is typical:\"Sarah swung down with a piece of timber and drove another stake into the ground. She knew that the ninety-yard-high mountain ash forests with the understory of blackwood and tree ferns provided decent cover from Colony craft, but even at this early stage, she was planning to outmaneuver Colony. She had no delusions about ever conquering the Skyborn, but maybe, just maybe, she could discourage them. Even now she realized that time was her enemy.\"This is pretty much how the whole novel reads, and the further it goes, the worse it gets. After about halfway through I has having to force myself to keep reading, and I was even more annoyed at the end (after a confusing strung-out fight where half the characters die but you don't feel anything because they were never more than sketches) to find that the story is not complete at the end because this is only the first book in a series, a series I have no interest whatsoever in continuing.If you're looking for something good in similar veins, I would recommend Heinlein's Orphans in the Sky (for the divided multi-gen colony ship), Wyndham's The Chrysalids (for the post-apocalyptic society) or even the \"Miri\" episode of the original Star Trek TV series (for the kids plague that kills you when you reach adulthood). As for Earthborn, I could only recommend it to younger readers who haven't read much science-fiction and who aren't very demanding about what they read in general. For anyone else, don't waste your time or your money.","Three hundred years ago, the Colony starship was launched to colonize the world of Tau Celi but when they arrived, there was no habitable world to colonize. Some of the passengers felt they should continue but those who wanted to return home took command of the ship. They land on what used to be Melbourne and plan to commit genocide on the genetically inferior humans that survived.Welkin Quinn is one of the first groups of Skyborn sent out to reconnoiter the area and he falls in with a clan of Earthborn who want to unite the people into a cohesive group so they can do more than survive. Welkin learns that the Skyborn have fed him misinformation and throws in his lot with Sarah and her group. Enemies surround them from the Skyborn to the barely human ferals to the roaming gangs of jabbers who work with the Skyborn to destroy the Earthborn.This is Paul Collin's first book published in the United States and it is easy to see why this Australian author is a hit back home. The story line is fast paced but does not skimp on character development. The hero learns that his ship's elders had an agenda to stay in power when they got to earth. He inserts himself into a group of Earthborn survivors that have a chance of uniting the various disease free factions on Earth if they can figure out a way of appropiating technology only available on the Colony. This is the first installment in what looks to be a great new seriesHarriet Klausner","Wish it had been better. The book seemed to lack detail and had a certain, I dont know, \"fakeness\" to it. Of course it is Science Fiction, but I just couldn't find the characters believable. I think the author should have devoted a few more pages on character development and back story. I thought the beginning went too fast and could have provided more depth to the fanaticism of the Skyborn and their mysterious past. An okay read, but I found myself struggling to finish instead of anticipating the next read. Hopefully, the sequel will be better.","An award-winning Australian writer, Paul Collins makes his North American debut with \"The Earthborn\". Though Collins is best known for his action sequences, his creation of unique and believable societies along with the character development of the protagonist Welkin Quinn make \"The Earthborn\" a work that will be enjoyed on a number of levels.Born aboard the terra-forming skyworld `Colony', Welkin Quinn is raised in the militaristic culture of the Skyborn. As this society prepares for its return to earth, its leaders--an order of elders--brainwash the people of `Colony', using misinformation to ingrain a hatred of the Earthborn and a fear of the Skyborn's homeworld, Earth. Using these emotions, the elders plan to commit genocide.When Welkin is falsely labeled as a seditionist, he is tortured and threatened. He is told that his only opportunity for redemption is to prove his loyalty by serving as a member of the Skyborn expeditionary force--an assignment where fewer than half of the Skyborn expect to survive. When his group is attacked by a viscous pack of Earthborn predators--the Jabbers--Welkin is rescued by an Earthborn woman named Sarah. Sarah leads a band of noble Earthborn, a makeshift family of sorts. Her family struggles for survival in post-apocalyptic Melbourn, a landscape populated by rival gangs who engage in turf-wars for precious commodities of food and medicine.Placed in an unfamiliar and hostile environment, Welkin Quinn is forced to think for himself--forced to confront the worldview with which he has been indoctrinated since birth. His revelation leads him down the path where friend and foe, right and wrong seem terribly reversed. To survive, Welkin must confront the society that created him and discover his place in a new world.The story of Welkin and his newfound family continues in Collins' recently released novel \"The Skyborn\" (2005), and the soon-to-be-released conclusion to the trilogy: \"The Hiveborn\" (Fall 2006).","&quot;Move over Ebola -- the cesspool of life has a new Supervirus&quot; --Glyn Parry&quot;Far-future adventure and excitment, science fiction as it ought to be&quot; -- Sean McMullen&quot; ... worthy of sitting on the same shelf with early Heinlein and Norton&quot; -- Don D'Ammassa, SF Chronicle 2003"],

      "reviews.text":["Originally released in 1952 under the name \"Star Man's Son\" this story is set in a post-atomic war future. While that may seem cliche, at the time it was quite original. The story focuses on Fors, who lives in a remote mountain village. As the story opens, Fors is passed over for the postion of \"Star Man\" - a man who goes out into the wilderness in search of ancient technology for the village. Fors blames this on the fact that his mother came from a tribe outside the village.Fors decides to abondon his village and sets out for the wilderness anyway, accompanied by Lura - his hunting cat companion. On his journies he encounters various other tribes, mutated wildlife and ruins of the past civilization.Although one of the main messages of the book - an apocalyptic nuclear war is a bad idea - seems obvious now, it is still an enjoyable story. I think the strength of the book is that the focus is kept tightly on Fors. The book does attempt to provide a post-war history, delve into a scientific mistery or reveal a complex political stuggle. Instead it revolves around Fors' desire to vindicate his father's belief in a large undiscovered ruined city, his desire to prove himself to his village, and struggle to warn his village of the growing threat of the \"beast-things\" that live in the ruins. Because the book centers around the protagonist's individual struggles, it does not seem dated in the way that a more technologically focused book would have. The post-war world is revealed enough to keep it intersting, but not so much as to be tiresome.This is a fairly simple sci-fi novel, that younger readers will enjoy. Despite that it does end with some ambiguity. While Fors may experience a personal triumph, what are we to make of the fact that the humans can only be united by a common enemy?","Unfortunately, the author passed away last year. Fortunately, she had time to write a good number of novels. This one, written in the fifties, is a more than average post-apocalyptic novel.It is the story of a mutant who doesn't feel at home in his tribe. One of the early X-Men :).Even if you can read it in a matter of hours, you will find that Andre Norton had plenty to say about the actual world men lives in and not so much about the nuclear war that happened, which is fine by me. The trip of Fors in one of the ruined city and his encounter with the Beast things is very gripping.Usually, I resell the books I read. I am keeping this one.","It has been almost 200 years since the global destruction wrought by nuclear war. The tools of man's technology lie rusting alongside broken roads between ruined cities. In the mountains, the descendants of people who were training to colonize other worlds when war broke out, struggle to survive.After decades of isolation, members of the tribe who have earned the title \"Star Man\" have ventured back into the lowlands. While trained in combat, they are not warriors. They are seekers of lost knowledge, consecrated to the task of recovering their past.Andre Norton's book \"Daybreak: 2250 A. D., originally titled \"Star Man's Son,\" foretells a cautionary tale of the future, one in which humans still have not learned the lessons of the past. The tribe known as The Eyrie are the descendants of scientists and engineers who were sent into the mountains to prepare for life on other worlds. When the affairs of man turned critical, their mission of discovery became a quest for survival.Wary of radiation-induced genetic mutation, the tribe in those first few years took drastic steps to maintain the purity of the human race. In their fear, the Eyrie have isolated and even killed those with characteristics that drift from the norm of humanity. That fear became, over time, a cultural prejudice against anyone who came from the lowlands.Onto this stage steps a young man named Fors. He is the son of an honored explorer, a Star Man, who took to wife a woman of one of the Plains tribes. That union bequeathed to the son hair of silver, the visible flag of mutation. Ostracized by his tribe, he has been denied the honor of following in his father's footsteps.After a youth filled with rejection and bitter prejudice, climaxed by the loss of his last opportunity to be a Star Man, Fors leaves the mountain stronghold of his people and sets out alone on a trail that will change the history of not only his tribe, but all that remains of the human race.Through the eyes of Fors we are given a fascinating glimpse of a post-apocalyptic world; the remains of the last great war of technology. In this world, the survivors of the human race have separated into tribes, each jealously guarding a swath of territory. Relationships between the tribes are bound in suspicion and conflict, but all share a mutual fear of the dwellers of the urban ruins, a human-rat hybrid known as the Beast Things.All of the human tribes have striven to turn their backs on those characteristics which drove the Old Ones to war and destruction. But Norton makes it clear that suspicion and hate, and the inevitable conflict arising from them is an irrefutable part of the human make-up and despite the naive desire for \"world peace,\" it would seem that humans will always reach first for the spear. The climax of the book, when the tribes gather for one last great battle against each other, becomes the moment when Fors steps forward and restores peace. He reminds all present that everyone faces a common enemy in the Beast Things and if humanity is to survive, that they must all band together in mutual support, or by choosing to exterminate each other, leave the planet to the Beast Things.In the ruined cities, we see in the buildings, the towering monuments to man's creativity. Yet, we are forced to come to grips with the truth that even in the face of a terrible lesson, we would still run the risk of destroying our each other. In the conflict between the tribes, we are challenged to rise above our primitive instincts and choose survival. In the travels of Fors, we find our own restless desires to go beyond the horizon; to seek knowledge of distant lands and unknown peoples. And through Fors' experiences, we discover that we can choose friendship; we can choose life; we can choose peace.There few problems with this story, the most pronounced being that it would be virtually impossible for a genetic mutation such as the Beast Things to rise to such an advanced level in less than 200 years. Perhaps 2000 years, but then there would be precious little evidence of the Old Ones left for exploration. The dialogue is pure Tolkien, and at times almost descends into Iambic Pentameter. Despite the stilted language, however, the story is clearly and descriptively told. The descriptions of landscapes and cities tantalizes the reader to consult a road atlas to identify the land where Fors traveled. The description of the big city on the Great Lake that Fors discovers sounds suspiciously like Chicago or Buffalo.At 191 pages, it is a short read, but an intense one. The book moves along rapidly from start to finish and Norton has taken the reader along for the breathless journey.Norton crafted a tale that is part Star Wars, Terminator 3, and Lord of the Rings, although its publishing date, 1952, predates all three. If you enjoyed Tolkien and Lucas, and you feel the hope that the best parts of humankind can always survive and arise from an apocalyptic future, then this book is for you.(A respectful attempt at a sequel: http://starmanssaga.blogspot.com/)","This is a book i read many years ago in middlw school and wanted to get a copy for my son whiole he was in middle school. What a great find and it was in great condition. Thanks.","Saw this in the amazon books available. Read it in High School, and had to read it again. A great read, not as techy as newer sci-fi. Good book.","Alright, most sci-fi fans have seen all the post-apocalyptic movies and played the video games, so seeing or reading about ruined cities is nothing new anymore. This tale though was a real trail-blazer, being written just after the birth of the atomic age. The stories central protagonist (Fors) is believable and deep enough to connect with. The strongest attribute of Daybreak is Norton's vivid and living descriptions of the ruined world of the future. One really gets the feeling that they are seeing the ruined planet through the eyes of the young mutant. I have read this novel about a half a dozen times now and each time I get lost in the descriptions.This is a simple read that is a lot of fun, check it out!","Have not had time to read the book yet. It was an Andre Norton book that I read as a teenager and it must have left a good feeling about it because I had to have it to read again"],

      "reviews.text":["As adolescent fantasy and post-holocaust stories go, it's pretty good. Be warned, however: the tone of this book (or collection of three books, each with its own protagonist) is almost relentlessly grim and tragic, as befits a setting that arises from a civilization-ending Blast. You can't have what you want - it will always be out of reach, taken from you, or turn out to be not what you wanted after all. Characters are often forced or manipulated into things they don't want to do by their personal honor. One character, who represents innocence and simple enjoyment of the pleasures of the barbarian life, comes to a bad end because of the designs of others; like Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet, most of the remaining joy in the story dies with him.Anthony's usual sexism is present, though arguably appropriate in a barbarian society; most of the women are chattel, to be won or lost in the dueling circle, and don't even have names of their own (instead taking a derivative of the name of the man who's won them, as do the children he fathers).If you're into watching a succession of men struggle against their fate, in pursuit of goals that turn to ashes in their grasp, read this book.","(from my son:) I am 10 and reading BattleCircle. in school i read this EVERY MINUTE its the best book i have read. People say it looks awful, I simply say \"Dont judge a book by it's cover\". i recommend this to ANYONE. (But i have the old book cover which looks kind of cheesy.)","I found this an amazing treatise on the value of a society based on honor. Two men, one circle. All decisions were final. Any dispute settled, any argument quelled. And then the novellas grow from there. Very often, one reads a book, but never actually feels anything for the characters involved. Sos changes all of that. Quite simply, the most amazing piece of literature I've read by Piers Anthony or any other author.","Battle Circle, by Piers Anthony, is an excellent story that I would recommend to anyone who follows the fantasy or S/F genre. When I began reading the story I read it as a Fantasy book. However, Anthony does an excellent job at swinging the readers vision of the world described from a fantasy to a S/F world. An excellent blend of the two genres. The three part layout also works well as each can be read as an individual story. I would recommend this and love reading it over again.","This book is extreamly entertaining, a real page turner. I would recomend this book for any fantasy or science fiction reader. If you've never read a post apocolypic type book, this is the book you want to read. It has everything: Love, courage, honor, etc.","I first read this collection of novels about ten years ago and immediately went out to buy the book for myself. Since then, I have read it several times and have been continuously pulled in by its alluring nature and by its own truth about a very imaginable post-apocalyptic age. Unfortunately I have lost the book through its many travels and now I have to have Amazon get me a copy!!! One of the most interesting books I have ever read... Bravo Mr. Anthony!","This was one of the first books that got me into reading again. I was taken by the scope and imagination of the book. It painted a very bleak world, but at the same time left me with the sense of hope, of the triumph of the human will and ingenuity. This book truely had it all, action, humor, romance, drama, a marvelous work. I commend Anthony.","I've read this book several times over the years, and it remains my favorite story of post-apocalyptic survival! It is very much worth the time and money required to find a copy!","This is a great book, about the courage of 3 men. There are romantic parts, funny parts, sad parts, and more. This is a definite must! This is one of the best books I have ever read!","This is one book I've read over and over again. Piers Anthony creates a world so full of detail that all the characters jump from the pages. If you have a copy you don't want, let me know!","This is one of those books that is not apealing based on its cover. Once you get into the second chapter you will not be able to put it down.","If you are into post-apocalyptic America, this is the book for you! When I read this in 1984,it started me on what has turned out to be a lifelong passion for Sci-Fi of this type.A must read for Sci-Fi fans..get the book, you'll enjoy it!","I was hooked 2 pages into the book. It is a fasinating story about the future, of earth. It has very interesting characters, that make you feel like your in the book. I am Not in the least dissapointed. Piers Anthony at his best.","written back when piers anthony still realised he needed real plots and characters -- proved he actually had some writing skills before the moronic output of xanth. good, solid if not particulary thoughtful post-apocalypse stuff","I've read this trilogy many times, starting back in the early eighties.

It's an intriguing three part story you wont be able to put down. The charictures are so indepth that you will want to cry for them. It's shocking and provacative. it stirs the imagination and leaves you wanting more. I hope this book becomes a movie someday.","The first two novellas, dealing with Sos the Rope and Var the Stick, are good reads. The third novella, which tells the story of Neq the Sword, takes the most appallingly stupid plot twist I've ever seen in a novel. Neq loses his hands and has a sword grafted directly to his arm. Kind of grotesque, but I could live with that a as a plot device. Not too many pages later, he has a glockenspiel superglued to the sword and becomes Neq the Glockenspiel. I flung the book across the room in disgust. The book is worth a look for the first two installments, but don't say you haven't been warned about the third.","I picked up Battle Circle purely on a name-recognition basis, and was rewarded for my faith. The three volumes of Battle Circle are some of the least lighthearted of Piers Anthony's work. Sos the Rope, Var the Stick, and Neq the Sword are parts of a very tragic and captivating story. Par for the course for Anthony, the characters deal not only with their own situations, but with the ethical considerations associated with their actions and others'. For this reason his heroes always command respect and those of the Battle Circle, while violent and largely illiterate, are no exception.","The time is the barbaric future and you have to take up a militant profession to survive and live well.Warriors, pick up a sword, a club or a rope and enter the Battle Circle to show your skills!This is one of Anthony's seldom-talked-about-book and difficult to find in bookshops (at least in Singapore and Malaysia)compared to some of his other titles. Hey, even amazon.com has only a used copy for sale!The trilogy trails the stories of Sos The Rope, Var The Stick and Neq The Sword (no prizes for guessing what weapons they use), with the tale turning from just another military fantasy type yarn, to post-Apocalypse sci-fi in an interesting manner.","Battle Circle incorporates the stories of SOS the rope, Var the stick, and Neq the sword: this is Piers Anthony work orginally published in the early 1970s.The stories of SOS, Var, and Neq are based in a barbaric world (possibly america), where honour rules supreme, and disagreements are sorted by challenge and battle in the &quot;circle&quot;. Each story is vastly entertaining and follows the trials and tribulations of each man fulfilling his destiny and dream/s.An avid Piers Anthony fan, I believe that this novel is one of his best works and so was surprised that only used books are available for this novel!Piers Anthony's Battle Circle is original, thought provoking, and evokes emotional interest/empathy with each character (which is something worth mentioning: a truly good author is hard to come by these days!).In three words, I believe you will find this book: a timeless &quot;keeper&quot;.","Battle Circle is a trilogy of Books - Sos the Rope, Var the stick and Neq the sword, available as a set in one volume. The story follows the life of a wandering warrior in a land of nomadic fighting tribes, and charts his adventures, and the changing fortunes of his empire. The book is perhapst he best work, and yet one of the least well known by this great author. The plot is watertight, and gripping, and the characters draw you into this wonderful work of storytelling. Excellent.","This is, without a dought, the most amazing piece of literature I have ever read. It is three books in one: Sos the rope, Var the sticks, and Neq the sword. Anthony intertwines them masterfully. He creates his own world that you will sucked into and accually start wishing our world was similar. The dimensions of this book are astounding. You will want to read it over and over","A very old series from Anthony, back from before he was rich and famous, but it's a very good series, one of the best he's written. I like it so much I've re-read it many times in the time I've owned it.First of all, a word of warning. This series is very dark and gory, it will make you wince. Since I first read it, I've become old and cynical and all the gore and treachery I read in it is no more than what I've seen in every day life, but it really bothered me when I first read it as a young lad, such as the dismemberments, the rapes and the tortures - there, does it shock you yet?Having said that, I think the impoverished Anthony poured his heart and soul into the book. What I like about this book and all of Anthony's good books is that he really invests his time in to the main characters, yes, he pours his heart and soul into writing them. They are fully fleshed and in our consciousness when we read them. Thus, I feel for Sos, or Sol of all weapons, or Var the stick. The characters stand out and up. And then Anthony discovered that the public would simply simper over light fantasy, and he poured his heart and soul into that. I don't think Anthony will ever write anything as good and as dark as Battle Circle. He is no longer hungry or impoverished. This series is a chapter in the life of Anthony pre-famous era and it's a gem.I won't say much about the plot as you can read that above. I will only say that your soul and your mind will be taken into a deep and dark journey into a sadistic post-Apocalyptic future if you choose to read this book, and it's a real treat.","Piers Anthony may be best known for his tongue in check Xanth series, and for his Adept and Incarnation books, but he also has written some excellent \"serious\" sci-fi and fantasy. This is one of there, ranking ver close to hisBio of a Space Tyrantbooks.I will not rehash what the other reviewers have covered so well, but let me just ad that this is a standout from my teenage reading days -- it made a big impression. If you are in the mood for a gritty, post-apocalyptic battle world where honor is everything, then this read should not dissappoint.","The first time I read this book I was about 12 years old and yes, I am a woman. I loved it and have read it a few more times since then. During the three stories the characters must master (or fail) tests of courage, skill, and strength. A must read for any fantasy fan.","This is really Piers Anthony's best book (although the Omnivore trilogy is great too.) A much different tone than his Xanth series. (Lacks the tongue in cheek playfulness that was fun for the first several Xanth books but began to cloy somewhere along the way.) A must read for Fantasy fans.","WHEN I FIRST READ THIS BOOK IN THE LATE 80'S I LOVED IT! I HAVE READ MANY FANTASY/SCIENCE FICTION BOOKS, AND THIS RANKS IN MY TOP 10. I HIGHLY RECOMEND IT."],

And the heathly humans are in danger from roaming bands of looters and killers, as food and water becomes more and more scarce.Can he learn to feed without killing? Can he learn to protect the humans he needs to live or will he give into his hunger?I think Kittredge is one of the most realistic vampires I have ever read about. He never pretends to be a good guy, he starts out doing what he does purely for selfish reasons. He doesn't want to be a Rock Star or a God or discover the secrets of the Universe - he just wants to live.And we don't know what will happen when the sun returns after the winter ends.","I bought \"Vampire Winter\" based on a recommendation in another reader's amazon.com list, and I do not regret it. Although VW is not as moving or as thought-provoking as \"I Am Legend\", my favorite vampire story, the post-apocalyptic setting does call that book to mind. VW is short (almost too short IMHO), the prose is spare, and the radiation science is a bit simplistic, but it's still a great little story. A vampire wakes up one evening to discover that humanity has just nuked the bejeebers out of itself. This isn't the beautiful, sexy, seductive vampire of Anita Blake's world. He's old, he's dangerous, and he enjoys the experience of killing the people upon whom he feeds. But as nuclear winter settles in, and isolated groups of humans struggle to survive the radioactive fallout, the vampire finds himself in the position of having to change his very nature in order to ensure his own survival over the long term.","I'm not sure how I feel about this book. Part vampire story and part gritty survivalist story, the author creates a skewed universe in which the reader comes to feel equal amounts of sympathy and antipathy for the characters.The protagonist, Blaine Kittredge (the one grating note in this story is the romance novel name for the vampire), is a vampire who likes killing and fear and madness. He comes to realize that not only must he stop killing in order to be able to survive after a nuclear holocaust, but he must help his prey survive, as well. They fear him but reluctantly depend upon him, as the line between enemies and allies continually shifts and changes, post-apocalypse.An interesting take on the vampire mythos, and worth a read.","Blaine Kittredge is a vampire who survives the dropping of a nuclear bomb (actually the dropping of nuclear bombs perhaps all over the world -- we never learn the full extent of the devastation). The symbiotic relationship that develops between Kittredge and the human survivors is pretty much the story of this book. And what a great story it is! I can't help thinking what a great movie it would make, as long as the makers kept strictly to the storyline and didn't twist and warp it out of recognition, e.g., have Kittredge fall in love or endow him with utterly fantastic supernatural capabilities. It is simply a really, really good vampire story and I highly recommend it.","no explantation is given for the vampires existance, is it viral or demonic or other? this vamp is capable of thought but unable to overcome the lust for blood....all in all a great read, a light read.","I am not sure if Lois Tilton was trying to be funny when she wrote this. But some of the things that Kittredge went through were hilarious. I was actually feeling sorry for him towards the end of the book. No one should have put up with so much. (Only a vampire could)I can not recommend this book enough. If only their could be a sequel, but I don't think Kittredge would survive it.","I bought this book new, hot off the presses. Since then I have given it away and repurchased it 4 times. Vampire Winter is a book that stands alone in concept and embraces the the vampire mythos without the tarnish that Ann Rice and her ilk sullied it with.VW blends the post apocalyptic genre seamlessly with a vampire story by setting the novel immediately after a series of nuclear blasts. As a huge fan of Rawles, Stirling, and anything post-collapse, VW satisfied me. Looters, radiation sickness, food shortages, small town solidarity, and the depths of human depravity...all there.Amidst the chaos, is our reluctant protagonist, vampire Blaine. After discovering that his sunless paradise will be a cold place without an uncontaminated food source, he sets out to save himself. Keeping people is difficult for everyone concerned, but but Blaine soon finds someone to take out his anger on. Blaine's interactions with the leader of the small town that he targets are delightfully psychological. I often don't know who to route for because Tilton never paints a single character in glowing, unrealistic terms.Overall, I can't recommend this book enough..I.am sad to be only the 10th reviewer.","LOVE this book. Read it many, many times growing up. Good depiction of a post-apocalyptic world as well. I miss the days when vampires were something to be feared, not something to jump into bed with.","I almost passed up this book because I thought the cover was cheesey. I'm glad I didn't. This is a great story!","First book I ever read about a vampire surviving world war 3 and having to protect humans so he has something to feed on. Outstanding!!!"],

      "reviews.text":["In an age where misinformation has spread to epidemic proportions, where the issues of peak oil and environmental collapse are addressed by the creation of hybrid SUVs, and where technology has quietly invaded and altered every aspect of human life, books like Extinction Journals are more important than ever. Despite all of today's problems (a looming conflict with Iran, celebrity antics, etc.), it's still possible to find hope for a solution. And yeah, constructing a cockroach suit to survive nuclear fallout isn't exactly a solution, but it does shed some light on the utter absurdity of our current dilemmas. As Dean, the novella's protagonist, says, \"One day you go to bed happy. The next day your dad dies. In a stupid, stupid way.\"Later, after Dean encounters a woman who also owes her life to insects, we eventually come to learn that as devastating as the planet's destruction might be, it doesn't have to be all misery and loneliness. Even when just about every living thing has been annihilated, there still exists a potential for new life. In this case, that new life might turn out to be far stranger than any Darwinist can conceive.A few have pointed out that Extinction Journals isn't perfect, and upon first reading, it did feel too rushed toward the end. After reading it again, this was far less of an issue. As is the case with many short novels, characters aren't always fully fleshed out, but the re-read demonstrated that this isn't necessarily detrimental to the book either.If you're looking for a fresh, freakishly funny read, look no further than Extinction Journals. Your inner insect won't regret it.","\"Extinction Journals\" is a hair raising journey through a post-apocalyptic United States.The narrator survives a nuclear holocaust with the help of an intricate cockroach suit he builds. Early on, he meets the president of the United States, an idiot who caused the war, and he kills him. He also meets another survivor who managed to survive with the help of an ant colony and who is now the queen of that colony.The writing is gripping and the characters are unique. I was hooked and wished the book was longer (it's a little over 80 pages long). Johnson's imagination is vivid and inventive.","\"Extinction Journals\" is a novella that mutated from a short story, according to its author, Jeremy Robert Johnson. This insect-sized gem of bizarro fiction features Dean, who survives a nuclear war thanks to his suit of living cockroaches, and a little supernatural assistance from a manmade god named Yahmuhwesu.The story takes place in the blasted and scarred remains of the U.S., which is the ironic setting for Dean's enlightenment. His father's death put his life on hold. The challenge of surviving nuclear devastation forces him to live again.Brought to us from Swallowdown Press, the book itself is like a wonderful bug: charming on the outside, with its petite size and fabulous cover art; icky on the inside, with its strange typesetting, particularly of dashes. The extra pages at the end have been put to good use, hawking other bizarro books, including Johnson's \"Angel Dust Apocalypse.\" That one's going on my to-be-read list, now that I've had a taste of Johnson's peculiar and witty word stylings.\"Extinction Journals\" is a fast read and a good introduction to the bizzaro genre for those who care to delve into it and can endure the inevitable thoughts of crunching cockroach carapaces that will echo in their minds after the last page has been turned.","Jeremy Robert Johnson, whose work I was first introduced to via the excellent short story collection \"Angel Dust Apocalypse\", has once again created exciting new fiction which, quite literally, shows no boundaries. With \"Extinction Journals\" Johnson has taken the concept which first appeared as a short story in ADA and turned it into an original, very satisfying short novel of just over 100 pages. The plot is extraordinarily fresh and innovative, and the images range from clever, to funny, to frightening. Really, you couldn't ask for anything more in a book which you will read in one sitting. It is entertaining, yet still maintains the ever present iceberg theory that more lies underneath the surface.Johnson's work continues to amaze me, and it also gives me hope for the new world of literature that is on the horizon. I hope to see JRJ standing over the trembling body of the old literary guard with his Liston knife in hand, and, with a flash of the blade, signal the dawning of a new era in the written word.","One reviewer felt that the author got bored with the story and rushed the ending. If there is one thing that you can learn by reading bizarro (and related genres) it is to be prepared for the unexpected. Things don't always end like you'd expect them to. What seems rushed may just be an unpredictable way for the author to conclude the story. Is that a cop out? Maybe sometimes.. but in this case, no. Any writer will tell you that many times the path that they had expected the story to go.. often changes. The story often writes itself.. the characters do things that are unexpected..even to the author.Well, now to EXTINCTION JOURNALS. This is the follow-up to the short story that was in the collection ANGEL DUST APOCALYPSE. It concerns the end of civilization thanks to an idiot president (remember, folks. this is fiction! hmph). Nuclear war comes and there are minimal survivors. One is a man who fashioned a suit covered in cockroaches. Awesome idea.The novella moves from post-apocalyptic nightmare to bizarro insect-related action. Oh and if you like insectian themes.. look no further.So, if you like weird fiction about the post-apocalyptic world... check this out.","Right from the beginning, I was drawn in. It was an original story, and so creative. I loved the idea of the cockroach and twinkie suits. The two things that would survive the apocalypse. Maybe the president should have used stale twinkies? I loved it! His internal thoughts, and even the sparse dialogue with the other few survivors, were seamless and I really just fell into the story. The ending was pretty quick to come, but I think I sort of realized about fifty pages in, that the book was more of a short story. There was no real climax that I noticed (aside from the attack of the army ants..), and I believe it could have been so much more if more of Dean's past had been explored, figure out more about the father he so obviously missed. I wanted to know more about why he made the suit, why other people did. I got a vague idea that the world knew the nuclear holocaust was imminent, but still. It was a very interesting idea. It probably wouldn't have felt the same if Dean was too informed, too lucid, but I do miss the details. The only drawback was when he met Mave. I was so disappointed in how the book ended. I wanted to love it, I tried to, but the last ten pages just didn't do anything for me. The ant debacle turned a great book, into a silly one. Though I believe the author is very talented. I felt serious similarities between his voice and Chuck Palahniuk, which is always a plus for me. Just bought his other two books, and can't wait to get started.","Cockroaches and Ants and Nukes! Oh, my! This is definitely not a read for Twinkies. Nor is it for folks who are easily bugged (though the certifiably buggy will have a field day). It may encroach on your sensibilities and antagonize your digestion.If this is the way the world tries to off itself, I might as well cut and leave right now. This is a quick read and not a bit sluggish or boring. I really liked it and my friend Katy did, too.Time flies and my wife is telling me I must quit. OK Honey .... (psst - read this, you'll get a real buzz!)","This is a strange, strange book. Strange like Bosch, de Cosimo and Dadd. Strange in a good way.The book opens at the Washington Monument, where the cockroach-covered suit that saved Dean (our hero) from the nuclear holocaust is eating the president. Who is wearing a Twinkie-covered suit. After finally prying his suit away from the president's body, Dean begins his frankly bizarre trip across what's left of the United States. On the way, he meets something very like a god, but more confused, a man wearing someone else's skin and, finally, Mave, who is the queen of an ant colony.The books at a headlong pace, crashing through its short, weirdly sweet narrative with the force of an \"Indiana Jones\"-style boulder. Dean's trek across the nuclear wasteland of America is lonely and brutal, but even though he is becoming closer to his cockroach suit, he refuses to allow himself to sink too far. In these respects, the book is good -- extreme and \"out there,\" yes, but not to the extent that it becomes unpleasant. And it's funny.But there are a few problems. Despite the fact that the bulk of the novel is spent with Dean and Dean alone, the reader leaves the book feeling that he is still largely unknown, or not quite present. His acceptance of the new state of the world is so easy, he seems to be almost in a state of shock. And while he does have a few exhcanges with other characters, these also feel somehow sterile -- as if everyone's still a bit off and their personalities haven't had a chance to kick in yet.But overall, it's a very good book, and one of the better representatives of the Bizarro genre that I've encountered. I'd recommend it to those wishing to read more in this fascinating genre.And to anyone who ever thought Gregor Samsa didn't have it so bad, after all.","I couldn't ask for a better introduction to the bizarro genre. It's a hundred page book heavy with actional-packed nuclear fun, sentient insect squads and a shimmering god summoned by the prayers of the now-dead. So inspiring, I wrote a song based off of it for my band.","Jeremy Robert Johnson's Extinction Journals begins with a true bizarro scenario: a man in a suit made of cockroaches accidentally devours the president, who is dressed in a suit made of twinkies. But by the end of the book, being dressed in a suit of cockroaches almost seems normal.As the protagonist wanders through the bizarre, surreal landscape of post-apocalyptic America, he encounters other \"survivors,\" other people who saw what was coming and prepared: a woman in steel-toed boots and an iron apron, a man encased in cement, a man wearing his neighbor's skin. The images in the book are sometimes serene, and other times haunting and nightmarish.Its only fallback: the end of the book seems very rushed. It feels like a lot more should have been discussed, that there was a longer life to the story than is written. But despite the odd pacing, Johnson's prose is graceful and clear and the book, up to the sweet, hopeful ending, is a brilliant read and well worth your time.","Basically its a handful of creative little sequences thrown together. Would recommend it highly if it wasfleshed out into an actual novel. If you can find it cheap, go for it.","really interesting concept, a man in a suit made of cockroaches roaming about after what appears to be a nuclear houlocast, but it was too short for my taste. i wish it had more of a tale and that the conflict wasnt resolved in (seriously) 4 pages. had alot of potential left untap, but since this was a continuation to a short story in \"angel dust apocalypse\" i dont suppose it was meant to be more than another short story with the same character.","this bizzaro book will keep you reading and you can finish it easyily within an hour or so. coat of cockroaches eating the president and talking to the rapture about what to do next now that no one is left. cool read, better get a couple of more because this one wont last long","So this book was not quite what I imagined. A very short little novel, about the end of the world, and surviving by wearing a suit made from roaches. I like strange, but even to me this was out there. Just not for me, I could have easily skipped it.","I've read Jeremy Robert Johnson's earlier work and, though while I've found many of his stories very entertaining, his writing remains bland at best. His style has no real spark to it and reads like a million other things out there. I was hoping that he could improve a little on this with his latest work, Extinction Journals. While his ideas remain fresh as ever, his writing remains unchanged. Also, while the story begins out strong with many possible directions it could go, halfway through it seems like he grew bored with the current story and rushed toward the ending. That's why I only give this three stars and I recommend reading Extinction Journals because I still haven't lost all my faith in JRJ quite yet. Hopefully future works will show much more promise.","Absolute rubbish. I can't understand the positive reviews and multiple stars. This book had no story line and no ending. I feel sorry for the tree that was cut down to make this waste of time. What's worse, I actually ordered this book from a store and am unable to return it. It will definitely be sold at my next garage sale.The main character has no depth whatsoever and the plot goes no where painfully slowly. The idea of creating a suit to withstand the end of the world actually had potential, but tragically this novel does not work.","This is hilarious. The satire in this novelette is biting & caustic as it should be. You don't have to be an ikthyologist to enjoy the level of \"racism\" displayed by the bugs as they connect to the humans. Are we really so small minded, the readers are forced to ask themselves. The answer should be obvious.","Like Jeremy Robert Johnson, I seem to have a fascination with the apocalypse. Thus Extinction Journals slots into the bookshelf alongside J.G. Ballard's Hello America, Denis Johnson's Fiskadoro, Jonathan Lethem's Amnesia Moon. Phiip K. Dick's Dr Bloodmoney and Cormac McCarthy's The Road. As a stylist he's not up there with Ballard or McCarthy but Journals is a rip-roaring read infused with both dread and humor. If I have a complaint it is simply that it is too damn short.","...is the life of a man wearing twinkies meets a man wearing a suit of cockroaches. It warmed my heart to read who got eaten. (You must buy the book to find out.) JRJ has become THE author to watch on my 'authors-to-watch' list. This was my first contact with his work, and I've read it at least four or five times since. I've loaned it out to friends (it's on loan as I write this review, as a matter of fact,) and I've told nearly everyone I know who would be interested in this book. So, I'm telling you, too. Buy it!PS-The fact that he is closely associated with The Mars Volta is synchronicity at its best for me as well.","A truly original story, from a fresh voice in fiction. A must-read for any readers looking for something new.","\"Extinction Journals\" picks up where the \"The Sharp Dressed Man At the End of the Line\" leaves off. For those of you unfamiliar with that story, it can be found in Mr. Johnson's short story collection, \"Angel Dust Apocalypse.\" Without giving too much away, we meet Dean in the last days before World War III, a young man who believes that he can survive the aftermath of a nuclear war if he's wearing a suit made of cockroaches. As the story ends, Dean is proved correct.\"Extinction Journals\" follows Dean around as he makes his way through the nuclear bomb ravaged wasteland of what was once the USA. He struggles to find food and water, all the while wondering if his \"suit\" will, out of desperation and hunger, turn on him. Along the way, he meets a new god, borne out of mankind's collective unconscious. Neither Dean nor the reader is sure whether or not he's hallucinating, but considering he just survived a nuclear war we have to give him some leeway.Ultimately, Dean meets other entomologically enlightened individuals who are struggling to put some sense to this brave new world. At that point, they must decide how life will exist, post-humanity, or if it will exist at all.JRJ has a knack for characterization, even if those characters are a bit twisted. Dean is a nice enough guy, but one has to really be out there to conceive of fashioning a suit out of cockroaches in order to survive a nuclear war. And JRJ's descriptions of the nuclear wasteland are convincingly real, making you shudder (and question Dean's desire to live to see it).The story was way too short. While readers don't need to be familiar with the short story that preceded this novella, it definitely helps. Adding it as a preface, while driving up the publishing costs, would have enhanced the reading experience for new readers of JRJ's work.I also had a feeling of repetition between Dean's encounters. It was as if he were stumbling upon the same old irradiated buildings he wandered into earlier.Lastly, I was hoping for more of an exploration of the relationship between Dean and his suit. I really couldn't get the sense that the symbiosis between man and roach was evolving until the very end. Maybe evolution itself works like that. Rather than gradual changes, we get abrupt \"do or die\" situations.While I enjoyed this book, I feel that, for the reasons stated above, it falls a little short of JRJ's previous works. Newcomers should pick up his earlier works first before coming here. Fans of JRJ's work will still want to add this to their collections.","This was the first book by Jeremy Robert Johnson I ever read, and it made me a fan.There's been a nuclear holocaust and Dean believes he is the lone survivor. Of course there's a lot of radiation around, so Dean needs to protect himself from the environment by wearing a suit of living cockroaches. This makes for a pretty surreal existence, but author Johnson grounds the story with Dean's ruminations on lonliness, and his quest for connection in this burned out world.He eventually finds a companion- a woman who has survived with the help of her suit of living ants. They also meet an alien god thing, and someone who doesn't wish them well at all. For all its weirdness, it's a very humane story about a cataclysmic ending and a strange new birth. It's savage and crazy and also touching and emotional.I recommend this book to adventurous fans of science fiction that want to take a journey outside the box.","This book was written as a follow up to a short story published inAngel Dust Apocalypse. I purchased it a few months ago and kept putting it aside, I found it in my bookcase last week and am so glad with my choice. Another off-beat page turner by Johnson. A little more sci-fi than I was expecting, but I give extra props to his sense of humor with the book's post-apocolyptic setting. Overall a fun short read for someone looking for something different!","Take the old adage, \"Only cockroaches will survive a nuclear war\", and build a unique, hilarious, disturbing, and surreal apocalypse story around it. That is what Jeremey Robert Johnson has done. Interesting from beginning to end, Johnson's 'Extinction Journals' takes you on a strange but thought provoking ride through a nuclear wasteland and though I enjoyed the book very much, I feel, as many other reviewers have stated, that this story had so much more potential for a fully engrossing sci-fi drama but fell a little short. That aside, I can still appreciate the work and always wish for more. Highly Recommended!!","If you're looking for a quick tasty treat, go for this. I figured that armageddon would be sad, but I forgot how funny it would be. Plus, politicians get what they deserve.","It's one thing to be weird. Anyone can do it. Except maybe Will Smith or Ben Affleck. They are both just too damn white. However, it is a whole other thing to be weird and make it entertaining, enthralling even. Few people can take a suit of cockroaches, God (maybe), and an ant queen (kind of), throw them into a post apocalyptic setting and have it form a consistently entertaining AND coherent whole. Johnson does just that. Bravo, sir, bravo.","Extinction Journals is probably the most creative tale to come out of this recent explosion of post-apocaylptic literature. Did you like the heart in The Road by Cormac Mccarthy? Well this story has plenty of heart and a survival suit constructed of cockroaches that has plenty of sci-fi authors scratching their heads and wondering why they didn't think of it first.In this tale Dean and his suit of cockroaches make a weary trek across a post-apocaalytic American wasteland. Dean struggles to find food for himself as well as for his suit and encounters exsitential lonliness all along the way. He also encounters people who had similiar ideas for suits including, the president in a Twinkie suit, someone wearing a suit of cinder blocks, and black guy wearing other people's skin, to name a few. None of these suits really worked so well. He eventually meets a woman with a similiar suit made of insects. The ending is a surreal and hopeful one for not only the audience, but the protagonist as well, considering the hopelessness he faced along his journey.Jeremy Robert Johnson is a great writer and a figurehead in the Bizarro scene. I'm personally looking forward to reading more from him.","Visceral. Weird. Cerebral. Unique. Bizarre. No, you can't pick just one because this book is all of them and more. Do you want to read great science fiction? This book is for you. Are you an academic looking for an entertaining deconstruction/critique of society's relationship with deities and with itself? Buy this right now. Is bizarro the genre that toots your horn? Extinction Journals has to be in your collection or you can't say you like the genre. Are you tired of the bland, talentless writers flooding the market nowadays? Don't fret: Jeremy Robert Johnson is here to rescue you with a short blast of top-notch literature.Extinction Journals tells the story of Dean, a man who survived the nuclear holocaust thanks to a customized business suit he coated in cockroaches. With everyone else dead, Dean is forced to deal with his loneliness, fear, beings coming down from the sky and the physical effects of a radiated atmosphere. As if all that wasn't enough, the cockroach suit, which Dean has to take care of when it comes to water and food, starts developing a collective mind of its own.JRJ's prose is brutally poetic, technically impressive, and wildly entertaining. The only flaw you'll find in this tome is its length. You'll want much more of Johnson's work when you're done with this, so go ahead and buy We Live Inside You as well. You won't regret it.","Extinction Journals by Jeremy Robert Johnson is a very cool post-apocalyptic piece of bizarro fiction. It's about this guy named Dean who makes himself a suit of cockroaches. This enables Dean to be one of the few who survive the nuclear holocaust that follows.Dean meets some other strange people in his ruined world. He meets (and his suit eats) the President, who survived by wearing a suit made out of Twinkies. Then he meets Yahmuhwesuh, who is an avatar of the collective unconsciousness that has been incarnated as a result of the nuclear destruction. Somehow, Yahmuhwehsus gives Dean the ability to communicate with his roaches, and Dean sets out on a journey for survival.I really enjoyed this one. It's a great, exciting read. And it's funny, which is always a plus with me. While I really loved it, I will point out that it is contained in The Bizarro Starter Kit (Orange), which is actually cheaper than the individual volume, so it would probably be better to get that instead.","In a much cooler high school than one I've gone to, Jeremy Robert Johnson's,Extinction Journalswould be required reading in Biology 101.Who is Dean? He is one of very few survivors in the post apocalyptic D.C. area, and he relies solely on his suit of cockroaches to keep him alive and unaffected by the radiation that threatens him. A little self-deprecating and surprisingly very level-headed despite his ever- constant nagging conscious, Dean should consider himself a hell of a lot better off than he thinks he is.As Dean begins to gain confidence, encountering along the way compassion, love, and a uniquely powerful foe, JRJ's writing alternates between strange, yet witty and humorous, and tender, due oddly to some highly evolved insects. He dissects the basic view of the human condition and inserts the primitive, rather other-worldly nature of a different species, fusing a vision that is at first frightening and then harmonious.At first I stumbled a bit over JRJ's usage of words separated/by/a/forward/slash that dotted the prose, yet I came to understand it as an important and distinctive concept for the journal. Not having read anything else by JRJ, I don't know if this is a usual trait or used only in the Journals. Either way, it seems to say that one word would not do, and to find that it is thrown in sparingly made me anticipate it happening again.Somewhat strange and riddled with over-powering elements of doom,Extinction Journalsis a random thought-provoking, highly intelligent read.","A man traveling through an apocalyptic landscape by way of his custom, living cockroach suit, after said suit has devoured the President? Sold! Armed with that information, you probably already know whether or not this is something you want to read. A great intro to Bizarro fiction.","You like it surreal ? Dark ? Post-apocalyptic ? Creative ? And funny on top ? You will love Extinction Journals. I read the entire book in like 3 days and I took my time. A very entertaining read. A wild, wild story of survival. Read it !","JRJ was my initial foray into what is known as the Bizarro genre. And I was immediately, irrevocably hooked.\"Extinction Journals\" is the continuation of a short story from his collection, \"Angel Dust Apocalypse\" (which is also a fantastic read, fwiw) entitled 'The Sharp Dressed Man at the End of the Line.'A man, Dean, encased in a suit made of cockroaches, finds his way in a just-after-nuclear-war world. While the man himself doesn't exactly \"grow,\" in the traditional protagonist fashion, his suit does, becoming gradually self-aware. And then they meet a woman covered in ants...I have long been a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction, and Johnson delivers something different in a scintillating package. \"Extinction Journals\" covers most of the traditional tropes, but in a new, surreal, and utterly enjoyable way; much like Palahniuk. There is something of Pat Frank's paranoia, Palahniuk's execution, and Matheson's slanted view here.It may not be to everybody's tastes, as the variety of reviews here show, but you can't deny his writing prowess. He is clearly a unique and powerful voice. So, come on in, and let a little insect sex into your life.","Jeremy Robert Johnson's novella Extinction Journals opens with a man in a suit made of cockroaches eating the President--who is in a suit made out of Twinkies. And if that's not a great scene for the first sentence to describe, I don't know what is.Extinction Journals is an awesome survivalist story that at times seems to have been written under the influence of something illicit, but manages to find a common ground between genre conventions and the call of surrealism. The best thing about this book is the juxtaposition of relatively normal survivalist scenes and the surreal conversations that turn up with the people and creatures our protagonist comes across.And boy are those some great scenes! I'm not going to give spoilers, but when the collective unconsciousness of the human race comes up, pissed that the people he represents are dead, I was happy. Things were good in my life right then. It's like a perfect fusion of man and insect. Maybe it does get a little rushed towards the end with the creation of a villain late in the story, but the ride to get there isn't hurt in any way.","Interesting post-apocalyptic novella about a man who survives a nuclear holocaust by wearing a suit of cockroaches. Sometimes humorous, sometimes bleak and totally bizarre. This book has one of the best first sentences that I've read and I look forward to reading more from this author.","Read this book in under 2 Hours...stopping here & there for whateva reason...GREAT BOOK! cant wait to read the authors other books....

      "description":"Per Hiero Desteen was a priest, a telepath -- and a highly trained killer. Together with his great riding moose and the young bear who was his friend, he was on an extraordinary mission. For this was five thousand years after the holocaust known as The Death. Now the evil Brotherhood of the Unclean was waging all-out war against the few remnants of normal humanity, determined to wipe out all traces of its emerging civilization. Hiero's task was to bring back a lost secret of the ancients that might save the humans. But his path lay through the very heart of the territory ruled by the Unclean and their hordes of mutated, intelligent, savage beast followers. And the Unclean were waiting for him!",

      "reviews.text":["This book is, for some unknown reason, one of my favorite stories. When I picked it up at a book fair way back in high school it was because the cover caught my eye. The story has a fine plot that moves well, and it was filled with novel characters. It's not like it's great literature or anything, but I liked it. Thank you Mr. Lanier, even if you never create another tale. Terrance Gallagher","Hiero's Journey began well enough. The writing is average and the story is interesting enough. The psi aspect is good, as are the animals. But then, about half way through our Hiero meets an adorable princess and from then on the story becomes way to precious, coquettish and coy to stomach. No one told the author that once the lovers declare their love the romance is over, I guess. What this book needed was an editor with a red pencil to cut all this flowery language, redundancy and cuteness. If he's still alive, the writer is in his eighties, but the prose reads as if a teenager wrote it. This comes from a romantic, by the way. Anybody want to buy a copy (and the sequel) cheap? Lesson one: never buy the sequel until you've read the first book, regardless of the reviews. Live and learn.","I confess that my biographical knowledge of Sterling Lanier is somewhat spotty. He graduated from Harvard in 1951 and did graduate work in anthropology and archeology at the University of Pennsylvania. He was an editor at Chilton in the early 1960s, where he persuaded that company to publish Frank Herbert's _Dune_. He began publishing science fiction of his own in 1961. Lanier seems to like writing adventure stories with military heroes. At their worst, they stike me as terribly dull. At their best, they are irritating because they fall barely short of being truly memorable works of science fiction.In _Hiero's Journey_ (1973), Lanier takes an interesting idea but does not give it the treatment it deserves. Five thousand years after a nuclear holocaust, the face of North America has been altered. Mutated plants and animals have spread over the land. Per Hiero Desteen, a kind of warrier-priest, is sent by his abbot from what was once western Canada on a quest to the south. His mission is to discover what a computor is and if possible to bring one back. Accompanying him is a morse, a mooselike mount with which he has a telepathic bond. Opposing him are the Unclean Ones, a satanic sect which is intent on exterminating most of humanity. It has the makings of a good adventure, but it falls a bit short.The problem, I think, is in Lanier's background. He has populated it with a great many mutant creatures, but he has failed to make them part of a plausible ecology. Back in 1963, L. Sprague de Camp published a gem of an essay titled \"How to Plan a Fauna\" (_Fantasy and Science Fiction_, October). The article is an excellent how-to-do-it guide for science fiction writers who want to plan a realistic ecological setting for their stories. I don't plan to reiterate de Camp's article in detail; but there is one basic rule that de Camp discusses that an author should follow: _Don't populate your setting exclusively with carnivores._ In _Hiero's Journey_, Hiero encounters a large number of spectacular creatures on his quest including giant weasles, 15 ton frogs, a giant snake, giant snapping turtles, giant fish with tails hundreds of feet wide, birds with 30 foot wingspans, giant monkeys and giant rats. While Lanier does give some attention to herbivores-- giant hippos, mutated cows, and giant elephants-- the carnivores greatly outnumber the herbivores in numbers and size.As the novel progresses, the carnivorous creatures become bigger and bigger. At one point in the novel, a giant fish rises out of the ruins of a sunken city to gobble up a boatload of villains. It's an impressive scene-- until you stop to ask how the creature lives in a spot where there aren't ordinarily any people to eat. There just aren't any animals large enough or numerous enough for it to feed upon.Because the ecology of _Hiero's Journey_ is not credible, the monsters appear to be plot devices-- creations that exist primarliy for the hero to fight and overcome. Unlike the alien life forms in a novel by Hal Clement, John Varley, or Larry Niven, Lanier's creatures don't seem to be part of a real ecology. They are not as believeable or as complex.","Update Dec. 1 2012: Attention Sterling Media Group: On the off chance that you read these reviews or that somebody can bring it to your attention, I stripped the DRM from your book and fixed the HTML the last time I read it. Give me my $10 back and I will give you the edited copy and you can fix this book for everyone. You can't beat that deal!Update Dec. 24 2011: The Kindle book was recently updated and the new version is improved. Unfortunately, it is also still terrible. Many of the OCR problems were resolved, but not all of them. Improper paragraph breaks and missing or incorrect punctuation still abound. Italics have not been restored. Overall, it is better, but still bad. It would be so trivial to fix the problems that it is really inexcusable for the publisher to be asking $10. It is obvious that nobody who gives a damn has read through the text.Original Review:As Hiero's Journey is one of my favorite books, I was happy to see a Kindle version available. Unfortunately, it is a big disappointment.The formatting is terrible, with line breaks in the middle of paragraphs, missing punctuation, many bad-OCR character substitutions, and none of the italics used to identify mental communication in the original version.For ten dollars, this is a complete rip off. I'll stick with my old paper copy.The publisher should either reduce the price to 99 cents or fix the text. Preferably the latter since I already wasted $10 on it. Don't make the same mistake I did.(I see that Sterling Media Group LLC has recently released all of Lanier's books other than Menace Under Marswood. I would happily have repurchased all of his books for the Kindle if this one had been well done. Hopefully they will release a fixed version. Until this one is corrected, there is no way I will be taking a risk on the others.)","Believable, imaginative, engaging. An extremely satisfying read from start to finish. I've read the book at least ten times, each more enjoyable. While based on a world atomic disaster this is an uplifting, feel-good story. The next volume, Unforsaken Hiero, keeps up the pace and adds more dimensions to Per Hiero, our hero. While each book tells a complete story, the saga is incomplete. It has been frustrating waiting for years for the third volume. Despite the lack, the two books are incredible.","If science fiction/fantasy is your genre of literature, do yourself a favor and take a weekend to read this excellent story by Lanier.His lead character, Per Hiero Desteen is an instantly likeable warrior/priest who must undertake a critical mission in unknown and forbidden territory in a post-apocalyptic North America 5,000 years in the future. The story is a real page-turner with dozens of believable plot twists and supporting ideas that make for a fun and fantastic read. The typical good vs. evil sub plot takes a fresh approach in Laniers world with many diverse characters including dozens of grotesque, nuclear-spawned mutations, some intelligent and allied to humans..others maelevelant but equally intelligent aligned with evil humans known as the Unclean. This unholy alliance is dedicated to the resurrection of the nuclear technology that decimated the Earth 5 millenia in the past, as well as the total subjigation of normal humankind.All these things become quite plausible thanks to Laniers excellent literary style and flair for creating believable, likeable characters. He is a master storyteller with a gift that so few authors have. Ultimately, this book is pure fantasy that is extremely fun! The sequel, Unforsaken Hiero is equally entertaining and a must-read once you gobble up this first book.Sadly, Mr. Lanier has never written the third and final book in the trilogy and it appears he may never do so. For the many Hiero fans left waiting, we can only hope Lanier may someday rekindle his passion for this series and finish the story. Or perhaps authorize a third book by a young upcoming writer in the sci fi/fantasy industry. I've been waiting for book three for over ten years.Regardless, please take Hiero's Journey. You won't be sorry.","I would wholeheartedly give a 5 star to this book as it is one of the finest example of post-apocalyptic fiction.However, Kindle edition is so badly ruined by publishers decision to just use a bad OCR device on the book and do absolutely no editing or even proofreading afterwards.For this, shame on you Sterling Media Group because you defiled such a beautiful book and Amazon because you shamelessly sell it in this shape.","\"Hiero's Journey\" imagines a long-dead North American continent. Nearly five thousand years have past since a horrible war decimated the world, turning it into a mutated hell. Pockets of humanity dot the wastes, with many sects having reverted to primitive savagery. Taking the center stage is Hiero Desteen, a telepathic Canadian priest assigned with the duty of venturing into the forbidden areas of (what were once) the Great Lakes and New England regions in search of technological artifacts. With only a few companions at his side, he must fend off an onslaught of hideous, war-spawned beasts and tattered remnants of civilization.The plot is really nothing new, but beauty is in how Lanier puts it all together. His post-apocalyptic world is vividly imagined, brought to life by description that is neither flowerly or sparse. The great monsters of the wastelands are mutated to comically huge proporations, yet instead of going for completely overkill, Lanier gives us only glimpses of them in action. He leaves most of it to the reader's imagination, and the result is a series of rather impressive scenes and a tense, foreboding atmosphere. The characters are standard - the lone warrior and his animal friends, the mysterious girl, the evil brotherhoods of evil. It has all been done before, but Lanier does a great job of breathing just enough life into them. They're tiny, pen-lights of goodness and humanity in a savage world, and while none of them are all that extensively realized, I could nonetheless believe in and sympathize with them and their plights.\"Hiero's Journey\" is a product of a time in which science fiction didn't have to be horribly complex and thought-provoking in order to be considered good. It's a great story with larger-than-life characters battling rediculous odds in a harsh world. It has action, adventure, corny-but-lovable dialogue, and some wonderful imagery. It's not a novel to be taken seriously, but it's a novel to be read and enjoyed for the hell of it. And it's certainly worth some extensive excavating at the local used book store.","Rereading this book for the 10th time or so, I am still amazed by how well this story works, relative to so many other fantasy and sorcery tales. There is no padding, no excess, no digressions even when the plot seems to be a series of hung-together adventures. Moreover, &quot;the Unclean&quot; are really evil and horrible, in a way that not many other authors seem to have captured. This book, and its sequel, deserve to be reissued. And maybe other authors should use it as a model for how to write fantasy/adventure that endures.","If science fiction/fantasy is your genre of literature, do yourself a favor and take a weekend to read this excellent story by Lanier.His lead character, Per Hiero Desteen is an instantly likeable warrior/priest who must undertake a critical mission in unknown and forbidden territory in a post-apocalyptic North America 5,000 years in the future.

In a holocaust world five thousand years in the future where atomic death has changed both man and beast,he was the last hope for the few remnants of normal humanity. In his way,the dark brotherhood of the unclean and there followers of mutated intelligent beast, &quot;The leemutes&quot;.together with his great riding moose and a young mutated bear,he rode forth to find the secrets of the past which might save the humans who were ruled by the abbeys.Through the heart of the unclean he went, and they were waiting for him!","I have the paper back of this book. I was very disappointed in the quality of this ebook. It looks like it was scanned, OCR'ed, and maybe spell checked. It appears that no human bothered to look at the output before they published it. The formatting is very bad and there are special characters in place of letters through out the text.","A tremendous story that draws the reader into the tale and attaches a personal interest to the hero's triumphs and perils. Each new character is crafted with honor, courage and wit or, in the enemy's case, with malevolence and evil foreboding. Each preceding chapter ends demanding the next one be started without delay. Humans and mutants, both good and evil, are brought to life with clarity and purpose. You can practically smell the fetid forests and, in the swamps and bogs, feel the bites of pests and clammy heat. The story is written enjoyably and makes the reader ponder what it would be like following a nuclear holocaust; the rabid growth and mutation of humans, animals and plants from the lingering greenhouse effect, even five millinia later. Humans and animals with the noble purpose to reestablish normal humanity throughout the land, able to communicate with their minds, form alliances to thwart the foul purposes of the evil enemy known as the Unclean. Hiero, a kind-hearted and sincere Priest, yet ruthless Killman when need be, sets out on a last ditch mission which, if successful, will allow the far flung Abbey fort-communities to turn the tide of the war they will inevitably lose to the Unclean wizards and their evil allies, the Lemutes (slang for animals that have gone through &quot;lethal mutation&quot; and are now harmful to humanity) if nothing is done. However, he must pass straight through the heart of the enemy's territory to get to his evenutal destination. Along his way he makes allies and friends and, as the danger mounts through the story, the pace increases and doesn't let up until the last page is read. And trust me, you won't want it to end!","I was very impressed with this book. It is about a human in a future made desolate by a nuclear war. The story takes place long after all the radiation is gone. This is a story of new beginnings. Our hero is pursued by a group of phsychic warriors who battle largely through the mind. Hiero discovers that he has an innate ability in this area that is awakened when he is attacked. As he explores his ability and tries to stay alive the reader is taken along a wonderful journey through the cities that have been taken over by the wild life.Sterling E. Lanier did a wonderful job on this book. I respect him as an author and have enjoyed everything of his I have read","Lanier's most distinctive gift as an author is an enthusiasm for his stories. Even if you are not a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction or adventure fiction you cannot help but be caught up in the frenetic eagerness of the narrative. The sheer number of expository sentences that end in explanation points is staggering. He may not be the most gifted author out there, but he obviously had a lot of fun writing Hiero's Journey and I found it a bit contagious.The \"Hiero\" of this story is a priest in a future Catholic order (as is typical of many post-apocalyptic stories) who sets out on a quest across a drastically changed North America looking for technological relics of vanished civilization. Mutated animals and people (and iterations of the two) abound. Do not try to look for scientific accuracy in this tale; it is \"soft\" science fiction resolutely and unapologetically. There is nothing really innovative or genre-busting about Hiero, but it was not a waste of my time. One minor complaint I have is how Lanier constantly relied on metaphors about radio and other technologic trappings when describing how telepathy worked in this story. Considering the main character had never heard of radio or seen anything like it these descriptions broke the fourth wall a bit.","Hiero's Journey (1973) by Sterling Lanier - 275 pages - rating: 7.5/10Adventurous journey across post apocalyptic North America ( including many Canadian references ) reminiscent of classic odyssey style tale. Hiero meets and picks up several interesting characters along the way as he heads towards an uncertain goal while battling numerous evil creatures of both human and animal origin. Jungles, the high seas and swamp settings keep the backdrop ever changing. He even hooks up along the way with a tasty young female morsel with a shockingly significant age differential.The writing style flows smoothly but there are several uncommon words that would require most of us to consult a dictionary. Otherwise a highly enjoyable and frequently exciting story.Claus Kellermann2006 April 11Sci_Fi_Researcher@yahoo.com","I've read this book over 10 times in the past 20 years and I have to say it's one of the finest sci fi books ever. It is post apocalyptic but it also is one of the finest and believable explorations of mind powers ever. Truly original in dozens of pioneering concepts!!An absolute must read!","Although it was many years ago I first read this book, it left such an impression on me that I went looking for it again. What a great adventure - good storytelling, terrific imagination and unexpected heroes and villans everywhere. Where's Hollywood?","Alternative future. Long after the nuclear apocalypses Earth is not quite apleasant place to live on. That concerns as well the places where Canada andUS are in our time. But it is not as terrible as you could imagine either.Through radioactive marches and ruins of great cities populated by belligerentmutants and other weird and evil creatures Hiero, abbot and priest of what wecall now Christian church, brings his pure soul in a quest for the ancientknowledge - the only thing which can save the reviving civilization of thefuture. And when in this journey he meets and saves his love she is definitelyworth all the trouble.Well, you guess all right, she is princess, and there will be pursuit andescape, hiding and fights, friends and enemies, and even some kind of dark andlight magic.This is one of the best mix of romance, fantasy and action I ever read.Maybe it would be right to place it in one row with the first &quot;Witch World&quot; ofAndre Norton and Christoffer Stasheff's &quot;Wizard in Spite of Himself&quot;.","I believe the Sterling Media Group LLC must have re-formatted the Kindle version recently as I just purchased it (August 2011) and it looks great. No line breaks, missing punctuation, or bad OCR substitutions. This is such a great story. It's a must read for lovers of Sterling Lanier's work and anyone who enjoys the fantasy/adventure genre. Thank you Sterling Media Group LLC for paying attention to the reviews and doing justice to Sterling Lanier's work.","This is one of the best sci-fi books I've ever read. And I've read a lot of sci-fi novels.The author writing style is vivid and imaginative, in this case putting you in the shoes of protagonist, Dasteen Hiero, to experience his amazing journey through the post-apocalyptic American wilderness to save mankind. It has everything you can imagine: a sunken city in the great marsh, bear with great intelligence and potential psychic communication abilities, villains and their hideous followers, and oh, a beautiful princess our hero saved along the way, I first read it through a borrowed copy more than a decade ago, since then I've bought my own copy, together with its sequel -The Unforsaken Hiero.Too bad the author didn't write a third book, that will make the story-arc complete.Has the author already passed away? Anyone knows?","Sterling Lanier weaves a marvelous tale of intrigue, adventure, exploration and romance. This is a book that even the most challenged reader will find hard to put down. It will be a shame if \"Hollywood\" does not discover this gem.","I have been reading Sci-fi for many years and I stumbled across this book review today. It brought back fond memories of my teenage years. I have read this book many times and it never disappoints.I only wish he would have finished the series, Sigh....","Absolutely epic, fun post-apocalyptic soft-science fiction.Sterling E. Lanier creates a highly imaginative world with an excellent protagonist who is easy to empathize with, noble companions, and despicable enemies. The story arc is reminiscent of ancient epics and draws heavily on Joseph Campbell like archetypes.The world is grim and disturbing, yet strangely appealing, a world of the unexpected with danger and wonder a hands-breath away. Lots of fun to read.[...]","I read this book the first time about 20 years ago and was fascinated by its intriguing and amazing story. Since then I always wanted to read this book again, but I never had a chance. Finally, when I saw that an e-book is available, I bought a Kindle reader and this book.It was a nice reading and I enjoyed the book again. However, I noticed something that I missed 20 years ago when I was a kid - the story flow is not always smooth and sometimes changes awkwardly. For example, when the protagonist has some deadly challenges and everything is against him and there is no hope, something magically happens, a new ally comes, or some unbelievable coincidence of events let him out of all situations. It was ok 20 year ago, but now I found this a bit naive and Hollywood-like. Still, the book itself deserves 4 stars.Another issue is a very poor formatting. There are numerous broken paragraphs and some OCR mistakes (use of number 1 instead of letter l). Buying an intangible book for $10 I would expect it to be proofreaded and formatted well. That is finally I use 3 stars to grade this e-book.","Both Hiero books are somewhat light on character development, and the post-apocalyptic flora/fauna are unrealistic. They also both tend to be somewhat juvenile. However, so were the Tarzan and Mars books. The Hiero books succeed for the same reasons those books did. They do not pretend to be a scholarly prediction of how humans would interact long after a nuclear disaster. They are simply entertaining.Sometimes the best judge of a successful book is not its technical merit, but how often it is re-read. I have a paperback of both Hiero books. They have been read many, many times. I have a paperback of Melville's Moby Dick. It has been read once. No question which has more artistic merit. The Hiero books are a fun read, and perhaps the best endorsement is my regret that Lanier never wrote a third book.","This is one of Mr. Lanier's best books. I have read it several times and have never tired of it. The only other book of his that I would rate at the same level is the sequel, Unforsaken Heiro. I have never seen the concluding book of the series, so I assume it was never written, but there two books are worth the time and effort to find and enjoy.","About 5000 years in the future, earth is a transformed planet. Ravaged by nuclear and biological warfare, life has become vastly different from the \"pre-Death\" era. Most of the dominant populations of humanity did not survive, but small, isolated populations were left intact. These are now the dominant humans. They are in a constant struggle for survival against the Unclean, which is an alliance of mutant animals and people, who share a goal of conquering the \"normal\" humans. The story follows a priest, who undertakes a secretive journey to find evidence for a rumored piece of ancient technology, which could provide his people with an important tool to fight the Unclean. Most of the journey occurs in what was once the Great Lakes region, or in the area once known as Canada.This is a pretty classic example of soft science fiction, and it focuses mainly on creating a colorful and interesting landscape. Telepathy is an intricate part of events. Mutated life is described in great detail, but without much scientific grounding. Life forms, it seems, have increased drastically in size and ferocity. The primary explanation is radiation-induced mutations. Telepathic ability has developed to become a fairly common trait among life forms, to varying degrees. Animals and humans can share mental activity, and the priest named Hiero uses that to forge a bond with an intelligent bear-like creature, who assists him with his journey. The bear's motives are never fully revealed, but it becomes a faithful ally.The writing was straightforward and just okay. Events, when they occurred, suffered from the average writing. The book, for me, lacked a sense of excitement. A great deal was invested in painting a colorful, and detailed future earth, populated by strange and interesting creatures. The title of the book is appropriate. In the hands of, say, Andre Norton, I likely would have thought of this as \"Hiero's Adventure\". But the feel is certainly more of a journey. Norton's books shared an emphasis on telepathy between humans and non-human creatures. I could not help but notice how vastly different her stories flowed from this one. Excitement and action in a Norton story is every bit as prominent as her imaginative creatures and worlds. Her skillful writing was the difference. This was still an enjoyable story, with enough wonder to entertain most readers.","I read this book in the 1980's and loved the story of adventure and futuristic mayhem. When recently searching for the sequels, recalling it was supposed to be a trilogy, I could not find any mention of such an author or such a book. Thanks to your reviews I now know the title of the sequel and plan to re-read the first book also.","\"Hiero's Journey\" is a great book, and would make a pretty darn cool movie. Mr. Lanier is quite creative, especially with his ideas on what sort of civilization might emerge from the ashes of a nuclear conflict (a semi-republic centered on monasteries in western Canada, where the damage might have been less). Some of the creatures that Hiero encounters on his journey, such as the Dweller in the Mists, are really cool.","Many years ago I picked up a hard back edition of this book complete with the second volume in the series. It was on a cart of books with a free sign on the front. I was a bit dubious at first, but was bored so started reading. WOW! It turned out to be one of my all time favorite books. So I was quite pleased to see it available on Kindle. I bought it and am current re-reading it. It is very fast moving, holds your interest well and the story line is quite gripping. A rollicking good read!","Came across this book more than 30 years ago, has stuck in my mind since then. I now have it on my kindle forever.","The characters are believable and have enough depth to hold one's interest and the story moves at a good pace to keep one's interest. I like the idea of this kind of result to a nuclear holocaust - some hope long in the future for a positive humanity. I found this book in 1988 first and enjoyed it then. I just re read it. I am pleased that Mr Lanier has written more on the subject! Oh, boy a new story by an old friend!Mr Lanier - thanks for some super writing!"],

      "reviews.text":["First published in 1901, this apocalyptic novel has been reissued as a \"forgotten classic.\" While the \"classic\" label may be something of an overstatement, it is important as one of the first science fiction novels, and the first \"last man alive\" doomsday novel. In addition, it is great fun to read.The plot is segmented into three distinct parts:*The first part covers an expedition to reach the North Pole, a feat which had not been accomplished at the time the novel was written. It climaxes with only one man, Adam Jeffson, left alive.*The second part follows Adam as he makes his way back to habitation, only to discover that a mysterious purple cloud has covered the rest of the earth, seemingly leaving him as the only human alive. Slowly sinking into dark madness, he unleashes his own destruction, burning the great cities.*The last segment cannot be discussed without becoming something of a spoiler. Suffice it to say, it includes Adam's return to sanity and to belief in the future of the earth.The pre-apocalypse first section is actually the most suspenseful and well written, conveying in frenzied language the mystery and actual horror aroused by the frozen Pole region. Of his race toward the Pole, Adam relates, \"...I sped, I spun, with grinning teeth that chattered and gibbered, and eyeballs of distraction: for a Fear, too--most cold and dreadful--had its hand of ice upon my heart....\"The second section unfortunately drags somewhat as Adam relates with numbing detail of his search of town after town and of underground caves and mines for survivors. Only when Adam begins his frenzy of burning does the narrative again come alive, as he watches the burning of London while smoking opium, drinking wine, and playing the harp.The last section features an entirely different tone, as Adam progresses toward reason and hope. Although the story line is more than a bit illogical (if that can even be said of this kind of novel), the ending is very satisfactory.This novel cannot be judged by modern standards, certainly, but it can be judged as a product of its time. Those who appreciate H. G. Wells, H. P. Lovecraft, H. Rider Haggard, and others in this vein will really appreciate this \"forgotten classic.\"","Started out pretty interesting. Middle was a little drawn out. Ending was a head scratcher. I was looking for a interesting ending to make up for the slow middle and,,,,,nothing.Keep in mind that this was written at the turn of the century so wording and writing style are consistent with that time and takes some getting used to,","After reading the reviews on this book, and learning what the plot was about, I was excited to give this book a try.Unfortunately, I really got bogged down in the details as the author describes the main character's journey to London. He could have tidied that part up a bit, perhaps shortening it dramatically to give the story the opportunity to breathe. Instead, it became such a chore to slog through each page that I finally just gave up.Disappointed...should have been a much better book.","Early on, this story impressed me. Well written, good story line, good syntax, minimal expletives,courageous main character--all features of a good read. When the protagonist and the reader realize that he (we) are it, the last guy, the Lone Ranger, the only chip left in the bag--then it falls apart. He begins to dither. The author starts writing the same thing in different ways. It's like he had to fill his quota of words for the book. Other reviewers describe him as going crazy, but I think he just went boring. Anyone can write bad stuff (like this review?) but I was expecting better.","I had trouble with this book at first. If it were printed today, it would be a very fat book. It's printed with a tiny font [most editions] and written in very formal English. It reminded me of Jules Verne. It should be on every science fiction fans list of read books.The story is basically post-apocalyptic, with spiritual undertones. No zombies or roving bands of starving people, more psychological. The main character is tormented, inventive, destructive - engaging.","Like many a reviewer above, I found this book to be totally word-tasty and directly emotional. I described it to a friend as \"virtuosity in the service of SOMETHING TO SAY.\" I hadn't finished the book at that point, so, maybe I'm just one of those people who got to the end and just went, \"really, is that all?\" I like to think of this as \"Lost before Lost.\" That might be kinda cheapening the talent that is gushing from this novel, but the two do share a few things.Without spoiling it for you if you haven't read it, the writer introduces rather a few exciting mysteries and possibilities and just lets them hang and die \"back on page 33\" or whatever/wherever that I found most depressing, unsatisfying and kind of lazy. Anyway, in between you get some of the most intelligent, informed and yet absolute stream-of-consciousness writing I've parsed in my years. And although I share THE OBSERVATION that most \"creative writing teachers\" would bitch about his \"run-on sentences,\" I could not put the book down sometimes-- as it kept me plugging away at the poetic, juicy verbage and stayed with my mind as though -I_ was the one thinking these thoughts. Am I nearly as intelligent as the character/writer=== heavens no, but did that matter=== most certainly not. Although Sheil's passion to tell and describe can get dense and close to entangled, for me anyway-- he never lost my interest or connection with the character and his mindset, despite there being more than a few topics discussed that I am not well-versed in or possess the vocabulary to quite grapple with (bedside companion every tenth page for this novel: a dictionary, and, if you're really committed, have internet accessibility for some of the geographic, literary and historical musings).Anyway, worth reading--- resounding YES. Disappointment--- ditto. Maybe, like one reviewer said, it was 1901, and he was writing for an audience of sorts, so, I dunno... Anyway, pick it up. Read the \"virtuosity in the service of SOMETHING TO SAY\" for the first 170 pages or so, and then get out one of those handy \"Choose Your Adventure\" books from being a kid and enjoy your probably more satisfying ending, although, I doubt you'll be able to couch it in the superior and worthy language of this ridiculously gifted master.By the way, wondered if maybe this was the book that Jimi was reading when he wrote \"Purple Haze,\" as I had always heard it was partially inspired by the sci-fi that Hendrix liked to read. Of course, I willingly applied this book to New Order's \"Blue Monday\" meanings also, probably to my detriment. Maybe, Barney, \"Purple Monday\" instead? I guess with Prince on the horizon that was a no go-- heh heh.","Most of the text of this fascinating novel involves the adventures of one man who is absolutely alone in the world. It is not everyone who can handle a novel with only one character, and this a character who of necessity must be insane. Shiel manages to deal with this very well. He mitigates the horror by having the millions of dead bodies fail to rot or stink. The ending is rather sentimental. It might have been more effective if Adam had not met his Eve.","I ordered an old paperback and was delighted to see it was in good condition. It was as described by mab1218 and the price was very good. I was especially pleased with the service of mab1218 because I received my order in a matter of days. So it was beyond my expectation and I am a satisfied customer.","Lovecraft mentioned this novel in his \"Supernatural Horror In Literature\" essay, and had good things to say about it. The novel deserves the good words. The first half, before our hero finds the inevitable woman to complete him, is really dark. A man alone, totally alone, with only corpses around him. I think that would send me \"over the edge\", too. Shiel captures the pathos of the situation well. Unlike Lovecraft, though, I like the \"romantic\" ending. At least the human race will not die out. This is well worth reading.","I call The Purple Cloud a fantastic fossil because that's what it is. That is not a criticism. I gave it 5 stars. It's simply that the fact it was written in 1911 shows -- both good and bad. Some of the science is off the wall, but I assume accurate for the day. The novel has a fantastic, hypnotic beginning set in the arctic. Like the jungle of Tarzan (written, I think, about the same time), this arctic landscape never existed, but it's a fantastic place of torment for the hero. Why is this book worth reading? The writing is hyptnotic. They don't write like that anymore. Dense, lush with an incredible poetic language, we follow the hero's solitary wanderings across an empty earth. This is a story of the last man on earth. This is a fossil, an archetype for all the later stories about the last man left alive on earth. A purple cloud came by and killed all while the hero was racing to the North Pole. What carries you along is the hero's interior as he undergoes one slow painful change within himself after another as he searches for another survivor, Does he find anyone? That's for the reader to learn. When you see the movies The Omega Man, The Quiet Earth, The Night of the Comet(this is a comedy) and all the other last man on earth movies, this was the great granddaddy of them all.","A cloud of gas that smells like peach blossom kills nearly every everyone in the world. Adam Jeffson is the only man left. He spends years looking for other people, wandering through the remains of civilization.One of the benefits of being the last man on Earth is that you would have the freedom to do whatever you want. The planet would be literally yours. Adam takes advantage of this. He becomes more and more eccentric, travelling around the world, burning cities to the ground. He wants to wipe out all trace of humanity, to make it look as if the human race had never existed. This could be put down to a symptom of Adam's growing madness - a madness caused by enforced solitude.The premise is a good one. &quot;The Purple Cloud&quot; sounds like an HG Wells novel in style. The language is a bit flowery, but I didn't mind that. (The book was published in the early 1900's after all.) When you read this book you travel around the world with Adam and find the same thing - emptyness, stillness, silence. How would you cope?In 1959 a film called &quot;The World, the Flesh and the Devil&quot; was released. It was supposedley based on &quot;The Purple Cloud&quot;, but it had nothing to do with MP Shiel's story.","No one has yet succeeded in reaching the North Pole, and a new British expedition is mounted. As our protagonist, Adam, returns from the arctic, all the humans and many of the animals he encounters are dead. Adam travels all over the world, looking for other living people and, understandably, going kind of bonkers.I wanted to like this book more. Early in the book, Adam finds himself in many morally challenging situations, but he has these voices in his head that more or less compel him to act in certain ways, so the reader is prevented from really entering into any moral struggles with him. I liked the writing, but each place Adam goes is essentially like the rest--everyone's dead--and I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. Near the end, something finally did, but then I mostly wanted to slap Adam around for being so dense.Maybe I'm just jaded from reading too many post-apocalyptic stories and that's why I'm not more enthusiastic about this book. If you're new to this sort of story, you might find this book to be a powerful exploration of loneliness and the meaning of human society and human life. A similar but much better post-apocalyptic novel is Cormac McCarthy's \"The Road.\"","This is the first and best science fiction book I read. I searched for another copy of it for 20 years until I found one on Amazon.com. I read it once again and loved it just as much as the first time. It takes you on a most fantastic voyage, never to be forgotten. Full of great adventure and excitement, I love this book!","This is the typical English disaster story in its earliest stages. Think John Wyndham, John Christopher, J.G.Ballard -- maybe the average English sf writer is a total loner and what he's really writing is wish-fulfillment!.... This book does have a quality all its own, vaguely reminiscent of William Hope Hodgson and I enjoy the old-fashioned textures. If you're at all interested in the origins of the genre, this would reward you on that score alone.","I got halfway through this book some six months ago and then just put it down for a while. Finally picked it back up and finished it today, and I must admit, for being an ancestor of the post-apocalyptic, last-man-on-earth genre, it carries some unique qualities.On the downside, this was just a difficult read, period. The prose was incredibly dense: sometimes an entire page was but one run-on sentence! No paragraph breaks, few semicolons, and even fewer commas. I tried to make an audio version of this book, and found I could not pitch the sentences properly, since I could not see their end!I'm quite practiced at reading, writing, and speaking, always at the head of my class even into the graduate level. That being said, this book almost *wasn't* English, not as modern-day Americans understand it, at least. I have a rather sizable vocabulary, but this was the first book to leave me hard-pressed to determine what he was talking about half the time:\"I paced between the oak pwes of the nave - massive stalls they are, separated by Corinthian pilasters ...some little angels with strangely human faces, Greuze-like, supporting the nerves of the apse\" and so on.Honestly, I'd swear he was making up the words half the time. Sentences ran far too long to keep the thread of things easily; I took to scanning over his florid descriptions but cautiously, for the most obscure little phrase within any block of text could trigger something that I would then be unable to understand.That being said, I really liked the book. Along with \"Earth Abides,\" these are the only two books that take their time looking at a world where man just... disappeared. Most post-apocalyptic stories talk about some war-ravaged earth, or one wherein civilization had been thousands of years ago. In stories like that, Earth might as well be Mars for the reader.Contrarily, \"The Purple Cloud\" and \"Earth Abides\" allow the reader to leisurely stroll through a world that, in one sense, looks exactly like always, yet in another, feels inverted, nightmarish in such ordinary alienness. An emptied - yet undamaged - world always feels far more gripping and interesting to me. In this, Shiel most certainly provides.Like I said, getting through his wording is like jogging in sand, and the guy he describes is pretty bizarre, wacked, and selfish, but I still find it a beautiful book, especially as the reader is slowly drawn from the lifelong nightmare of the protagonist's depravity into a beauty he'd never have guessed, let alone dared believe in.Definitely a must-read, a keeper, and a read-again.","make this book really worth reading. I find the descriptions of an empty world chilling, the familiarity with some of the places(in England) making the story at once believable yet terribly strange to me. Shiel is a romantic, bringing the story to an optimistic end for our poor protagonist (hasn't the poor guy suffered enough...!), even though it seems like Leda gets the short end of the stick once more(Victorian women were made of stern stuff!).In the end it is Shiel's rich and unusual descriptive style that really made this book stand out for me and I look on it as something original, captivating and totally refreshing compared to the lame language used in a lot of modern fiction.","It's an experiment that can never be performed, but it's worth thought anyway: how would a man act if there were no one to answer to? Adam Jeffson is that man, and this is his world.Back in 1901, when this was written, parts of the earth's surface remained unmapped, including the north pole. Jeffson is part of the expedition to reach that pole - as sole survivor, he finds it (an actual upright pole, it turns out), and struggles back to civilzation to claim his reward. No one is left to give it, though. During the months of his trek, catastrophic volcanoes unleashed poisonous gasses that cover the world, killing off every bird, beast, and man, except for him alone. At first, he scours the globe in search of other survivors. After years of solitary confinement in the world-wide jail, his civilized spirit fails. He turns to the decadence of drugs and pointless wealth. Decadence turns to active nihilism, a self-declared mission of arson and destruction, a modern Nero who blasts and burns entire cities for his own amusement. Then ... well, I'll try to avoid spoilers, but his name is Adam and 1901 was not an era that tolerated wholly unhappy endings.Just reading history books won't tell you how nervous that era was. Political tremors were building up to the quake that triggered the first world war. Medicine hadn't made the inroads against disease that modern generations assume, as the 1918 Spanish flu would soon show. The earth itself could turn against mankind, as the 1883 explosion of Krakatoa had shown. Sheil captured that sense of fragility, and his words preserve that sense for today's reader.This book also preserves the style of writing that prevailed back then, something that might be even less familiar today. Think of the effort that moviemakers put into the special effects of today's media, then realize that writing was that era's medium. The pyrotechnics are all there, but in the florid vocabulary of the writing.The story is a fair one, and could work well if recast as a modern adventure movie. More than that, though, \"The Purple Cloud\" records the fears, the values, and the literary style at the turn of the last century. It succeeds at many levels.-- wiredweird","This book indeed establishes the \"Last Man on Earth\" genre. The main character had an encyclopedic knowledge which seemed a bit of a stretch at times; he was a scientist who had an amazing ability to sail the seven seas alone. He was also an architect who managed to build a palace all by himself. His grasp of world cultures was astounding. But, aside from that, the book was entertaining, along the same lines as Robinson Crusoe.","This book explores the effect of an apocalyptic event on the mind and behaviour of an individual symbolically named Adam, who is literally the \"last man on earth.\" Written in 1901 by an author only recently rescued from obscurity, the novel tracks the deterioration of Adam's psyche after the poisonous purple cloud of the title wipes out all other members of the human race while he is conveniently away on an expedition to the North Pole. Adam gradually comes to the realization, after arriving back into warmer climes, that he is the sole survivor of the purple cloud. He now has unfettered freedom to do as he wishes without any restraint, but to what purpose?We follow Adam's attempt to cope in these circumstances as he experiences over a 20 year period alternating bouts of depression, euphoria, despair, megalomania, madness, and perhaps final redemption. He is now the master of the world, but alone, and he demonstrates his powers by torching all the world's great cities and undertaking other grandiose projects. All this is told in exacting detail.If an opportunity were to present itself he could be the \"new Adam\", starting a revitalized human race, but he recoils, not wanting to perpetuate what he believes is mankind's failings. Such an opportunity does present itself, however, and without ruining the ending, he faces the dilemma of balancing his principles against love (and lust). That aspect of the story adds some most needed dramatic action.The writing is representative of that era, with long sentences stuffed with dependent and independent clauses and numerous references to ancient historical figures and mythology. Also, get out your dictionary! I found it a bit of a slog to push through the middle part of the book after his initial searches for other survivors proved unsuccessful. After all, how hard is it to convince us that a person in that situation will go crazy?This book is recommended for sci-fi fans curious about an important historical rendering of the \"last man\" sub-genre and who are curious about an author who apparently was an influence on Stephen King.","I call The Purple Cloud a fantastic fossil because that's what it is.

Of his race toward the Pole, Adam relates, \"...I sped, I spun, with grinning teeth that chattered and gibbered, and eyeballs of distraction: for a Fear, too--most cold and dreadful--had its hand of ice upon my heart....\"The second section unfortunately drags somewhat as Adam relates with numbing detail of his search of town after town and of underground caves and mines for survivors. Only when Adam begins his frenzy of burning does the narrative again come alive, as he watches the burning of London while smoking opium, drinking wine, and playing the harp.The last section features an entirely different tone, as Adam progresses toward reason and hope. Although the story line is more than a bit illogical (if that can even be said of this kind of novel), the ending is very satisfactory.This novel cannot be judged by modern standards, certainly, but it can be judged as a product of its time. Those who appreciate H. G. Wells, H. P. Lovecraft, H. Rider Haggard, and others in this vein will really appreciate this \"forgotten classic.\"","Started out pretty interesting. Middle was a little drawn out. Ending was a head scratcher. I was looking for a interesting ending to make up for the slow middle and,,,,,nothing.Keep in mind that this was written at the turn of the century so wording and writing style are consistent with that time and takes some getting used to,","After reading the reviews on this book, and learning what the plot was about, I was excited to give this book a try.Unfortunately, I really got bogged down in the details as the author describes the main character's journey to London. He could have tidied that part up a bit, perhaps shortening it dramatically to give the story the opportunity to breathe. Instead, it became such a chore to slog through each page that I finally just gave up.Disappointed...should have been a much better book.","Early on, this story impressed me. Well written, good story line, good syntax, minimal expletives,courageous main character--all features of a good read. When the protagonist and the reader realize that he (we) are it, the last guy, the Lone Ranger, the only chip left in the bag--then it falls apart. He begins to dither. The author starts writing the same thing in different ways. It's like he had to fill his quota of words for the book. Other reviewers describe him as going crazy, but I think he just went boring. Anyone can write bad stuff (like this review?) but I was expecting better.","I had trouble with this book at first. If it were printed today, it would be a very fat book. It's printed with a tiny font [most editions] and written in very formal English. It reminded me of Jules Verne. It should be on every science fiction fans list of read books.The story is basically post-apocalyptic, with spiritual undertones. No zombies or roving bands of starving people, more psychological. The main character is tormented, inventive, destructive - engaging.","Like many a reviewer above, I found this book to be totally word-tasty and directly emotional. I described it to a friend as \"virtuosity in the service of SOMETHING TO SAY.\" I hadn't finished the book at that point, so, maybe I'm just one of those people who got to the end and just went, \"really, is that all?\" I like to think of this as \"Lost before Lost.\" That might be kinda cheapening the talent that is gushing from this novel, but the two do share a few things.Without spoiling it for you if you haven't read it, the writer introduces rather a few exciting mysteries and possibilities and just lets them hang and die \"back on page 33\" or whatever/wherever that I found most depressing, unsatisfying and kind of lazy. Anyway, in between you get some of the most intelligent, informed and yet absolute stream-of-consciousness writing I've parsed in my years. And although I share THE OBSERVATION that most \"creative writing teachers\" would bitch about his \"run-on sentences,\" I could not put the book down sometimes-- as it kept me plugging away at the poetic, juicy verbage and stayed with my mind as though -I_ was the one thinking these thoughts. Am I nearly as intelligent as the character/writer=== heavens no, but did that matter=== most certainly not. Although Sheil's passion to tell and describe can get dense and close to entangled, for me anyway-- he never lost my interest or connection with the character and his mindset, despite there being more than a few topics discussed that I am not well-versed in or possess the vocabulary to quite grapple with (bedside companion every tenth page for this novel: a dictionary, and, if you're really committed, have internet accessibility for some of the geographic, literary and historical musings).Anyway, worth reading--- resounding YES. Disappointment--- ditto. Maybe, like one reviewer said, it was 1901, and he was writing for an audience of sorts, so, I dunno... Anyway, pick it up. Read the \"virtuosity in the service of SOMETHING TO SAY\" for the first 170 pages or so, and then get out one of those handy \"Choose Your Adventure\" books from being a kid and enjoy your probably more satisfying ending, although, I doubt you'll be able to couch it in the superior and worthy language of this ridiculously gifted master.By the way, wondered if maybe this was the book that Jimi was reading when he wrote \"Purple Haze,\" as I had always heard it was partially inspired by the sci-fi that Hendrix liked to read. Of course, I willingly applied this book to New Order's \"Blue Monday\" meanings also, probably to my detriment. Maybe, Barney, \"Purple Monday\" instead? I guess with Prince on the horizon that was a no go-- heh heh.","Most of the text of this fascinating novel involves the adventures of one man who is absolutely alone in the world. It is not everyone who can handle a novel with only one character, and this a character who of necessity must be insane. Shiel manages to deal with this very well. He mitigates the horror by having the millions of dead bodies fail to rot or stink. The ending is rather sentimental. It might have been more effective if Adam had not met his Eve.","I ordered an old paperback and was delighted to see it was in good condition. It was as described by mab1218 and the price was very good. I was especially pleased with the service of mab1218 because I received my order in a matter of days. So it was beyond my expectation and I am a satisfied customer.","Lovecraft mentioned this novel in his \"Supernatural Horror In Literature\" essay, and had good things to say about it. The novel deserves the good words. The first half, before our hero finds the inevitable woman to complete him, is really dark. A man alone, totally alone, with only corpses around him. I think that would send me \"over the edge\", too. Shiel captures the pathos of the situation well. Unlike Lovecraft, though, I like the \"romantic\" ending. At least the human race will not die out. This is well worth reading."],

      "reviews.text":["This wonderful novel by Yvonne Navarro features a plague-ridden earth ruled by vampires. The surviving humans are being used as a blood bank by the vampires, who are immune to the plague. But a small group of humans begins to fight back... Yvonne Navarro's characters are excellently drawn, and very believable. And it's a good, scary read as well. If you liked I Am Legend, you'll love this book!!! Currently available only on disc from the author - see her info on this page!","Vampirism spreads across the world like a plague. As humanity dies out for the exception of a few bands of people that hold out in the city. Scavenging by day and hiding by night. A small group of people come together to fight the cause of the plague, and to save the few survivors that are kept and bred like cattle by the head vampire. A quasi &quot;I Am Legend&quot; like novel with a almost spirtual like ending. The book is a page turner, and was my first introduction to Navarro's works.","How many vampire novels are out there? I can't begin to count the number of them that I've read in the past. Some are fantastic, a lot are really good, and still more are pretty darn bad. Fortunately, Navarro has given us a really, really good vampire novel set in Chicago in the aftermath of a vampiric plague that has ravaged the earth.A relatively small group of human survivors exists in downtown Chicago. They don't know about each other because they all live in fear simply trying to survive each night while the vampires stalk for food. Anyelet is the queen vampire who decided not too long ago to create more of her kind in order to not have to hide her existence. Unfortunately, this quickly grew out of hand, and now the vampires must scrounge for a food source. Navarro gives us a story telling us what happens when these few humans and these powerful vampires clash, and the struggle the humans face to free themselves from the plague.This was such an entertaining and creepy novel to read. There were a few passages that actually had me checking over my shoulder to see if anyone was there (I dare you to read the first several pages detailing the doctor's search and discovery mission without shivering). It's no wonder that this novel gained enough attention to warrant a special hardcover release. The story has adventure, vampires, guns, medical experiments, human slaves used as food, and an apocalyptic vision. Afterage is relatively original, well-written, and fun. Sometimes that's exactly what you need in a good, scary read. If you want something refreshing after reading all those other copycat vampire novels, then give this one a try.","AfterAge is a fantastic vampire post apocalyptic thriller no doubt, a different sort of vampire story. This well thought book twists the vampire story to a new dimension of coolness, mixing (in my eyes) a type of zombie esk \"I Am Legend\" type story and that of the plight of a world conquered by vampires, the struggles the humans go through are well portrayed, and really brought to a personal level.Definitely get your hands on this book, you will not be disappointed..And most important.... no stupid sparkly vampires...!!!!!","This is one of the greatest horror masterpieces of all time. I've read hundreds of horror novels and this is easily one of my favorites. Deserves to be right up there with I Am Legend. I wish Navarro had kept this direction instead of writing books for teenage girls. Though, the \"Impact\"/\"Shadows\" series is a worthy read as well.","Posted 04/11/11: This Vampire scenario is believable. It was fascinating and apocalyptic without being too dark. It was an enjoyable read and I highly recommend it to all the Vampire lovers out there."],

      "description":"In 1958, after the death of Pius XII and the unforeseen election of Guiseppe Roncalli as his successor, a revolutionary change began to rock the Catholic Church. Young seminarians who were studying for the priesthood during that time were profoundly affected by the radical changes initiated by Pope John XXIII and also by the often- virulent opposition from other members of the hierarchy. Confessions of a Serial Celibate is the account of one such seminarian whose life was profoundly transformed during those turbulent days. With poignant wit and honesty, the author describes his sometimes painful journey of faith, from the security of rules and dogma, to the ambiguities of social concern, and eventually to the freedom of laughter and detachment. Central to this journey is the author's gradual recognition of what he calls the \"Catholic Operating System,\" that underlying behavioral program which has determined the thoughts and actions of Catholics for the last seventeen hundred years. Anyone who has begun to perceive a discrepancy between organized religion and his or her own spiritual values will find Confessions of a Serial Celibate a stimulating and enjoyable read.",

      "reviews.text":["The depth of the characters and their adventures kept me glued throughout the story.However, it's not really a science fiction story. That is, science does not drive the story--the characters do. And although I was a little surprised with how Book One ended, I still want to see what's next for these characters.","I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from The Coyoteman Chronicles. I knew it was a post-apocalyptic fantasy, but I feared it might be built around some type of shamanism or New Age philosophy that would take precedence over the actual story. I needn't have worried because Las Vegas Rite is truly an enjoyable novel - and a meaningful one. In many ways, it's a coming of age story, its lessons magnified by the fact that the central character's coming of age coincides with his introduction to actual human society (in its post-apocalyptic form). The protagonist's journey outside his very insular world is truly a rite of passage in every sense of the word, and his spirit guide, the Coyoteman, is a source of ancient and mysterious wisdom.It's not entirely clear what happened to human society, but \"The Change\" of eighteen years ago saw virtually all social institutions burst apart at the seams (not surprisingly, the trouble all started in California). Phil, Diana, and their infant son Taine escaped the growing insanity and violence of Pasadena and its nearby environs by heading for the hills; along the way they met a man named Hardin, and it was he who basically established the family unit in a remote location with the means to survive on their own. After Hardin died, the Coyoteman began appearing to young Taine, seemingly as an imaginary friend full of guidance and wisdom. Now eighteen, Taine has decided that the time has come for him to leave the only home he has ever known and see what is out there to be found in the world his parents left behind. The population has been greatly reduced by the sufferings of the past, but the end of civilization had not brought about the end of mankind (although a kind man might now be hard to find). Following the sometimes cryptic advice and warnings of the Coyoteman, Taine works his way to a deserted town ripe for exploring, whereupon he gets his first furtive look at his fellowman. Eventually, he finds his way to Las Vegas, a dangerous place run as a personal fiefdom under the self-appointed King Peter. It is a whole new world for Taine, and he engages himself quite fully in the experience (especially when it comes to Peter's beautiful young charge Veronica, as well as a young revolutionary named Joanne). Still, there is much about this new life that goes against Taine's principals, and Coyoteman still appears from time to time to point his young charge back toward the path of his destiny.Las Vegas Rite is an insightful and almost profound novel punctuated by enigmatic truths that actually energize the events and experiences of Taine's journey. Each chapter in Taine's life serves as an instructive vignette on various themes of an enlightening sort. Through it all, Taine grows into an increasingly noble young man. The taste of sin lingers in his mouth but grows increasingly acrid to him, as his thoughts never stray very far from home.The author's pen name, Canis Latrans, is the scientific term for coyote, and he does seem to stand somewhat apart from mankind. Taking on the spiritual mantle of the coyote (combining Native American spirituality with Zen philosophy), he seeks to offer a unique interpretation of mankind and this thing we call life. The quotes at the beginning of each chapter, the words of the Coyoteman, and a couple of illustrative intermissions all represent the voice of the coyote, if I understand things correctly. This literary device, if I may call it that, really sets this novel apart, making Las Vegas Rite as instructive as it is exciting. You've got to love a novel that succeeds so beautifully on two entirely different levels.","It has been about two decades since Phil and Diana fled the Pasadena area with their infant son Taine as the catastrophe apparently eradicated civilization. They were fortunate to meet up with Harbin when punks killed the man's wife. He took them to his mountain sanctuary where survival became the norm.Encouraged by the Coyoteman, who visits only him, Taine needs to leave to find his mate in what apparently remains of Las Vegas. His father is worried about what his son will find out there while his mother encourages him to do what he must do though she will sorely miss him. The trek for his companion begins with him meeting the first human Ray in Independence besides his parents and the deceased Harbin since he was an infant. However, he also spots some vicious souls who he does not trust. After befriending Ray, Taine heeding Coyoteman continues on, but soon encounters dangerous foes like King Peter and Mendikek, who want to enslave him or kill him. His chances of reaching Vegas seem remote even with Coyoteman to guide him.Mindful of Hiero's Journey, the first Coyoteman tale is a fabulous post-apocalyptic tale. The description above barely touches the action of this action packed science fiction thriller. Taine is a strong protagonist who keeps the tale coherent as he travels a ruined United States; his escapades like opening a can of what he assumes is food provides the perspective of a powerful saga that will have the audience reading this work in one delightful sitting and anticipating further adventures.Harriet Klausner","This is an intelligent, multi-textured book. It's involving, with all the elements of a good story; at the same time causing one to pause occasionally and consider deeper concepts. The author respects his readers' intelligence and avoids overexplaining the many subtle insights and messages tucked away like little treasures within a dramatic tale. The format is fun, and somehow helps prevent us from taking it all too seriously. Coyote slips in and out, speaks in riddles, and is as elusive as some of the ideas he hints at. I especially liked the quote or saying at the beginning of each chapter, which then goes on to somehow comment or elaborate on it. The author has a real talent with words. He \"plays\" them like an expressive musician, and he can describe something mundane in such a way as to truly create the actual experience and sensations of it. He also creates believable and clever dialog. His wry sense of humor adds yet another dimension, and all in all I found this book to be both delightful and thought provoking. I'm very much looking forward to the next book of the series.","Anyone who is interested in excellent science fiction will enjoy this book.. It's well-written and fun to read. I look forward to Book 2 and hope it will appear soon!","A coyote-ish fictional escapade that ranges from realism to fantasy to soft-porn. All the characters, from the hero Taine to the brutish, 'Big Mikey', seem astonishingly real. And unlike a lot of tedious apocalypse stories, this one is more of a voyage of discovery. If I were to criticize anything of this book, it would be that it's too short. I want to know what happens next. But based on the title, I expect I won't have too long to wait."],

The main characters in the book are Sander and Fanyi. Sander is a young blacksmith`s apprentice, who is set to inherit his father`s position as Master Blacksmith. At the time of his father`s death, Sander`s uncle, Ibbert, who is also a blacksmith, denies him his rightful position as Master Blacksmith and assumes the role for himself.Sander will not accept his uncle`s decision, and leaves his nomadic tribe that dwells in the plains of the west. Sander set out to the east lands by the sea,in search of forgotten technology. To have knowledge of metal forging from the past would surely give Sander the power to overtake his uncle`s role as Master Blacksmith. On Sander`s way to the east, he teams up with a woman named Fanyi, who is a cross between Zena`s Linda Lawless and the talk show host Lezza. Fanyi not only has beauty and brawn, but also brains and finesse. I enjoyed reading this book, with adventure around every corner and a verity of mutant creatures. The reading is easy, and the author does not insist on technical terms that would have you reaching for your dictionary after each turn of the page. I would recommend this book to young readers or adults who get bored with lengthy, hard-to-read novels. Our characters end up finding more than what they seek. The way they find their sought knowledge is unexpected and exciting.Andre Norton is a exciting science fiction writer, with a down-to-earth technique that does not play on vulgar expressions to entice his reader.

I thank him.","I've been reading Andre since the 70's, and while the book was okay, it didn't thrill me like most of his work.","Norton wrote this when this type of story was still fresh in 1952. It was an era that produced some of the finest of these stories ever written, including Walter M. Miller's masterpiece. Against Miller's work, this one struggled to hold my attention. I am a Norton fan, and certainly didn't expect it to resemble any style but Norton's. The story of mankind's struggle to learn about their ancestors' ways before nuclear destruction, and the struggle to regain some of the lost knowledge while seeking to avoid a repeat of past mistakes, is pretty straightforward here. The message of the story seemed obvious and cliched. It probably was not yet cliched when it was written, but it is obvious enough for even the youngest readers to comprehend.Messages and lessons aside, you will enjoy it if you enjoy any of Norton's work. There's no mistaking her style, and it is evident here. The adventure is solid, action is swift and suspenseful, and an outcast character named Fors becomes the star. His companion is a mutated cat, as he steals a map and leaves his clan to journey in search of lost cities and knowledge. The story follows Fors as he encounters prejudice and tribal warfare, and tries to encourage cooperation among tribes to combat a common enemy. The nature of the Star Men, from Fors' own clan, is not revealed until the end, and it is one of the brighter moments of the story. As an adventure story, this is as competent as any Norton book. As a memorable or thoughtful statement of the futility of warfare, it is far less successful.","Star Man's Son (1952) is a post-apocalyptic novel that takes place about two centuries after the Great-Blowup. This story is also entitled Daybreak - 2250 AD in reprint editions.The cause of the catastrophe is unknown, but the effect are quite obvious. Much of the population was killed by the immediate effects of nuclear bombs, many others died later from the direct radiation and fallout from those bombs, and many more died from induced radioactivity, plague and starvation. Many plants and animals had been mutated into unrecognizable and deadly forms. Only a few humans survived and many of these were also mutated into Beast Things and other horrible creatures in the \"blue cities\" where radioactivity lingered. A very few survivors, however, received beneficial mutations that improved their chances of survival, but the seemingly normal survivors generally feared and hated any and every mutant.Fors is the son of Langdon, a Star Man, a far ranging explorer and leader of the Eyrie, and a woman that Langdon had meet down on the plains. Although Langdon was seemingly normal, Fors has inherited white hair from his mother, a mutation viewed with suspicion by the other residents of the Eyrie. While Langdon was alive, he protected Fors from most of the fear and hatred, but then Langdon was killed by Beast Things on an exploration into a far city and the men who find him bring back only a few of his belongings.After that, Fors was mostly ignored in his efforts to become a Star Man like his father. He has been adopted by Lura, a great hunting cat, and has made his own sword, knive, bow, and arrows as required. His father, a master teacher among the Star Men, had already ensured before his death that Fors knows all that is required. Nevertheless, the Council has passed over him for five years and tomorrow he will have to give up his weapons and become a tiller of the soil. As he ponders his options, Fors conceives a bold plan and immediately starts gathering supplies and equipment, including his father's pouch, for a great journey to search for the lost city in the north that was never bombed and thus is safe for scavengers.Although Fors has tried to hide them, he has some unusual talents that will help him on his trek: he is able to communicate empathically with Lura and he has much better night vision than most humans. Moreover, he has other, more subtle talents that manifest as he travels.This story is based on the premise that mankind will come close to destroying himself and this premise is found in many other works by the author. In many respects, it is a reflection of the worldview of the Cold War era, but it persists even in recent SF stories. In most of Norton's tales, this apocalyptic vision was like Pandora's box, in that there was an element of hope among all the horrors of war.Recommended for Norton fans and anyone who enjoys a mostly optimistic story of the possible future.-Arthur W. Jordin","This was one of the first science fiction novels that I ever read, and the ideas and images in it have stayed with me all this time. Nor is it really \"dated\", it could all still happen- only it is now 250 years into the future instead of 300.This is the story of Lars of the Puma clan, of the people of the Smoking Mountains. Lars's father was of the famed Star Men- explorers of the blasted wilderness beyond the mountain stronghold of the Star Hall. The brotherhood of Star Men sought to carry on the tradition of their research scientist ancestors- to seek out new knowledge for the betterment of the tribe- and of the world. This was to be Lars's destiny also, except that his father failed to return from his last mission and there was no one to speak for him at the last choosing of apprentices. So, rather than accept the insult of a lesser life, Lars took up his sword, bow, and his father's pouch, and along with his great mutant hunting cat, Lura, went out to find the great lost city of the Old Ones that his father's last journal entry spoke of.Published in 1952 this was one of the first post-apocalyptic novels. It is also one of the most believable. Even in light of current knowledge you still find it believable.One other thing, in spite of the tales about the unimaginable horror of nuclear war, this book was about hope. You see, even after you press that big \"reset\" button, mankind will yet find a way to survive; the great cycle of re-civilization from the ruins of former greatness will start again. If you were a kid growing up during the Cold War this was an important message to keep at the back of your mind.","I can't believe that I never read more of this lady's books! I remember reading at least 3 of her novels back when I was a young'un, and I wasn't all that enthralled to read more. I read the time traders and iron cage and none of them was as good as this one in my opinion.I'm currently reading The Beastmaster and it's already good.Starman's Son was a good, fun, fast read full of action and adventure, full of cool and rich characters of both human and animal. A must read!","As an 11-year old reading this in '76, the rat-mutants (yes, some creepy illustrations in the hardback copy at the Beaumont, TX Public Library) were deliciously twisted outcome of mankind's nuclear idiocy. I was firmly convinced at that age that nuclear oblivion would occur before the year 2000. Sifting through bombed out cities looking for unspoilt, unradiated tins of food from centuries previous, the hero battles odds, overcomes fear, and brings hope in the end. Nice.","StarMan's SonThis was the very first Science Fiction book that I ever read, my Brother had purchased the paperback version sometime in the 1950's and was kind enough to let me read it, I was \"hooked\" then and still am, Andre Norton shall never die as long as she has readers.This is about a young boy Lars of the Puma clan; Lars's father was a Star Man- explorers of the blasted wilderness beyond the mountain stronghold of the Star Hall. The brotherhood of Star Men sought to carry on the tradition of their research scientist ancestors- to seek out new knowledge for the betterment of the tribe- and of the world. Unfortunately Lars was a mutant, and his mutation was very apparent, his hair was white, and the Clan had not accepted him. What was not so apparent was that he had the ability to telepathically communicate with his great hunting cat, Lura. When Lars's Father failed to return from his last mission Lars snuck out of his village to explore the vast Wilderness , rather than accept the insult of a lesser life, Lars took up his sword, bow, and his father's pouch, and along with his great mutant hunting cat, Lura, went out to find the great lost city of the Old Ones that his father's last journal entry spoke of.Published in 1952 this was one of the first post-apocalyptic novels.

If you were a kid growing up during the Cold War this was an important message to keep at the back of your mind.I believe that this was the first book that I used a lined 3 X 5 card as a bookmark. Anytime I came across a word that I wasn't 100% sure of the meaning I wrote in on the lined 3 X 5 card. At the end of the book, I would write down the word and the definition into my personal Lexicon. Over the years I found that there were fewer words on the 3 X 5 cards. Science fiction seems to have an unwritten rule that the author must use a wide vocabulary.I strongly recommend this book to every teenager who wants to discover the exciting world of Science Fiction and to their parents who want to improve their reading ability and their vocabulary. You might want to do the lined 3 X 5 card thing, also.Gunner May, 2008","I read this book as a pre-teen, and it has remained at the top of my list since. Fors was my hero of many an imagined adventure of my youth. It is admitadly dated now, but I still recomend it to someone who enjoys a good sci-fi book, especially a young reader.","A fun read with an admirable message about the necessity of cooperation among all peoples if we are to avoid destruction. It's interesting that humanity requires a common enemy, the Beast Things, in order to unite it. This displays a realistic understanding of human psychology that is undermined to some extent by an ending in which everything is wrapped up a bit too tidily. There is a problem with pacing--the most exciting scenes occur in the middle of the story. Also, the Beast Things just never seemed like a particularly menacing presence outside of the abandoned cities which were their lairs. More of the novel should have happened there.","You've probably seen dozens of books that are about &quot;post-apocalyptic&quot; adventures, but this is the one that started them all. Its the Greatest! Like all of Andre Norton's stories it contains colorful characters, imaginative settings, and good plots which are interesting. Plus the author blends a good deal of drama into the adventurous storyline. Read about the adventures of &quot;Fors&quot; and learn why he is venturing into the ruins of ancient cities.","My daughters both enjoy reading science fiction. While discussing The Hunger Games, I told them about Starman's Son. Although I had forgotten a lot of the details or perhaps didn't understand them fully as a young teen, I do recall it being one my favorite books. I am anxious to read it again and share it with kids.","I read this as a kid back in the 1970s and always remembered it. The adventures were so appealing that, as a middle-schooler, I half hoped that the Cold War would blow up just so I could get out of the tedium of public school and become an explorer of the ruins too. I read it again while on vacation this year and it was a page turner... a classic post-apocalypse novel with mutants galore."],

      "reviews.text":["I read this book over 10 years ago and the memory of its beauty still haunts me. The prose was so elegant and so precise that I could taste, smell and feel the sensations being described on paper. The world of a post-nuclear holocaust oppressed by a rigid social and political structure should have been ugly and unpleasant, but quite the opposite--it was enchanting and thrilling.Three scenes from the book I remember particularly: the richly clad prince wandering among blossoms of ylang-ylang (altho' it's been so long since I read this it may have been jasmine); an erotic encounter between the bandit Derweet (a beautiful woman disguised as a handsome man) and his/her computer-generated servant, the lovely child, Cho ( I felt as tho' I, too, were being ravished); the slipping, sliding journey that Cho takes in search of her brother down the mountains of southeast China that have been melted into glass by nuclear blasts. Nor can I forget the creature that lends her name to the book as its title, \"Divine Endurance,\" the small, brown, wise, tough-talking little cat that accompanies Cho in her travels.Gwyneth Jones has a subtle imagination and a deep understanding of human nature. You experience this beautiful book rather than merely reading it.","By the time that Chosen Among the Beautiful (Cho) makes her way from the broken palace to the great lake, we are clear about a few things. Neither she or her cat, Divine Endurance, are what they seem and this is not your typical science fiction/fantasy novel.This is my second book by Gwyneth Jones. I decided to pick up Divine Endurance after being extremely impressed with Bold As Love. Sadly little known in the US, Jones is an award-winning British science fiction and fantasy author. She is justly famed for her inventiveness and the quality of her prose. Divine Endurance was her first novel.This post-apocalyptic Indonesia is an amazing and real place-- full of myths and shattered shards of society. Cho, her brother Worthy to Be Beloved, and the mysterious Divine Endurance are relics from the disasterous past-- angel dolls which act as a catalyst for change in the struggling world.If Divine Endurance has a flaw as a novel, it is largely that the world and the characters are better developed than the plot. It reminded me in many ways of The Etched City, by K.J. Bishop, although I think that the Jones book is ultimately more successful.If you are looking for something unusual and are a fan of dystopic or post-apocalypse science fiction (China Mieville, Sean McMullen) then I suggest that you give Divine Endurance a try. Certainly if you are a fan of any kind of intelligent science fiction or fantasy, then you should become familiar with Gwyneth Jones.","Divine Endurance, by Gwyneth Jones (first published 1987)Bottom line: A painful, sad meditation on what it would mean for humanity to be given what it needs--not what it thinks it needs--to be entirely at peace.Trigger warnings: Rape implied (in the past, not of a main character), shaming of barrenness, forced castration, prostitution out of need and social ostracism, child slavery, drug abuse, death of main characters, loss of a significant other, racism with resulting persecution and genocide, kidnapping, sex with a partner who appears to be a minor (looks 15 years old but is actually much older)How does it treat women/same-sex relationships? In the novel's post-apocalyptic society, women are the governing heads of society, ruling in seclusion. Men have no power in government and carry out day-to-day tasks, look pretty, and practice the arts. Castrated men, called boys, take care of menial tasks. Neither boys nor men are treated poorly, but it's clear they're lower on the social totem pole than women. F/m sex is controlled by the governing women. Young women have sex with assigned partners when they come of age. If they bear children, they're accepted into the governing body of women; if not, they're considered failed women and ostracized. Tensions between the genders are still very strong and in many ways identical to those of the present day, except in reverse. Same-sex love seems to be accepted and not frowned on, whereas different-sex (sexual romantic) love seems to be taboo, beyond the sexual encounters prescribed by the government.Does it have explicit sex scenes?: It has non-explicit sex scenes, in which f/f couples initiate sex and then fade to black.Would I read it again? Yes. It's fragile, sad, and horribly bleak, but it also has a thread of hope in it.Would I publish it? Yes. I'd ask for Jones to clarify a few passages where I wasn't certain which characters were doing what.This is an enormously sad book. In the post-apocalyptic future, only a small portion of humanity clings to life and civilization (the novel is set in a far-future version of the mainland and island countries bordering on the South China Sea). Divine Endurance, a bio-engineered cat android, and Cho (short for Chosen Among the Beautiful), the last of a line of androids/gynoids designed specifically to make people happy (no matter what the cost), leave the dead factory in which Divine Endurance raised Cho and travel out into the dying world of human beings, searching for Cho's brother, Wo (Worthy to Be Beloved). Divine Endurance and Cho discover that the last of humanity is on the edge of war with itself--and how can you make so many hurting, despairing, yet desperate to survive people happy? Cho imprints on Darveet, the last survivor of a royal household that once rebelled against the matriarchal government, taking Darveet as 'her person,' the one particular person she will try hardest to make happy. As a barren, 'failed' woman, someone who simultaneously yearns to be part of the women's secretive government and who sees fatal flaws in it, and as a mixed-race woman, half of the genetically-mutated hill outcasts and half of the genetically-managed royal blood, Darveet's desires are more than complicated and less than definitive. Together, she and Cho meet other women (and men) who strive hard to hope and work for their world's survival.For me, as someone who lives with depression, this book captured the hopelessness that comes with depression, but on a civilization-wide scale--that sense of what does it all come down to? Why not just give up and let it be over? Why does it all hurt so much, for so little? It's a rough read, but a poetic one, with an ending that doesn't shy away from the book's themes but which didn't crush me with its bleakness, either. If you're sad and need catharsis and a sense that someone understands how deep and bad it can be to feel as though everything you could ever do is futile, this is a good book for that; if you're sad and need something to take your mind off of the fact, this isn't a good book for *that.*It's worth reading. I've never read a novel about the slow end of the world that might follow the fast end of the world of a global apocalypse--the end of the world that would still take hundreds of years to sputter out, with human beings trying until the last minutes of the species to keep going.","When I bought the oriiginal Arbor House edition of this wonderful book, it started a lifelong relationship between Gwyneth's work and me as her devoted reader.Drawn to the cover (I'm a devout cat person) and intrigued about the locale (I've been drawn to that part of the world ever since it was used by Poul Anderson to create his off-world setting for Earthman Go Home) the deal was sealed by her great prose style and the sense of wonder she creates.In no way predictable, but in every way plausible, this is a book to treasure and re-read (as I have done, with a reading copy.)Somehow I've bought but have not yet to any Ann Halam books, but anything by \"Gwyneth\" goes right on top of the on-deck list as I've loved her rock and roll quintet, The Spirit of Bois Dumont, and her great books of criticism.","Too bad the author forgot to write a story. :(It's really too bad. The premise is wonderful and the writing is great. However the characters are so sterile that I simply don't care about them in the least. This book reminds me of fine crystal. Sharp, beautiful but cold and, in the end without meaning."],

The surface is dominated by a group collectively called the Mutes (for Mutants) and the Iron Lords (Japanese that occupy the eastern US). Steve Brickman, the hero starts out as a shining member of the USA's flying force (called a Cloud Warrior by the Mutes), but finds himself in a number of intrigues that run a total of 6 books. Great reading. duellist@interserv.co","I read many SF books, many of these involve a post-apocalyptic earth. None of these books has kept me as enthralled as the Amtrak Wars series has. Patrick Tilley gives such depth and detail to his characters and locations that you find yourself rooting for Steve Brickman and his mute friends as they face the might of the Federation. I would definitely recommend this and the other books but only if you have a lot of free time on your hands because I guarantee that you will not be able to put it down and, when you have finnished it, you will want to start all over again (I did). Five stars.","Steven Roosevelt Brickman returns to the Amtrak Federation after five months of captivity by the Mutes. He thinks he will be a hero - a brave survivor bringing back valuable intelligence that the Mutes are a lot smarter and have a lot more resources than is believed. Instead, he is stripped of everything and consigned to the A-levels to work out his life as the lowest of the low, maintaining the environmental systems the allow the underground Federation to function. And then he is offered a way out, plus a return to the overground. Steve's loyalties are about to be put under even more pressure than before . . .\"First Family\" is as good as \"Cloud Warrior\", though it feels more claustrophobic. That's no surprise, though, as that's exactly how Steve is feeling himself as he re-enters his old life. There's perhaps a little less action, but action is not really the point of this book. Despite the importance of the plot, \"First Family\" is a scene-setter: from it, we learn a lot more about the Mutes and the Amtrak Federation, and especially the manipulations that have affected Steve's life since birth. The First Family - whom we actually meet - view him as a tiny cog in a very large machine, theirs to use at will. Whether he proves to be valuable or dangerous, they'll use him as much as possible. And Steve is still too naive to realise exactly what his situation is.\"First Family\" also sets up the action for the coming books. Roz and Jodi are reintroduced, and we meet two other Trackers who will be very important later, Kelso and Malone. And Steve accepts a dangerous mission from Mr Snow which is played out in the third book, \"Iron-Master\".It's sad and frustrating to see how Steve is manipulated by those around him, despite his cleverness. But he is determined to find the truth and run his own life, and that has just as much impact on the plot as those manipulations.The setting and plot of \"First Family\" are as intriguing as as those of \"Cloud-Warrior\". Just try to ignore the nastiness of the relationship between Steve and Roz.","If you are keen on exploring the tyrannical potential of high technology, you can't do worst than to start here. This is '1984' updated into the info-tech age, makes Winston Smith's life in Airstrip One seem like a totally relaxed seaside holiday in Blackpool! The definitive word in hi-tech dystopia novel, it ranks way up there with 'Brave New World', 'THX 1138', 'The Glass Tower', etc. It is also 1 of the all-time best post-Apocalyptic sci-fi thrillers ever written, IMHO. Cross Adolf Hitler with Bill Gates and Dale Carnegie, stir in Ph.D's for social-psychology and electronic engineering , and you get the 'First Family' of the book's title. A must-read!!! Anyone who knows Patrick's email address pls pls pls contact me - I've been wanting to compliment him personally for a long-while now!","The graphic detail of the book and its plot are nothing short of resplendant. This series is story telling at its best. I believe that I will have a hard time finding another book, series or author, that will come come close to this one. The ending did come as a bit of a shock though. Come on Patrick where's book 7.","A series well worth the late nights spent reading. Where is book seven? On the grapevine a dispute between Tilley and the publisher, regarding movie rights? Does anyone know the truth? Still six of best in anyones language.","Having read all 6 books a couple of times it is still hard to put them down. The detailed description of surroundings and events made me feel like being part of this fantastic adventure. What a tremendous gift to be able to write books like that.

For five years (since the events recounted in Maelstrom), she and her bionic brethren (modified to work in the rift valleys of the ocean floor) have hidden in the mountains of the deep Atlantic. The facility they commandeered was more than a secret station on the ocean floor. Atlantis was an exit strategy for the corporate elite, a place where the world's Movers and Shakers had hidden from the doomsday microbe ßehemoth--and from the hordes of the moved and the shaken left behind. For five years \"rifters\" and \"corpses\" have lived in a state of uneasy truce, united by fear of the outside world. But now that world closes in. An unknown enemy hunts them through the crushing darkness of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. ßehemoth--twisted, mutated, more virulent than ever--has found them already. The fragile armistice between the rifters and their one-time masters has exploded into all-out war, and not even the legendary Lenie Clarke can take back the body count. Billions have died since she loosed ßehemoth upon the world. Billions more are bound to. The whole biosphere came apart at the seams while Lenie Clarke hid at the bottom of the sea and did nothing. But now there is no place left to hide. The consequences of past acts reach inexorably to the very floor of the world, and Lenie Clarke must return to confront the mess she made. Redemption doesn't come easy with the blood of a world on your hands. But even after five years in pitch-black purgatory, Lenie Clarke is still Lenie Clarke. There will be consequences for anyone who gets in her way-and worse ones, perhaps, if she succeeds...

      "reviews.text":["First off, for those of you haven't already read \"Behemoth: B-Max\" (at least) you will definitely want to do so before tackling \"Behemoth: Seppuku\". For reasons that the author explains in the first volume, they constitute one book that was split into two due to pressures in the publishing issue. This novel does not stand alone, and will make no sense without reading the previous volume. Furthermore, there are two other volumes in the series \"Starfish\" and \"Maelstrom\" and while each entry stands on its own fairly well, reading the books in order would definitely be the approach I would recommend.For those of you who are new to the series, here is a brief synopsis that should tell you whether or not these books are for you. Essentially, the story arc is about evolution: human, animal and electronic. By mixing a blend of biology, computer science and chaos theory, author Peter Watts has created a near future Earth where man is simultaneously at the height of his powers and walking the knife's edge of total ecological failure. In an effort to maintain the high standard of Western living mankind has turned to deep sea geothermal power to meet their energy needs. Miles below the ocean, specially engineered humans culled from the dregs of society maintain these power plants. However, what no one could have expected was that they would encounter an organism that would unleash an apocalypse. Part hard science-fiction, part post-apocalyptic, the first two books represent a genuinely original voice in the genre.For those of you who have been eagerly awaiting \"Seppuku\" rest assured the ending is eminently satisfying. Given the two volume approach, it is difficult to offer much in the way of plot details without providing spoilers, but I can say that after the somewhat broader focus of \"Maelstrom\" and \"B-Max\" the story has gone full circle and boiled back down to the most perverse trinity of characters one is likely to find: Lenie Clarke, Ken Lubin and Achilles Desjardins. As the three engage in a power-play in which no one's motivations are clear and the fate of the world hangs in the balance, action takes precedence over thought, to sometimes disastrous effect. Nonetheless, the science and technology which has so defined this series is on ample display and is as prescient as ever.Of particular note, I found the conclusion to be perfectly enigmatic. This is post-apocalyptic fiction, and a happy ending would have been wildly out of place, but Watts' conclusion recognizes this without being entirely bleak. In this regard, his novel owes more to \"Alas, Babylon\" with it's open ended conclusion, than the superb, but utterly fatalistic \"On the Beach\".To say more would risk huge spoilers, so suffice it to say \"Sepukku\" is every bit the conclusion I was hoping for. Watts has combined hard science fiction and post-apocalyptic fiction and taken both in new and exciting directions. If you're a fan of the series, you'll be glad at the way it ends; if you're intrigued by this review, grab \"Starfish\" and start from the beginning.Jake Mohlman","Unlike his excellent debut, Starfish and its first sequel, Maelstrom, this conclusion is a disappointing creative misstep on the part of its author. The chief problem with BEHEMOTH: SEPPUKU is that in spite of setting up Lenie Clarke as the heroine of the story, Clarke herself is entirely passive throughout the book, making no real decisions or actions on her own, being led by her sociopathic-but-honourable comrade Ken Lubin. She never achieves any great insight and becomes a bit player in the story.This book feels as if the author had become so preoccupied with his Hard Science Fiction ruminations that he had forgotten that his characters had been complex, dimensional characters in the previous books, and were now merely cartoonish chess pieces wandering through a thin narrative. There are also the deeply disturbing scenes in which the villain rapes and mutilates a sympathetic supporting character that eventually feel like a gratuitous exercise in writing snuff porn with a Science discussion interweaved in them, especially when that subplot no longer links up with the main story and never reaches any real resolution.The first two books in this series brilliantly married the Science with the complexity and pain of its damaged characters, but this book has degenerated into a dystopian cartoon that feels too much like a wallow in the [...] of sexual sadism and social pessimism. There have been brilliant dystopian Science Fiction novels in that past that earned their pessimism, like John Brunner's THE SHEEP LOOK UP. Alas, BEHEMOTH: SEPPUKU does not belong in that league.","An anaerobic microbe from the deep sea may have delivered the coup de grace to an already struggling mid-21st century world.It makes more sense to me to review the whole series when it's one story -- so here goes.I was very surprised to find that the mass market editions of these books are out of print -- even as the final hardcover has only just been released. I can't understand why this series wouldn't get more support, because in my opinion it has everything that successful science fiction needs. Watts incorporates big, shiny ideas -- and the deep-sea biology is a wonderful original touch. The books include a high level of action and tension and, pleasantly unusually for \"idea\" SF, are strongly character-driven. And the characters are tormented enough for anyone.There are flaws. At times, the plot is unclear, and while I like the pivotal role played by ignorance and misunderstanding, at times an irritating back-and-forth plot dynamic (Seppuku is a cure, no it isn't, yes it is) appears. Characterization, while overall excellent, at times seems over the top -- it's not entirely clear why *everyone* is so messed up, and the stupid bickering between the Rifters and the corporates in Atlantis left me with sympathy for neither side. I was put off by the apparent indifference of the characters to the impending destruction of Earth's whole ecosystem -- but then, they're selfish and profoundly damaged people, and creating sympathy for them in the reader's mind does not seem to have been Watts' priority. I would have found the aforesaid destruction more effective had it been shown more clearly.But, despite all these quibbles, I think this series is really good SF, and I highly recommend it.","I am reviewing the last 2 books as one here, which is how the author intended them to be published. First, you will have a hard time with the content if you haven't read the series starting with Starfish. The story is compelling and fascinating and a more than a little horrible. The writing is excellent and the plot unfolds briskly. The science is well researched and accessible to most intelligent readers. The proposed what-ifs of a near-apocalypitcal future are totally plausable.But sheesh Watts is hard on his characters. I give 4 stars for a great book, because it is, but I admit I'm left cold by the violence: some sexually graphic and sadistic, up close and personal, some happening far away from the characters at hand but with devestating consequence. All in the name of saving the world. The ending is enigmatic: I would have loved a neat wrap up of the surviving characters and and exposition of the future, but it's not that kind of book. So be it: that is Watts' choice and I have no bones with it aside from personal preference. But what I do have bones with is the dilution of Lenie's character from a force to be reckoned with to a a whiny nay-sayer. Even if Lenie more or less killed the whole world in the previous books, at least she did it with style (ya know, in a really twisted way). Now she sets off to save the world with a whimper and a moan. Boo. So that's my beef.Conclusion: if you love terse, unshirking, compelling and serious sci-fi, Watts is your man. Read in good health.","Peter Watts concludes his _Rifters_ saga in the fourth and final volume, _Behemoth: Book Two: Seppuku_. Watts had written that he originally planned a trilogy but that changes in the publishing industry had forced him to divide his rather large final volume into two novels, but that he was fortunate to have a good breaking point between the two books and two resulting novels that were different in scope. It seems to have been a good choice, as while _Behemoth_Book One_ focused nearly entirely on the undersea refuge of the corpses and rifters (along with our old friend Achilles Desjardins), _Book Two_ spent no time there at all but instead allowed the reader a tour of a post-Behemoth North America, a taste of international politics, and of course the end game between Lenie Clarke, Ken Lubin, and Achilles (and a new character that the book introduces, a physician by the name of Taka Ouellette).Overall I found it satisfying. The post-apocalyptic world we got to see was believable and interesting though wasn't perhaps as well-explored as what we got to see in _Maelstrom_. We were shown much more of the sick and sadistic pleasures of Achilles. While never really entering \"torture porn\" territory, the reader is left with a sense of disquiet (at least this one was) about how far the author would go in that regard. I didn't think it gratuitous, as this was a fundamental aspect of Achilles' character and of what had happened to him regarding his conscience, but it still nonetheless made me a bit uncomfortable at times (and makes me wonder just what the future holds for some forms of entertainment, given the evolution of horror films and the continual apparent need for succeeding films to outdo one another, a point I think the author was trying to make).I liked the ending, it had two interesting twists I really enjoyed and didn't devolve into what it could have been (one character simply killing another, story over). The world at the end of the novel is fundamentally different and not necessarily a world without hope. It is also a world that would be interesting to see explored in a later novel.I would like to express my displeasure at this series being out of print despite its recent age (_Seppuku_ came out in 2004). That is a real shame, as it is a worthwhile and interesting series, an excellent addition to the end of the world sub-genre of science fiction as well as probably the finest novel to ever handle the deep sea and ocean themes. The series overall was well researched (the author himself was a marine biologist) and had well-developed characters, a fascinating setting, and was an intriguing exploration of developing trends in our world.","The first book, \"Starfish\" was amazing, just a great read. This last book is horrible! Confusing, pointless, and extremely degrading, I wish I had never read it. I agree whole heartedly with \"aisian film c\" above! The rape and torture of one of the more sympathetic characters is what really pushed this book into the crapper for me.","I loved Starfish. I appreciated the smart science (hey, gotta love SF with bibliographies!); I found the world riveting and the characters well-drawn. But I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this book. The sequence of sexual sadism, which stretches on for chapter after excruciating chapter, is simply too visually explicit to be worth experiencing. It's an image I just didn't need, and one I can't get out of my head. It includes an eroticized clitoridectomy, for goodness sake. For me, that sequence overshadows everything else in the book, and however much you may want to see the resolution of issues raised in the other books, be sure you're willing to have that image stuck to your eyeballs before you buy or read this volume.","When I was sixteen I worked at a grocery store with a girl named Marianne whom I thought was pretty attractive. I wanted to ask her out for months but could never build up enough courage. After all, I didn't want to have to work with her if things went terribly wrong on the date. Eventually she quit and on her last day working, I asked her out. She said yes and we made plans for that weekend.A short time into the date I realized that her breath was horrible. I don't know if it was an anomaly or if I had just never been that close to her before. Either way, the date couldn't end fast enough for me. When I took her home I stopped walking halfway to her front door and let her walk the rest of the way alone-where I told her goodbye from a safe distance of about 20 yards.What does that have to do with Behemoth: Seppuku? Very little actually. But it does have something to do with the Rifters series, of which this book is the the fourth and final volume. Several years ago when I came across the first book in the series; Starfish, I was attracted to its eye-catching cover and intriguing description on the inside flap. I read it and enjoyed it. When the next book Maelstrom came out, I started to notice the bad breath. Unfortunately, as I've mentioned before, I have a mental disorder that does not allow me to quit reading a book I'm not enjoying, and apparently the condition makes it hard for me to stop reading a series of books once started.The series takes place in the not-too-distant future. In need of a new source of energy, mankind begins to tap into geothermal vents in the deepest parts of the ocean. It's discovered that hardened criminals possess the type of temperament best conducive to surviving under the extreme conditions at the bottom of the ocean and given the choice between imprisonment and a relatively free lifestyle segregated from the rest of humanity, many choose the latter. These workers are then surgically altered into amphibian-like creatures (rifters) in order to allow them to survive at such depths. Unfortunately, for the rest of mankind, there are bacteria that thrive at the bottom of the ocean. Bacteria that the human race is not prepared to defend itself against. Using the rifters as vehicles to the surface, the bacteria quickly spread with apocalyptic results.As the series progresses, halitosis sets in. There's not a likeable character anywhere in the series and the great idea behind the story gets overshadowed by the author's overwhelming angst and pessimism. Even in the acknowledgement section at the back of the book - yeah, my condition made me read that too, Watts writes that even if the book and the series \"sucks\" it would \"suck even worse\" if it wasn't for the help of the acknowledged individuals. If you're interested in owning the complete series, there's going to be a very cheap set on eBay in a few minutes.","Five years ago amphibious cyborg Lenie Clarke unleashed the microbe Behemoth on an unsuspecting world, killing ten million in North America. Lenni and her fellow cyborgs escape the devastation in the ocean depths and are at war with the VIP's who fled to the underwater city of Atlantis. The people of Atlantis and cyborgs make peace when Behemoth finds its way into the underwater city. For the first time in five years Lenie journeys to land accompanied by Ken Lubin to find a way to keep Behemoth out of Atlantis.Although a vaccine for Behemoth exists, it is in scarce supply so more people die from the microbe and the plagues that follow in its wake. Watchers guard against anyone breaking out of quarantine and many countries want to eradicate North America and thus destroy Behemoth. A new deadly microbe Seppuku is launched as a cure for Behemoth but when it kills the microbe it also infects the host. A watcher, Achilles Desjarding know that Seppuku will eventually die out before killing the host but he doesn't tell anyone because he wants to keep all the power he gained. Lenie and Ken can stop him but it might mean their deaths.BEHEMOTH: SEPPUKU is the last of the Lenni Clark books and it is just as action-packed and exciting as STARFISH: MAELSTROM and BEHEMOTH: B-MAX. This is a dark gritty speculative fiction novel with the survivors grimly determined to rebuild civilization if Behemoth is eradicated. Lenie knows she can never find redemption but she does her best to save what is left of the North American population. Desjarding is the archetype villain who everyone will love to hate. Peter Watts is writing excellent cutting edge science fiction.Harriet Klausner"],

      "reviews.text":["After reading this book in a college Sci Fi class at Berkeley almost 20 years ago, it remains one of my all-time favorites of any genre. It is positively amazing that it is almost 50 years old because it reads so thoroughly modern and relevant. The story grabs you right from the outset and doesn't let up. What makes &quot;Earth Abides&quot; so special is that it can be read on many different levels. While reading it for the first time, I often had to peer out the window to make sure there were still people around! Don't miss this sure bet","As a fan of non-alien, post apocalyptic novels, I sometimes struggle to find truly good books to read. Well, Earth Abides is a truly GREAT book, and you will not regret this choice. The book is well-written and unforgettable. It was written in 1949, but wears its age well. I was even able to enjoy its social perspectives toward women and race. George Stewart, like Mark Twain in Huckleberry Finn, really struggles with the social beliefs of his time, and questions both racism and sexism without overpowering his remarkable story of survival.I'm an avid reader. I especially like realistic science fiction, but don't limit myself to the genre. I rank Earth Abides in the top 5 of ALL the books I have ever read.","Earth Abides, written in 1949, tells the story of the fall of civilization from deadly disease and its \"rebirth\". It is actually three books in one: the disintegration of the world, the establishment of a new collective culture, and the moral weights of leadership. I initially read it as a post-apocalyptic novel and was rewarded with a philosophical treatise on the loss of a way of life and the dangers of man oversimplifying himself. The development of the tiny band's subsequent generations is more terrifying than a plague wiping out the planet. It is a story of 'what man wrought' but not in the way one anticipates. Originally classified a \"science fiction\" novel, now, with time, it must be categorized as literature.","\"Between the plan and the fulfillment lies always the hazard. Between the plan and the fulfillment stands always the frail barrier of a human life\" - George R. StewartIsherwood \"Ish\" Williams is one of the last people on Earth! How will he survive, how can he go on?\"Earth Abides\" is a book that I have owned for quite awhile & a book that I have always planned to read next, but never did. Finally I read the book and I was not only thoroughly impressed, I was in awe of George R. Stewart's ideas about how it would all end and how we could possibly go on.I'm amazed at the amount of the poor reviews for this book, I think most people are expecting moreI Am Legendtype material. This book is not that at all, there is some violence, not alot, there are no zombies, only people & animals. Many reviewers state that Ish should have done this, he shouldn't have done that, forgetting that this masterpiece was written in 1949. The book is so far ahead of it's time, it's baffling to me how George R. Stewart came up with some of these things. Would it be much different it this novel was written today, well obviously yes.Stewart's theory of how each animal will thrive before it's numbers level off really made me think. The everyday things that you never give a second thought, Stewart brings them to the front and makes you think, what do we do now, how do we get past this?If you like to read post-apocalyptic novels, if you've readThe Roadand enjoyed it, read \"Earth Abides\"This is the road that no man finishes traveling. Men come and go, but Earth abides!Enjoy~","How anyone could rate this book poorly is beyond comprehension. This is a well written, fascinating study on human thought and action. As much a intellectual simulation as a study of the time and attitudes of that time in which it was written.","George Stewart's \"Earth Abides\" is a tale of the end of the world by way of a plague that handles the subject in a way much different that similar tales. More thoughtful, deliberate and slow than I expected. More than anything it is a look at how man's conquering of mother nature is temporary at best. Take away man, and the Earth's memory of man will be soon forgotten. At the same time, it deals with civilization - what are the fundamentals of civilization, what keeps people together, and what prompted the creation of tribes, religion, superstition, and war.Without question, I enjoyed this a lot. One of the better takes on a post-apocalyptic scenario I have read to date. No Mad Max BS, no metaphysical The Stand mumbo jumbo, no b-grade nonsense ala The Postman, just pure introspection regarding how mankind would move on, and more importantly, how the Earth would move along as if we were never thereMandatory reading.","Some interesting ideas explored in this novel, such as the true worth, or otherwise of what we today term 'education'. Stewart asks the reader to question the validity of many of our modern values upon which today's civilization is based as well as pointing out how swiftly these would erode in the aftermath of some holocast. I am not sure if Ish made the correct decision when he completely abandoned the school for the children. There was only the one chance to pass on the knowledge of reading and the communication value it holds, and once lost it would be gone for ever. Also, the future survival of 'The Tribe' would have benefited enormously if future generations had access to much of the knowledge contained in the library.Another interesting point was how &quot;The Tribe', or rather 4 of its members, so quickly decided on the death penalty for Charlie.There appeared to be a complete lack of any real emotions in any of the characters. This was particularly noticable at the start of the novel when Ish looses not only all his friends, but his family also. There seemed no grieving process, and although he was certainly sad at the loss of Joey and Em, I did not feel his pain.Stewart could have written a far longer novel without loosing my interest and much more could have been included. The 'Quick Years' passed too quickly for me and I could have handled a few more hundred pages without loosing interest.Altogether an excellent read. We are asked to question so much of what we today hold as important. He questions our complacency, which is always a good thing.","Do you know the joyous feeling you get when you just happen upon a book quite by accident, read just a few chapters of it, and realize that it will be of great signifiance to you? Well, that was my experience with this book! I can't believe that I was not introduced to this book before now. It is with some sadness that I just completed reading it.My degree of connection with the main character, Isherwood Williams (Ish), astounded me; therefore, I must admit that my reaction to this book is quite subjective. It as is though the author looked into my mind and wrote a book about me in a post-apocalyptic world, including my greatest virtues and worst vices. The descriptions of the thoughts, triumphs, failings, joys, and frustrations experienced by the main character are poignantly honest and real. Metaphorically, this story seems to describe, with regard to many things, my existence in this, our so-far non-apocalyptic, world. For example, I find that I constantly struggle to define what I think to be the appropriate balance of individuality and community/state in our world. If you are one who consciously ponders such things or pursues a study of philosophy, I believe that you will view this book as a masterpiece. It just made my top 10, that is sure.I feel that I have gained much in my reading of this book. Mostly, I come away from this reading experience with a renewed feeling of peace and a reassurance in myself and the human spirit. I will no longer, I think, become quite so frustrated with regard to certain things or people in this world.&quot;Am I happy? Yes, I am happy. Things are as they are, and I am part of them.&quot; - Jack, great grandson of Isherwood Williams (Ish), the Last American.","This really great fictional accounting, by G.R. Stewart, of what our future might be, remains my favorite of the genre. I've just reread it for perhaps the third or fourth time - with some years in between. And although just a little dated it retains the vitality of adventure, promise and hope within a story of global tragedy. Considering current media hype about a possible Bird Flu pandemic this is an enlightening and enjoyable reading experience.","George R. Stewart's &quot;Earth Abides&quot; was written in 1949, so of course there are some anachronisms that occasionally jolt the reader. The Giants play at the Polo Grounds and the Dodgers at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. There are no interstate highways and radios all have vacuum tubes.These minor historical curiosities aside, what truly amazes is the timeless of Stewart's story. How many science fiction novels from 1949 still rate the glowing reviews of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; you will find here? By comparison so many modern sci-fi stories are formulaic, written with short, choppy sentences, shallow characters, and action sequences ready made for transfer to the screen.Stewart's vision of the future, where education and especially reading, slowly fad away after an apocalypse applies more to today's world than that of his own. His characters have little ability to bring back the technological remnants of the dead world, and truly, if 99% of the people on the planet were to disappear how many of us have the skills to keep the power going, the water flowing, and automobiles running decades after the disaster? His characters adapt to their environment in the most natural way.In the nearly four decades I have been reading books this is one of a handful that has made a memorable impression and which I consistently continue to recommend.","I don't think I've never read another book like this, so I'm not sure how to describe it. Very slow paced, not a lot of character development. Not a lot of explanation about where everyone went, I just didn't think enough how and why questions were answered early on. Interesting, but I really found it easy to put down. I also found some of the main character Ish's point of view about non-whites curious, yet somewhat disturbing. As if that was the way people viewed each other in the late 40s, and quite obvious lack of communication/knowledge about each other. There are some very interesting plot twists in here, none of them gory where they could be. Seems as if Stewart withheld gruesome details to focus on Ish's response to a completely changed world (no complaints here). I just find this book hard to recommend, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading this either.","I read this book years ago, lost my copy and when I heard the old time radio adaptation I got another copy. My first reading I was waiting for the clashes with other survivers, the cannabiles trying to eat them, you name it. Now after many years and another reading I understand Ish and the other survivers better. People cling to what they know, what is familiar. So did Ish. He was a bookworm, maybe even a geekish type. He loved the Hills, being solitary, studying. He was even in a profession that may have regarded less educated people as stupid (highly skilled science/engineering types come to mind) He was the last person to be chosen to kickstart humanity, to lead it back to greatness. He had the courage to drive cross country,alone, but not to keep the children in school or to take the books from the library.I liken the little colony to an office load of people who have never had to face a deadline, a change of upper management, or a takeover. They plodded along doing things the way they always did until circumstance forced an issue- the water, the visitor, there own need to bring in new blood. Ish knew what needed to be done but he lacked the wherewithall to motivate the others. He was not the charasmatic leader found in later novels. Those by S.M. Sirling come to mind, or Alas Babylon! Ish held the colony together and prevented their complete loss of civilization. He enforced rule of law when necessary, and made hard decisions.As others have pointed out, this book will continue to be debated as long as there are two people who have read it and thought about it.","I read this book aeons ago when I was in high school - of course back then it was a lot heavier (chisled in stone). It's a great book - though a bit antiquated and an interesting twist on the post-apocalyptic genre. The symbol of the single jack hammer has stuck with me through the years to the point that I never pick up my one handed sledge in the garage without thinking of the story. If you've never read it, you are missing a real treat.","I first read this in college for an English class and it really caught my imagination. Overall, the basic plot line of the book is very interesting and thought provoking, though the writing is not what I would call first rate. I like the fact that the book focuses on the fate of civilization in the wake of an overwhelming catastrophe without resorting to the seemingly inevitable appearance of zombies or other un-dead as is the case in so many other post-apocalyptic stories. I also like that the story balances optimism and pessimism, rather than going totally pessimistic a la 'The Road'.","I won't quibble with the author about such things as the shelf life of gasoline. I found this novel an intriguing insight into the era in which I was born. The author draws conclusions about post-apocalyptic civilization that, while I find them disturbing, are certainly possible. He casts the role of the antagonist not as the greed, lechery, or lust for power among others outside his tribe. Rather, the antagonist is the lethargy of a group of survivors who live by scavenging and whose creative urges never develop as a result.Personally, I find that a depressing scenario...perhaps because I also see it as a possibility. The main character, even though the tribe considers him their leader, is cast as one who stands outside the group. Instead of directing their energy toward creativity, he continues to see himself as an academic...an observer. Inevitably, the \"tribe\" is reduced to being a combination of scavengers and hunter/gatherers. Mr. Stewart does a good job of chronicling this decline. I simply think he (and his protagonist) accept this fate too easily.This is a book review, however. It is not a social commentary. The novel, itself, is well written and very effective in its' message. It's a worthwhile read, even if only undertaken as a study of the Amercan culture during the time period in which it was written.","So good. The good beginning and the good ending more than make up for the sometimes-boring middle. The whole, of course, is poetic. The author intended that and he succeeded. And he succeeded in making a post-apocalyptic story that is not dystopian, as so many of these contemporary stories are, and moreover is actually hopeful and, in the end, optimistic. And Stewart is to be thanked for that, as much as for anything else he has done here. As others have said, the novel certainly is worth reading again and I will do so.","At first, I found it hard to get past what I considered the author's naivete. Afterall, 99% plus of the world's population dies out, but there are few bodies...a plague of rats with the same result...the streets, even within the population centers, are virtually clear of stranded vehicles, etc. But, then I realized, this book was not about personal survival, it was about the survival of knowledge. Armed with the world's knowledge and a fine brain, Ish is only able to bequeath to his survivors a hammer, archery skills and the ability to make fire without modern means...despite his best efforts. This scenario of lost knowledge is even more probable today with Wikipedia taking the place of public libraries for many of our youth. An anthropological masterpiece! A must read for those planning to rebuild civilization after its collapse. (It's hard to believe this was written in 1949)","Earth Abides is a 1949 science fiction novel by George R. Stewart. When a plague all but wipes out the human race, a young introverted intellectual decides to observe the way the world responds to the sudden removal of humans, and, later, works to reconstruct certain aspects of civilization while battling to keep education alive.This is a thoughtful book: one of Stewart's primary themes here is a philosophical take on civilization: its pros and cons, what is gained and lost through starting over, and whether parts or the whole are worth rebuilding. Stewart, with the world's last scholar as his main character, does a wonderful job with this.But while Earth Abides is all about ideas, Stewart mostly punts on the moral and theological ramifications, as his characters move on quickly when these themes present challenges. In a world where people can't help but focus on death, that's a missed opportunity.In addition to the book's philosophical emphasis, Stewart's post-apocalyptic world is generally free of unrest and violence. While this allows Stewart to focus on his themes of rebuilding, his characters are rarely in much peril, and there's never much suspense. Yet as Stewart charts the life of his protagonist through the years and decades, the reader becomes invested in and attached to the character, passive and powerless though he may be, and this is why the novel is compelling, and why the reader will not mind the book's many philosophical detours.On the whole, Earth Abides is an intelligent, poignant and melancholy novel, and one of the finer and more influential works in the genre. Bonus points for an interracial relationship during a hostile era.","\"At the funeral of Homo sapiens there will be few mourners.\"I loved this book. So many end-of-the-world tales center on violence, war, superhuman heroes and unrealistic resolutions. Earth Abides is unique. It follows the story of \"Ish\", a biologist who was busy doing research alone in the mountains of California when a virus swept around the planet wiping out all but a few members of the human species. Immune to the virus, possibly because of a well-timed snakebite, Ish proceeds to explore the empty world. He travels across the United States, returns to the west coast, and helps establish a small community with a handful of survivors.Earth Abides is special because it all seems so real and down-to-earth. Ish is a scientist who makes keen observations and comes up with brilliant solutions to problems. But he is always very human. The character never drifts in a formulaic larger-than-life hero who can save the day. I also like the realistic mix of survivors. No, they aren't all Mohawk-wearing rapists and murderers. No, they aren't all highly intelligent saviors of civilization. They are an assortment of people one might see walking down any sidewalk in any city. Some smart, some dumb; some nice, some not so nice.Earth Abides covers a lot of ground, stretching out many years beyond the disaster. It is fascinating to read the author's description of crumbling cities and vanishing highways. It reminded me of the fine nonfiction book, The Earth Without Us.This book was a pleasure to read and I highly recommend it.\"At least,\" he thought, \"life is quieter.\"\"Yes, a tribe is like a child. You can show it the way by which it should grow up, and perhaps you can direct it a little, but in the end the child will go his own way, and so will the tribe.\"\"Men go and come, but Earth abides.\"","Earth Abides is a great book. It has always been one of my favorites. George Steward makes it easy to put yourself in the situation of being the last man on earth. This is the kind of book that you will read over and over through the years.","I, too, read this book 30-something years ago. What I remember most is the boy. I think he is Ish's son. He is the only one of the new generation to wonder how that dark box (the television) once worked. And he dies! I so wanted him to start figuring things out.","i have read the last ship alas babylon year zero footfall lucifers hammer this book was the best even though it was written long ago that is the most epic story MEN COME AND GO BUT EARTH ABIDES i read it 20 years ago and several times since","One of the most interesting books I've ever read. I wish he'd focused a little more on what happened in the rest of the world than the Tribe, but an amazing book all the same.","EARTH ABIDES by George R. Stewart is one of many books that take as its theme the destruction of mankind, leaving the Last Man on Earth as a narrator. THE PURPLE CLOUD by M.P. Sheil did much the same but Sheil's book was marred by excessive racism. Stewart's book is saved not only by the logical working out of the plot by its narrator-survivor, Isherwood, but also by Stewart's clever though subtle use of using Isherwood's slowly failing senses over many decades of post-apocalyptic adventures as a metaphor for the slow destruction of the American ideal of life.As the novel opens, the reader is told that the United States has been hit by a super-plague that has spread with lightning rapidity with near one hundred percent fatality. Ish, one of the very few survivors, passes by a abandoned car on the San Francisco bridge. This car is registered to a James P Robson of Oregon. This seemingly innocuous narration is later seen as the central metaphor of the book. Years later, Ish has several opportunities to pass the car in and out of San Francisco. Each time he does so, the car becomes somehow less distinct, a fuzziness that resonates first in his mind, then in the reader's mind. As the decades pass, Ish meets isolated pockets of survivors who have forgotten their American heritage. To these barbaric Mad Max types, Ish is the Last of the Americans. They tease him, they pinch him, they see him as a failed god type who could not deliver on the promises of the fabled technology of their legends. By the novel's end, he sees them pinching him, but he cannot feel them doing so. His senses have failed him just as America's technology had earlier failed to protect its population from the plague. Just before his death, Ish remembers the car on the bridge. Was it red? blue? green? Owned by Robson? Robinson? Robertson? He does not remember. But he feels sure that America has died, its technology has long since died, but its people live on, possibly learning from the mistakes of their predecessors, or maybe not. Stewart concludes his otherwise depressing work with a hint of optimism: \"Man may come and go, but earth abides.\"","I would have given this book fewer stars if I had been able to put it down. In spite of the stilted prose, odd inaccuracies, and generally bleak view of human nature, Earth Abides' end of the world scenario is completely gripping. There's none of the pseudo-mysticism of The Stand, just pure mid 20th century sci-fi goodness. Some of the scenarios Stewart presents aren't very subtle, and his views of women and blacks are what you might expect from 1949, but if you're at all interested in the &quot;what happens after a mysterious virus wipes out most of humanity&quot; scenario, Earth Abides is worth a read.","I bought this book and read it with the hope that it would be at least as good as Alas Babylon, one of my all time favorites. It was not. Earth Abides may have been the prototype of the collapse of civilization genre of Science Fiction but it has been outdone by so many other later books I hardly know where to start.To begin with, even the main character is very shallowly drawn and it goes downhill from there. You don't really care what happens to any of these people because the author does such a sketchy job of portraying them as having any of the qualities that we need to see in a literary figure in order to identify with them. This book is a science fiction version of The Grapes of Wrath without the character development. Be prepared for sexism, elitism, stupidity, lemming like fatalism and lack of preparation for any kind of civilized future. Also the author totally fails in most respects to know and understand how long canned food will last and how quickly you might be killed by scurvy living the lifestyle described in this book. Add in unrealistic pretexts for the characters doing what they do and you have a book that drags you into editor mode thinking how you could make it better.If you why I gave this book three stars when I disliked it so much, here is why It gets one of them for concept, the second for being the prototype of the genre and the third for having an interesting beginning. Where is really falls down is the ability to deliver on the initial promise. Books and movies for the most part succeed when they take an initial premise, however, far-fetched and then elaborate on that initial premise in a logical manner. After the initial suspension of disbelief this is how they suck you in. This book doesn't suck you in but actually loses you in contradictions, flimsy pretexts, and poor research with an ending that tails off in a whimper and left me whipping through the last several pages to get to the ending only to find that there was really no \"there\" there. Earth Abides gets credit for illustrating very convincingly the complex web of technical knowledge and individual job skills as well as motivations that keep our industrial society afloat but loses all the previous credit when it fails in a primal manner to explain why rational people who didn't really want to do a lot of work would makes life choices that initially and in the long run would mean a lot more work than the alternative choice that they didn't make. A low-tech lifestyle is a bundle of work compared to learning about and maintaining some of the elements of civilization. This is where I really fault the author as I believe that a lot of things including; the shelf life of canned goods, the back breaking labor of a hunter gatherer existence without even any horses, human craving for fresh food, and basic human emotions are ignored or glossed over in order to reach a contrived conclusion.","This a truly great book that everyone should read. Now to my experience with getting. I was looking for a reasonably priced hard back edition. This one said very good condition, in a price range I could live with. When I got the book I was happy with the condition until I found a bar code on the back cover which tore the cover getting it off. They should have specified that there was this sticker on the back cover. I like to keep my books and that is why I buy hard back. I was disappointed. Not only that but there was a sticker on side that read salvation army, $2.99. I really didn't care about the price difference but it showed me lack of concern by the seller which I do not appreciate. ruscolombo","I was really looking forward to reading this book as I have lately been going through a post-apocalyptic literature jag. After thoroughly enjoying \"On the Beach\", I purchased \"Earth Abides\". While \"On the Beach\" centers on humanity's ability to stay hopeful while facing the inevitable, I was confused by the intended message of \"Earth Abides\". The book's protagonist, Ish, likes to think of himself as the forward-thinking leader of a new civilization, but he comes across as more of an apathetic dreamer. In the twenty-plus years following a devastating plague, Ish and his companions evolve from foraging through supermarkets for food to....foraging through supermarkets for even older food. And I guess that is the really frustrating element of this book- in all that time no one has the foresight or gumption to make more than half-hearted attempts at creating some sort of self-sustaining community. The 'Gilligan's Island' crew did more in two years to create a society than this motley crew does in thirty!Kidding aside, I am sure that the author is making a statement about mankind that others have picked up on and that has apparently gone way over my head. I actually look forward to reading more learned reviews of the book to figure out what I missed.","Can't believe the negative reviews of this extraordinary novel. Read it for yourself. Then, you will appreciate life as we know it today. You will sleep well, adore more your family and friends, and rest assured that Earth abides.","I read this book about half way in sophmore year, and quit reading it. Now I'm 20 and I decided I'd give it another try. I have about 60 pages left, and I gotta say, this book is one of the slowest I have read, up there with the lord of the rings fellowship. I know it's a classic, but man, I can't even read this book for more than 30 min. at a time. Usually I blaze through books within a few days, but I'm probably on a month and a half with this book. I work a lot, so I dont usually have much time for reading except while I'm going to the bathroom and before bed, but wow. I mean the book is ok, it's not bad, it's just not a pageturner, which is what I usually go for. The main character Ish is very paranoid, thinks to far into detail over everything, and is in my opinion is a coward. I also feel like there is too much side tracking in this book. It's also very repetuous. I feel like there is too much thinking and too little action about anything. In some ways I relate to the main character, because I overthink a lot of things, I'm not the biggest strongest guy, nor the most handy, but that doesn't make it any more interesting of a read. It kind of defeats the purpose of me reading a book. I read to meet interesting characters, be engrossed in a story that is not mine, and to entertain my mind. I don't want to read about a character thinking. If i did want to read about that, I would read a philosophy book and do the thinking myself, or better yet, I'd read nothing and just think. When I think of books taking place in a post apocalyptic world, I think of a little bit more than this gives you. There could have been a lot more interesting scenarios in the depicted world than the one focused on in this book.I will say though that this book does use an interesting vocabulary, and I've learned a few new words. And the part's in Itallics are by far the best parts of the book. These parts do truly make an impression in your mind, and I would rate these as 5 star. Some of the itallicized parts are very deep and meaningful. I love this quote out of one of those parts \"Between the plan and fulfillment stands always the frail barrier of a human life\"Overall: Id say it's worth reading, but it's by far not the best book ever like some of the other reviewers are saying. I liked Cormick Mcarthy's \"The Road\" as a post apocalyptic story better, it seemed more real, and it moved at a quicker pace.","Every fan of post-apocalyptic stories has his own reason for following the genre. Mine is, that I like to see what the author considers most important to life in this world. When civilization and human society collapse; when food, medicine, and basic comforts become scarce; when friends are few and family is imperiled, what values will prevail? Most of the classic novels of calamity portray survivors determined to carry on, forming communities which are insular and self-reliant; learning and developing the skills and collecting the resources essential to living in a new world. Earth Abides paints a somewhat different picture.Ish is much like the heroes of the other popular disaster stories, in that he is determined to carry on; and to recover, as much as possible, the advances of civilization which are in danger of disappearing with the loss of most of the human race. Ish finds himself the head of a community and extended family; and though he is strong, educated, and resourceful, he finds nothing but frustration in his efforts to pass on his values to the next generation. His children and grandchildren have little desire to produce goods for themselves, having become dependent on the things left behind by those who died from the plague. He is unable to inspire them with his vision for keeping the great accomplishments of humanity alive.Something unique about this story is the occasional vignette describing what happens to the world around Ish, now that the human race has essentially become an endangered species. If you've ever watched the History Channel's \"Life After People\", you'll get a sense of that here - and see how these things directly affect Ish and the other survivors.I'm discovering that those classic novels which I can read many times throughout my life, and which say something new to me each time (see my reviews of \"1984\" and \"Fahrenheit 451\"), are those in which I recognize the signs of true works of genius. This is only my first time reading \"Earth Abides\", but I already wonder what it will say to me in five years, or ten, as I raise my children, or lead kids in my community, and try to impart my own values and experience to them. Will I be able to pass on those things they need to survive, or will I find myself, like Ish, disappointed, or having to realign my expectations?An engaging read, with all the hallmarks of a true classic.","I have read and reread this novel many times over the years, and this was just one of many copies I have bought to share with friends. It is the easiest reading but most thought provoking apocalyptic novel I have ever had the pleasure of reading.","This book is an interesting read about the end of civilization and rebuilding...but honestly nothing really happened in this book. The whole book seems like a huge buildup to some epic conflict/event that is going to happen, but never does.Maybe it's just a sign of the times that today's reader expects action, I always have a hard time with books written in the 50's.","This great book addresses one of the age-old curiousities so many of us have: What would I do if one day suddenly I was all alone in a world wiped clean of almost every other person?Ish, the main character, is a non-descript every-day Joe who finds himself in just this scenario. There are a few other survivors along the way, eventually forming a \"tribe.\" They all have their flaws and eccentricities which makes the story all the more believable. If you plucked a random selection of humanity and put them on a desert island they wouldn't all be super heroes! They would bumble along and learn how to survive as best they could within their limited capabilities.It was the way in which the author wrote the book that made it so great for me. The little interjections within chapters describing the changes in the Earth away from the human plot were great, and they provided context and realism to the human story. The progression through the 60 some-odd years was expertly crafted by singling out the years with momentous turning points for more detail, and speeding through the fascinating \"quick years\" in between. The descent back to a stone-age type existance twists the emotions. Sad for one who is familiar with the conveniences and comforts of modernity, but understandably necessary for the new human condition.A great novel that is considered a classic of post AP for very good reason.","I thought it started a bit slow, but in time I was certainly hooked. The writing style seemed a bit formal but I grew used to it. I found it easy to forget while reading that the setting was decades ago, as I could easily envision it happening in these times.By the middle of the book I was considering it \"required reading\" and thinking of family members I could loan it to. It definitely gains steam as the story evolves. Loved the ending, both powerful and moving.I can see that Stephen King must have been inspired by several different portions of this book to write the Stand. I consider this one better. I would have liked maybe to see it longer, with more character development of the younger generations. I suppose 900 page novels were uncommon in the time it was written, so we are left with what it is. A great, and thought provoking novel.","This book should be considered right up there with the classics of the genre. It's a wonderful and complex narrative that pulls you in and slowly pulls you along. It's not action packed but it is a very realistic look at a future where mankind has suffered a terrible tragedy. Highly recommended!","In 10th grade we read a story that dealt with the end of the world in our English class. I was intrigued. As i spoke again of this story a year later my 11th grade english teacher suggested that i read \"Earth Abides\". I shrugged off the suggestion being as though it was from my teacher (one of the lesser evils in my life) and it wasn't untill later that year when i found it on the library shelf that i finnally picked it up and began to read. I managed to rack up over 30 dollars in library fines because i litterally refused to return the book to its rightfull home. After reading it straight through three times in a row, I began to keep it under my pillow. I would pull it out at night and open it up and read randomly wherever the pages led me. Earth Abides may just be the most inspiring book I have ever read. I am now a Senior in Highschool. I since have bought a copy of Earth abides to replace the library's copy so that i could keep the copy that i had grown so close to. It is not so much the story or the people in it that i have attached myself to. The understanding of human nature and the way we react to crisis, and the way we move through life never ceases to amaze me. As I prepare myself to go into a career in Pyschology Stewart continues to be a constant inspiration in my search towards understanding of human behavior and human emotions. Also I am inspired as a writer. I can only dream that someday i will be able to write as well as Stewart. To be able to convey my thoughts or create and develope a character as well as he does would be beyond my imagination. Earth Abides leaves one person in awe and leaves them dying to read more but afraid to turn over the last page, for fear of ending the story. A wise person once said that finishing a good book is like losing a close friend. This holds true in Earth Abides. Whenever i read that last page my best friend dies with a simple punctuation mark. But as the book continues to remind us, Men go and come, BUT, earth abides.","The characters in George R. Stewart's Earth Abides symbolize many biblical people.Isherwood, the main character, is referred to as Ish throughout the novel. \"Ish,\" however, can also be a shortened form of the name Ishmael. Ishmael was a biblical wanderer who allegedly founded the Islamic religion. In the first half of the book, Ish is a wanderer, venturing all over post-apocalyptic America, eventually settling down and founding a tribe.One of Ish and Em's children, Joseph (who is referred to as Joey), is representative of the biblical Joseph. He is very gifted intellectually, and has the ability to see the deeper meaning in any situation, much like the biblical Joseph's ability to interpret drams; unlike the biblical Joseph, however, his talent is squelched, when he is stricken with typhoid fever, and dies as a result.The mentally-handicapped Evie has a name similar to the Eve, and is nave, much like her biblical predecessor. Eve is targeted by the evil serpent, and is expelled from the Garden of Eden when she partakes of fruit from a forbidden tree. Similarly, Evie is targeted by Charlie, a greasy character who lusts after her and plans to take advantage of her innocence. Before actually seducing Evie, however, he is executed by the others in Ish's Tribe, for Evie's well-being. Likewise, the serpent from the Bible receives his comeuppance in the form of expulsion from Eden and being made to walk on his belly for the rest of eternity.Ish's wife, \"Emma,\" is referred to as Em throughout the novel. This also ties in biblically, for \"Em\" can be short for \"Emet,\" a name meaning \"Truth.\" Emma is characterized throughout the novel as a strong-willed individual who helps hold the Tribe together. After Joey's death from typhoid fever, Ish asks Em if there might be a God taking vengence for Charlie's execution. Em responds, \"If there is a God who made us and we did something wrong before his eyes... at least we did wrong only because we were as god made us, and I do not think that He should set traps.\" (258) She speaks her mind, and she speaks the truth.Ezra was a biblical prophet who chronicled the return of the Jews to Jerusalem after their expulsion by the Babylonians sixty years prior. Likewise, in the novel, Ezra speaks with great foresight-much like a prophet-and lives to observe the Tribe's rebuilding of civilization.These and other biblical parallels make Earth Abides one of the most symbolic modern-day books.","I first read this book nearly 40 years ago, and loved it. I go back and re-read it about once per decade, and I never tire of it. This was the first &quot;post-disaster&quot; novel, and in some ways still the best. Because it was written in 1949 it's a bit dated in some ways, but the human element is so strong that it still holds your interest; you really CARE about the characters! One of my all-time favorites!","Recently I took it upon myself to read the twelve books describing end of the world scenarios that are being recommended by Amazon in one of its lists. Of the twelve that I read, this is by far my favourite book. George Stewart wrote a story that is both believable and entertaining. In fact, with only a few minor historical references to culture in the 1940's, one could easily think that this book was written yesterday. I regret that the other books written by Stewart are not widely available. I think he's an amazing writer. Buy and read this book. You will not regret your selection.","This book was written in 1949. It has withstood the test of Time.If You like a good Post-Apocalypse yarn, Read & Enjoy.","\"the Earth Abides\" is a well written book. It is now somewhat dated, but it still offers a good set of characters that are well developed and a solid story line. Good story telling, realistic characters that are well written, fine dialog, all combine to make \"The Earth Abides\" a pretty good read.","This book should be considered right up there with the classics of the genre. It's a wonderful and complex narrative that pulls you in and slowly pulls you along. It's not action packed but it is a very realistic look at a future where mankind has suffered a terrible tragedy. Highly recommended!","This timeless masterpiece recounts the most likely of the various apocalyptic ends to man's brief reign on Earth. Written from a naturalist's viewpoint, the novel recounts the fall of man following a sweeping measles-like pandemic. The author deftly informs us that the unknown disease is sirborne, that it hits only higher primates, and that the death toll is so all-encompassing that society simply vanishes. Mr Stewart also notes that the bulk of the few survivors are so devastated by the event that they become incapacitated. He also recounts nature's way of restoring an upset ecological balance and how the remaining animals cope with their new-found freedom.Ish Williams, the main character, himself goes through a period of psychological angst, but as with some persons in any crisis, recovers his equilibrium. He sees and meets others who cannot, but eventually meets an equally resolute woman. The book then briefly, but viably, notes how mores change when society disintegrates.In a section entitled \"Quick Years\", the couple meet certain other adjusted persons who have adjusted to the \"Great Disaster\", as they call it, and a rudimentary \"tribe\", so-called, comes into being. A tight, fascinating study leaves the way clear for \"The Year 22\", the next chapter.It is interesting to note how the members retain traditional taboos, remember dates and holidays, and yet slowly return to a hunter-gatherer society. Organized learning is a natural casualty, to be replaced by superstition. Obviously, the ability to conjugate verbs becomes surplusage at such a time.The tribe learns to face disease, criminality, and tragedy. Religious tenets alter in each such society. One is left with the belief that man hasn't really learned very much by all of it. You learn that the most important thing to primitive man was the bow and arrow, and fire-making. Ish preserves these for future generations, along with a less credible democratic tradition. Even the language begins to change, as history marches on.I won't spoil it by giving the ending, but you won't forget it, any more than you will forget any of the details of this incredibly well thought out, impeccably written book.Even if, as with some reviewers, you cannot accept Stewart's approach or result, you will be forced to concede that, in addition to being a great storyteller, he is an incomparable, almost lyrical, wordsmith.I hated to see the book end.","Even Stephen King admits he based THE STAND on this interesting novel. I also recommend Doherty's AREA 51 series.","Considering all the raves, I was disappointed by Earth Abides. Although the premise was interesting, it never really went any place and kind of left me hanging. I thought the discussion of how man's departure from Earth affected other species was thought provoking and well done, but the rather dry writing style and lack of depth in the characters left me underwhelmed.","All i have to say is this book is sooooo gooood!","Allow me to digress for a minute. Has anyone ever seen the Bruce Willis movie The 12 Monkeys? Anyone besides me that is? I didn't think so. Back to the subject hand. The plot of Earth Abides is similar to that movie. A biological plague devastates the United States and the rest of the world. Isherwood, &quot;Ish&quot; Brown, comes across a dying man named Barlow. After Barlow's death, Brown's the last man on Earth. If I may digress again, it's also similar to the 1971 Charlton Heston movie &quot;The Omega Man.&quot; Ish sets out on a cross-country trek to preserve our culture. In Arkansas, he finds roads in disrepair, and forests reclaiming everything. That's all I'm telling you. If you want to find out &quot;the rest of the story,&quot; READ THIS BOOK!!!","I read this for a geography class in college. Boy, what a downer. Think Little House on the Prairie meets Mad Max, it's that skewed and contorted. Moments of trying to rebuild are perpetually dashed. In truth, what we have here is the story of a man trying to recreate the past, and how a world gone wrong prevents him from achieving his dream. He is in essence, powerless to do anything about it for the forces against him are nature itself.I do not recommend this book unless you like to read about characters who have no hope whatsoever. I think the one plus is that it's set in the San Francisco Bay Area, so there's a kind of tangibleness to it from this reader.Beyond that, I should've trashed or donated this thing ages ago.","This is one of the great books of the 20th Century. Unfortunately, a poor job was done producing it for Kindle. It seems to me that the print edition was scanned using Optical Character Recognition software and not proofed. It is full of misspellings and incorrect words due to the software limitations. If Amazon expects us to pay for this, they should make some effort to be sure that their product is correct!","George Stewart has crafted a science fiction tale that stands up fairly well to the test of time. Although it was first published in 1949, the language and ideas are still immediately relevant today. What would happen to you if civilization fell apart? How would you survive? How would people treat each other?The tale unfolds gradually, without suspense. For me, this was not quite the memorable novel that the highlighted reviewers described. I read the whole thing, but I could have easily put it down halfway through, since I did not develop a deep emotional attachment to the story or its characters. The novel is told in the third person, but through the eyes of Ish, the main character. This unusual point of view puts the reader at a distance. I didn't feel that I really knew any of the characters in the book, except for Ish.Ish has a bland personality. He is one who accepts his lot in life, even his lot in death. As the workings of civilization fail, he notes their passing. In the end, he does little to oppose his tribe's drift back into the stone age. This engendered my main disappointment with the novel. Why did the author make the protagonist so weak? There have been great novels fashioned out of weak characters, but ultimately I did not find greatness in this book. It is well written, but it did not fulfill my expectations.","This isn't badly written but, it didn't hold my interest like a really good Sci-fi book will do. It has a good story line but, the characters lack personality. It is interesting to read a book that was written as Science Fiction years ago.Earth Abides","Given a copy of \"Earth Abides\" in 1976 while stationed in Atsugi JA. This novel takes a single premise and projects the \"what if\" to a very logical and believable conclusion. I have read this novel three times since, each time obtaining a different prespective on the way human nature molds our life's decisions. Ranks with 20,000 leagues u/sea, The Time Machine and other SF stories that will stay within your mind years after the final page has been turned. One of the very few works of fiction that I recommend to friends - if you're searching for a believable work of science fiction \"Earth Abides\" will exceed your expectations.","I liked this book, its a very good view on what things could be like for the few survivors of a near species-ending pandemic. Written some time ago it does tend to be dated, but not annoyingly so. I knocked off a star due to the fact that it is somewhat navel-gazing in its execution. There's alot of deep thinking going on by the main character. Given all of this, its still worth a read and will IMO promote some thinking of your own.","The story of a world decimated by a fast-moving plague, Earth Abides follows the life of Isherwood, a 29-year-old loner who, while camping, suffers a rattlesnake bite that saves his life. After recovering from the snakebite (and other symptoms), he makes his way back to the San Francisco Bay area, where he finds his parents gone and the city deserted. Indeed, only a few people remain after the scourge that killed millions.Written in 1949, Earth Abides is a philosophical sci fi classic--it takes place before rock and roll, before microwaves, and way before computers. As Ish bands together with a few survivors to found a new civilization, he must decide what is important to keep from the Old Times, and what can be abandoned. The charm of Earth Abides is that it is as much a portrait of the mid-20th century as it is a futuristic fiction. It is the story of the last Americans.","The first scifi i ever read. Published , i believe, in 1949,the language is still current and still moving. Love a book that makes me think about the end of the world...","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it. This maturity is perceptible all along this work.The story is situated in a world devastated by a sudden pestilence that annihilates most of humankind. Taking into account the last SARS epidemic that jumped abruptly from China to Canada it doesn't look an impossible scenario.This is the story.Isherwood Williams comes down from an isolate spot in the mountains to discover an empty world. He starts searching for survivors all across USA, from California to New York and back again. He finds only isolate human cells, couples or trios, overwhelmed by catastrophe and in a near catatonic state.Returns to his native town and contemplate with a certain scientific detachment the fading world around him.Mr. Stewart intercalate brief vignettes describing what happens to dogs, cats, cattle, plants, roads, dams and bridges, contrasting them with Ish's daily experiences.Little by little the story grip reader's attention and even if action is somehow slow, the book can't be put down.As the story goes on human cells began to draw near each other, grouping and interacting again. A rather feeble structure starts growing up.The author approaches universal questions about survival and extinction; civilization and savagery; social structure and anomie. He also examines religious values, ethics and life's ultimate sense.This book gives the reader a lot of stuff to think about. A very enticing read!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","In this profound ecological fable, a mysterious plague has destroyed the vast majority of the human race. Isherwood Williams, one of the few survivors, returns from a wilderness field trip to discover that civilization has vanished during his absence. Eventually he returns to San Francisco and encounters a female survivor who becomes his wife. Around them and their children a small community develops, living like their pioneer ancestors and gradually returning to a simpler way of life. It may seem odd to say that a book in which the majority of the world's inhabitants die is life-affirming and spiritual, but I'm going to say it anyway. I have read this book again and again over the years, and each time I come away from it with a deep feeling of peacefulness and confidence in the power of Mother Earth.","I read this book about 15 years ago and had completely forgotten its name, but this book kept coming back to my mind over the years and I had to search and rediscover this book. What made this book to stay alive in my mind were my own thoughts and ideas that I have developed during the years about how civilizations grow and develop trends like religions, life styles etc.The central character of this story, Ish was an ordinary man before the plague that wiped out the whole world. In the new civilization, he, oblivious to himself, started assuming the role of a leader. The civilization, against his own wishes, started looking up at him as their spiritual leader.Most of the story is made up of his reflections and ambitions for the new civilization. He intended the new civilization to be based on the old one, taking advantage of the technological developments already in place. But, the civilization chooses to follow its natural progression and he found everyone around him to be very comfortable with the barbarian way of life.It is a thought provoking book. Must read for anyone who is a thinker !","This was one of the early end of the world novels where the survivors try to restart society. Though there is a lot of scientific inaccuracies, what makes this book great are the characters. If you liked Stephen King's The Stand which also had great characters, then you should like this one.The main character is Ish. Ish seems to be someone that we all strive to be. Caring and smart. Ish also, has the son that we all wish our children would be like. Ish's son is the smartest of all the children and he simply idolizes Ish.Ish uses a hammer (a basic, I guess Stanely model) as his symbol of power (or his sceptre) over the survivors. Undoubtedly, the hammer is to pass to Ish's son when Ish dies.The big project for the survivors is to get an old automobilie repaired enough to explore other lands and try to find other bands of survivors and get civilization back on its feet. I don't want to give the rest of the plot away only to say that this project turns out to be a big mistake.","Despite its age and archaic language, Stewart's practical knowledge of nature makes this one of the best epoch-ending books ever written. Other stories reveal this knowledge but unfortunately, are out of print (Storm and Fire). You've probably read enough reviews to know what the story is about, but be prepared for some radical thinking compared to today's social standards. This was written when many words were compounded by hyphens. When you read of the tail-gate on the station-wagon, don't be shocked. We really wrote that way back in the late forties and fifties. His story reflects the way things were then, not now, so you'll likely find this story as alien as many future fiction stories. We really have evolved that much. Enjoy one of the great SF stories of all time. It certainly is my favorite.","This book is a &quot;must read&quot; for those of us living in Northern and Central California. His descripitons bring the story home. I have assigned this book to students for extra reading. I believe it should be assigned reading in our local high schools.","After I picked this up I realized I read this book a long time ago. Because the time setting is over 60 years ago some of the language and terminology has passed into disuse but, what would you expect? Entertaining and thought provoking.","I read this book about 35 years ago as a paperback and just decided to read it again as a Kindle edition. I liked it much more when I read it as a teen, now in my 50's it seemed kind of slow. It's not one of those books you read over and over again.","I first read this book as a senior in high school, and it's stayed with me all this time. Some typos and poor editing in this edition, but the story is worth reading and sharing with friends.","From start to finish, the book was entertaining if not thought provoking. I enjoyed the the perspective of the main character throughout the book and each encounter. He was much more relatable than most protagonists in the genre. I recommend this book to anyone looking in the survival / post-apocalyptic genre.","For the year written, it seemed ahead of it's time. It does not compare to &#34;Alas, Babylon&#34;. At one point I put it aside and read another book. Though, as the principal aged, his thought's and actions, were first class.","Warning before you read, no cannibals or massacres are devices used in this novel. It is a thinking man's teotwawki! I totally enjoyed sharing the thoughts of this quiet man who watched his world rebuild. Great balance for all the survivalist info I glean from all my other beloved shtf reads!","This classic book reminds us how greatly our civilization affects our surroundings yet how temporary and insignificant we are in this world.Mr. Stewart has written a book that keeps pressure on the reader to think introspectively. The style is easy to read and allows such personal thoughts to mingle with the words being read.","If seen only as an example of early writing in this genre - mankind after the apocalypse - this should be taken as an acceptable novel as compared to later attempts in the same vein. The characters don't really develop and just seem to stumble along without learning how to cope beyond what they knew &#34;before&#34;, which makes for a somewhat plodding read.","I read the Earth Abides, after listening to a friend describe this story as one of the most impactful he had ever known. Several years later in the early 1980's, I stumbled across a slightly used copy in a bookstore. George Stewart tells a fascinating tale of a post apocolyptic vision staged in the East Bay section of the San Francisco Bay area. This story has stayed with me and endures as a valued set of images. The struggle to make sense of the horrific and nonsensical was intuitively accurate. The story revealed in human terms the everyday efforts of a small group of survivors, suddenly stranded and adrift. The beneficiaries of a hulking but hollow industrial infrastructure that no longer served those who remained and their succeeding generations. The unfolding &quot;descent&quot; of industriatized society as well as the marginalization of technology was at once fascinating and frightening. The ending left me stunned, yet wisened.","My 12 year old daughter is reading Alas, Babylon right now and was discussing the plot with me. I immediately remembered reading Earth Abides over 10 years ago and was wondering if it could still be found. Obviously, there are lots of fans. What a compelling story about the potential future of mankind. Should be required reading in school","I read this book when I was 12 or 13 years old (more than 30 years ago) and it had a lasting impact on me. I have long since forgotten most of the &quot;classics&quot; I have read but this story has stayed with me through the years. Friends think I'm nuts when I say things like &quot; as you yourself, Ish, well know!&quot; right out of the blue. I just stumbled across it at Amazon and immediately ordered it. I can't wait to read it again!","I first read this book about 20 years ago, it caught my eye because the opening date used in the book is my birthdate 12/22/47. Have read it many times since and it never fails to make me re evaluate my current situation and really look at what is important and what is not. This is a must read book for me at least once evey 18 months.","I read this book 10 or 20 years ago, and I still think about it nearly every week. Where would I choose to live? What would I try to save? I have even thought of making my own screenplay adaptation based on the book. If the author needs help or motivation, then please e-mail me!","Read this book when you're really depressed. You will realize that things are not all that bad. Earth Abides provides hope. Even if everything we hold dear, everything we assume to be permanent, everything human disappears, the dream will survive.This is not the metaphysical good v. evil crap of Stephen King, nor the bang-bang rootin' shootin' end of the world of the pulps, but a quiet look at what the world would be like if mankind silently slipped away.","This book was captivating, and exciting. It makes you think abou the fragility of life, and how quick things change. This should be read at least once in your life. Stewart was 40 years ahead of his time when he wrote this and you don't want to miss out on it.","To read this book for the first time, at 10 years of age, is to enter suddenly into the reality of the fragility of the material society into which we are submerged.How could everyone really die off like that? This was MY town! MY Bay Area! MY UC Berkeley campus playground! A major metropolis! Fascinated, I couldn't put the book down. Living in Oakland, Ca. in the late 60's, I avidly looked out the windows when traveling through the East Bay, striving to see that little pony, running and running and running.It was beyond my comprehension that a thing so large as the Bay Bridge, which my grandfather had had a hand in building, could fall apart! I had thought such a thing would take ages and ages to break, not just a generation.All it takes is an earthquake, a dash of sea salt and a virulent bug.","This book is way ahead of it's time in exploring the way mankind can be taken down by virtue of the adaptabiliy of micro-organisms exploiting the large population of world ranging individuals. This book is scary that way, not to mention the writing is incredibly good. George Steward shows a love and understanding of ecosystems and how culture can be shaken and lost by the loss of the majority of constituant members. How Isherwood Williams copes with his deminishing expectations for the next generation is realistic and shows how most of us adapt to the whims and caprice of what life can throw at us. This book could be a world shaker if given a good rewrite updating the 1940s slant. With what we know now that Steward seemed to predict would come about intuitively, this work would be very popular today. Don't let that stop you from reading this great, great book.","I wandered in here and was suprised to see that the book was still in print, and how many people had read and loved the book. This was recommended to me about ten years ago by the author's grandson, and I agree with many other readers. It is a timeless and thought-provoking end-of-world scenario. It is a strong argument for compulsory education as well. Very enjoyable.","Earth Abides is a fantastic book. When I noticed it was written in 1949 I was a bit concerned, but it was not dated at all. The simple synopsis of the story is that everyone on the planet dies in a plague, except for a few hundred people. The story follows Ish, who was a ecologist or something and is now forced into the role of designing plans for rebuilding civilization. Along with a few others he meets and adds to his community, the book follows Ish's &quot;tribe&quot; for about 60 years. During that time the human build infrastructure deteriorates along with Ish's hopes of quickly restoring an active civilization. I would like to especially credit Stewart for including two long chapters he calls &quot;Quick Years&quot;, where he moves ahead 10 or 20 years. A less confident author would fill that 20 years with the same nonsense over and over making this a much slower and longer book.","It is a mystery how anyone could read this book and feel it is poorly written. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is a heart-breaking, gut wrenching , beautifully written novel. The only fault I had was its' length. I wanted it to go on and on. That is the highest praise I can give any book. Stephen King's Stand is a very good novel, too, but doesnt hit the emotional chords as well as this one does.","&quot;Earth Abides&quot; deals with the collapse of society after a plague has killed nearly everyone in the world. Isherwood (Ish) Williams was in the mountains when this happened, so he was spared the trauma of seeing everyone die around him.&quot;Earth Abides&quot; is probably one of the more realistic apocalypse books. A plague is tidier and more envionmentally friendly than a nuclear holocaust so the world was quite lucky. The survivors who band together are just ordinary people. No military strategists, scientific experts or specialists. No engineers or architects. They have to cope with life in a world without medical services, police, government, or farmers.Over the years, 20th century life is slipping away and Ish's tribe can't bring any of it back. Decades later San Francisco is a jungle and Ish is the last of the old race. The new race are illiterate hunters but they are also a more decent people. They treat the animals as equals, they are happier and have none of the hangups that affected 20th century society before the plague. They'll never know how to split the atom, build missiles, or damage the ozone layer.Because history tends to go round in circles I don't think civilization really died after the plague. It just went to sleep. One day it will come back, maybe in a few centuries. Something new and better. A rejuvinated world, fresh and clean.&quot;Earth Abides&quot; was a good book. It probably wouldn't work as a movie, though. Not after the criticism that &quot;The Postman&quot; got. But I thought Kevin Bacon would be good as Ish. I'm not sure who would play the other characters.","I was really looking forward to this book, and was left feeling really disappointed. I have now read all of what I consider the \"big-4\" of 50's PA literature, I found Alas Babylon and \"Canticle for Leibowicz\" excellent, \"on the beach\" overly depressing and unrealistic (but I was 16 when I read it so my opinion might have changed by now) but Earth Abides left me un-impressed.I thought the central character was so devoid of likeability and compassion it made him entirely unrealistic, in fact he came across as some sort of post-apocalyptic Daily Mail reader who spend a significant proportion of the first part of the book traversing America deciding if anyone was \"good-enough\" to share his planned new civilisation, but found the survivors too emotional, too provincial, too poor, too black, too uneducated etc etc. \"Ish\" would have benefited from a good punch in the face, and the only character who might have offered to give him one was executed for bragging about his carnal adventures whilst drunk.His long suffering and dignified wife Em, also had to make the startling confession that she was of mixed race and was beside herself with gratitude that Ish didn't then and there string her up from a nearby tree (like Charlie).The pace of the story is languid and the descriptions interesting, but for me, the entire book was held back by the attitudes and small mindedness of the central character.I am generally not a fan of the \"marauding biker gangs\" type PA style but in this case, if the Toecutter had rocked up at Ishs' house and decapitated him with some sort of boomerang, then the community and post-plague America would have been done a great service.Sadly, the attitudes of Ish probably just reflected those extant in America in the 50's but that means that the story has dated particularly badly, and although Alas Babylon also suffers from the same malady, the central character in that book is much more human and flawed and this makes that book a more engaging read.I am currently reading \"Summer of the Apocalypse\" which borrows some elements from Earth Abides, but is a much better fit for me in terms of what I like in PA books.","I first read this book when I was twelve and lived very near Berkeley. It was the first time I had seen the word \"ecologist\". The book has stayed with me for the last 59 years. I have reread it many times, and have used it as a basis for many earth sciences classes. While it is in a sense, apocalyptic, it is not preachy, or sensational, but a gentle, detailed reminder that in this day of climate change, it is not earth that is in danger, but our own and related species. That Ish, the protagonist , is an observer rather than a charismatic leader, gives us, as readers, a chance to observe with him the deeply meaningful theme that, \"men come and go, but Earth abides. One of my all time favorite reads.","Man has passed and what remains are the things built to sustain us; our cities, bridges, highways, grocery stores, street signs, power plants and dams, parked cars and canned peaches. These things do not simply disappear. Yet with enough time much will be lost to the weeds, the earth will take it back and intermingle our fallen silver coins with the pebbles of the riverbank.***As one of the founding novels of apocalyptic fiction, \"Earth Abides\" is not only a tale of what comes after global disaster but what is means to be human in the simplest and grandest sense. Although written in 1949, it continues to be praised decades later and for good reason, it is a captivating book that reaches beyond the genre of science fiction and into the heart of humanity. On the surface, \"Earth Abides\" is the tale of Isherwood Williams' survival yet it such an expansive novel that the tale of one man becomes that of all mankind.In our contemporary world we tend to forget (or deny) that individuals are entangled within society for better or worse, but the truth is that we cannot be separate from our culture, our history, and our way of life. I found this novel to be a mindful mediation on what it means to be a part of a community and a sort of Anthropological study of civilization.I was surprised and actually relived to find there were no zombies, no riots, no constant struggle to fight hordes of panic stricken survivors, but a rather calm and quiet end to the human race as it once existed. To be sure it seemed quaint; this notion of a peaceful ending in spite of sudden pandemic and inevitable death, but it was surprisingly optimistic without being wholly nave. Many people would likely continue to follow the rules of society even without the enforcers of law for a while, but with time, these things would matter less and less. And despite many who choose to do no harm to their neighbors, there will always be some men who pose a danger to his peers in malice or self-preservation.","I was surprised how well \"Earth Abides\" held up as a post-apocalyptic novel being read in 2010, even though it was published in 1949 - over 60+ years ago. It was remarkably current, in my opinion. Yes, there were a few politically incorrect/outdated views on women, race and retardation - based on this day and age. But if you read it based on the reality of 1949, some of the ideas put forward by Stewart were actually ahead of his time.This novel is not an action packed, shoot em up, zombies control the earth PA novel. It is a character study on how different people or small groups of people react or shut down in a disaster. And the way they act and react may not be what we would consider to be the best - for the individuals involved or for the salvation of mankind. But I can actually see the events in \"Earth Abides\" happening. Scary to think of but imaginable. This book stands the test of time.","I ordered the audio book based on an article that called it \"one of the best post-apocalyptic novels\". I expected a plot that would detail the heroic efforts of the protagonist to survive and thrive in the world after most of the human population dies. I did not expect the protagonist and his band of survivors to do the obvious - to be scavengers upon the bones of civilization, and to give up or not even try to keep or advance civilization's progress up to that point. The slow realization that the path of least resistance would be the course of action was one of the most depressing and poignant moments I have had in considering the future of humans on this planet. I felt I was personally witnessing the de-evolution of mankind.Of particular interest to me was that the author, George R. Stewart, chose to use a virus as the vehicle that killed most of the inhabitants, not the obvious nuclear holocaust. The fact that atomic bombs were capable of killing off the bulk of mankind was still very fresh in the minds of his readers in the late 1940's. Viruses as agents of destruction seem to be one of the very real swords hanging over our heads today, making us relate to this book even more.","George Stewart's \"Earth Abides\" is regarded as a classic of the overcrowded post-apocalyptic genre, and for good reason. But the book achieved classic status only because its post-apocalyptic setting is a secondary feature of the narrative.Stewart didn't write an adventure story about a loner/survivor who must fend off attacks from marauding mutants. In fact, given the context, there is surprisingly little action at all.Instead, \"Earth Abides\" puts you inside the mind of the main character, Ish, for an extended meditation on the nature, specifically the frailty, of human existence.Stewart ranges far and wide, if not deeply, into an astonishing array of issues, from the personal to the universal. That said, there is a core idea, which the title expresses in part:Earth abides. The dude does not.It is a pagan formulation: Earth 1, Humanity 0. And while I would put it another way, I'm at least grateful that Stewart made me think. Who needs marauding mutants?","This book has been torpedoed by some readers because it isn't \"The Stand.\" While \"the Stand,\" is one of my favorite books, what happens after the world is wiped out by plague becomes highly supernatural. Much as I like that, Stewart shows a much more realistic side of what would happen to whatever few survivors this world might have if a plague took most of us out of circulation. Any possible community would be small, and battle dogs, ants, rats, diseases, and the like. The characters here are never to be forgotten--Ish, Em, Joey and Charlie above all, and the plot stays with you long after the book is finished. I read it in the '80s when I worked on a book assembly line. Imagine my delight that it is now available again. This is up there with \"Alas Babylon,\" and just a bit less depressing than \"On the Beach.\"","I read some of the rave reviews by others which made me decide to order this book. Of the end of the world genre, I would say this rates near the bottom.I guess what annoyed me the most was how far off the author was to guessing how the world would decay... I'll list a few examples and let you decide for yourselves.1. The rate of decay of everything was grossly exagerated. Rail lines reduced to nothing but a pile of rusty chips in only 30-40 years? Entire houses rotting away and completely gone in just 10-15 years? Huge dams rotting and breaking after only 5 years? Very silly scientific assumptions.2. The lack of doing anything worthwhile for a so called smart man. He can only teach just one child to read? Doing basically nothing to improve his life over the course of 40 years?3. He comletely underestimated human will. The children in the tribe lacked any kind of basic intelligence. The author probably never had kids and assumed they are stupid without a formal education.You know what, this isn't even worth my time to continue listing all the flaws. Trust me, spend your time watching one of the recent Discovery Channel episodes on the end of the world without man, it would be much more compelling then this book.","I just finished this book, and I have to say it was interesting but nothing really special. I read The Stand many years ago, and loved it, although it was extremely unrealistic. Earth Abides has the realism, but it overdoes realism, without too much excitement. Basically if you have some time and want a quick read, pick this novel up, but if you are looking for a spectacular sci-fi or post apocolyptic book you are better off picking up another novel.","This tale of the apocalyse is very thorough in its examination of all of the changes in the ecosystem if man were to disappear from the earth. The first half of this book is a real page turner as the main character travels the countryside to discover what has become of the great cities of the U.S. after most of the human race has been wiped out by a deadly disease. Unfortunately, the second half of the book sinks into mediocrity as Ish's small band of survivors shun the \"old ways\" in favor of a return to illiteracy and primative life, which makes the second half kind of not belieavable. Christians [should] be offended that the author has absolutely no respect for and even argues against the existence of God in this book. Nevertheless this is a great book and worth the time and money.","The Greatest Book I've Ever ReadIn the book Earth Abide, By George R. Stewart thesubject at hand throughout the book is the survival of man. Thisbook takes place in San Francisco California where a vast plaguehas almost wiped out all of the Homo-Sapiens. This book followsthe life and times of one man (Isherwood)and his struggles to rrebuild his past American life. This is very heart warming thatour culture would last to the breaking point of our species. Ihope you all feel the same.Isherwood starts out in the mountains on a school studytrip. This is when he became sick from a rattle snake bite. Hereeven before the plague he had to struggle for his life. \"I justhave to cut the bite holes and extract the poison,(Stewart 12).This characteristic shows that he is a survivor and foreshadowshis success aaginst the plague.He also in many other ways begins to stabilize hissurvival iin this book. He ensures safety by meeting othersurvivors and creating a tribe. He tries to edjucate their youthwith their past culture, but loses the young ones to moreexciting activities. He even tries to better the adults, but hefaces complete anguish because not a single person cares. \"Nothanks, were going to play with the bulls, and go dodgin,(Stewart 44).Isherwood thorugh much heart ache and disappointment,goes for one last hurrah to save his people. He teaches his twomiddle aged boys to drive, and sends them in a cross countrysearch of survivors. When they return, it was to no avail. Theygave up and found no one worth finding. Ish is lost agian tothis new world.This is a reamarkable book that is one so captivating iscauses internal turmoil in yourself. By reading of a quitepossible tradgedy, it makes life much sweeter. Also by seeinganother man struggle so hard for all that we stand for isinspiring. Even though Ish couldn't accomplish what he wantedit's good to see he had a moment of clarity at the end of hislife. For then he realized how the only constant is change, andthat Earth Abides.","This book Earth Abides by George R. Stewart is about a man who passes by a massive disease which basically obliterates the US. This man, Ish, has to come to realization of this huge crisis and try to find survivors. It goes on and on about his thoughts and shows the struggles that he faces it the horrid situation. He goes around america finding survivors and ends up making a huge family in the end.This book was basically boring and depressing because it was just lagging on and on about how he thought of everything. It made you want to fall fast asleep at times too. (something that i obviously did) I am one of those kind of people who likes adventure and this book had none. It just was one of those books that wanted to show how horrible things could happen to us if we don't watch it. It sort of chilling and makes you depressed to think that it could happen. George R. Stewart was probably giving a good message out when he wrote this, but in the sense that people want to live there lives without this catastrophe, it is not very good.I would not recommend this book to kids under the age of 12 because it probably is too advanced for them. Also because kids do not have to worry about this sort of horror happening to them at that young of an age. People who need to sleep at night and want to fall asleep fast, please read. If you like adventure and mystery in a book, please go find a different book.","The book held great promise in the first few dozen pages... a believable plague and a believable reason for the protagonist to have survived. It goes rapidly downhill from there. The lead character, Ish, is pompous, self-absorbed, grating, and oh so very tedious. Even giving credit to the fact that the book was written in 1949, there are some very basic errors. Canned goods don't remain safe after 20 years, nor does gasoline remain usable. I kept reading hoping that the book would go somewhere, but it really never did. If you must download this book to your Kindle, do yourself a favor and pull down the sample. Read it, enjoy it, and move on. There's NOTHING more there. If you persist, don't say that I didn't warn you.","2 stars for the \"human\" emotional experience but the book lacked excitement and was mostly dull and depressing. The year of the rats, grasshoppers, etc. How original - not. The only thing the people did was marry more than one wife and breed. No one learned from \"George\" on how to keep the plumbing and houses in good order. No formal schools were set up so everyone learned to read so civilization could rebuild itself. They talked and made plans but never followed though.Ironic their small group refused to breed with a pretty but dim witted female because they didn't want dim witted children yet in terms of learning, each successive generation became dumber anyway. The author must like caveman because his little \"tribe\" is rapidly devolving into that era.","Many of the rave reviews for Stewart's post-apocalyptic novel are by readers who first read it many years ago. After prodding from a trusted reader-friend, I read it last month for the first time. Our hero, Ish, is uninspiring, and the other characters are wooden. Although the premise is a clever one, and many of the events that occur are unexpected and therefore interesting, it's difficult to get caught up in this story of mankind's fate after a disease wipes out most of humanity.Everything in the novel occurs within one man's lifespan, and it is therefore not surprising that Stewart exaggerates character traits so that mankind will swiftly evolve. But the characters are so unenlightened - Ish is the only one interested in teaching children to read, and he gives up after a while - that it's hard to take seriously Ish's assurance (to himself?) that these are average Americans.In short, an interesting concept but flawed in the execution.","If you like this kind of book, you must read this one. Written in the late 40's, this is the grandaddy of all apocalypse stories.","Earth AbidesEarth Abides, a novel by George Stewart taps into people's fascination of being the last one on earth. In this book the main character Isherwood Williams (Ish) survives arattlesnake bite in the mountains and returns to find almost every single person dead from a cataclysmic plague. Ish survives the plague and explores. While exploring he finds other survivors and they try re-founding American civilization. They live above San Francisco Bay in the Berkeley hills.Although this novel is well written and very real, I did not like it. The author put a lot of thought into it but it just didn't interest me. This book wasn't all boring, it hadsome good things about it. One of which is how it was frightening because this could really happen to mankind if we don't watch out, but there was more dull things than scarythings in this book. I also thought that it was weird that Ish and the rest of the community were so interested in caring on civilization instead of thinking about their own survival.The only reason that I finished this book is that it is based in the bay area and that is where I live so I can relate to the scenery that the author describes. If you didn't live in the bayarea then this would be one more thing that wouldn't interest you.I would not recommend this novel. It is interesting at the beginning but then gets boring. It is too long and the author seems to drag on subjects to the point where I don'tcare anymore. If you were going to read this book I would say it is best suited to high school or college students. If a young person read it I don't think that they would understand it.","Stewart's Earth Abides has long been considered a classic in the sci-fi genre and a classic apocalyptic novel (it even helped to inspire Stephen King's The Stand). And it is no wonder why. Stewart has a highly believable, excellently written story here. Though it does lose something in the the third part of the book, when Ish is an old man. One you should definately pick up.","I think I first read this book when I was about fourteen, and it made a powerful impression on me then, so much so that I could still remember almost the entire story some forty years later. But, given that youthful impressions are sometimes not all that accurate, I decided to re-read this and see if it is really as good as my memory said. It is.The scenario is simple: what would happen if a new virus suddenly wipes out almost everyone? And this is no ordinary disease, as the fatality rate is incredibly high, leaving (at most) perhaps one person in 100,000 alive. With this as a starting point, Stewart looks at his new world though the eyes of Isherwood Williams, who is something of a loner, intellectual in outlook, an observer, rather than a doer. This outlook stands him in good stead in the immediate aftermath of the great die-off, as it gives him a reason to live, to observe just how the Earth will react to the sudden removal of that pesky, environment-changing species called man. And reaction there is: ants, rats, dogs, cattle, cats, wheat, corn - each has its fortunes drastically impacted. Many of these changes are detailed in some interstitial material that is told from an omniscient viewpoint, very reminiscent of the similar technique Steinbeck used in The Grapes of Wrath, and perhaps these sections are just as powerful as Steinbeck's, though they don't have quite the great prose-poetry that Steinbeck had. By detailing these changes in this manner, Stewart makes his scenario both highly believable and very immediate.But Stewart's main focus is what happens to the very few people that are left. Ish eventually finds some other survivors, most especially the lady who will become his wife, Em, and here we find some buried social commentary that probably made this book quite controversial when it was first published in 1949, as Em is not white, a point made very subtly and never directly stated, as one of the clear messages here is that race, looked at from the standpoint of long-term survivability, is of absolutely no consequence.Another point of departure for this work from the standard disaster scenario is that there is no world-saving hero; mankind cannot get back on its feet in short order and re-establish civilization, and that the great majority of survivors would necessarily live off the leavings of the old civilization, for the simple reason that it is far easier to open a can of tomatoes than grow your own. That this same attitude of doing the minimum to survive would carry over into other aspects of post-disaster living, so that there would be little or no effort to teach children how to read or fix some of civilization's infrastructure as it slowly fails, such as electrical power or water supplies, is perhaps a debatable point, but Stewart's depiction makes this very logical and believable. Right alongside of this portrayed attitude is what do people do when there no longer is any `law': what is right and wrong and how do people cope with actions by some that threaten the survivability of the Tribe? The answer Stewart shows to this problem may disturb some people, but it strikes at the heart of the whole concept of `for the good of the many' and what personal moral responsibility is.Some have commented that this book is `dated', and there is some of this, as tube radios and phonograph turntables show just where technology was at the time of publication, but any serious reader will quickly realize that the specifics of the technology are immaterial to the thrust of this work. And perhaps somewhat ironically, there is one item detailed here that is as current as tomorrow's headlines, when Ish pulls down a book from the University shelves which details imminent climate change (keep in mind when this written!) and decides that this, too, is irrelevant to his current needs - the climate will be whatever it is, and mankind will just have to live with it.The last section of this book paints a very powerful picture of just how gods, legends, and social mores become ingrained in a society. Perhaps it's not the prettiest picture of where mankind is headed or how well he'll deal with problems, but it is remarkably plausible and will produce strong feelings of melancholy, despair, and (perhaps) subdued pride.A remarkable work which avoids just about all the pitfalls of typical post-apocalyptic works, and has a great deal to say about just what makes man man and what is truly relevant to the daily business of living.---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)","A virus wipes out 99.9% of the population, leaving the few stragglers left to figure out how to survive, organize (or not), etc. Don't be fooled into thinking that because this book was published in 1949 that it somehow won't be 'with it'. It's pretty well thought out, both in terms of what happens to the people AND everything else (dogs, cats, cattle, crops - things which other authors might leave out entirely), and in a departure (which I won't reveal here) from the usual 'we'll survive and things will eventually return to normalcy' plot so often present in this type of book.","Stewart's novel begins with a science fiction premised used by Stephen King in The Stand -- a virus quickly wipes out most of the world's population -- but from that point on, the two books (and others that have used this idea) are completely dissimilar. Stewart has little interest in the plague itself, and it is covered in a short part of the book. Rather, his interest is in how people react to being deprived of modern civilization. For years, his characters try to keep things going by teaching their children to read, and keeping memories of the old world alive. However, the drastically changed circumstances of their children's lives make this impossible, and the small group of survivors descend to a hunter-gatherer civilization.Stewart also addresses the question of what would ordinary people do who find themselves deprived of the protections of the law, and thus having to make their own difficult choices.Those who read this book expecting a typical science fiction novel will be disappointed. Stewart uses science fiction themes to explore significant issues in much the same way that George Orwell did in 1984. An excellent novel.","Apparently many of the reader-reviewers are science fiction or horror fans and thus compare Stewart's novel with that genre. Those readers are not likely to appreciate the ideas expressed in &quot;Earth Abides&quot;. Stewart was one of the first fiction writers to deal with ecology and human's place in the balance of nature and his extrapolations from anthropological thought of that period (1940's) are exceptional. It seems that many of the readers, without realizing it, got so caught up in the novel that they criticise the protagonist's character flaws as though he were a &quot;real&quot; human wanting him to be &quot;more insightful&quot; and less of a pedantic man. Those flaws appear to make him more authentic.Although classified as science fiction, the term speculative fiction is a better fit. It is interesting that the period of time covered, approximately 1948, to the present day, and although it was written in the late 1940's, it is still fresh today. Looking back, if there had been a catastrophe at that time, we would very likely today be at the point where the novel ends. A hundred years from now the novel is likely to be a classic and hopefully be on a shelf not labeled &quot;Science Fiction.&quot;","I know this is considered a classic, but, in my opinion, it does not pass the test of time. None of the characters, including the narrator, Ish, is engaging, and the passivity of the survivors is hard to accept. I don't need zombies to make PA fiction exciting, but reading about survivors who basically just live as if nothing has changed, happy to eat canned food is dull and depressing.","Well what can I say - if you want a book that will make you think about it not only whilst you are reading it but for a long time afterwards, then this is the book for you. The story is great and I thought Ish's character was great too - I know some people didn't like him (including my husband) - but I think that is just the point. He is a young man with little experience who thinks he knows everything because he has been to university, but really doesn't know that much at all. Sure he's not perfect but who is! He does the best he can and whilst we may not always agree, at least he is a believeable character. It has been a long time since I have read a book and thought \"wow\" when I was reading it and wanted to debate it for hours afterwards. The only other memorable books I can think of are \"Wild Swans\", \"Watership Down\" and \"Day of the Triffids\". This beats all of them! I followed \"Earth Abides\" with \"Timescape\" - which made me appreciate even more just how good \"Earth Abides\" really is.","\"...and the government of the United States of America is herewith suspended, except in the District of Columbia, as of the emergency...\"With those ominous words begins a classic tale of the end of human civilization. \"Ish\" (a graduate student whose given name is Isherwood Williams) is the barely tolerable protagonist who survives a rattlesnake bite (and possibly some strange infection) only to leave the forest and find a world of ghost towns. As Ish discovers, while he was in seclusion, engaged in fieldwork for his thesis, a virulent plague broke out worldwide and eliminated virtually every other human being from the face of the earth. Instead of descending into a drunken madness like one of the few survivors he meets, Ish roadtrips across the country looking for a vestige of the learned civilization he remembers. Alas, his quest comes up empty-handed, for, as he discovers, not many people have survived the plague, and those who did are (understandably) not too interested in higher education or high culture, preferring instead to focus on subsistence and maintaining their sanity. Along the way he picks up a loyal friend in the form of a dog, and finally returns to the Bay Area of California, where he meets a group of survivors and sets out to re-establish some kind of human community. In the second half of the novel, we follow the growth of this community and are faced with Ish's growing apprehension about humanity's future. Much to his chagrin, the aspects of civilization he prizes so much--music and art appreciation, reading and literature, mathematics and philosophy, etc.--seem to have no place in this new world where humans are once again a part of the natural order and not her proud conquerors.While the novel itself is quite a good read, filled with interesting speculative insights into human life after the collapse of modern civilization, Ish provides an aggravating example of the 1940s American white male ivory tower academic (his character's qualities definitely date the novel). When he encounters black survivors in the South, he muses about the possibilities of exploiting them and establishing his own little fiefdom. He continually considers his cohorts in the new community as his intellectual inferiors, even as they manage to carve out a new life in the face of this overwhelming calamity while he reads his books. That he spends more time worrying about the restoration of high civilization than about the very real issues of day-to-day survival that they face was also incredibly infuriating. Ish is at his most distasteful when he contemplates his son Joey, a boy whose sole worth seems to be the fact that he is bright and can read. Somehow, though, in spite of all his character flaws, Isherwood Williams ' arrogance and detachment are finally overcome by his circumstances, and he has, if not a complete change of heart, then at least an acceptance of the reality that \"men go and come, but earth abides.\"","This post apocalyptic book starts off strong with somewhat of a new twist on the traditional post-collapse civilization, as told by one graduate student and his struggle with a life after modern conveniences are gone. He is an observer kept alive as the second wave of deaths wash over the world by a mere need to observe and discover. I'll never forget reading as if with him while he waited for electric power to finally fail. The lights dim slightly and with this realization he waits up as a long time friend passes into oblivion. Several of the concepts are quite dated (the copy I read was re-released in the 70s but still referred to household items long since out of date and probably belonged in the original publication from '49).The main character is faced as being the only intellectual left in a small band of survivors he later deems \"The Tribe.\" This is the placement of the majority of the book and faces the questions of what humans would do with so much time on their hands? How they would adapt to a life with everything they need laying about them, but no deadlines to push them to reestablish a civilized world? It also conicals several things other books leave out, such as the adoption of odd superstitions about \"Americans\" by children who have never known a life with organized government or life outside of their small Tribe. I would give this part of the book a higher score, but the later portion fell short of my expectations and the standards set by the rest of the work.As the book continued it became quite redundant and predictable, and though I had high hopes the book would somehow redeem itself and return to it's previous glory, I was left disappointed. If you are looking for a book with a strong resolution upon completion, this is not a book for you. While I am glad I finished it (the first half was quite good), and several major problems were resolved, a larger picture of what would happen with the passing of the main character was left unsaid (though a general idea was obvious and alluded to several times). This portion of the book brought down the overall rating I could give.I would recommend this book as an easy read with an interesting take on the traditional end-of-the-world concept.","Earth Abides from George R Stewart is a good book about what would happen if suddenly the entire world population, except for a few, would die from a disease. As such, the book is remarkable as one of the first post-apocalyptic novels in existence (dating from 1949). And it is a very well thought through one too. Aiming for realism, exploring the various effects and problems the survivors would face, it renders the many successive post-apocalyptic stories as merely unrealistic popcorn stories. However, don't expect the story to \"draw you in\". The events are typically kind of boring, and even though there is a distinct set of characters, they never really develop. Further, the writing style is not always really gripping, but rather unexciting. Also the dated moral reflections might be a let down for some, but I suppose that is mainly caused by the time the book is written.The book details a number of time periods: just after the epidemic, 5 years later, 20 years later, and 50 or 60 years later. The time in between is sketched very roughly. The story centers on Ish, a survivor of the mysterious epidemic. Ish is an academic, working on his (PhD?) thesis in Biology. We learn later that if the epidemic would not have struck that Ish would probably end up as a professor (like the writer). Ish is, apparently, the only 'thinker' left on the world, and all the people he meets are about (or under) average on IQ and ideas, but not necessarily in other practical matters. Ish is an observer, not really a natural leader, and he does his best to plan a safe way for the remaining people towards a new civilization. However, it becomes clear, that even though Ish knows a lot and has many skills, that a lot of work and ideas hardly influence the people in his community and that he fails on many great planned things, even though he also has some unexpected success with small but eventually rather important things.The good part of the book, what makes it a classic, is that it explores most issues you can think off about what would happen if such an epidemic would occur. It explores the psychological effect in the beginning, the scavenging of the stores for existing goods, the mingling of very different average people in a group, the effect on the rest of the ecology by the sudden disappearance of men, the effect of aging on materials, infrastructure and goods, the way the average people would face these changes, (small) group interactions, diseases, unnecessary skills (e.g. reading), the automatic development of groups of people, and the limited effect of the ideas of the intellectual few (maybe dealing with some of the writer's own frustrations). And probably I forgot a few explored ideas as well.However, the book is not perfect, and not a classic in the sense of some Heinlein, Clarke or Asimovs that I have read. Some flaws: characters are rather stereotypical, the main character seems to be a bit thick and single minded at many points (irritating sometimes), all characters have a great lack of initiative and many times things just stay as they are, but also not all ideas are fully (satisfyingly) worked out. Also some logical plot holes exist, and timescales of things happening seem to be bended a bit to fit with the lifetime of the main character.However, in spite of the many small flaws I shortly pointed out, I can still recommend the book. It is not for everyone, and certainly not for people that look for a really exciting story, but the discussed ideas and the thoroughness in which many of those are explored (making it a kind of hard-scifi book), combined with the historical value of this book as a very early post-apocalyptic book make this book really valuable and read-worthy. If you are not immediately letdown by its flaws and if you are interested in idea-books and speculative fiction, I would certainly give this one a try.","It's been awhile since I read this book, but what I remember about this book is that it insults you and basically says that if you haven't gone to college and grad school that you cannot be intelligent or sire intelligent children. The author writes this book about the one truly intellegent person left alive. He portrays the rest of the survivors, who are average non-college educated, blue collar types, as little more than simpletons. The main character and the author doesn't even try to have the survivors learn to use the left over technology to help better their situation because they are too dumb. When they reproduce only Ish sires an intellegent child. The rest of the chilren are all dumb like their parents. Bah, that's it. My hatred for this book is off my chest. I don't reccommend it.","Having loved this story 20 years ago as a teenager, it pains me now to find that it is surely the most badly written book on my bookshelves. All the characters are two-dimensional. The dialogue is uniformly stiff and amateurish. Worse, there's a faintly fascist tone running throughout the entire story that I failed to notice as a callow youth, but that now reveals itself on almost every page. Perhaps the saddest aspect of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that the story is clearly and shockingly the fantasy of an author who was very probably an insecure misfit who dreamed of existing in a world without people, or at least with just a handful of simple folks over whom he could rule as their intellectual master. If Stewart had spent some time in analysis, &quot;Earth Abides&quot; might never have been written. It is a truly awful book.","Plot Kernel - A deadly virus has nearly annihilated the human race, leaving all other life untouched. Civilization has ended. A survivor searches for others and eventually joins with a woman who lost her family in the epidemic. In time, he becomes the leader of a few families who have intermarried and who together live off the abundant supply source of the otherwise uninhabited city.","I love post-apocalypse fiction, but I can't figure out why everyone likes this one. The first 1/3rd of the book is great, as the main character experiences what becomes of his world after everyone else dies. Then it's as if the last half of the book was written by a female. It's mostly introspective, about how the character feels, and nothing really happens. If you want a page turner from front to back, read 'Alas Babylon','One Second After', or 'Without Warning'. I would donate this book to my local library, but I would feel guilty knowing some poor guy might pick this up and waste as much time on it as I did.","Great story of what would happen if a lazy / self proclaimed intellect survived the human apocalypse. Ish may have let thousands of years of basic knowledge disappear without getting off his highchair for a second. But, in the end at least \"Jingle Bells \" survived his incompetence and carried on.","I was very excited when I received this book, because I had read great reviews about it. However, it did not hold up to my expectations. The first two thirds of the story consist of the main character driving back and forth across the country looking for survivors (that is as far as I made it- leisure reading should not have to be a chore). When he does encounter survivors, he only stays for a brief time to visit with them and moves on. That is it. There are no conflicts. There is no tension or threat from others or nature. No plot. He simply drives back and forth looking for people, discovers them, and then moves on. I have never read anything more boring, not even required readings for courses I have taken. Perhaps this book was the first of its kind when it came out, and that may be why it has such acclaim, but the storyline is nonexistent. On the up side it does have some very well written descriptions of the land and animals (that is the only good thing I can say about this book).","Wordy, verbose, unrealistic. Meeting around a table with the woman who eventually gives him children, written like a bad female romance novel.Emotionally mature hunter-gatherers evolve from his haphazardly raised progeny. Unrealistic ending, which was a slog to get to.","If you are easily depressed or get melancholy, do not read this book. If the thought of the human race dying out and mother earth thriving gives you the warm fuzzies, then this book is for you. After the major opening disease-kill tragedy there's *some* hope for man... then less hope for man... then a little more hope for man... then a *lot* less hope, and on, and on. It's an emotional roller coaster that, on average, only looses altitude. In the end, earth wins, man looses. I had 100 pages remaining to read and finally had to flip to the last page so. I. could. just. &quot;end it&quot;. Yuk. Two weeks later I still have a bitter taste in my mind. If you like sci-fi's such as &quot;ender's game&quot; I predict you'll hate this book too. My hope here is that I've saved somebody else the pain.","I started becoming interested in the post-apocalyptic genre after watching a few episodes of the TV show \"Jericho\" (which is quite interesting in Season 1). While searching this category on Amazon, \"Earth Abides\" popped up a few times along with several other titles. I picked up a copy and read it last weekend. The plot and the characters are mildly interesting and I guess I should cut it some slack having been printed back in 1949. However, I have to say as you get more than halfway through the book, the story line just seems to drag on and on and is generally pretty boring. As I neared the end I found myself skimming from page to page and just praying it would finally end. The copy I bought was used and I threw it away when I was done to prevent someone else from wasting their time with it.By comparison, I also bought a used copy of \"Alas Babylon\" (also printed in the 1950s time frame) and I can safely say it is a far more interesting read after only being about 100 pages into it.","I was very disappointed in this book. It was slow, boring, filled with uninteresting characters, and the writing was extremely stilted. And I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to accept that automobiles would still operate after sitting around with gasoline in their tanks for thirty years. I skimmed through most of the book hoping something interesting would happen, but I was utterly dissappointed. There are better books in this genre, don't waste your time with this one.","A half-century ago, Stewart saw too clearly a future which could, indeed may yet, come to pass. He, and only a few others, survive a world-wide plague. How he attempts to preserve his society - how he prioritizes, what agonizing choices he and his 'flock' make, the compromises they have to accept - makes for among the finest end-of-the-world books ever written. Ish, the main character, is no less uncertain, no less fascinating, than Macbeth. Ish is clearly the everyman each of us could see in him/herself after a catastrophe impossible to imagine. A long book - it could be no less - by its end, one hopes for a sequel. It is not clear whether Stewart is optimistic about this future - and that too is appropriate. For every reader will probably come to a different conclusion as to where the 'tribe' is headed based on his/her own perceptions of what Ish did correctly or otherwise and what the reader might have done differently. No modern home library is complete without Earth Abides.","George Stewart provides a compelling &quot;thumbnail&quot; picture of mankind and how adversity can bring out the best and worst in people. This mini-saga is so well written and loaded with such a rich mix of characters and situations that the reader cannot help but wonder what tomorrow might bring. If you enjoyed Sarum you will love this","I was introduced to this book at a time when the world was beginning to fully envelope the &quot;benefits of technology.&quot; As part of the computer generation, for whom the desires of the world could be acquired at the click of a mouse, Earth Abides awoke in me a deep appreciation for the distance we have come and the importance of the most basic lessons in life. For more than 15 years I have been looking to recapture the insights I discovered in reading the book as an impresionable teenager. How ironic that is technology that now presents me with the opportunity to read it again","I have spent twenty years &quot;selling&quot; this book to friends and acquaintances as a must read. Some &quot;got it&quot;. Others didn't. Read it. If you &quot;get it&quot;, you will re-read it many times again!

Set in the Bay Area and rifewith haunting moral and ethical questions. Every student -heck, every HUMAN - should read this one at least once. I'vebeen through it more than ten times since I read it incollege. TIMELESS.","As the lead character copes with the demise of civilization, we find an elegant creativity that challenges the mind and helps us see the world in new ways. This is one of the greatest books I've ever read and certainly one of the most haunting. I strongly recommend it to anyone.

It is the ACKNOWLEDGED inspiration for THE STAND by Stephen King !!","Facinating concept. It's far ahead of it's time. Written in 1949 it could easily be updated to any time. It must have caused quite the controversy when originally published. Each time I've read it, I've found something new. A perfect book for discussion groups","Lost Books -- Review Number 1 Earth Abides by George R. Stewart D. D. Shade 6/11/98Had Isherwood Williams lived to see our day, with it's social and political decay, he might not have worried so much about &quot;preserving&quot; our culture. As it happens in George R. Stewart's book, the devastating viral plague that cleanses the earth of nearly all human life occurred approximately 50 years ago. Long before the assination of John or Robert Kennedy or Martin Luther King, Jr. Long before the war with Vietnam. Before we put a man on the moon and then cut the space program. Before the pervasion of television and the computer revolution. Before the escalation of the cold war, AIDS, or most of the great serial killers. In other words, Earth Abides takes place in a time that many Americans with gray hair look back upon with nostalgia. The post World War Two years, when those of us between forty and fifty were born. The boomer years. A time of great prosperity. A decade that saw the birth of rock-n-roll, hamburgers, and Oreo cookies. Yet it was a time of great poverty for some. When restrooms, restaurants, and the seats in public transportation were separated by the color of ones skin. When equal pay for equal work was unheard of and a woman's place was in the home. A time when the word 'communist' was the dirtiest and deadliest thing one could call another. An altogether strange time, know as the fifties. It is into this world that Isherwood suddenly finds himself alone. Victim of a freak snakebite while out in the wilderness working on his graduate thesis and survivor of an even more freak accident, the development of a viral plague that wipes out humankind in a matter of weeks. It is altogether fitting that someone named Ish, this is how he signed his name to a hand scrawled will while delirious from the snake bite, should find himself alone in the world. Ish, David Pringle tells us , is a direct reference to the historic Ishi, a California Indian who became famous as the last living representativ! e of his tribe. Ish spends at least a quarter of the book searching for others. He finds a few, lucky people with great immune systems, and in the process stumbles upon the woman with whom he shares the remainder of his years. Together they try to build a community and at the same time rebuild civilization as they had know it. You will have to read the book to learn of Ish's heroic triumphs and failures as he tries to make sure the future has a heritage. Although following the traditional post-apocalyptic formula, that of the earth being cleansed by some means and leaving a few to rebuild civilization, Earth Abides offers some interesting commentary on some central moral questions of our/that time. One of those is racial unrest. Given the nature of European and African American relations in this nation in 1949, Stewart was taking a quite a risk when he developed one particular central character, Em. Ish chooses a strong willed, able, out-spoken, African American woman to be his mate. She was not the first female Ish found, nor was she the best looking, but she had within her the strength to become the mother of a new civilization. Ish recognized this and fell in love with her quickly. And Ish was right-Em alone had the strength and courage to bear the first child in the small community that had grown around them. There was no one who knew how to deliver a baby, and that was frightful enough, but the greatest fear was not knowing if children born into the world would inherit their parents immunity to the plague. Earth Abides is considered a classic by several sources but to my way of thinking, it deserves that exalted position in speculative fiction for having been a forerunner is demonstrating that black and white can live together. Stewart further shows us how important is the relationship between past and future. He does this symbolically through the vehicle of a 4-pound, single-jack hammer. At the beginning of the book, just before the snake bite, Ish is exploring a cave and finds this hammer. It is the! kind miners used in the old days when rock-drills were placed by hand. It is called a single-jack because it can be used with one hand. Ish notes the pleasure he feels when he finds the hammer because of its tie to the past. Even delierous from snake bit, he remembers to take the hammer with him. He keeps it with him throughout the book. As the community grows around Ish and Em, the hammer is used each year to chisel the numbers of the year on a big rock in the hills above where they live. It is always present on the mantel in Ish's living room. And at the end of the book, when Ish has grown old and the younger men, his and other's children, sense that he is ready to pick a new leader for the community, they wait in a circle at his feet for Ish to pick the next leader by giving them the hammer. The importance of tradition to the family and the community is symbolized in the single-jack. John Clute and Peter Nicholls feel that post-apocalyptic or disaster stories are so popular because they appeal to secret desires we all share: a depopulated world, escape from the constraints of a highly organized industrial society, and the opportunity to prove one's ability to survive. I choose the latter of the three. Post-apocalyptic speculative fiction provides a window from which to view the &quot;stuff&quot; of which humankind is made. The writer of a disaster or holocaust story can pit humans against the worst possible odds. The post-holocaust novel gives us the ability to perform an experiment that in reality would be unethical-to put a group of people in hell and record their progress getting out. Earth Abides is a moving, triumpal story of just such a group. No single character in Earth Abides has the stereotypic appeal of Bruce Willis or Nicolas Cage, and yet I came to love them all and worry about their conditions because they were real people. People with many of the same problems and weaknesses I have. People whose actions made me stop and wonder what I would do in the same situation.","I had been really looking forward to this book. Sadly, it really didn't deliver. I found the story telling very linear, the main character Ish, lacking in any real depth and the logic of how he and his small band of people survived, very questionable.I found the first 1/3 of the book interesting. The main character Ish, travels the US in search of other survivers of the deadly plague that ravenged the world. It read more as a travel logue than an sci-fi book, but never the less, was still interesting. However, one would be better served reasing the book, \"A world without us\".Ish, seems nonplused by the vanishing of humanity. The character uses \"logic\" to deal with the situation, but calls those who are enotional or \"crazy\" as being in shock. Frankly, it appeared to me that Ish was in shock, due to his lack of emotion over the loss of basically everyone. It was as if he rationalized it this way, \"wow, everyones gone, oh well, I'm lonely, but that's the breaks\".Finally, gathering enough other stragglers together to form \"the tribe\", they seem to live solely on old can goods from local markers for...22 years!!. I don't know about you, but the last thing I would eat was a can of food that was 22 years old.It appears as if everyone in the \"tribe\" was hit with the stupid stick. Any normal parent would teach their kids the basics of reading and writing, not these folks, it's as if they all just gave up. Plus there is a point in the story where it's highlighted that none of the children even know numbers! WTF? Any normal parent teaches their kids how to count their freaking fingers and toes!Also, the book was written in 1947, yet no one in the book knows a thing about gardening! No one had victory gardens during the war? No one lived on ration cards?It's like all these people dropped out of the sky.There are some many other things wrong with this book, I could go on for pages.Why did I give it 3 stars? 1 for it was a post apocolypic story, the second for the first 1/3 was okay, and lastly, the 3rd star because there were some mildly interesting moments.Beyond that, it's like a group of morons running around in a dark room trying to find the switch.","A brilliatnly written socio-sic-fi. Though the book is a bit austere for the scope fo the catastrophe, it is truly a wonderful tome! Like the later work of Stpehn King's The Stand, Earth Abides explores the questions and illustrates the harrowing reality that might be if a \"super\" disease were to kill most of man-kind.Thought provking and beautifully crafted.","Earth Abides, a novel by George R. Stewart, is an excellent novel that depicts a possible scenario for a post-apocalyptic world. It provides people with a fantasy realm with questions of what could happen and what will happen all through the eyes of the novel's main character, Ish. He joins up with a couple of survivors in what he sees fit for the new world and they create a society that tries to cope with it. George Stewart further enriches the story with character chemistry and strong elements of theme.Themes of survival and love are strongly present throughout the novel. Ish's strong will to contain the community he had once known pushes him to survive so he can teach the next generation of what good can become of it. His relation to Em also draws out the love and caring in Ish.George Stewart uses chemical equations between characters to draw an exact importance of each person in their society. He chooses a man named George who is a carpenter to build and repair homes. He has a friend named Ezra, who acts as an advisor to Ish. They all piece together to form Ish's envision of a good society.The topic that concerns Ish the most is the community he had once known. Ish, who is trying to inflict positive change in society, is cursed with the inability to change himself.Throughout the book, he learns to trust his society and the future, which is dependent on him to lead them. He learns of the differences between the two generations and tries to blend in. He goes through many experiments, which has led in to some disaster and many good.Earth Abides is a great novel about the fantasy and high possibility of a post apocalyptic world. The characters and themes in the novel are beautifully inscribed drawing an essence of drama and suspense into an already stone set feeling of both feelings. Reprising themes of love, survival and many other themes are present to enrich the story. Earth Abides, a novel by George R. Stewart, is a novel I'd recommend to anyone who is interested in character chemistry and the post-apocalyptic ideology of George R. Stewart.","Societies Rise and Decline but the Earth Abides In the classic apocalyptic novel Earth Abides George R. Stewart creates a nightmare on earth that could occur tomorrow when a massive unknown epidemic obliterates almost all of society. A young man named Ish is forced to search for companions on this barren, naked earth void of human life. He searches for sensible people to aid him in his quest for survival and mental sanity. Em is the person who keeps Ish sane and through her love and courage helps him to face the future. Together they find a group of companions, and together they establish a tribe in the Berkeley Hills in the Bay Area. George Stewart1s powerful and realistic writing captivates the reader and makes one imagine how each of us would react in Ish1s situation. Even though his novel gets rather slow in the middle with few dramatic events adding to the plot, Stewart demonstrates the harsh situations and triumphs of life this small nucleus of mankind must face without modern society. Stewart1s writing fascinates the reader by exploring the actions of the offspring of the original seven tribe members and shows how people develops without modern society and all its conveniences. Stewart shows how all-human societies have come about, by tracing the development of this small tribe that survives a cataclysmic disaster. In the novel Stewart puts Ish and the tribe through many difficult trials as they struggle to survive. He is able to create an almost unimaginable situation and turn it into a reality. Each character is developed so well that the reader is able to experience the events. Ish1s leadership is strengthened by Em1s courage and Ezra1s loyal friendship. Because the reader can relate to these believable characters in this unbelievable situation, it is easier for the author to relate his point. Stewart fascinates the reader by showing how man develops with all his customs and superstitions and without a modern society. While reading about the tribe1s triumphs and failures we are able to step back from the modern world and see how civilization perhaps developed. The author examines the growth and characteristics of individual characters. What each of them bring to enable this tribe to survive, show how a society begins and flourishes. Em brings her courage, Ish brings his knowledge and his leadership, George is the carpenter and so on. Each member of the tribe contributed to the betterment of the whole society. Then at that point we are able to see the growth of society again, as if it was cut out from man1s actual past history, when ancient tribes started to develop. . At first the challenges are just simple, to fulfil the basic necessities of survival like shelter, water and food. Once these needs have been fulfilled, the tribe progresses to larger concerns such as education of the younger generations, keeping records and calendars, rules and exploration. Eventually the tribe integrates with outside members sometimes successfully, sometimes not. For instance when Charley comes back with the Robert and Richard he brings disease and chaos to the tribe. The tribe had the difficult decision of banishing him or killing him to protect their way of life. Many of them, including Joey who was the hope for the future as a leader because of his intelligence, die because of this outside influence. Later however the tribe successfully mingles with another tribe, which helps their society grow because there are more possibilities for men and women to find mates in a larger society.All through the novel Stewart accurately demonstrates the development of a simplistic society with all its triumphs and failures, to symbolize the history of human development. He is able to show that future societies would develop as past societies have as long as basic human needs are met. When people have food, shelter and more importantly significant human relationships then a society can begin. The society that Stewart creates starts with two people who found each other in the midst of chaos. They unite with others with whom they are compatible and from this small group a multi generation society formed. In his lifetime Ish saw a society develop. He saw his children and grand children and great grand children living happily. Through Ish1s eyes, the author masterfully shows all of us how societies rise and decline but how through it all the earth itself abides. Stewart in this famous apocalyptic novel captures the reader and artfully demonstrates the nature of human societies.","This book is one of the most moving and realistic surival novels that I have ever read, the suceive plauges of Domsicated animals and pests for one, and the point that the most brilliant minds of of western, and Gobal Civilization would break under the strain of the end of civilization seems all to true. Though the very end of the book was depressing(as San Fransico burns, and the Part about the new Human tribes) but even though civilization is pushed under, it is suggested that it will rise again in the far future though as we watch civilization unravil as Isherwood tries to pick up the peices is heart breaking, his attempt at a school is sad and the way that he finally breaks under the strain of being remembered as a god. This is a great classic of Sf Read this book!!","It really made me think about the sensativity of the planet and society of every day life.","Earth Abides is a great book for the reader new to the science fiction genre. Isherwood and Em are strong characters. The building of a new society is intriguing. I read this book over 25 years ago and I still remember it fondly as my introduction into science fiction books.","I have read and re-read this book over the years. It is riveting, entertaining and more than likely prophetic. The bomb that may destroy us all is the one we can not defend against, the incurable, quick-acting and all powerful virus. A nuclear Dooms-Day could not be more horrifying.","The well conceived story captures the imagination from the start. That's why we buy books like this...right? The intellectual and forward looking main character reminded me of the captain in &quot;The Last Ship&quot;. Read it!","George R. Stewart weaves at once a beautiful and hauntingly believable tale with this novel, one that I've never been able to forget...or wanted to. Once considered dated, with the lessening of global nuclear tensions, the scenario Mr. Stewart envisions for a possible worldwide catastrophe, one brought about not by bombs but disease, has once again come to the forefront and become the most plausible ingredient in mankind's demise. More even than the fact that this is a truly enjoyable read is the deeper message Earth Abides shares with the reader as it reaches down and touches our very hearts, defining what it means to be human in an inhuman environment. The symbolism involved in Isherwood Williams' desire to keep a hammer with him for the future as a tie to the past is obviously an unconscious comment on his personal hope of rebuilding a fallen civilization. A hope that goes unfulfilled in his life time and maybe many lifetimes to follow. The insight into the human psyche that Mr. Stewart demonstates as he carries Isherwood from his youth at the beginning of the book to old age and finally death at the end and Isherwood's subtle change of attitude during that process, rings exceedingly true and speaks volumes about Mr. Stewart's keen and perhaps unique ability to put into words what it really means, or at least should mean, to be human. I've rarely read a book more than once because I just don't have the time, but I've read Earth Abides several times since I was a teen and I know I'll read it several more times before I too reach that stage in my life that Isherwood assures us won't be the calamity our youth oriented culture would have us to believe.","Science Fiction books are hard to remain classics given our growing understanding of science and technology. Earth Abides is an exception because it is written from the perspective of an anthropologist trying to cope with the fact that his world has been destroyed. Like many readers this book changed my life&gt; I read it in my teens, in my 20's and I guess it is time to pick it up again in my 30's.","There are plenty of other reviews that go more in-depth as to why this book is amazing at the top of the list, but i just wanted to contribute to its stats, and give you my .02$Its memorable to the core, i read it almost a year ago now, and have read a decent handful of post-apocalyptic fiction between now and then, and this one really stands out in my mind.From the very beginning it was gripping, and only got better. It didn't focus on the die-off, but on the aftermath, and how it affected the environment, wildlife, and the anthropological ramifications.Once he does meet up with fellow survivors, there's no great battles with cannibals, not even starvation, but just life. The book really gets down to the core of what it is to be human, and what is important, and how different types of people have different priorities, and how these different ways of thinking would affect the rebuilding of human society in a near extinction level event.It both gives you hope, then rips it away, and makes you question what is really important in life. It makes you wonder if the way of life we are living in our modern world is natural, or a freak coinsurance. perhaps it would happen again if somebody hit the &#34;reset&#34; switch.","A bit dated, but a good read nontheless. Some parts are very wrong (such as gasoline, tires, and batteries for a jeep keeping so long, or that all of the stores of weapons and ammunition back when it was written (M1 garands, M1 carbines, 1911s, and all of the civilian models) not being available after the military and most people are gone. But still very imaginative and well written.","This was a real change for me, which I was looking for in a book at the moment. Not an &#34;action&#34; book, but still holds you spellbound at times, and often I couldn't put it down. It had it's slow areas, but not enough to distract from the total experience. A thought provoking story from the 40's I believe - but you will find yourself thinking about things in every day life a little differently. Definitely a good read!","I found this book to be amazing. It is a very detailed -- at times almost too realistic -- depiction of life after an apocalypse. I found Stewart's handling of societal changes quite believable, and more sophisticated than many more modern works. He also does a great job drawing characters that we can believe.I read somewhere that the author was shocked that this is still on the top of many \"The Best of Science Fiction\" lists. Since he set out to write a literary adventure story, and not science fiction. So be it.Whatever you call it, though, it is riveting.","It led the way for so many great apocalyptic yarns, and was influential in literature and in creating an awareness if the fragility of society. Isherwood was a paradigm for most civilized men. He was content to observe life, and was only dragged into life by his wife. When society fell, he calmly observed the fall of civilization, along with it. He dreamt of rescuing civilization...but settled for surviving on it's leftovers.I wonder how many preppers read this in their formative years.","I have read this book several times and it is a timeless classic. It leaves you feeling what the main character would feel under the scenario that this book was created.The World Without Us","The latest post-apocalyptic fiction seems to focus on dealing with deadly infected persons. What if they just all died and a small group had to start over. This book focuses on a main character who is more human than the supermen of modern apocalypse, he's not an ex-special forces operative with pre-med and a welders certificate who grew up on a farm. He's a little lazy, has some relationship issues, a mediocre teacher and in the end is just a normal guy dealing with population events.","A very original and unique plot, particularly given that it was written in 1949, makes this book a great read and not to be missed for fans of the post-apocalyptic sci-fi genre. Most every book since written in this genre borrows elements from this book. The pace of the story moves well and there are many sub-plots which are interesting (in particular, the main character makes frequent introspective observations that are thought-provoking about humankind). Of particular note is how relevant the book is today, over 60 years after it was written.My main negative critique is the general prose and writing style. It is impossible to believe that the author was an English professor... very basic sentence structures, little in the way of character development, and a ridiculous over-usage of exclamatory statements from the novel's characters (literally hundreds of exclamation marks throughout the book). The Kindle version had a number of typos as well.Still a worthy four-star book given its deep and compelling observations on humankind and a very clever and original plot.","I had great expectations when I started this book and got out of it slightly unsatisfied. The book shows pretty well what civilisation is about and how much it is fragile. Also how much civilisation relies on a few individuals only. All the lost knowledge in the library no one can understand remains as a vivid image in my mind.In spite of some theories underlaying the story being already out of date, that book poses essential issues and the empathy we develop for Ish in his efforts and trials to answer them and maintain some civilisation makes the story moving.","This is one of my favorite books. Written in 1949, it's remarkably contemporary and accessible. I love the references to hifi. It seems to me more of a work of philosophy; a meditation on humanity, relationships, change and civilization, which is precisely why it's so timeless. It's also something of a love story and there is a gentle tenderness pervades the entire story. Ish is a wonderful character. As the world is completely and unalterably transformed around him, he strives for continuity and permanence. In the end, his striving is for naught, he's failed. But there is no bitterness and remorse but an acceptance of the world around him and the love that expressed itself in his relationships with others. The story wasn't anything like I thought it would be, much better.","I read this book when I was in middle school, probably 1982, and it's impressive that it seemed futuristic even at that time when it had been written decades earlier. With the imminent release of \"I Am Legend\" I was reminded of this book again as a different take on post-apocalyptic literature.I said it was memorable but flawed because it gave an interesting early look at the idea of a pandemic, and the aftermath of such, but didn't seem to give a realistic take on the survivors' civilization. Why would people suddenly give up their institutes of religion, for example? Historically, when has this happened? He has black people in the south growing cotton \"just because\" and worshipping crocodiles (I don't know if this was a racist component or not.)In the end, his view was rather too cynical and unrealistic about the way people react to the loss of technology. Technology isn't what makes people great, it is their values. I think he didn't realize that.","I first read this book in high school -- 1964! And, loved it soo much I &quot;forgot&quot; to return it to the library &lt;blush&gt;. I've re-read it numerous times over the years and enjoyed it every time. I hope you enjoy it, too. It's a tremendous read.","If you like post-apocalyptic sci-fi, as I do, you'll probably enjoy this book. The book starts out strongly but peters out toward the middle after the narrator settles down and becomes embarrassingly introspective about how himself and what it takes to build a civilization. Parts of the book are clumsily written and pretentious. If you want better apocalyptic fiction, try John Wyndham or John Christopher.","I love end-of-the-world fiction. Call me a gourmand of it, if you will. Well, one story I had missed was, &quot;Earth Abides&quot;. So, I read a lot of reviews here at Amazon and I decided to buy it.I gave it three stars because I did not finish it. Usually, I can read anything. Even bad fiction becomes a challenge to conclude; disappointing fiction is a different story. It's just isn't my type. Though, I can appreciate what others see in it.Summary: A fellow goes off hiking and is bit by a rattlesnake. After his near-death experience and recovery (lasting about 2 weeks), he comes back to society to find no one home. The book follows his life as he: travels, struggles, meets other survivors, starts a fledgling society.The strengths of this book encompass one man's struggle to survive an unthinkable situation. It is wonderful at explaining some the effects of a global disaster in which only the people are gone. Our ordinance remains. But all eventually decays. The next generation of human society loses it cerebralness, but gains an innate link to the earth. Man exterminated by a virus with extreme prejuidice has now become just a creature not a ruler of the earth.In fact, just as I am typing this out; I am getting excited to read it. But, here come the negatives.The weaknesses are few, but very important. Characterization. Stereotypes abound, while the earth abides. Women are merely wombs needed for their matronly duties. Which would be true in this case. But there is no other extrapolation of feelings and thoughts for the women other than a prehistoric regression of their being and worth. All other characterizations are weak. The protagonist grows on in years but not in emotional or intellectual depth.There are other things that I did not like in the book. When things start to break down, our hero does nothing to stop it; even when he has others to help him. On grand scale, when the infrastructure fails, nothing is done. Not even attempted. One man may not be able to save a power plant or water system. But a group could. Well, possibly. After all, they have all the time in the world. Even if the those infrastructure repairs are ignored, what about personal systems? Our hero is a graduate student in Geology, and this book was only written 50 years ago. The Cold war is in it's infancy. Bomb shelters, survival gear are not unheard of. Oh well. That's what I don't like.Conclusion: I think if I was a teenager I might have read this book differently. But being in my early 30s and a scientist skews my notion of this type of fiction. Please read this book. You may be able overlook, or not even think what I pointed out were points against it. Personally, I'd suggest reading, &quot;The Stand&quot;, &quot;Warday&quot; or &quot;I am Legend&quot;.","I hate this book. I truly hate it, more than any other novel I've ever read outside of fundamentalist hate-drivel. That's saying a lot for me, given that I love reading and I particularly enjoy sci-fi books and those with apocalyptic themes (morbid, yes, but what can you do).The reason I loathe this book with the burning fire of ten thousand suns is the blobs of useless goo that pass for the main characters. They don't DO anything. Sure, they do the usual things like eating and sleeping and scratching their nether regions, but that's about it. As I read through this train-wreck I wanted to grab a bullhorn and scream into the book for them to do something, ANYTHING, to better their situation or try to learn something new or to show an emotion of any kind. The author has the main characters sitting around and eating out of tin cans and twiddling their thumbs for-get this-forty-two YEARS. Not a few months while they get the hand of harvesting fresh food, not a year or two while they learn new trades or research better ways to go about things, but forty-two freaking years.They don't even bother to teach their kids to read. There's one kid named Joey, whom the main character Ish keeps thinking, \"Garsh, he's the one!\" (repeated often), and ponders the possibility of teaching this precocious seven-year-old how to read, but Joey suddenly dies of illness. Presumably, so does civilization, because the passel of thirty-odd other kids running around at this point are deemed by Ish to be either too stupid or too disinterested for him to bother getting out of his Lay-Z-Boy and teaching them the ABC's. Obviously the author has never been around children. The ONE thing he does teach them, and he refers to this as his \"legacy,\" is to show them how to make a bow and arrows.The basic message of the book is \"Yup. We're screwed, folks, so give up early.\" Frankly, if I had been in the situation that these main characters were in, I'd do my damnedest to rebuild and make use of the remaining human world around me. I'd teach my kids how to read and how to use all the technology around them, and if I didn't know how to use something I'd find out how. I'd learn to farm and how to turn the electricity back on and basic medical care. I sure as hell wouldn't be sitting around for forty-two years staring at the wall.The only thing that kept the first half of the book from being used as toilet paper (don't ask about the other half) is that Stewart drops in the occasional interesting factoid about what would happen in nature if there suddenly were no longer any human beings. These facts are nicely offset from the story, set in their own paragraphs and in italics, so if you're interested in this sort of stuff you can skim through and read them fairly quick.","I was looking for a good \"end of the world\" type novel, and after the amazing reviews, chose this one. Disappointed hardly describes it. This is one that as a quick reader (usually finishing a novel in less than two days) it took me over a week of forcing myself to keep picking this back up. This was so anti-climatic it was boring.The most interesting thing about the story wasn't even told! One day, Ish wakes up to the aftermath of a world stripped of most humanity. Personally, I would have liked to read about the actual acts of the end of days, not the leftover start over.So Ish decides to drive all over the U.S. just observing, meeting some people along the way. Again, pretty dull. It is described well, and the writer is a good writer, but he doesn't seem to have anything to tell. He could have had more conflict, more interesting character, but it lacked this. In fact, until the end of the book, I didn't even know how old Ish was in the beginning. For a book that focuses on this main character, and pretty much the first quarter of the book is all about Ish, there is very little backstory and knowledge of him. Unacceptable.Instead the focus is on everything going on, well not going on, around Ish. The lack of people. The mess. The fires and fallen trees. Where has electricity and where doesn't. The looting.The most interesting thing he actually wrote about was the rise and fall of other species. I would have LOVED to read more about THAT! However, his telling of the ants, which was brilliant, was summed up in a few paragraphs while he took ages to tell the most boring parts.It also was unbelievable to me. Granted, this was written in the forties. But I hardly think for as long as time passed, even in simpler times, that people would live as they did without making more adjustments until they absolutley had to. I suppose some people might be that way, and I guess we'll never know until it happens.Honestly, I would have been more interested in reading about the other survivors than Ish, who was a procrastinator and thought very little of those closest to him.I would not recommend this book. Yes, it does stick with you. But not in a good way.","This book sucks. Cars don't run on 20 year old gas, canned goods go bad after time, You should probably learn how to grow your own food and get your own water before 20 years has passed... This book is not only dated, but just plain stupid in it's aspects of survivalism.","First, let me start off stating that I know this is suppose to be a classic; however, I found little to like in this book. It is a very, very long story where nothing happens...really. After a couple hundred pages I started to skip forward, looking for something to peak my interest. Nothing ever happens in this book...let me sum it up for you. 1) Plague, 2) a few people find one another, 3) they plant plants, 4) they plant more plants, 5) they watch the ants and rats die out, 6) they have kids and scribble on a rock for 20 years, the end.If you want to read a great post-apocalypse book, get One Second After or The Road. Either of these books blows this dull piece out of the water.","Great book. I really enjoy apocalyptic fiction. I have read a lot of it and this one has got to be towards the top of my list.This book takes on more of an human approach to the end of the world. There is not a great deal of action but the pace does not get sluggish. Unlike most end of the world fiction this one has a much broader scope and looks at the future of a \"Tribe\" of survivors instead of just the main character. Plus in most of these type of stories there is one main challenge and once that is defeated the story ends and that is all. Not at all the case with Earth Abides.The best part of the book for me was the 2nd half. There is a heart touching story of the main character and his son. Since I can't give away any spoilers it is hard to say what I like about the end other than the way the book hints at what life has become but only through glimpses of the main character.The reason I didn't give it five stars was the length. While it never drags it could have had some parts cut out and not effected the book at all. In fact, more than once I read something went to the next page and read such a similar page that I went back to make sure I had really turned the page. It only happened three times tops but still you start noticing that there could have been some trimming done.Great book, cheap book, fun read.","One of the origional Apotholyptic tales. Since this is probably how it will all end, it is internesting to see the authors views on environmental \"take back\" from humans. Good read, young or old.","I read this book based on other reviews - having searched for good post-apocalypse novels. After reading Cormac McCarthy's \"The Road\", I was preparing myself for a depressing, yet thought-provoking read. \"Earth Abides\" was a thrill to read, and I kept turning back to remind myself that it was originally published in 1949! I thought the complete absence of any \"modern\" references to today's highly computerized world would make the story instantly outdated, but in fact, the opposite was true, for if we lost power, we would have to revert to very basic skills, just like Ish and his tribe did. This truly is a book that will stay with me for a very long time. Highly recommended!","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it. This maturity is perceptible all along this work.The story is situated in a world devastated by a sudden pestilence that annihilates most of the humankind. Taking into account the last SARS epidemic that jumped abruptly from China to Canada it doesn't look an impossible scenario.Isherwood Williams comes down from an isolate spot in the mountains to discover an empty world. He starts a search all across USA, from California to New York and back again. He finds only isolate human cells, couples or trios, overwhelmed by catastrophe and in a near catatonic state. Returns to his native town and contemplate with a certain scientific detachment the fading world around him.Mr. Stewart intercalate brief vignettes describing what happens to dogs, cats, cattle, plants, roads, dams, bridges, contrasting them with Ish's daily experiences.Little by little the story grip reader's attention and even if action is somehow slow, the book can't be putted down.Human cells began to draw near each other and a rather feeble structure starts to grow up.This is the story.The author approaches universal questions about survival and extinction; civilization and savagery; social structure and anomie. He also examines religious values, ethics and the ultimate sense of life itself.This book gives the reader a lot of stuff to think about. A very enticing read!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","I read this book over and over, loving it more each time. It gives the reader alot to think about because even though it's ficitonal, it is still possible. It is about a man who goes up into the mountains for some time, gets bitten by a snake and becomes very ill. He rests in his mountain cabin for several days, coming close to death, but eventualy regaining his strength. When he left the mountains and headed back home, he noticed the town was dead...literally. Very well written. I bought a new copy because mine was falling apart. Buy this book.","Like some of the other reviewers, I read this book 25-30 years ago. It changed how I viewed the value of the work we do. Stewart makes a strong case that if we can't maintain the infrastructure of our phyical world (roads, bridges, water works, electric plants, etc.), all our knowledge about the rest of the world is for naught.Stewart also explores &quot;events in nature&quot; and how them affect humans. In his book Storm, Stewart quotes Sir Napier Shaw: &quot;Every theory of the course of events in nature is necessarily based on some process of simplification of the phenomena and is to some extent therefore a fairy tale.&quot;In Storm the phenomena is a Siberian wind blowing south; in The Earth Abides, it is a virus. In both cases the earth is fine, but human are worst for wear.By the way, like The Earth Abides, Storm, and a third Stewart book, Fire, are set in Northern California. Everyone familiar with the great Pacific storms or the forest fires, will find these books fascinating.","I enjoyed this book and appreciated the thoughtful way in which the author depicted how the world could be with only a few humans left in it. Stewart covers a lot of topics (religion, education, environment, race, family, marriage, etc.) and how they would evolve or devolve over several decades. He describes a world where random people are left alive and those people may not be the most suitable people to live under the new conditions. The story moves along fairly quickly and generally kept me interested, if not fascinated.Some other reviewers mentioned how the main character, Ish, seems a little devoid of emotion at times. I agree, but I found another trait in main character more annoying. He spends a large amount of brainpower philosophizing and lamenting the lack of intelligence and motivation in the rest of the tribe. While Ish does some teaching, the children never learn reading or basic math skills. They also never work on any improvement projects or learn to recreate any of the basic disposable items they use regularly. My complaint is that Ish doesn't do any of those things either. I blame him for many of their failings. You could say that his shortcomings are realistic, but it drove me a bit crazy.Overall, this was an enjoyable read.","This book makes me want to explore Amazon's return policy for Kindle editions.Barring that, it has made me learn how to delete items from my Kindle.It has also taught me to pay attention to negative reviews.It is simply awful. Why, then, 2 stars?Well, the story - once you get past its one massively huge, incredibly off-putting major flaw - isn't too bad. Many folks have pointed out factual issues (ever volatile gasoline and canned goods that never go bad), and called these fatal flaws. I attribute them to the publication date: maybe, in 194x, when personal automobiles, gasoline, and canned goods were still fairly new, it simply wasn't known that they both spoil? I don't know, but those details weren't killers for me.What ruined the story, then? The protagonist. Our hero. I've read books with villians who were infinitely more likeable than the main character, Ish. He's a contemptible, amoral, elitist sociopath and I feel dirty having inhabited his mind for the past 2 days.I can kind of understand his elitish judgement of the people around him. Again, consider the context of the 1940s. Even today, college degrees are relatively rare (even though I think many of us who have them forget this fact. They are almost universal in the people with whom I associate, but still only 10% of the US population have them.), and in the 40s they were rarer still. So our disgusting hero was part of an elite at the time, and the majority of the population probably did not possess even high school diplomas. Once I realized that, he became slightly less unpalatable.However, our hero, Ish, views the near extinction of humanity with no more emotion than I view an empty of box cereal in the morning. In fact, I think I have more emotion over the cereal. His reaction to learning his parents have died? Effectively, \"eh, so what. What's in the fridge for dinner?\" Similarly, for no reason, he considers simply shooting the dog that accompanies him and, later, decides to shoot two cows just because. Not for survival or meat, really, just because he had a gun and they were there.He has no qualms about simply looting whatever he needs (a viable survival skill, I'll grant you), but views with contempt a group he encounters on his road trip who didn't move into a more palatial home simply because they could - and who are doing a more effective job of adapting to their new situation.He meets a couple in New York who insist on pretending nothing has changed, and looks down upon him. Yet the rest of the book, he exhibits nearly this exact behavior - living off canned food rather than adapting. He constantly disparages his colleagues in the Tribe for lacking imagination and drive, yet for all his superior intellect and thinking and ideas, does exactly nothing to drive change.I thought, eventually, that the author had made him so utterly horrible deliberately and that, over time, we'd see a metamorphosis in Ish, an awakening in him that he was not the paragon of humanity he believed. There are hints, here and there: his admitting that, though she's stupid, his wife was the true strength in the Tribe, etc. But, in the end, this contemptible human is still full of himself, believing his descendent's view him as a 'god', and, sadly, is still the same, utterly obnoxious, foul human that he started as. He takes pride in this, too, which is pathetic: to have survived the death of civilization, to have had even a weak hand in its rebirth, and to believe that the experience has left you utterly unchanged, that you would have been the same person if society had simply carried on, is truly sad.","George Stewart's super-classic is my favorite SciFi sub-genre--the demise of man by one means or another. Stewart uses a pandemic virus which is a bit cliche--oops, wait a minute, he did it first! Everyone _else_ is the cliche. His writing is dark and literary, brought to life by his protagonist, Isherwood Williams', gloomy, introspective personality. Stewart does not develop the science behind the virus, but given that he wrote the story in 1947, I suppose he can be forgiven. On the other hand, H.G. Wells and Jules Verne forcast many technological wonders in their stories, so maybe Stewart could have gone out on a creative limb just a wee bit more than he did. Nevertheless, the real gem of the story is Stewart's portrayal of the demise of mankind--not the virus that reduced his population to a handful--but the demise of his culture, his literature, his creative energy. It seems we humans are what we are because with great numbers of people scarfing up every last spot of ground and every last resource, each individual has to be ever on his toes just to turn a buck. Take away the people, say, overnight, and the detritus of their civilization becomes easy pickings for the surviving few. No need to grow anything to eat--just open up a can. When they ran out of cans, it was almost as easy to hunt for dim-witted, slow-footed domestic cattle, now living in the wild. But the real casualty was culture. Several generations after Ish, people no longer spoke Ish's English, at least not so he could understand it. Culture too appears to be a product of crowds. Stewart set the bar for this SciFi sub-genre. There have been many since 1949, including my own example listed below, but he has yet to be equalled.--Ejner Fulsang, author of \"A Destiny of Fools\", [...] 2007","This is the granddaddy of post apocalyptic novels. Whenever I read this book I see bits of so many post apocalyptic novels in it. Well written, well delivered. If you like post apocalyptic books then read this one. It wasn't until the release of EARTH THE NEW FRONTIER that I read a better end of the world book than Earth Abides. Both of these are classics in the post-apocalyptic genre.","This is a book that rewards close reading--not skimming. Written in 1949, it is still a haunting and poignant read. Those who dismiss this as cliche must remember that this is the book that gave birth to the cliche, the first truly prophetic biological-apocalypse piece of writing, and all who come after must merely stand on its shoulders. Re-released in the &quot;SF Masterpiece&quot; series, and deservedly so.","Earth Abides is a book concerning a plague that kills off most of humanity and the survivors' attempts to reconstruct civilization. The pace of the book is rapid in the beginning and the reader doesn't have to get very far before they realize something terrible has happened. We are initially with one character, Isherwood Williams, who seems emotionally well suited to survive this tragedy in which 99% of everyone has died in the space of two to three weeks. The story continues with Ish traveling across the country looking for survivors and eventually returning to his home in Berkeley, CA where he meets a woman, Em, and they marry each other. Slowly a group of people calling themselves &quot;The Tribe&quot; forms and Ish tries to lead his small group back towards civilization and away from a more &quot;primitive&quot; existence.Strengths are the good character development as well as interesting asides on how the world is readjusting to no longer having man dominate it. It offers some interesting insights on human nature and societies in general and as a disaster book ranks highly on the list. In a sense it is like The Stand except for that this plague is strictly natural, not a tool for a climatic battle between good and evil. The plague simply comes and kills humanity off and that is that.Some of the negatives are found in the style of writing. This book was written in the late 1940's and the language used is rather dry. The author seems to go overboard on his word usage and sometimes seems to be talking down to the audience a bit.Still, if you like disaster stories you should pick up Earth Abides, it is well worth any effort.Robert Merkamp","I liked the book but all the characters were technologically ignorant. Even in the forties they had small portable generators but this was ignored in the book. One part of the book basically said they let all the lights go out. People knew about generators then and if not you would've have soon found out.","I'm not talking about the pandemic itself; I'm talking about the aftermath. I found the lack of progress of the human race, as detailed in this book, to be very unlikely. Even assuming that out of initial group of adults in Ish's group, Ish is the only highly intelligent one, I found it really hard to believe that the adults wouldn't bother to teach the kids how to read and do math, so that they'd be able to use the libraries to learn the skills they'd need to survive. It didn't make sense that there would only be two main characters with any sort of curiosity about *anything*. Why was knowledge of carpentry lost when The Tribe's carpenter died? Didn't he train anyone in his craft? Didn't anyone want to learn?I expected this book to outline some sort of return to the land, which would be much more realistic than having The Tribe live off canned food for forty years. This book spends way too much time expounding on how intelligent Ish is without showing him actually doing anything to help the human race.","I had heard excellent things about Earth Abides. I have always liked post apocolyptic books, and this is often the first recommendation by people. I tried reading it once, but thought the writing was detached and boring after a few pages, so put it down, and gave it away. Then, i saw the audio version on sale on audible.com, and downloaded it.I know this book was written in 1949 or something, and those I've talked to, comment on that as if its an excuse for blatant and rampant sexism and racism. But, I'm sorry, there is not accepatance in me for any of this no matter when it was written.The women are portrayed as either blood sucking, parasitic whores or blank and faceless wombs. Even his dog, a female dog, is described as ungrateful, needy and parasitic, expecting to be taken care of without giving anything in return, and provides in no way useful in the way of dogs, that I can remember. She is named Princess.The first non-whites that are encountered are identified as \"Negros\" and are described as unattractive, nervous, hesitant and lice ridden, living in a cabin with cheap and rickety furniture although there are far nicer houses empty for the taking. Our main character trades a dollar bill for eggs, and the \"negros\" are well pleased. So, they are poor, dirty, and stupid.Then, there is our main character, he is an unappologetic arrogant elitist who deems 99% of those he meets as unworthy of living. He decides that they will all die \"secondary\" die off because they are stupid, crazy without will to live. He drives around in his car, looking for people, but yet finding none, eventhough he infact comes across people. None of them are \"worthy\". He even makes a list of why he will survive were the others will die, and the list includes that he is solitary, and never cared much for people anyway. Which seemed strange to me, since he had found 4 or 5 people in one day's search. Its not like the world is entirely empty.I gave it two stars, because initially, I was interested in the observations of the earth and the cities and how nature is taking over and civilization is breaking down, but with no engaging characters or furthering of a worthwhile plot, I quickly lost interest and had to force myself to go on, looking for even a glimmer of the amazement and awe others seem to view this book. I found nothing of the like.","One-and-a-half stars really. Not much happens in this book.The main character spends most of his time musing over the fate of the earth and observing the effects of erosion on human artifacts, now that most of the world's population has been wiped out. One of the racier sections I recall was his observation of a storm water drain overflowing.It took two or three pages.However, the book is readable enough to fill in a bit of time while trapped in a hospital bed for a few days, and might even have earned as many as three stars from me, were it not for the &quot;hero's&quot; much over-inflated sense of self worth which manifests itself on nearly every page, most often by refering in his thoughts to all of his friends as simple, stolid, dull, or just plain stupid.Not to mention what he thinks of those whom he doesn't count among his friends!Maybe we are not meant to like the &quot;hero&quot;, but I think we are, and I can't help thinking that this story could be written by one of those aneamic, spotty, embittered social outcasts that one often finds lurking in the shadows at science fiction conventions, more at home with his onanistic fantasies than with any human being. I quote:&quot;...he realized that in some ways...he felt a new security and even satisfaction at the contemplation of a solitary life. His worries in the old days had been chiefly about people. The prospect of going to a dance had more than once sent him into a sweat; he had never been a good mixer; no one had asked him to join a fraternity. In the old days, such things were a handicap to a man. Now, he realized, they were actually a great advantage. Because he had sat on the edge of so many social gatherings, not quite able to mingle in the conversation, listening, watching objectively, now he could endure not being able to talk, and again could sit and watch, noting what happened. His weakness had become strength. It was as if there had been a blind man in a world suddenly bereft of light. In that world, those with seeing eyes could only blunder about, but the blind man would be at home, and now, instead of being the one who was guided by others, he might be the one to whom others clung for guidence.&quot;His intellectual snobbery becomes glaringly obvious as he begins to meet other survivors, and is at it's most repellant when he discusses &quot;half-witted&quot; Evie, whom one of the other survivors found &quot;dirty, grovelling, and unkempt, living in filth with merely enough intelligence to open cans to feed herself on whatever they contained, without cooking or preperation.&quot; This doesn't seem too much of a crime, and neither does the only other thing that seems to be &quot;wrong&quot; with her, that she can't hold a conversation. Nevertheless, the &quot;hero&quot; goes on to say:&quot;It would have been better, he had often thought, if they had merely put a can of sweet ant-poison within her reach somewhere.&quot; Of course, we must remember that when this book was published, in in 1949, social policy in the US was still under the sway of brianiac and boffin advocates of eugenics, and many &quot;subnormals&quot; and &quot;moral degenerates&quot; were still being sterilized by court order, despite the widespread revulsion over the results of Nazi social engineering procedures based on the same premises. A good antidote to the attitutudes expressed by this book is to be found in Jonathan Kellerman's excellent thriller &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot;, wherein eugenicists lurk behind a spree of cowardly murders. Kellerman's book is also recommended as a healthy locus for introspection by any readers of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; who find themselves agreeing with the &quot;hero's&quot; attitudes and solutions.","Overall this book didn't impress me enough to ever recommend it to anyone else but it also wasn't horrible. The beginning explanation of the plague and the prehistory of the character are so vague that the rest of the book is ruined. Doesn't stand anywhere near books like The Stand or Swan Song.","I would not recommend this book. UNLESS you are having a hard tiime falling asleep!! The main character, Ish is supposed to be an educated man who survives a deadly world wide virus. He uses his aledged power of observation to observe how the people around him, who are incapable of doing anything without his help survive. Unfortunately for the people around him, Ish seams to be unable to do anything but watch and complain.","Earth Abides is a disaster story where aplague almost wipes out humans. Becausewe grew too prosperous we had to die, according to the author, that is just the way things work. So the few survivors get by never trying to improvetheir lives, having no ambition the human race lapses into hunter gatherers with only superstition as a guide. Thisbook is a waste of a good oportunity. Insted of saying &quot;Hey, we can occomplishthings if we work hard and perservier.&quot; The author tells us &quot;Hey, we're almost as good as cockroaches and if we drop our standards, we too can can eek out ameager existence.&quot;I don't have to pay people to depress me, I can do that all by myself. What awaste of time and money.","I read this book a number of years ago, and forgot about it. Recently, I saw it on the shelf, and decided to re-read it. After forcing myself to read it, I understand why it was easy to forget.The main character, Ish, is highly arrogant and self-righteous. Ish, only Ish, has the power to drive civilization back from a total collapse. Ish has a son, Joey, who worships Ish, and Ish drinks it up. Joey is The Saviour, The One, a child who must be taught the abstract ideas which created Civilization. Nothing else matters.The side-characters are all inferior. These are the people with skills to survive. This includes artistic skills which doesn't include the formal education which _must_ be part of any \"real\" artists training.The most interesting part of it all is the background story of how the Earth really abides without Man trying to impose his will. Structures decay due to natural events; forests and wild-life reclaim the land.It may be a classic book, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a good book!","I have been a fan of PA fiction for over 30 years. My first PA novel was the children's novel \"Beyond the Dark River\" by Monica Hughes - a novel which I read when I was eleven. It hooked me on PA fiction and ever since then I have been trying to find as many novels or movies that I could get my hands on.I had read good things about Earth Abides online and was looking forward to reading it. Can I say how disappointed I was? Perhaps it was the era in which it was written, but all I could think of throughout the book is that the new civilization would have been much better off without the pompous a$$ of the main character Ish. \"They thought of me as a God.\" Good grief!If I could have rated this movie a zero I would have. Take this one out of the library if you must, you'll be glad that you didn't waste your money on it.","Even if Stephen King did base THE STAND on this book, he takes the idea of a world-wide plague and develops it much better than Stewart. I understand that EARTH ABIDES was written in the forties, but the stilted style of writing used and the attitudes and world view of Stewart's main characters are so jarringly anchronistic that I could never forget I was reading a book --- it never transported me into the world that the writer was trying to create. The italized asides within the chapter explaining what was happening elsewhere (i.e., lice, cats, ants, etc.) were interesting but not enough to save the book as a whole. LUCIFER'S HAMMER, WAR DAY, or THE STAND are all much better &quot;end of the world&quot; type books","When I write &quot;one of the most memorable books I've read,&quot; that's saying something, because I've kept up a pace of reading at least four books a week since before entering Kindergarten and am now 67. I borrowed EARTH ABIDES from the library a year after it came out, in 1950, when I was a 14-year-old high school sophomore, reading everything and anything labeled &quot;science fiction.&quot; I didn't own the book until fairly recently, but it stayed vividly in my memory. I could call up characters like fussy Maureen, stolid George, loyal Em and the tragic genius child, Joey. I remembered the fascinating journey across America, the vague frustration I felt (even so young) over Ish's passive character and the generally negative slide of the tribe from scavenging off civilization into what appeared almost to be an Upper Paleolithic lifestyle at the novel's end--not even qualifying as barbarism.But it's Stewart's refusal to tread the usual Golden Age sci-fi path and make Ish a superscience hero that makes the novel very special. Ish may be a scientist, he's academically bright, but like many people he's low in energy, street-smarts, and foresight. By and large his motley clan possesses even lower survival skills. They aren't much different from the Valley Girls in another good story in the end-of-the-world genre, the movie NIGHT OF THE COMET. Both are based on an understanding that if the human race's average IQ is 100, half the people who are likely to survive a major disaster aren't going to be awfully competent. Stewart certainly knew that, and it provided both the uncanny realism and the rather depressing pessimism of this story. It's fascinating to note that the other reviewers have noted both aspects of EARTH ABIDES.","George R. Stewart weaves at once a beautiful and hauntingly believable tale with this novel, one that I've never been able to forget...or wanted to. Once considered dated, with the lessening of global nuclear tensions, the scenario Mr. Stewart envisions for a possible worldwide catastrophe, one brought about not by bombs but disease, has once again come to the forefront and become the most plausible ingredient in mankind's demise. More even than the fact that this is a truly enjoyable read is the deeper message Earth Abides shares with the reader as it reaches down and touches our very hearts, defining what it means to be human in an inhuman environment. The symbolism involved in Isherwood Williams' desire to keep a hammer with him for the future as a tie to the past is obviously an unconscious comment on his personal hope of rebuilding a fallen civilization. A hope that goes unfulfilled in his life time and maybe many lifetimes to follow. The insight into the human psyche that Mr. Stewart demonstates as he carries Isherwood from his youth at the beginning of the book to old age and finally death at the end and Isherwood's subtle change of attitude during that process, rings exceedingly true and speaks volumes about Mr. Stewart's keen and perhaps unique ability to put into words what it really means, or at least should mean, to be human. I've rarely read a book more than once because I just don't have the time, but I've read Earth Abides several times since I was a teen and I know I'll read it several more times before I too reach that stage in my life that Isherwood assures us won't be the calamity our youth oriented culture would have us to believe.","Due to a multitude of rude comments regarding this review I will edit to please. Here goes... NON-SPOILER ALERTI can't expound upon this book as some of the reviewers have. Nor can I recall in exact detail everything in the book.But I can add value in this way.... I read this book 30 years ago, and I still think about it. I can remember the xxxxxx, the xxxxx that xxxx the main character, the waves of xxxxx xxxxxx after the event... the xxxx, the forced xxxx, the eventual shut down of the xxxxx xxxxx as the xxxxxxxxx started to xxxxx. The shift from xxxxxxxxxx( for years) to xxxxxxx for themselves.The last breaths of the xxxxxxx and the xxxxxx for the xxxxxxx, the xxxx which every year the xxxxxxx took up to the xxxxx and xxxxx the time since the xxxxx.30 Years.... and I still think about it. How many books, movies, songs... etc... do you expect to think about 30 years down the road. You probably wouldn't even remember the title let alone a rough outline.Will I read it again? Certainly! I ran into a young lady reading this on the subway a few years back, and we had a wonderful conversation... it's that kind of a book.SPOILAGE AVERTED --- Skol","One thing that disturbs people about Earth Abides is its incredible humbling realism about the human condition. People who read it come away profoundly unnerved by the idea that civilization is not something guaranteed to come into existence if we lose it and that it requires an enormous convergence of many different kinds of stimulus to create the energies needed within a race of men to bring it into being. Even the most gifted races of people on the Earth can barely hold it together in the best of times, George Stewart shows us how easily it can all fall apart and remain in a primeval condition for untold generations.The protagonist Isherwood suffers from the same disease that afflicts even the best of men - he lacks direction, loses initiative, becomes too preoccupied with the daily stresses of living and watches his life trickle away in the post apocalyptic environment without ever seeming to summon the right kinds of ambitions to carry out his grand dreams of rebuilding the old world.Stewart was quite prophetic considering when this book was written because many modern anthropologists have since confirmed that many previous civilizations have died out precisely because of this &quot;critical threshold&quot; of the division of labor and sheer numbers of vanished races being too low to sustain a breeding population and achieve the critical mass that leads to a progress oriented civilization. Stewart was very perceptive too be able to articulate this phenomenon and even narrate its exact trajectory following the loss of so many people who were vital components in the world that Isherwood regrets the demise of.The most disturbing aspect for me was that I see much of the exact decay of western civilization going on right now all around us and we have not even have a catastrophic plague yet. The same loss of purpose, of drive, of a sense of our own individual worth as a nation and a desire to maintain our sovereignty is slowly giving way to the degenerative notion of a world socialist government of faceless consumers who lack any culture beyond the food court and cineplex.The terrifying thing about the book &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that it is the story of our world and the modern era ... even before we suffer the inevitable collapse of our civilization in the physical sense. The reality is that we see it all crumbling around our eyes into the multicultural carnival of formlessness and we often find ourselves as helpless and feckless as Ish himself in doing anything about it.Highest rating, possibly on the top 100 list of best fiction I've ever read. I consider Stewart to be the author of a modern classic in publishing this book. It is so much more than simply speculative fiction, it contains eternal truths.","As I look at the many Amazon customer comments, I see a real split between very favorable and unfavorable reviews. This seems to be because some readers are looking for conventional science fiction/fantasy or adventure. Much as I love those genres, this isn't it, so if that's what you're looking for, save yourself the trouble and don't read Earth Abides. If you do read it, don't expect it to be something it's not.Earth Abides is a book for people with a strong streak of curiosity, who cannot resist thinking and speculating about the human condition. If this is you, few books will satisfy you as well as this one. It first captivated me when I was 14 - yes, there are teens who would be very excited by this book - and I am now on my fourth reading. There is no other novel to which I have returned so regularly. If you are possessed of this curious, speculative streak, then you will appreciate the protagonist, Ish, who himself is driven to understand the horrible event that has overcome the world and to raise and shape a new world. You will also appreciate the realism of the action and characters, and the underlying drama of the situation and tragic heroism of Ish, and you will not for a minute miss the contrived drama and heroism that make for conventional action fiction.","I read this book in '75. Since then I've been pretty much obsessed by it and other eoc novels (End Of Civilisation). I've looked for a book that had similar 'feel' to it. Unfortuntaly 'The Stand', 'Alas, Babylon' or 'Swan Song' don't capture the same magic. The closest I've come to simulate the read experience that was 'Earth Abides' is Alfred Coppel's 'Dark December' or Brian Hodge' 'Dark Advent'.Out of all 300+ eoc novels I've picked up over the last 25 years, 'Earth Abides' STILL ranks as the best. It's probably my all time favorite novel...I think I'm going to go read it again...","First published in 1949, this novel won the 1951 International Fantasy Award in Fiction (the first one awarded) even though this is not a true fantasy novel. The International Fantasy Awards were originated by four British science fiction and fantasy fans (Leslie Flood, John Beynon Harris, G. Ken Chapman, and Frank A. Cooper) for the 1951 British science fiction convention. The awards lasted between 1951 and 1957. George R. Stewart (1895-1980) was a Professor of English at the University of California in Berkeley. This well-read novel is about life after a plague has killed all but a few people on Earth. Isherwood Williams, a graduate student in geography, returns from a trip to the mountains to find everyone dead. He travels throughout the land and finds a female survivor. They settle down in the Bay Area around San Francisco and a small community grows around them. As time goes by, Isherwood tries to teach the children reading and the knowledge of the past. As the decades go by, he discovers that he is the only one who recalls the greatness of the past. Humans have become a band of hunter-gatherers. History has come full circle. &quot;...men go and come, but earth abides.&quot; Carl Sandburg considered it one of the best novels of its time. It is regarded by many as a masterpiece and was a precursor for many later disaster novels (note that one of the voters of the International Fantasy Award was J. B. Harris, whose pseudonym was John Wyndham and author of another classic disaster novel, &quot;The Day of the Triffids.&quot; One of the earlier reviewers suggested that Wyndham was a better disaster writer. But, &quot;Triffids&quot; came out in 1951, and Wyndham still chose &quot;Earth Abides.&quot;). The name &quot;Isherwood&quot; is a direct reference to Ishi, the last surviving member of a California Indian tribe who was brought to the University by Kroeber of the Anthropology Department (many science fiction enthusiasts are very familiar with Kroeber's daughter, Ursula K. Le Guin). Ishi is still quite famous in the study of native American cultures. This book has had such an impact in the development of the science fiction genre that it is now required reading for all serious students of science fiction and speculative literature.","Very rarely do I finish a book and immediately recommend it to other people. Mostly books help pass the time and end up portraying the same plot; another female FBI agent trying to catch a serial killer who ends up stalking her. However, after reading Earth Abides I called up my brother and told him to pick it up. The book, while written some 50 years ago is still topical. The book takes you on a journey of how a person survives after a disaster that wipes out almost the whole population. It then takes you deeper, you find yourself emotionally involved with the character. And you realize that George Stewart has moved from an tale of physical survival into a tale of emotional conflict. The transition is smooth and the two easily complement each other. If you enjoy reading about a world where civilization has been wiped clean and a new world must start over. I highly recommend this book. The writing was engaging and intelligent without confusing you. The storyline was deep and involving. Overall, the main character becomes immediately identifiable. The book ends; but the world created by George Stewart lives on in our imagination. And, I believe that is a definition of a good book.","As of this date there are 158 reviews of George R. Stewart's Earth Abides here in Amazon.com. I'm not sure that writing a 159th will really add any value or if anyone will even make all the way to #159 to see it. But I feel very strongly about this book and to the intrepid reader who gets this far, I hope it helps you to decide to give the book a try.I was 12 years old in 1968 when my Mother gave me this book to read. She was (and still is) a voracious reader. But she has never liked or appreciated science fiction. Then again, she never considered this book to be science fiction. I read the book in one day that summer and have read it at least a half dozen times in the 35 years since then. And I would agree. Although often voted as one of the best science fiction books of all time, I don't really think of it as science fiction. Stewart was not a science fiction writer. Rather he was more of an ecological writer looking at how the planet behaves in relation to specific circumstances. Two of his other novels, Fire and Storm are good examples of this.One area I differ strongly from my Mom is, I do have a good appreciation for science fiction as well as other apocolyptic fiction. Ray Bradbury, Frank Herbert, Robert Heinlein, Philip Jose Farmer and Issac Asimov have thrilled and entertained me for years. But Earth Abides was what got me started and remains my favorite piece of fiction.Earth Abides is a simple \"what if\" story. What if virtually every person on earth died and only a handful were left? Given the book's publication date in 1949, it was groundbreaking. No one had really written a novel on this topic before this. Virtually all the other books in this genre owe a debt of gratitude to Stewart. Books such as The Stand by Stephen King, Alas Babylon by Pat Frank, Malevil by Robert Merle, Lucifer's Hammer by Niven & Pournelle and Swan Song by Robert McCammon included.Stewart must have had his influences, but not from a book or author of this kind. Therefore the story does not focus on war or technology or industry (or science fiction). Instead it is a tale of how the people might behave under the circumstances, the struggles they deal with, the decisions they make and the decisions they fail to make. It is also a tale of how the earth changes and the previous efforts of mankind are so easily erased.Some reviewers here have criticized the main character Ish as being too passive. But this is a part of the novel that rings very true for me. How agressive would one be after living through a time when virtually everyone else dies? Wouldn't most people struggle to survive, never mind thrive?I won't give away the plot for anyone who has gotten this far. Plus if you've made it all the way to this review, you've seen the plot described almost 158 times. In the end the book is both depressing and uplifting. It is depressing in that most of man's advancements appear to be lost by the end of the book. But it is uplifting to realize that the earth heals itself and in the end man will start fresh.The book is both a product and a victim of it's time period, the late 1940's. Some of it will feel a little dated, after all it's over 50 years old and think what has happened in those 50 years. But remarkably, it still comes across as fresh. And with very little update could be brought up to present day and still be a powerful piece of fiction.All in all this is a great read for most people. For those looking for a hard core science fiction look at the end of the world, go watch the Terminator movies.","&quot;Earth Abides&quot; is a wonderful literary work. It's a shame that it's catalogued as a work of &quot;science fiction&quot; because it is so much more than that. I'm sure that many serious literary fans have failed to pick up on this teriffic book because of that &quot;tag&quot;.The book has a tremendous &quot;hook&quot; line - that being, &quot;almost the entire human race is eradicated by a terrible catastrophe&quot;. The plot is very believable and amazing when you consider that the novel was written in 1949. Author George Stewart is a great storyteller and has created some very interesting characters. The hero of this book, &quot;Ish&quot;, is both a &quot;superman&quot; and an &quot;everyman&quot;. He is both the leader of his tribe, but also easily led. His development as a person and as the head of his people is a wonderful progression throughout the book. His wife, &quot;Em&quot; exhibits all the great characteristics of the strong woman behind the &quot;great man&quot;. And, let me say that the symbolism of Ish's hammer was a very interesting facet of the book.My only criticism (and it's a pretty minor one) is that the book did not go into enough detail regarding the disaster and how other people throughout the country were affected. I think that this would have added some rich &quot;body&quot; to the storyline.All things considered though, this indeed is a book for the ages.It belongs with some of the best works of that era, such as &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot;, &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, and later &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. As an educator, I would really urge school officials to add this novel to their list of great American Literary selections for high school students.But, do yourself a favor - go to the library or your local bookstore get a copy of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; and delve into this great classic with its timeless message about the unshakeable human spirit!","I'm not going to defend it; excellence stands the test of time, and this one has been around for decades (1949). I would simply ask you to read it for yourself.\"Ish\" came to be one of my favorite literary characters and an inspiration for my own work.","'Earth Abides' is a classic novel of the end of human civilization and it's rebirth. Unlike other apocalyptic sci-fi fantasy novels in the mold of Mad Max, there are no weapon wielding skin headed cannibals roaming the wasteland. In fact the only violence in this novel is an encounter with a pack of wild dogs and the heart rendering decision the community makes to deal with one of the human survivors. In light of recent research exemplified by books such as 'The World Without Us', 'Earth Abides' is astonishing prophetic and knowledgeable. You might say that this novel is an environmentalist's apocalyptic novel 50 years ahead of its time. The novelist's understanding of modern ecology is amazing considering when it was written. The theme of the novel is stated in the title. Human civilization may disappear but earth will abide. A modern classic that should not be missed.","Isherwood Williams is away in the mountains pursuing his graduate field studies in geology. In our iPhone, instant connectivity world it is hard to imagine the isolation this kind of trip entailed in the 1950's when George Stewart wrote his book. Recovering from a snake bite, Ish stumbles back from the hills to find most of humanity wiped out by disease. We follow Ish through the remainder of his life as he comes to terms with a changing Earth--an Earth on which humanity is a barely noticeable presence.The absence of humanity is not only a stark fact, but is emphasized by the author's writing style. Ish is a clear introvert and we experience much of the Earth's change through his internal monologue. Even when he encounters, interacts with, and teams up with other people, this produces very little dialogue. This style underscores the aloneness of the book's characters. It's not loneliness, in the emotional sense, but a continuing reminder that other people no longer play a significant role in the world.The Earth itself becomes an evolving character in the book. We experience the successive rise and fall in populations of insects, rats, dogs and other species as seasons in the Earth's changing life. The diminishing resources scavenged by human beings from cities and storehouses are important to their survival, but also serve as markers of change as the Earth sheds the thin layers of Man's influence. This change is not progress, nor is it overly mourned as decline. It is thoroughly described and documented as inevitable change. Ish observes it and reacts to it. But neither he nor the other characters influence its path or pace.Read and compare this book with two other classics of post-Apocalyptic fiction:Alas, BabylonandThe Day of the Triffids. These works also follow their characters through crises, scavenging, and attempts to preserve the technology and civilization of the past. They are both more optimistic and more social in narrative style and in the strategies followed by their characters. After reading them, return to Earth Abides and appreciate it for the melancholy and aloneness felt by both its characters and its readers. It is a good story, a moving experience, and a skillful integration of message and writing style.","Yes, this is a must-read. I found it 40 years ago and have never forgotten it. Very realistic, this runs rings around today's fantasy and sword-and-sorcery pseudo-science fiction. Countless derivative novels and movies owe this book a lot.","Earth Abides is not a typical post-apocalyptic novel. It doesn't present a world of mutants, giant cockroaches or bands of marauders. It simply shows the slow and inevitable decay of man and all his works, in the teeth of attempts by the protagonist to restore the old ways of civilization. In that it succeeds beautifully and shows us the grandeur of our world and the majesty of what we have wrought...then compares it to the greater majesty of nature and the eternal gaze of time. The novel works best as a family drama, more Swiss Family Robinson than Mad Max, and has no sensational adventures to offer other than the daily tribulations of life. For man may be a great creature, but he is still small and the world doesn't really need him at all...Earth Abides is the most meditative and serene post-apocalyptic novel I've ever read, and it's recommended for more thoughtful readers who won't be easily bored.","EARTH ABIDES is lauded as one of the most noteworthy post-apocalyptic novels ever written. It was originally published in 1949, and its author, George R. Stewart, was better known as a writer of nonfiction than fiction, but EARTH ABIDES is easily his most recognized work--it has been in print off and on for nearly fifty years.Isherwood (Ish) Williams is a graduate student working on his thesis--\"The Ecology of the Black Creek Area\"--in the wilds of northern California when a virulent virus destroys humanity. When Ish returns to civilization he finds emptiness. There are no bodies littering the streets, no signs of struggle, nothing except the surreal stillness of empty towns, streets, businesses and homes. Everything is gone, and Ish doesn't understand what has happened until he reads the bleak, desperate headlines of the last issue of a newspaper in an abandoned magazine shop.EARTH ABIDES is the story of how Isherwood Williams survives the death of humanity, and with it, modern civilization. He is man of intellect--he mourns the passing of knowledge--and he can visualize the future not as an abstract idea, but as it very well may be. Ish chronicles the remnants of humanity as they form themselves into small tribes. They live off what the \"old ones\" left. They open cans for food; they raid sporting goods stores for firearms and ammunition, and miraculously they survive and grow. Ish begins his journey as an observer, but he quickly finds himself a participant of this new world.EARTH ABIDES is one of the most troublesome novels I have read. It is troublesome for two reasons. The first is the writing--style, narrative, and plotting--drove me batty. In a matter of pages it would cycle from being an immensely powerful and energetic story to a dull, over analytical and tiresome diatribe. One of the reasons for this wild and frequent swing was the frequent, every few pages, interruption of the narrative with an omniscient perspective spoiler: It was italicized and, in a very technical and academic style, told exactly what was going to happen in the next few pages. It interrupted the flow of the prose, and generally annoyed me.Secondly, it was a very unflattering look at just how terrible it would be to survive the death of civilization. There is nothing romantic, or eerie, or wholesome, or evil, as in many other popular post-apocalyptic stories--but rather it showed the difficultly, the loneliness and down right miserable aspects of surviving past modern civilization. It read very realistic--the way it would be if our neighbors suddenly died and one or two of us were left holding the bag: suicides, drugs, alcohol and insanity all the flavor of the day.This aspect of the novel was its strength--Mr. Stewart's visions of desperation were apt and vivid. One example of this is when Ish returns to an empty world, and drives through town after town honking his horn, and then waiting for the answering honk that never comes. Ish's loneliness and desperation is palpable and completely understood by the reader.EARTH ABIDES was a roller coaster ride. I enjoyed it yes, but I also disliked it. It is a novel filled with ideas, but its impact is lessened with the over-evaluation of those ideas. If you enjoy a good post-apocalyptic novel EARTH ABIDES may be the answer, but tread warily, because some of its impact and importance has worn away with the passing years.-Gravetapping","Let me preach: I consider it a crime that _Earth Abides_ is out of print. But I can understand why. It challenges way too many of modern man's notions. It is seditious in the quietest of ways.I had never heard of this book till I wrote a review for _I Am Legend_.Some people compared both books and out of curiosity I picked it up at a used book store.Wow! Why is this book not in the canon of great works of American literature? True, it is a 300 page (in the paperback) _meditation_ by one man on the fall and gradual rise of mankind. I can understand why some reviewers loathe the book. It is an observation, not an adventure. The hero's meditations merely travel through time; through space his travels are almost incidental.Our hero, Ish, is no Odysseus. He is no Don Quijote. He is no Robin Hood or King Arthur or Moses. He is an ordinary scholar, a grief-stricken individual trying to come to terms with post-traumatic stress after witnessing the near-universal death of the human race. All he can do is make heroic attempts to _keep track_ of events and time.His meditations and road trip bring him in contact with stoic people, with depressed people, with defensive people and at one point, his Tribe encounters religious fanatics--all isolated groups of survivors trying to cope and remake society in their image.As _written by Stewart_, Ish's burden and character are not those of a civilization builder but rather of a witness to decay, ruin, and eventual rebirth, in which Ish _realizes_ that hubris and a need to control \"fate/destiny/the future\" drove much human action, human culture, and the human spirit.Ish's insights continually bowled me over as I turned page after page. His meditations on technology, progress, humanity, eugenics, government, economics, religion, philosophy, superstition, anthropology, education, and literacy (all man-made institutions) constantly challenged my views and I began an internal dialogue with Ish's character!Ish/Stewart challenges a lot of notions of what we call progress and culture. Amazing. No wonder some people have hated and, doubtless, will hate this book. Prepare to have your attitudes about culture, and civilization,--and what makes a _great literary character_--challenged.It's not one of those, what-would-you-do-in-this-scenario novels, but rather an exposition of what one man _learns_ from his circumstances. Does he challenge them? Fight back? Does he mold circumstances to his spirit or does he go along with them? Is the \"individual acting upon his circumstance and vice-versa\" _question_ some kind of cosmic constant?There are earthquakes, forest fires, city-wide conflagrations. The daily amenities are gone: water, power, fire/police protection, doctors/medicine, etc. You are on your own. What do you do? Responses are manifold. Ish's response and that of his \"tribe\" is just one. That is the brilliance of this novel. You can understand Ish's actions, but would they be yours? Would any actions make a \"difference?\" What is this \"difference\" and who gauges/judges it? Therein lies the crux of the novel. Those who hate the novel seem to resent this existential/metaphysical point.A harsher critic would say that \"events happen\" in _Earth Abides_ in order for Stewart to make his point. Fair enough. Very few characters are developed with fine detail, but that is not the point of this novel. The novel is _about Ish_, the man, his conundrums and his meditations. Not about what we would have done or written or how we would have developed the \"supporting characters.\"Oh, and the pathos in this book is very real. The human universals occur: love, births, bondings/friendship, weddings, tribalism, leadership-rivalry, loss, death. And even a morally ambiguous, ethics-challenging execution.If a few scenes don't bring you to profound sorrow, well...let's just say _I_ experienced the sorrow and emotion of the scene as the novel unfolded.I will not reveal more, but this sad and haunting novel is worth the read. This is a novel that for some reason reminded me of H.G. Wells's _The Time Machine_. Shelley's \"Ozymandias\" and Yeats's The Second Coming\" come to mind as well. Read it and buy your friends a copy. Be a friend. Be well. The Earth Abides.","In my top 5 Science Fiction Novels Ever.Earth Abides tells the story of one solitary man who survives a global, but short-lived plague by pure chance. The novel chronicles his life from that point until his eventual death and is filled with both adventure and introspection. At times the main character, Ish, is hard to like simply because his reactions are so human it's disturbing. He's no hero, and in the post-Heinlein flood of heroic SciFi novels you could be forgiven for calling this novel slow.Earth Abides reaches the lofty height of my number 3 favorite despite the fact that it DID NOT win either the Hugo or the Nebula Award, in fact it wasn't even nominated. Instead I award it this honor because it is the most brilliant example of the post-holocaust theme I've ever encountered, and that theme is a huge one in the Speculative Fiction genre. This is THE BAR, and no one has raised it in 50 years.Superbly poetic and graceful, Earth Abides is undeniably honest, realistic and human it's long, diary-like journey from start to finish. I could easily see myself as Ish... which is both a revelation and scary thought at the same time.","This is such a great book on so many levels, it's a shame that it's being subjected to negative comments from readers who have totally missed key points about the story. First off, the protagonist, Ish, is a geographer, an informed and detached observer and not meant to be a hero or role model. Please don't ladle 21st-century dramatic or politically-correct expectations onto him. He's more real than that. Second, some reviewers here are complaining that Ish doesn't teach his fellow survivors to read etc. But in fact he tries throughout the second half of the novel to do so. They just won't. Ish gradually accepts that his fellow survivors aren't capable of hard intellectual work, that the torch of civilization is going to be mostly extinguished. Ish theorizes that probably the few, functioning survivors of the global plague are going to be doltish people. The sensitive, intelligent ones that survived went mad and were deemed unfit to join the little tribe of survivors. So Ish has the human clay that he has -- simple, uncurious, habit-driven people. He's constantly frustrated that he can't rouse them to live above the level they quickly sank to -- of hunting and gathering cans from supermarkets, talking about fixing up things but never doing it, etc. The whole novel is about the unstoppable descent of the last survivors into primitivism, despite having all of the knowledge of the world at their fingertips in the library.The stopover in the south at the family of the \"negroes\" deserves to be called passe -- the book was published in 1949 after all.","A young man recovers, from what seems to be snake bite, to find humankind has basically been decimated from a strange disease. That's the way Mr. Stewart's work begins. And where does it go from there? Well, the protagonist procedes to explore the remains of the U.S. Eventually he settles down and begins a new life, in the new world that Earth has become.Even though this book might be classified as a sci-fi piece, it is a little less and more than that:- Earth Abides does not deeply explore the \"sci\" in sci-fi. There are not many explanations for the disease that destroys civilization. And there are not too many explanations either for what comes next in the book.- On the other hand, Earth Abides does a great job in exploring the psychological effects on the survivors of the demise of civilization. Moreover, Mr Stewart stretched his work through time to show us the way the first generations of the world (the survivors' sons, daughters and grandkids) would behave. This is really nice.I enjoyed this book. It really did not make a big difference on me the fact that it was written some 50 years ago (frankly, I'm not really sure if the outcome would have been different if this disease attacked us now).I recommend this book to anyone interested in exploring the possibilities and consequences of a decimation of humankind by disease (not impossible considering the bird flu). Regular sci-fi readers might enjoy it, too.Don't read this if you want a hard-core sci-fi book, if it being 50 years old is an issue for you (no Internet and cable TV here...), or if you don't want to share the protagonist's loneliness.Enjoy!","I just read this book again. I don't know how many times I've read it and I enjoy it each time. I bought it at a used book store in Las Vegas years ago and I'm so glad that I did.","Disappointed. I'm slowly learning to pay more attention to Amazon's negative reviews to get a more calculating grasp of a book's contents.Apparently civilization goes out with a very orderly, civilized whimper. As the police and military forces crumble along with everything else in a matter of months, civil order magically maintains itself with little looting. Perhaps a feasible conclusion to reach, but much more fleshing out was needed to explain the psychosocial motives for such an end to 99%+ of the human race.The author makes no effort to create a story arc--this is a poorly written fictional ethnography, not a novel. The plot mirrors the personality of the plodding, coldly methodical protagonist.Most of the other characters are two-dimensional and cliched, following personality and behavioral stereotypes you'd expect from a 1949 bog standard. While this is feasible /to a certain extent/, the author proceeds with no introspection about it, as though the Leave It to Beaver cast was instantaneously transplanted into a world without people.On the positive side, the author makes distinct efforts to present the ecological side effects of humanity's disappearance. But this saving grace grows old, too, as the novel plods through the decades following the apocalypse.Now that I think of it, I believe that's exactly what the author intended, realism be damned. He imagined a band of primitive hunter-gatherers in the withered skeleton of an American city, and worked backward to see how it would fall into place. Too bad verisimilitude was the first casualty, normally a hallmark of the genre.","I wanted to like this book. I really did...but after getting into it, I had to stop and put it down. The plot is just too unrealistic, and the main character Ish is robotic and boring. As some other reviewers have stated, Ish shows almost no emotion after literally 99.9% of the human race is wiped out. He reacts clinically, robotically, and without apparent emotion after he returns to his parent's house to find everyone dead or missing. \"Hmm, that's interesting. Everyone's dead.\" He takes a freakin' road trip to \"look for survivors\" --yet leaves them all behind--deeming them unsatisfactory companions. This is justified by stating that Ish enjoys solitude. Umm...sorry, I enjoy the outdoors and solitude as much as anyone, and no normal person would react in such a way. Ever hear of the \"mad trapper\" or \"cabin fever\"? That's what really happens to people denied human interaction. Madness. Depression. Paranoia. Suicide. A longing to see another human face.The author, an English professor, must have fancied himself in the role of Ish--a purely logical, Spock-like Vulcan wandering around an empty world. This was a mistake--don't make the protagonist (and hero) of the novel to be a clone of yourself--the savior of the new society, a professor. Gag. I just couldn't buy into that. I also didn't like the author's prose--dry and dull. I can see why some people liked the book, but it just didn't do it for me. I'm thinking things would be a lot more like \"Lord of the Flies\" than \"Earth Abides\"!","The reviews I noticed are fine reports on this fine book. However, one point may have been overlooked. This is the first book I'd read (my first read was back in the 1960s) that used the term ecology. Mentioning this point will deepen the other reviews.","Stewart's books was perfectly creepy and emotional. I identified with the protagonist greatly, and do not feel he was too passive or overly-cerebral. Truth be known, in the few crises I have known, I've often reacted much like him. Okay, I'm a little more attached to things than he is, but I feel this is a plot contrivance to allow the story to go forward.Having read and re-read &quot;The Stand&quot; quite a few times now, I was struck by Stewart's decision (1) not to gather large groups together, (2) not to restart civilization (e.g., electricity, running water, et al), and (3) to cover such a large span of time. &quot;The Stand&quot; covers perhaps up to a year after a plague wipes out 99% of the human race. This book covers over a half-dozen decades. I feel that all three of these decisions demonstrated a far more likely result than King's use of dreams as a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; to gather persons into two camps for the &quot;final conflict&quot; between good and evil.Born in 1976, I am only now becoming aware of these post-apocalyptic classics. I have now finished &quot;On the Beach&quot; by Nevil Shute, &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot; by Pat Frank, and of course this one. The first two dealt with the all-too-real Nuclear Nightmare that even I experienced (though all those younger than me can't even remember there being a USSR). Shute's book was &quot;a stern warning of things to come&quot; and &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot; was more of a man vs. nature story.But this one, it dealt with the nightmare that first captivated me in &quot;The Stand&quot; - a world decimated by plague, leaving the infrastructure intact. While Stewart did not pick up the thread the way I wish he had - that is, some form of civilization being preserved, rather than yet another &quot;Time Machine&quot;-style primitive culture that barely recalls our culture. However, Stewart does spend a great amount of time talking about the decay of this world, and that fascinated me. Storm drains clogging, water seeping into houses and rotting the carpets, termites collapsing houses over the work of decades, dust settling into the corners of the Golden Gate Bridge and grass growing there, and the work of rain and frost on the Northeast roads. All of this riveted me.My biggest complaints are mostly minor, such as (1) how could running water go on for 20 years? (2) why did it take so long for the electricity to run out, and the biggest one (3) why were there no signs of panic (e.g., looting, riots, massive traffic jams as swarms of panicked people ran about in civilization's death throes, et al).My biggest gripe, however, is spiritual. Nobody in this book, even former churchgoers and clergy, feel any need to reach out to God. Admittedly, I'm biased, being a Christian, Biblical scholar, and future University prof. But I am a rational being, and I feel a rational argument can be made for the spiritual side of man, a characteristic that even the protagonist recognizes, even if he can't properly articulate, let alone address, this &quot;God-shaped hole&quot; in each of us.Now, I realize that science fiction, even more than other genres, allow us to paint on a blanked canvas (the devastated world) our worldviews on such things as man's innate goodness or evil, the necessity or redundancy of God (e.g., church, Scriptures, etc.), the expression of our social nature, the necessity (or redundancy) of modern technologically-dependent society, and so forth. I understand that we're not all going to agree; I don't feel it's my job to insist on homogeneity amongs everyone. However, if I wrote a book along these lines, I would make sure to include atheists, skeptics and agnostics, along with members of other religions (at varying degrees of dedication) along with those persons I feel &quot;make sense&quot; from my perspective. While by no means do I feel &quot;all religions lead to God&quot; or that &quot;you just need to be sincere,&quot; I do agree that any description of a post-apocalyptic (or any other) reality, in order to be fair to the multiplicity of human thought and experience, must recognize that &quot;it takes all kinds.&quot;That said, I did find myself chilled by the spiritual apathy evidenced, among other things, by the community's perception of &quot;Evie,&quot; the mentally-challenged pariah. &quot;We don't want no idiot children ruining the gene pool&quot; the protagonist declared in some fashion on numerous occasions. While I may see, in a survival-based world, the necessity of taking precautions, I did feel that the cold and unfeeling attitude (&quot;should we have even let her live?&quot; Ish asks himself repeatedly) was frightfully inhumane. There is no &quot;all are created equal&quot; here, no &quot;all are God's children&quot; here. While I understand expediency, I do not feel it must be carried out heartlessly.However, apart from this one real gripe, I truly do recommend this book to anyone interested by such things, like me. After borrowing this book from a library (copies are hard to find!) I've decided to buy it. I suppose that's the best recommendation I can give...","This novel, Earth Abides, written by George Stewart takes place in San Francisco during present times. A worldwide virus overtakes and wipes out the entire human race, leaving only a select few alive. Of these few is a man named Isherwood who goes in search of other survivors to band with. He meets a woman named Emma and a few other people who start a new civilization. It is not easy, however, and they are constantly hitting head-to-head with nature, fighting for survival. As in any other society, there are some people who challenge the law that was laid down in the beginning. As a result, certain members of the tribe are divided. Unity is essential for survival...will they make it? Only time will tell.The author of this book was probably raised in a Christian environment because there are many Biblical references in this book. For example, one of the characters in this novel is named Ezra, as is an Old Testament prophet. Stewart&#65533;s Christian roots are evident in the way he unravels his novel and the double meanings behind some of his story. For example, a child named Joey is born to Ish and Em that is far more intelligent than any other of the many children. Ish finds hope in this young boy because he knows that Joey&#65533;s outstanding brightness will one day be of great use to future peoples, just as God had much pride in His son Jesus.This novel is a wake up call to the reader in that it brings attention to how weak and vulnerable humans really are. What if mankind were to die today? Would people have their affairs set in order?This novel is a fictional story but has real-life applications. For example, there are real people facing real starvation and shelter needs. Stewart portrays very well the thoughts and feelings of each of the characters, which enhances the story line.Earth Abides is an excellent novel. It is extremely well written and it flows nicely. Anybody thirteen years of age and older should definitely read this book because it captures the reader&#65533;s attention and has the ability to transport the reader to a world no longer inhabited by humans. Younger children may not be able to understand some of the vocabulary in this book and may be easily confused due to the complex plot line. However, I give this book a two thumbs up.","Despite the quality of Stewart's writing, which is elegaic at its best and readable at its worst, this is a very creaky and dated work. Certainly, you have to make some allowances for the culture and time in which books are written, but like John Wyndham, Stewart seems handicapped by an assumption of the rightness of bourgeois values, especially when it comes to women. The book does address this, and in some ways is all about the struggle to maintain these values in a world where they are making less and less sense. But, you get the feeling that, in terms of sociopolitical change (as opposed to the obvious physical change - the old infrastructure has been destroyed), it's a case of 'apocalypse? what apocalypse?'. Stewart's characters are like Hollywood western stereotypes - the men are either upright patriachs or shifty loners; the women are wives and daughters who appear strong but are really just there for breeding and cooking. There are works which do tackle the obvious questions of the use of social roles in a society totally different from that which created them, most notably the vastly under-rated New Zealand film, The Quiet Earth (if I've remembered the name right). Read Stewart by all means: it isn't a bad book, but it isn't the classic it's built up to be.","Many readers will find this book very frustrating. It describes in one lifetime the dissolution of civilization on the planet. We know that if even a handful of humans survive a major disaster they will probably cling to the fundamentals of civilization a bit longer than one generation.In particular we will cling to reading and writing. These are the foundation skills of civilization. Writing systems are one of the foundation stones upon which civilization is built. The notion that we would allow a generation of kids to grow up without teaching them to read and write is tantamount to criminality.But if you stop seeing this as a single generation book, and think of it more as though Ish, the lead character, is able to see through many generations, then the story becomes much more believable.With all the talk of avian flu and the potential for a super virus this book seems eerily relevant to society today. Much more so than when it was written. Throughout the book we have metaphors for the natural balance of nature as we see one rampant population of animals after another expand and then die back to sustainable levels. And the question must always be, is the human population on earth sustainable?The answer is clearly no! And if we don't do something about our population levels and our resource consumption, this book may well represent our future on this planet.","First, I would like to say that just about everything to say about this book has been said. Most reviews are accurate, there are some great characters in this book and Ish does have some intense experiences, however I have mixed emotions as far as this book goes.Ish's long time companion Em, is a reliable and loving character, Ish & The Tribe look to her for strength and wisdom, time & again she delivers. She is loved and respected by all, but when she passes away, her death is all but over in one paragraph. It is similar with old George, he is a lovely character, like a grandfather or old uncle, I would have liked to see a few pages devoted to his passing. This is not the case. This leaves me a little flat.Some parts of the story are deeply moving ie when the boys return after their adventure and a stranger is with them. He is the carrier of desease and when he will not leave when asked, a solution must be found. The elders have to make a decision that chills them all to the bone. Great reading, but when Em & old George die it is almost glossed over.I enjoyed this book, but I would not recommend it as a light read. If you are into PA stories and you like deep intense stories, then I guess this is for you.If you are after action and adventure, stay away.","I know this book was first published in 1949. I can overlook the unlimited shelf life of canned goods and gasoline. It's the main character \"Ish\" who ruined this story for me. He is your typical elitist douche bag who confuses a large vocabulary with intelligence. With a university library at his fingertips, this mental giant could not learn the basics of survival (agriculture, animal husbandry, auto repair, food storage etc...)in his lifetime! I muscled through the book hoping it would redeem it's self in the end, but I ended up losing eight bucks on my kindle and three days of my life. If you want to read this \"classic\" be prepared for constant complaining about the stupidity of others while doing absolutely nothing to better the situation. Hubris abounds with his superior attitude and god complex. He's also a bit of a racist (Not for his use of the word \"Negro\", but for his temptation to use the black people he encounters to make himself king!) and a sexist.","Isherwood Williams is away in the mountains pursuing his graduate field studies in geology. In our iPhone, instant connectivity world it is hard to imagine the isolation this kind of trip entailed in the 1950's when George Stewart wrote his book. Recovering from a snake bite, Ish stumbles back from the hills to find most of humanity wiped out by disease. We follow Ish through the remainder of his life as he comes to terms with a changing Earth--an Earth on which humanity is a barely noticeable presence.The absence of humanity is not only a stark fact, but is emphasized by the author's writing style. Ish is a clear introvert and we experience much of the Earth's change through his internal monologue. Even when he encounters, interacts with, and teams up with other people, this produces very little dialogue. This style underscores the aloneness of the book's characters. It's not loneliness, in the emotional sense, but a continuing reminder that other people no longer play a significant role in the world.The Earth itself becomes an evolving character in the book. We experience the successive rise and fall in populations of insects, rats, dogs and other species as seasons in the Earth's changing life. The diminishing resources scavenged by human beings from cities and storehouses are important to their survival, but also serve as markers of change as the Earth sheds the thin layers of Man's influence. This change is not progress, nor is it overly mourned as decline. It is thoroughly described and documented as inevitable change. Ish observes it and reacts to it. But neither he nor the other characters influence its path or pace.Read and compare this book with two other classics of post-Apocalyptic fiction:Alas, BabylonandThe Day of the Triffids. These works also follow their characters through crises, scavenging, and attempts to preserve the technology and civilization of the past. They are both more optimistic and more social in narrative style and in the strategies followed by their characters. After reading them, return to Earth Abides and appreciate it for the melancholy and aloneness felt by both its characters and its readers. It is a good story, a moving experience, and a skillful integration of message and writing style.","The premise of this story is the elimination of 99% plus of the human race as a result of a world-wide plague. The plague only effects humans. All other species of life continues to live and in some cases, thrive. Does that sound like something you've read before? I don't think so. In this story the plague kills slow enough to allow the living to bury the dead, thus the streets are not full of dead bodies and the freeways are empty. The remaining few gather themselves into small \"tribes\". The leader of the tribe in our story was a history professor at a major university which is very close to the location of the University of California, Berkley. As a professor he observes the progress, or regress, of his tribe as a student might and creates a tale that would be appropriate for an Anthropology class.Equally interesting to the \"student\" is the impact on the ecology as a result of the loss of mankind. It is truly amazing how much control man has and the impact of his sudden removal. To give even examples would be to deprive the reader of experiencing it themselves. Although not a long book it covers a period of around 70 years or more. It does so by summarizing periods of 10-20 years into short chapters. The author does an excellent job of maintaining continuity in this manner.I would recommend this book hold-heartedly to the serious reader, not because it is a difficult read, for it is actually quite an easy read, but because it is not an action adventure story but a serious look at the possible destiny of mankind. A destiny which I for one would hope we would be better than. The story was written in 1949 but would vary little if written today. An \"end of earth story\" with a very modern premise would be \"One Second After\" written in 2009 which was fascinating to read back-to- back with Earth Abides and which I will be reviewing separately.","Earth Abides is well worth the read. It is difficult for me to suggest precisely why that is so, thus very little actually happens through the course of the book.I suppose there may lay its charm. It's simplicity seems to add plausibility. My impression is that there was much more hype than the title deserved, nevertheless, it certainly deserves some.","With nearly 300 reviews of this book at Amazon, I hardly have to give a summation of the story. I was swept along by the narrative, and I identified greatly with Ish, the protagonist of this post-collapse novel, perhaps because of affinity with his personality. However, I do not give it 5 stars because I happen to differ with the kind of fall-back-into-pre-literate-history climax. Ish should have done a lot more than he did to preserve literacy and a connection with tradition. True, the memory of the Iliad and the Odyssey and the real horrors of the Holocaust is not something we could describe as essential for the survival of mankind, but I could not blithely accept the disappearance of the history and the literature of our human species. There is much that is terrible in our history, but much also that is heroic and even sublime.However, I must say this book is one that will stick in my mind for a long time, and it is rare today to find a book that will have that effect. Most of the books today that are lauded as \"good reads\" are just entertainment for a few hours but are quickly forgotten. Not so with \"Earth Abides.\" You may argue with certain aspects of the novel, and/or certain philosophical conclusions of its author, but once you've read it, I doubt that you will be able to dismiss it or pretend you didn't spend a few hours with the survivors of \"the plague.\"","I read this book when I was a freshman in High School, after it was assigned by a cool female sci-fi teacher. At the time I didn't care much for reading, but I read Earth Abides cover to cover. The book changed me, turned me into a reader and then a writer. That was over 30 years ago, and still I so often think about various sections in the book. Now, here I am, ready to purchase another copy and reread the incredible novel, just to see again how it still so deeply affects me. Earth Abides is powerful, memorable, and deeply moving--it is everything a book should be.","This is, if not the best, at least one of the best books of its type ever.The story is told with a grittiness that makes every page crackle with life. I read it first in high school, and have read it several times since. I was so happy to see that Del Rey Books re-issued this timeless classic in 2006.A whole new generation of readers will be able to enjoy Stewart's amazing novel.A. C. Ellisauthor ofIn Pursuit of the Enemy,Worldmaker,Soldier of 'Tween, andSHADOW RUN: Book I of The Ancients' War","Isherwood (Ish) Williams has recently finished grad school and is camping in California when he is bitten by a rattlesnake. At first the injury seems minor, but he rapidly descends into a delirium-filled illness. After several weeks, he gradually regains his senses wondering how a simple snake bite could have affected him so strongly. He heads back into town and find everyone gone. It seems a bit odd at first, but Ish thinks to himself that perhaps it is Sunday (he has lost track of time). He eventually comes across a newspaper that describes a devastating plague that has swept across the country, and he becomes aware of the full magnitude of the catastrophe that has struck the United States and the World. What follows is one of the best stories about post-apocalyptic survival ever written.This book is divided into three sections, the first two taking the lion's share of the space. In the first section, Ish discovers the plague, realizes he is one of the few survivors, and decides to take a cross country trek to see who and what else has survived. In the second section, set 22 years after the first, Ish has settled down with a small number of other survivors who start families in the SF bay area. We see the first and second generations of children born after the plague who have no concept or awareness of what we would term modern civilization (and all that implies for better or worse). We follow the slow decay of the remnants of the earlier civilization, and the construction of a new way of life. In the final section, Ish is an old, dying man reflecting on his life and all that has happened. In between each of the three major sections are brief vignettes that cover the major events of the the chapters that are set decades apart.This is largely an introspective tale about Ish's thoughts and emotions as his world crumbles around him and is rebuilt and transformed. If you're looking for a story about a lone survivor battling mutant zombies or some such thing, you'll be disappointed. In the first section, Ish is just trying to make sense of what happened and figure out what he wants to do. In the second, he tries to teach the children of his small community something about what life was like prior to the plague and maintain some continuity with the past. One of the children ask him what an American was, and Ish finds that it isn't so easy to explain. In the third section, Ish is the only pre-plague survivor left in the community, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren now unrecognizeably changed to cope with their new environment. There is some action in this story, but not much. One of the best aspects of this story (and this genre in general) is that the author explores what would happen to all the trappings of modern life if the machinery just stopped. In some ways, the changes would be immediate and profound, in others, changes would take more time.The bottom line is that this sad, introspective tale woven around some Biblical themes is an all-time classic in my view and definitely recommended. There are some outdated (or just plain different) ideas and ways of thinking in this book (Stewart wrote it in the late '40s I believe), but don't let that stop you from reading the book. Stewart conveys a message and asks some questions that are relevant to people and human nature whatever epoch they happened to be born in. People will be reading this 100 years from now. I read this book (along with Alas Babylon) many years ago as a teen and decided to re-read the pair again. There are many powerful images from this book that I still remember now decades later. My view now has changed a bit as I can understand Stewart's central message better, but no matter what you think about this genre in general, this is a timeless story that you'll never forget.","What happens if mankind is almost wiped out yet the infrastruce remains relatively untarnished? What skills are most valuable in such a situation? Once Maslow's hierarchy of needs has been fulfilled, what comes next? Can a society regress but improve simultaneously? Can extreme preventive measures be moral? I love a Mad Max post apocalyptic tale, but the seemingly pedestrian situations and questions posed in this book continue to haunt me long after reading it.","I read this book 35 years ago while in junior high. It captivated me. I pondered (as only an adolescent can) what I would do if I were Ish. What would I do if I came home from a trip into the mountains and found the world dead of a plague. How would I respond? What would I do? How would I survive? How would I cope?I read it again when I was in high school and the same musing returned. I found it in my box of \"things\" several years later when I was 23, after I was married. I sat down that afternoon and read the entire book. Again it affected me - but in a different, more mature way. After I had children, I gave it to my daughter to read when she was 16. She found it to be a very fascinating read on the sociological impact on man of a devastating plague which leaves only a few scattered survivors. I have lent my copy to several people over the years and everyone who reads it finds the book to create emotion and ponder what they would do in such a situation.The mystery and appeal of the book lies in the writer placing the reader into the conscience of the main character named Isherwood \"Ish\" Williams. There are several undertones within the book - one of which is the role of the reluctant leader, the second the \"sacramental\" image of the hammer. It also shows the tendancy of man to desire religion.This book review, I hope, motivates someone to read a book that they may not have read by simply looking at the cover. You will be mesmerized by this well written classic... I guarantee! (I have been mesmerized by it 5 times now in the past 35 years)","I remember first reading this book in High School almost 30 years ago - the story of Isherwood Williams and his struggle to survive in a world where 99% of the people have perished in a biological holocaust. Well written, it keeps the readers attention pretty much throughout. While the book suffers a tiny bit of \"out-dated-ness\" (no mention of cell phones, or the internet) it is still an excellent and well-thought-out read about the demise of our techno-centric civilization. I especially like the way the book takes you through the passing of years, and eventually decades - to a future that makes you step back and say \"Yeah, I can see that happening...\" Enjoy the book, it's a great read!","If you're manic depressive you definitely don't want to read this book. Normally, I love exploring the delicious idea of an end of the world scenario, then having the opportunity to start over. But, I was amazed at how much I hated this book. The characters simply showed little redeeming value and did little but live off the works of the last surviving generation. God, how I slogged through the entire book, hoping that it would get better, that I was going to learn some valuable life lesson or something. It never came. When I finished the book this morning, after reading it in spurts over a period of a month, I really was depressed!The writing is workman like, which is sad, because there's not a poetic line in the whole book, with the exception of the title itself. Oh well.","Having just finished reading Earth Abides, by George R. Stewart, my mind cannot put it down. When I began the book, I expected an apocalypse type novel, and it is that, but it is very much more. I was drawn into the existence of the main character, Isherwood Williams, in such a profound way that I am quite at a loss without him. He is not a formula hero, in that he has human frailties. He is a ponderer and a worrier, much like me. Perhaps that is why I was able to relate to him so easily. He takes nothing at face value, instead he is always fretting, contemplating, and evaluating. His successes are mitigated and his blessings are mixed, as is often the case in real life. There is nothing about the book that is formula, which is a rarity in this genre. On the contrary, it is a truly original work, replete with both adventure and philosophy. The writing style flows beautifully, without an unnecessary phrase or a word out of place. It is a true work of literature, one of the best books I ever read. I am sure that its effect on me will endure, and I will remember this book and its vivid characters for the rest of my life.","I first read this probably 40 years ago and I've re read it over the years, most recently last week.This is a book that stays with you and I was surprised how much I remembered. But I had forgotten just how emotional it was. Stewart's prose seems simple and utilitarian but has real depth of feeling.It's a terrific book.","Very well written and interesting plot. Kept reader wondering what was next. Could not put the book down. I have it on my e-reader and will read again","A friend let me borrow this book to read and I could not put the book down. I do reccommend anyone reading this book, even to this day I still am thinking about the story. It does make you think of how you would be able to work things out when everything you know has disappeared. Great read, I loved this book so much that I had to get a copy for myself!!","I've read a lot of Science Fiction in the past 35 years and found this just ok. I guess I didn't get the underlying message. There was little action, little adventure and basically a bunch of slackers degenerating back into the middle ages. The main character Ish was an odd duck that I could not relate to. I guess I just don't get it.","I felt that this book is very monotonous in how the main character of the book travels around the country looking for people and answers to what happen to the world. he will go in to extreme detail in minor occurrences like seeing something like a body or a hammer. i think this book is very good and has a good plot and deep thesis but i wouldnt recommend this book because it is a slow pace dragging book.","I first read this novel, borrowed from the library, in 1963 and was intrigued by the by the author's detailed descriptions and unique story line. I purchased it in 1987 and re-read it, then loaned the book to a friend and lost track of it - but it was every bit as enjoyable again. Now, I'm 68 and purchased it thru Amazon and re-re-read every word in detail. It is still a tremendously powerful novel and challenges the readers to place themselves in the past and future. What would you do to rebirth a civilization? How could you cope in those first, empty days. What regrets might you have as you witnessed the demise of literature and art? What, then, the consequences as the \"Earth Abides?\"","I realize this is a 'classic' of science fiction, but I couldn't find it in me to really love it. It''s good, but sooo dated in many respects. And frankly, I never really connected with Ish, the main character. Still I am glad I read it, because of its enduring status.","I read Earth Abides in the sixties as a teenager, and it is one of the few books that stays with me through the years. A beautiful, haunting book.","I first read this book when I was in high school. That would be early '60s. It was one of those stories that was foundational in my own thinking. It was a pleasure to read it again after all these years. It is one of the earliest of the apocalyptic genre and its themes are timeless and the characters unforgettable, as you yourself Ish well know. It is still fresh and engrossing to read.","After having read many apocalyptic scifi novels; this is defenitely utopian. SPOILER: The disappearance of all the victim of the plague is suspiciously clean. Also, the simplification of the breakdown of infrastructure seem a bit too clean. However, having dealt with these questions, Stewart frees the book to deal with the most preponderous question: How do the Survivors of a great diaster rebuild civilization?","After reading this book I can no longer get myself to read anything else. There is just no other fiction novel, I believe, that can possible be as good as this book.It's so incredibly thought provoking and engrossing I can't stop reflecting on it.","This is a classic sci-fi drama with interesting survival and sociological study. Long but entertaining and I can recommend it.","This is an enduring futuristic fantasy novel that is hard to put down. The characters are well developed and sympathetic without being heroic. It is easy to image yourself in the protagonist's position, and contemplate how you would react. It really makes you think about what is important in your personal life and in society. An excellent novel for anyone with an active imagination.","This book is so old I was leary about reading it...I have to tell you..even though this book was written so long ago..this book will stick with me forever...the characters are memorable and you are right there with them..you laugh and cry with them!!! i will always remember this book..i am so glad i read it!!!","this is a very well written sci-fi/apocalyptic thriller. it isn't so much as a thriller but an exploration of the human race (in the POV of Ish, one of the most memorable fictional characters IMHO). I love the line \"between the plan and the fulfillment lies the frailty of human life\". so many quotable and thoughtful quotes. this is not for sci-fi readers who like action-packed plots - this book has depth, it satisfied me as a realistic portrait of life after an apocalypse. in fact, if there really is an apocalypse, i believe those who had read Earth Abides will be more than prepared to deal with it.","Excellent book. Still current though written in late 1940's. It is a novel that sticks with you. I have read many disaster books, end of world stories, but I have to say this one is my very favorite.","George Steward did a great job writing a novel that is timeless in nature. I thought the book was well written and the characters in the book were believable and down to earth. I could not put the book down. The pace of the book was fast and exciting. Each page of the held a new twist or further clarity in the development of each character. I especially enjoyed the development of the relationship between Ish and Em as it spanned over time and life events. George Steward did a great job writing a novel that is timeless in nature George Steward did a great job writing a novel that is timeless in nature.","I'm an avid reader. This is one of the most memorable books I've ever read. Earth Abides is a true masterpiece in every sense.","I love the apocalyptic genre. I had high hopes for this book and it started off good as the main character travels across the country during the aftermath of the disease (which he did not witness first hand while it was happening). After he meets up with a group of fellow survivors, they form a small community and from then on the whole book just seems to be pointless and boring. I got excited when the main character's two sons decided to take a trip across country, but the story line did not follow them on their trip and we found out little of what they saw and experienced when they returned. That infuriated me. Overall, this book was disappointing.","I have been a huge fan of the TEotWaWKI (The End of the World as We Know It) genre for quite some time. In a conversation with a fellow fan, I revealed that I have not heard of this book. After the shouts of shock and consternation died down, I was strongly urged to read it.Boring!Most of the book is taken up by the main character (Isherwood Williams) going on and on about what he or others should do. Then he does nothing! It got to the point that, after an actual interaction with another character (rare though they were), I dread the blah-blah-blah that was about to come.The only reason why I finished this book (and kept this from being a single star review) was the insight it provided on the age in which it was written. These are the things that stand out for me:* Being apologetic for not killing or running off the supposed mentally dificient member of the group.* It seeming to be OK for younger folk to painfully pinch very old people when they don't respond as expected (so much for respecting your elders).* The shame in having to bypass a mountain lion rather than killing it.* Killing a calf only for its liver, and killing its mother just because it was in the way.* Fear that a kid may be too smart and the need to keep it from reading too much.* Purposely not using reference material when trying to do something for which they have no experience.* Seeming lack of desire for good food. Whatever is around is good enough. No need to go out of your way to make something good.* The only time sex is implied is for making babies or cast aspersions upon someone's character.This was an exercise in anti-intellectualism and anti-sensualism. I'd rather be killed in the plague than to have to live with this bunch.","I've read many of the \"apocalyptic\" books. This was a quiet one. Since it was written in 1949, that might explain that. It was a pleasure not to see the F-word at all, and so many of the other obligatory modern slang phrases. It did avoid any positive reference to religion, so it is \"modern\" in that respect. Not exciting at all, and somewhat sad. Probably would appeal to women and those who consider themselves as intellectual or literary critics. Me, I just wanted some action from this book--not.","Why is this kindle book \"not available to kindle customers in Australia\"? SHAME on you Amazon. This was the best book I ever read as a teenager and I so wish to read it again","I read this book years ago (in the early 80's I think). It was my first post-apocalyptic novel and there are pieces of it I still remember. When something kills most of the people in the world, Stewart takes us into middle America. A dog named Bridget (I think), an Irish Setter, sits and waits for her people to come home. Bridget's bewilderment and her mourning is what I remember. The protagonist is a teen-aged boy who struggles to survive. Along the way he meets a housewife in her 30's, and she eventually becomes his wife. She's lost her husband and children and there's something she's hiding--a secret that illustrates how the world has changed since 1949 when Stewart wrote \"Earth Abides.\" Earth Abides ends on a positive note with humanity not quite back to square one. If you like \"everyone dies-but-us\" books and you're sick of flesh-eating zombies and vampires, I recommend it.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005F6569Y/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title","I read this book as a teenager. I've shared it with everyone from siblings to grandchildren and they all agree. It's a thought provoking look at a possible future for the earth. A must read for everyone!","This is a remarkable science fiction novel that has stood the test of time. I read it in the early sixties and recently bought it for my daughter.","What an excellent book! I read this on Vacation in Cancun, and couldn't put it down. I may have missed a couple good vacation days totally engaged with this story. Well worth it.","Earth Abides is a great book in general but among its genre its easily one of the best. If you enjoy post apocalypse fiction then this is a must read. No hesitation at a five star review.","Excellent book! I've owned a copy many years ago, and had to have another since my old copy was lost or stolen!!!","I first read &quot;Earth Abides&quot; in a borrowed copy in the early 1950s ... and many, many times since. My problem then was losing the title --- but never the story. Finally, in the late 1960s, my 15-plus year project of telling the story over and over in search of a title (and a copy of my own) paid off. That copy, well thumbed is well kept. It's on my top shelf, handy for a quick read every couple of years or so. I just finished it again today ... not the first time I've made it through in one sitting and then regretting hitting the last page. In part, the book helped lead me to the East Bay (Clayton) in the 1980s and my time there also makes the story real and special. Now it's back to the top shelf ... the only proper place for this really &quot;great read!!!&quot;","I read this magnificant book over 30 years ago and I still canNOT get it out of my head. I was born and raised in the Berkeley/El Cerrito area. While reading EARTH ABIDES, I could visualize, with extreme clarity, all the areas mentioned in the book. I actually put myself in the possibility of REALITY while: the electricity ran out; the overgrowth of flora/fauna; the animals going wild; seeking tires at dealerships on Shattuck Avenue; seeking other humans in Berkeley, the UC Berkeley library; the creating of another human generation; no racial hostility; etc. I just ordered two more of EARTH ABIDES to give to friends who grew up in the Bay Area. They will be astounded and will love it. Although written in 1949, and what is going on in the world today, was this another prophecy?","Like most of the other reviewers, I too have read this book many times. There is some-thing about this story that stays with you. I can't say I have had the same feeling about any other book.","I read this book over 15 years ago and to this day I still cannot get the story out of my head. I wish I can find another copy so I can read it again and even pass it onto my family and friends.What made this story so remarkable was how logical the story line flowed. Everytime I ponder that faitfull question of being one of few left on Earth, I try to take into account the possibilities of how Earth will &quot;reset&quot; iteslf around me. Would I want to stay in Florida, move back to California, or go on a quest to some distant land and build my own civilization?Anyway, I highly recommend this book for those who have ever pondered the question of being the &quot;last person on Earth.&quot;","I first read this book at 11 yrs old (1965), and have read it 4 more times throughout my life. I continually think about this book and always recomend it to friends. I grew up in the desert with not much to do BUT read,when I finished it the first time I had to start over right away, Ive NEVER done that with ANY other book!!! have fun reading it!!!!!","It was a must read for my Physical Geography class. We were supposed mto read it from a Geographers point of view. My teacher prefaced it with &quot;this book was written in the 40's and it is sexist - so ladies please don't let it irritate you.&quot; I however, didn't find it sexist I found M, the lead female charachter, a strong and wonderful woman. I also liked the fact that there was interracial marriage and poligamy. Forward thinking ideas in the 1940's. All in all it is a good weekend read. But, it is way corny! Especially all the text in italics.","As a long time reader of sci-fi, this novel-EARTH ABIDESs is the single best story ever written. I have read it more than 30 times. From the time Ish begins his relent measures to understand what has happen, the start of rebuiding a social group, the developement years, and the final bridge location with Ishs' final thought of &quot;Men may come and go but Earth abides&quot; stirs thoughts of --how would you perform in a like setting.","What more can be said? Get it and read it!!! I first read it about 35 years ago and it has stayed with me. The book impressed me then and it impresses me now.","When the protagonist entered the Bancroft library at the Univeristy of California, and the author described him handling the books and the care which was taken when he left, was so beautifly described I almost cried. Living in chaos but leaving in such a humanly way left a strong message of the power of books and libraries that needs to be an inhernt value to our culture.","It seems like this book was super-great when I first read it about 40 years ago. I haven't been able to forget it. I am excited to see it is in print again---but why was it ever out of print? It is timely, provocative and just plain great reading for any age.","I found this post-apocalyptic story well written, but a bit slower paced that other titles of this genre. I attribute the pace to the era in which this book was written. I would consider this a must read, especially if you have read On the Beach and Alas, Babylon.","I have read this book several times. Once you start,...it's hard to put down.","I liked this book, though the introduction claiming i would remember the book forever and so on. Well, intro's like that turn me off a bit. It certainly is intriguing in a rather simple way. The later seems to add a certain plausibility which makes it much more believable. It's always a trade off, exchange a little drama for a little more realism. In all, a nice balance. I must say that the book is well written.","An excellent read -- an excellent re-read. The book is both entertaining and thought-provoking. If you like science-fiction with an apocalyptic theme, you will like this work.","great book about the aftermath of humanity and how the world deals with our absence, follows a young grad student from the extinction of man to the establishment of a new human society.","I think this is a post-apocolypse classic because of the unique perspectives the author presents. Rather than focusing on theh flu epidemic that wipes out the majority of humanity, the author focuses on one man's experience of it through the rest of his life as he joins with other survivors and the beginnings of their \"tribe\" come together. There is really less \"action\" than one might expect as the author tells the story of \"post-flu\" life and the subtle, slow changes that emerge as human beings begin living more in balance with the planet. A very beautiful story really as humanity comes to know iteself apart from \"civilization.\"","I did a comparison of this book with Childhood's End for A-level English. Two more different sci-fi books would be difficult to come by and that was the point. Earth Abides is a quiet story, full of the thoughts of Ish and the story of the community he helps found after a plague wipes out most of humanity. There is no scientific details as none of the characters have the expertise to know them. It a human story - not a science one. Some details are given of how the impact of humanity is gradually wiped from the planet and how the survivors - well survive.Don't expect explosive action or tales of daring-do. What you will get is an insightful book - even after all this time - what you will want to read a second and third time. Definitely one to keep - close!!","This was by far the best book I've read in a long time, in terms of pure quality. Coming off a run of John Grisham books before it (and after, I'm reading another Grisham story now), it was amazing how different the quality of the story was, and how much more thought-provoking. Grisham tries for some philosophical stuff in his books, but didn't come close to what you find here.The story itself was Ok...not fascinating alone, though surprising. A few things I certainly didn't expect to happen transpired. But what made it worthwhile was the \"what if\" factor. Imagine living through the apocalypse. Ponder the questions it raises:- What would I do? Seek other people? Focus on survival? How to judge others, and how easily to settle in with them?- How strong are the author's, and lead character's biases in the story? We get their perspective so strongly it's not clear sometimes what the reality is?- What about Charlie? There's no way I'd make the same vote as the characters in the book - so I think. But if I had lived as they had for 22 years, would that change my opinion? How can I know? (answer to that last question - I can't).Is there some deeper answer in the book about what the meaning of life really is? If we strip everything we have today away, we go back to a more primal state where the search for food, water, shelter and safety are paramount in our minds. So how much of what we experience now is a product of civilization and society, rather than our true nature? The memorable line which was something like (I don't have the book for a direct quote) \"I'm happy. Things are as they are and I'm a part of them.\" says a lot doesn't it? Goes back to Buddhist philosophy really - focus on the present. When there's no guarantee of the next meal, when there's no shelter because a fire can burn it all down, when wild animals lurk, how much time do we have to ponder, to worry, to debate? And does that make us happier - meeting our primal drive to just...be?I'd highly recommend this book, my \"top\" recommendation whatever that means. It covers ecology, philosophy, sociaology and so much more...I waited almost two years to read it. It's a shame I waited that long.","Starts off great, slows down too much in the middle but finishes well. If you are looking for a Robinson Crusoe post-apocalyptic type read this is not for you. Nothing like \"The Stand\". All the characters are at best low end of average and manage to accomplish very little over the 42 year span of the book. Somehow, I liked that about the book. The writer gets a little too esoteric though. Still, one of the better reads I have had this year. Written in 1949 and I got a hoot out of picking the small things that dated the book. Everybody smoking is an example.","A thoughtful examination of the slow collapse of civilization in the lives of a small band of survivors brought together by one man who remains their leader until old age. In general, four stars, in science fiction genre alone, five stars.","I've gotta confess I was not very excited to read this book, having obtained on a bargain and postposed its reading for about a year, when I eventually got to it, I was absolutely blown awaythe writting, althought not brilliant, is very polished and takes you throught the wonderful adventure of the end of mankind as we know it, throught the vast territory of a deserted united states, and tells us how it would slowly and rapidly decay in its various facets, until it would stand almost naked, a fertile ground for life anewcoming throught the plagues caused by the broken ecosystems and among the difficulties tapped by the human intervention we give for granted, it sets up a perfect place for the second half of the book, in which civilization begins again, necessarily different of how it came about in the first place, offering us exciting reflections on how we are and how we'd be, on values and life and growth, we age with the original characters, and by the time Ish is an old man we can see this new world throught the eyes af an old man, we understand and are subjected to the same hoplesness as him in the development of the new world, yet the hope of life, free of our cultural bagages and preconceptions, grows and leaves you a great aftertastean incredible novel, terribly underrated, which should be cherished and shared","Several reviews have noted what they call the essential pessimism of the book: Man Has Fallen, Civilization Is No More, etc. Well, yes, that is all there. But what is also there is a profound triumph of the human spirit: Civilization is Dead - Long Live Civilization. I will NOT spoil the ending, but book ends with a rebirth - an obvious societal pregnancy if you will - of a new civilization, one profoundly in keeping with the new conditions of their brave renewed world.One can imagine a sequel, and I wish Stewart ahd written one!I first read this book almost 50 years ago, and have re-read it multiple times. It is one of the best \"transition\" books ever written. I recommend it on several levels.","An astonishing science fiction novel in the apocalyptic vein, written in 1949, and despite a surprisingly few dated references, a story that remains both entertaining and relevant. In the beginning, protagonist Isherwood Williams (with the unfortunate nickname of \"Ish\") is one of the few survivors of a virus that wipes out a majority of the human population. Ish is in his twenties, an over-educated outsider, who stands on the margins of society analyzing and contemplating what he sees. After a solo excursion across the county and returning to the Bay Area, California, he slowly joins up with an assortment of characters, and becomes the de facto leader of \"The Tribe\". The struggles that confront them are meticulously well thought out and explicated by the author while rarely dragging down the narrative. The slow decay of an industrial society with no one left to manage it and the natural environment no longer held at bay serve as the antagonists. There are no sci-fi pulp orientated elements such as giant mutant killer ants (for better or worse). Threatening the Tribe are scourges of rats, wild dogs, and other animals, as various species overpopulate until starvation brings their numbers down again. There are outbreaks of disease to be dealt with and wild brush fires caused by dead trees no longer cleared away. The novel deftly provides details such as what happens to the plumbing when city reservoirs dry up and fall into disrepair. The real strength of the book, however, is how Ish is forced to confront what knowledge and wisdom needs to be passed on to the future generations in order to rebuild society. Hence with his intelligent introspective nature, interwoven into this entertaining story are thoughtful reflections on what purposes societies serve, what they protect us from, and even what they blind us to and cause us to take for granted. This is a timeless classic our own civilization would be mistaken to let slip into the \"out-of-print\" abyss.","Well almost everything has been already written about this book but I have one new curiosity not yet mentioned by anybody. In fact it's this curiosity that caused me to only give it a three star rating. To enjoy this book I had to believe that the handful of survivors world wide all loss basic curiosity. I can understand the total grief, the total denial and complete loss of the few who survive. I cannot understand the total and complete loss of curiosity. All around the survivors they have the tools, the machines and all the books but nobody has any interest in them. The leader of the survivors gives only lip service to the books but does nothing to really grow from them. Nor does he use them to learn the psychology of how to motivate his tribe. He only once attempts to do anything and at that it's only an after thought. He comes up with an idea that sparks the survivors into thinking about rebuilding a jeep but that's all. Aside from this his tribe cares about nothing. His tribe lives only day to day but seem forever lost in the now and blind, uncaring and unwilling to look to the past and what it can offer to help then survive in the future. The author never mentions curiosity or its loss in any of the timeline that the book traverses. It's as if curiosity never was part of humankind. All in all, I could enjoy the book without curiosity but it left me wondering what if it had included it in the story.","This is the 'end of the world as we know it' novel that all others are compared to. Even though it was written in the 1940's (copyright 1949) it is timeless, not aged at all, a great literary work.It all starts when the main character, Ish, is bitten by a rattlesnake and laid up in a remote cabin, unconscious for an extended period of time, while, unknown to him, a plague destroys over 99% of the population. There begins a superb story of the trials and adventures of one man, and eventually a small group of people, as they battle nature and themselves, and attempt to re-establish civilization. This is one of those rare novels where characterization and plot and setting all mesh together into one beautifully written yarn, that after reading it, you will never forget it, it is that powerful. If there ever existed the proverbial page turner, this is it. Of course, being written in the 1940's no mention is made of personal computers, CD players, and the like, but if civilization was gone these most likely would be of little use anyway.The philosophy and human interest angles contained in this book are well done. The scenes and descriptions of the demise of civilization and peoples' reactions to it, depicted by Stewart, seem very realistic. Your heart will be with the characters of this book when you read it.","Earth Abides is a thought provoking look at how the world would go if almost all people were eliminated from the picture. Some very interesting looks at the eco-structure, reformation of small societies and how they would interact from the short term to the long term. The book has some very sad and touching aspects that help you relate to the characters. The technology is a little outdated because of when the book was written but you can get past that. Overall, a very good book. One I would think in a few years I might like to read again.If you liked &quot;The Stand&quot;, and have wondered what would might happen 50 years afterwards. This is the book for you.","I have been looking for this book for a long time. I read this book for an Environmental Science class at Long Beach State about 20 years ago and it made such an impact on my thinking about the environment. Every time I see grass growing up through the cracks in the street or the roots wrapping around pipes I think of the book. While the environment seems quite fragile, it appears that it is not a fragile as we think and we are the fragile ones.","Let's start with the book's obvious problems. First, the author is a creature of his times -- the 1940's, and his views relect those times. He is paternalistic towards African Americans and women, and he feels that people without much formal education are not very smart or capable. Second, his main character, Ish, is not likeable; he is lazy, selfish, unloving (for the most part), rather anti-social, inflexible, and egotistical. (I am not sure that the author intended Ish to be unlikeable, as Ish is also a creature of his times.) Third, the author's view of the post-apocalytic world does not ring true; even given the dolts that the author has chosen to survive this catastrophe, surely more of the modern world would have survived -- at least for a few generations. (Example [MILD SPOILER]: would middle-class Americans ever decide not to teach their children to read? If there ever were a group of people who needed to know how to read, it would be this new generation!) Fourth, I do not find the biology/physics of this new world to be believable. (Example: where did all of the bodies go?) Fifth, the \"mother earth\" motif that runs throughout the book is hackneyed -- though, in fairness, it might have been fresh in the 1940's.Still, I liked the book. It is a book of ideas dressed up as a post-apocalyptic tale. What does it mean to be human? How does one balance the needs of the group against the needs of the individual? What is culture? What aspects of life/culture have value? What is love? What role should religion play in society? What role should education play? How does one go on after a devastating loss? How can people relate across generational lines? Can one generation truly lead another? What is happiness? What skills in life are most important? When is violence justified? What does death mean? How does one motivate and lead others? What does \"fun\" mean? How do small group dynamics play out? What function do rituals and symbols play in life? How do cultures adjust to rapid change?I did not usually agree with the author's answers to these questions (when he provided them), but they did challenge me. I have thought a lot about the book since completing it.","I agree with another reviewer who said it is a measure of this book's greatness that I still think of it now, fifty years after I read it.Fire, by the same author, is also unforgettable.This from a guy who can re-read a mystery he read three years earlier and not remember who done it.","A horrible disease sweeps the planet in days, killing just about everyone. Isherwood Williams is for some reason spared from this plague, and finds himself a survivor in a barren society. The book follows the course of his life, and that of other survivors, as they live out their days in a new world.My opinions ran wild with this book. For reason I will explain further along in the review, I started out very much enjoying the book, then my interest waned, and finally something clicked into place in my pea-sized brain, allowing me to finish the book on a strong note.I found it very easy to step into the mind of Ish. He reacted in a way to his situation that I felt was very natural, while learning how to cope with life alone. I don't want to give much of the plot away, but roughly the first third of the book deals with Ish's life alone. Ish starts out as something of a loner and a worrier, and seems to adjust to the world...for a while. Soon, he becomes desperate for a purpose, and with that notion, sets out to find out \"what happened\".Later, Ish struggles with his own weaknesses while trying to decide how to save the future. Through it all, Stewart keeps the characters consistant. I found it refreshing that he didn't try to thrust someone into the heroic role. For whatever reason, this earned him a good amount of credibility with me.A note on the writing style; I believe this book was written in 1949, so the flow of the book seemed a little odd to me. Some of the conversations just didn't flow well, and I chalked that up to the age of the book. On the other hand, Stewart's timeline fit right in with the world we live in today, and did not really date the book. Except maybe for spraying DDT around like it was air freshener.Around the middle of the book, I started to lose interest. I guess for me the story sort of bogged down with Ish trying, and consistantly failing, to get his people to try to focus on the finer things in life. As I said earlier, when things finally \"clicked\" for me, I found myself appreciating this part of the book more, as it fit in very well with who Ish was and what his purpose was.The ending was just magnificant. I very much felt what Ish was feeling, and clearly saw that he had finally accepted that things were going to work out for his decendants, even if things didn't turn out exactly as he had planned. I can't stress enough how good of a job Stewart did with the ending.This is not an action novel, and at points did become a bit too philosophical for it's own good. For me, it all came together at the end, but it might turn some people off. Also, as mentioned above, the writing style can seem a little strange, but overall this book shot far up my favorites list. This book easily get's five stars from me.","This book Earth Abides by George R. Stewart is about a man who passes by a massive disease which basically obliterates the US. This man, Ish, has to come to realization of this huge crisis and try to find survivors. It goes on and on about his thoughts and shows the struggles that he faces it the horrid situation. He goes around america finding survivors and ends up making a huge family in the end.This book was basically boring and depressing because it was just lagging on and on about how he thought of everything. It made you want to fall fast asleep at times too. (something that i obviously did) I am one of those kind of people who likes adventure and this book had none. It just was one of those books that wanted to show how horrible things could happen to us if we don't watch it. It sort of chilling and makes you depressed to think that it could happen. George R. Stewart was probably giving a good message out when he wrote this, but in the sense that people want to live there lives without this catastrophe, it is not very good.I would not recommend this book to kids under the age of 12 because it probably is too advanced for them. Also because kids do not have to worry about this sort of horror happening to them at that young of an age. People who need to sleep at night and want to fall asleep fast, please read. If you like adventure and mystery in a book, please go find a different book.","The book earth abides was about a man who passes up a massive disease that spreads throughout america and basically obliterates it. It has this man, Ish, come to realization of this huge crisis and shows his struggles to find civilization. As he searches through america he finds out that many other people have survived the catastrophe and he starts to make a family. As the book goes on it shows the will of human survival and the horror of this situation.I thought that the book was a little too slow. I am sort of a adventure book reader and this book had slim to none. It just went on about Ish's thoughts for like 2 chapters at a time. It made you want to just fall asleep everytime u read it. It was dull most of the times, but it does make you think how bad it would be if that sort of thing happened to the country.I would say that this book would not be very appealing to young kids because it is too advanced for them. I would recommend this to people who need to fall asleep at night definately. Also if you like to hear about the deep thoughts of a person who has no one to talk to for weeks, read this book. If you are an adventure or mystery reader who likes action, do not get this book.","\"Men come and go, but Earth abides.\" These chilling words written by George R. Stewart leave the reader feeling bare and stripped in the popular science fiction novel \"Earth Abides.\" A novel I read and still can't decide what to think about it.This book is filled with puzzling situations, frustrating moments, and mind-bending problems that make the reader ask, \"What would I do?\"Plague has struck the world, and people are dying by the millions. A lone survivor, Ish, on a mountain camping trip manages to fend off the disease with snakebite. He returns to a frozen, empty world, and is determined to find civilization and life in the seemingly dead planet. Most of the people he meets are in shock, having seen the horrors of death and destruction of the planet and are stupefied, unable to talk sense or even take care of themselves. One man Ish comes across is drinking himself to death; only eating things out of cans and seems only half-alive. Through his journey's, Ish has a growing urge to settle down and establish life as he knew it again. He alone must save the human race.I thought this book was very interesting, at first. The beginning was intriguing and exciting to think about. But after a while, the idea became old, and boring. Ish just begins to muse over the world's pathetic state, talk about how he's the only intelligent person left, and even starts to become a little snobbish to say the least. The way women were used merely as wombs, though logical in such a situation, got a little annoying also. The detail and wordiness left my mind to wonder away from the book, and I even recall something as simple as a storm drain overflowing taking up two pages to talk about. Ish's endless attempts to get people to think and work for themselves also become a bit momentous and bothersome. It really makes you want to slowly go crazy along with Ish, as you read his \"bible\", page after page of musing nonsense. I really wanted to tell him to start enjoying life and give up on trying to control everyone's thoughts and actions, just to let things go. But there were moments of truly beautiful writing and raw honesty that drew me out of the droning slump. When Ish finds something to believe in, though, it was really disappointing to have it destroyed so suddenly. Ish becomes so obsessed with saving the world, he becomes very self righteous and stuck up, he transforms from a hero into someone you are sick of and increasingly angry with. The author looses his grip on the story and turns the book into a guide of what to do if you find out the world's population has come to an end, and it's up to you, being the only truly sane and intelligent person, to save the planet. The character's personalities fade, and you are left with a bunch of names and occasional dialogue.The novel begins with a bang, and ends with a whimper, which makes the reader want to whine as well. It was not something I'd want loved ones to read, but I would highly recommend the first two hundred pages, and then move on to something else. The people who say they truly enjoyed this book through and through, in my opinion, are liars. It's a thoughtfully written piece, and deserves the recognition it receives, but if you are looking to be entertained, find another book, \"Earth Abides\" will leave you out in the cold.","It's amazing how despite half a century of technological advancement the Earth Abides is largely just an expanded version of the Red Plague by John Steinbeck.","Good story, but a bit unbelievable. Characters reasonably developed.Mostly clean, no gratuitous sex or violence, but some crude language.","Excellent book.. Highly recommend it. Very well written. Takes you through generations. a great read!","Dated but thought provoking aptly describes this novel. Set in post-nuclear holocaust America. excellent.","earth abides may have been original when it came out a zillion years ago but it's dated now and can't compete with stories being written today. the hero is some boob who survives the plague only by stepping on a rattlesnake? wow. and then he can't even teach children to read. why not? there are some good moments here and there, but in the end this book is a yawn.","The idea of an apocalyptic end of our planet and of humankind has always been extremely prevalent in society. From religion to movies, theories of annihilation can be found everywhere. But few books attempt to tackle the subject of life after the end. I think George Stewart wrote this book in the 60's and I wanted to see what his ideas were on that subject. The premise was great, but I was extremely disappointed with Earth Abides because Stewart brings in many themes/ideas but never goes into any of them in any detail whatsoever. There is absolutely no emotional connection with any of the characters,and even less so with Ish, the main character. I felt like I was waiting for something to happen throughout the book, and it never came. The author attempts to tackle way too many &quot;big&quot; subjects at the same time, and in the end,he fails. The only reason I gave this book even one star is because the reader can learn about how the world may deteriorate in the future when man is no longer here.One could say that that is a positive thing.","Some good ideas. Some interesting speculations on the nature of man and society. Some interesting predictions of how the earth would respond to a die-off of humans. Ruined by needless wordiness, 2 dimensional characters and very little to say of a philosophical nature. A bore and a disappointment. Skimmed the last 100 pages.","EARTH ABIDES is such an amazing book. In fact, I happened to keep my high school copy rather than returning it before graduation. Deep down, I think my teacher knew and was happy to take the loss.I have three books that I will not part with - EARTH ABIDES, THE STAND, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. EARTH ABIDES and THE STAND have a lot in common. I am surprised, as were others, by all of those who gave this book such a low rating.The story tells the tale of a college student, Ish, who is working on his thesis up in the mountains. He gets bitten by a rattlesnake and heads to lower ground for help only to discover the human population has been wiped out thanks to some weird plague. The story becomes Ish's quest to live as supposedly the last human on earth.First, I want to clarify that this book was written in the 1940s. Those who complained about the writing being poor, one guy even said the book was written in the 60s and he is wrong, need to look at the times. The world in the 1940s was far different to today. If you cannot adapt to the language differences, skip this book. While I find it rather narrowminded, I also understand the world is full of people who just can't stand something that is different to the norm.In the 1940s, they didn't have the computers, men were working away from their family farms, they'd become used to modern technology, so it isn't surprising that Ish would have allowed so many things to slip by for decades. If the world ended tomorrow how many can honestly say they would know how to irrigate their crops? How many even know how to garden?At heart, EARTH ABIDES needs to be viewed with the consideration of the differences in time. It is and always will be my favorite book.","I am a 62 year old grandmother who has read hundreds of books, but no book ever moved me like this one. It is the story of one thoughtful, intelligent young man spared during a world wide epidemic that wiped out most of the population. While we always expect that the end will come with a bomb that distroys everything, this time, all the infrastructure was left intact. The plants and animals that had evolved to be dependent on humans also succumbed and Mr. Stewart deals with this in a remarkable and sensitive way. Today human beings have brought civilization to the brink, but this book reminds us that no matter what, the Earth Will Abide.","However, if you want Mad Max or his clones go elsewhere. Since I read this book back in grade school it has always been on my shelf, in fact I usually have 2, one personal copy and one copy to give to friends. I read many of the reviews of this book and wonder if some of these people read the same book. To me Earth Abides is one of the most uplifting books ever written. This book shows that no matter what comes, life and happiness will happen. No matter all Ish's failings to teach his people, his Greatgrandchildern are happy, they do not miss what they never knew. He teaches them to survive and they will teach themselves the rest. Again I say if you are looking for an actionpacked end of the world book I would recommend Daybreak-2250 A.D. by Andre Norton. However if you want one of the best books written that will make you think about humanity and all its failings and gifts, READ THIS BOOK! I just wish I could have given it 15 stars instead of just 5.","Ish, a college student, survives a rattlesnake bite and mysterious illness alone on a mountain camping trip. When he recovers, he can't find anyone and slowly realizes a plague has wiped out the human race. He wanders across the country, finding only a few stunned survivors and makes an intelligent and courageous decision to not join the first people he finds. After a period of terrible isolation, he finds Em, a true survivor like himself. They are happy together and attract five other survivors. A tiny little tribe grows around them. Ish devotes his life to trying to bring back civilization as he knew it. He fails at his superficial efforts at farming and at educating the children. He succeeds beyond his deepest dreams at giving his descendants the tools they need to create a healthy, happy way of life. The novel works as a thought-provoking study of what do you do when the world collapses around you. It has some weaknesses. Here and there, the fact it was written in 1949 shows. One can argue that Ish would have been able to get the children to read if only he hadn't been such a boring pedant and he could have been a better farmer if he'd been willing to explore alternate ways and crops. The book's strengths greatly outweigh its weaknesses. For one thing, with not much action, it's a true page turner. This is a fantastic novel to discuss and to argue about and to ponder the fundamental question it raises. What would you do for the rest of your life if you survived the end of the world?","First off, I should state that this novel was written in the late forties, and thus reflects many of the prevailing attitudes of the time. It is rather sexist, and even vaguely racist (although neither element is malicious, just ignorant) so if you think that may ruin the novel for you, then you probably want to skip it. That said, if you can look at \"Earth Abides\" in the context in which it was written, you will find a thoughtful, entertaining novel.\"Earth Abides\" is predicated on a super-virus wiping out the overwhelming majority of the Earth's human population, while leaving the rest of the animal kingdom unaffected (at least directly). The story follows \"Ish\" as he struggles both to survive, and come to grips with the loss of civilization. Over time, a community of survivors gels around him, and they work to scratch an existence out of the ruins of San Francisco.Stewart takes a rather bleak view of the survivors of the holocaust, not to mention their children. Rather than trying to reestablish \"civilization\" they slip into a more or less Stone Age existence, supplemented by the leavings of a culture they are completely alienated from, and that is not understood by the children at all. While I understand that Stewart was seeking to comment on what makes up a \"civilization\", and what the natural human condition is, or should be, I think he introduced an element of wishful thinking into his narrative (strange as that may sound). It is extremely unlikely that things as fundamental as literacy would completely disappear within two generations, and while they might very well fail, I suspect that survivors would at least attempt to maintain electricity, water supplies, etc.Where this novel really shines, and what I found most interesting to read, was Stewart's descriptions of the ecology of a North America largely depopulated of humans. He does a superb job of predicting the fluctuations in various animal populations, and I believe that the long-term balance that he predicts is probably not far from what would actually happen.Ultimately, \"Earth Abides\" is an entertaining novel that leaves one thinking about how they would react in similar situation. While I don't necessarily agree with the way the novel plays out, I was constantly challenged to come up with an explanation as to why I thought things might be different. In the process, I gained a deeper appreciation for the depth of Stewart's characters, and the challenges he pitted them with. If you enjoy \"apocalyptic fiction\" this is definitely a book for you, but even if you have not strong feelings for the genre, I suspect you will enjoy the excellent characterizations, thoughtful story and wonderfully realized world.","This book attempts to answer the age old question, \"what will earth be like without humans?\". In a word, BORING, just like this novel. Don't get me wrong, there are some great parts to this novel with real drama and action and intrigue and heart-wrenching feeling. Unfortunately, those parts are few and far between, and they are between mountains of tedium and monotony. I will give George R. Stewart credit for doing his homework scientifically, historically, culturally, etc, and I have no doubt that if a horrible plague ever wiped out nearly all of the human race, this is probably a really accurate depiction of what would occur. However, and this is why i give this book such a low rating, there is a vast difference between writing an accurate book and an entertaining one. In many ways this book is very similar to other post apocalyptic novels like The Stand, The Road, The Book of Eli, On the Beach, etc etc etc, however, where those novels shine and where this novel falls flat is in the art of story-telling. Basically, this novel has no story other than the mere survival of the last remaining humans. There is no plot, no antagonist (unless you count harsh nature herself), no great task to complete, no long journey to take, and no lesson to be learned. When gone is the human race, the earth and everything on it will still be here, and in the closing words of the author, \"Humans come and go, but the Earth Abides.\"","I really enjoyed this novel from the apocalyptic genre very much. It was not a fantasy good versus evil type of story but rather a speculative look at how civilization might fare if there was a sudden die-off of 99% of the population. In this story there is a sudden plague of such devastating severity that nearly everyone is dead within a couple of weeks of its outset. This book does not focus on the plague or the sufferings of the infected and dying people. No grisly oozing bodies are found in these pages and very little trauma or grief. We enter the picture shortly after the dust has settled, so to speak. The story is not about the plague but about its aftermath. It is told from the perspective of one man who survives and traces his experiences as he goes in search of other survivors and finally settles back in his native California and makes the foundation of a new \"tribe\" of civilized human beings. This book was written in 1949 so it is doubly interesting because it not only gives us a look at the author's speculation about the factors that make up civilization and the interesting trials and successes that might arise, but it also gives us an amazing look at the huge changes that have taken place in our consciousness just in the short period of years since it was written. It has the unexpected bonus of actually confirming some of the points the story originally was designed to suggest. Even though the author seems as though he was an open-minded, perhaps even liberal thinker, the book contains ridiculous racial stereo-types, as well as skewed ideas about the personhood of mentally disabled people and also of women. Women are shown as being entirely domestic and dependent. Cigarette smoking is still very much a happy pastime in this brave new world and is enjoyed by men and their pregnant wives without a care in the world. When a plague of ants becomes a problem the main character, Ish, sprays himself and his pregnant wife down thoroughly with DDT, a substance that is used several times in the surviving world to overcome pests. I found these old-fashioned ideas very interesting when coming from a \"reasonable\" man that no one of his time would have considered to be prejudiced. The book is a thought-provoking page-tuner. I kept imagining that I would have done things in a much different way from the main character but I found the ideas and reasoning to be essentially sound and worth contemplating. This is an interesting look at how the Earth might rid herself of the virus called mankind and is certainly a good look at the power of her self-healing capabilities. I definitely recommend this book.","I first read this book when I was 8 years old. My dad had left it out and I grabbed it up and read it. Even at 8 years old I found this book gripping and thought provoking. As I grew older I would find a copy and read it, and each time I would gain something new from reading this book. I am 45 years old now and I am feeling the urge to read it again. I think the reason why the survivors did not \"rebuild civilization\" was because they were all in shock--their whole world (friends, lovers, children) had been wiped off the face of the earth almost overnight. If you add to this the author's stated premis that the survivors were mostly average to dull, then the story makes more sense. I recommend this book to anyone, it's a sci-fi classic. I also think the movie \"The Omega Man\" might have been inspired by this book.","Many reviewers here expected something different, I think. They are dismayed.They have all the elements properly arranged but do not see how they add up. Ishi characterizes himself as intelligent and the others as inferior to him in cognitive ability, yet he fails in almost all his undertakings.At the first sign of trouble he goes home and sleeps in his boyhood bedroom, then returns there and takes up a permanent residence in the old home place -- this infantile reversion is culture-shock but he can't see it. He is supposedly trained in ecology but is taken by surprise every time the local ecology adjusts itself to mankind's absence -- this emphasizes the futility of a college education in a survival situation. He carries a prejudice against negroes yet marries a mulatto and doesn't even realize it at first -- his blindness extends deeply within him. He tries to educate the youngsters but cannot hold their interest -- he is too disconnected from their reality. He has in front of him all the ingredients for success -- yet fails on his own terms, which are unreal.And yet, he does succeed, doesn't he? In spite of himself he does manage to attract a group which survives and stays together. Gradually over the course of his life he becomes ever-farther removed from reality, while the children take over the lead. They develop the skills they need to live in the new world almost while Ishi is not looking -- they become \"wild Indians\" wearing skins and shooting arrows.Ishi was the name given to the last member of a tribe of California Indians, the Yahi. In 1911 he was brought in by white society and nursed back to health by the Kroebers, with whom he lived. The Kroebers were a university couple, anthropologists. Their daughter Ursula was born in 1929 and grew up with Ishi in the house. Ursula's married name is LeGuin; she has won many awards for her science fiction. (Google 'Ishi' and see.)Ishi also is the short form of Ishmael, a name for the Wandering Jew of legend; Melville's \"Moby Dick\" begins with the sentence, \"Call me Ishmael.\"In short, Ishi is sort of the Dagwood of survivalists. Arnold Schwartzenegger would not star in the film version. Despite his shortcomings and failures, life actually does go on. In fact he is a lot like you and me. How well do we know ourselves? How well do our everyday decisions turn out? Once Ishi says to heck with it and lets things slide, things get better just like in real life.Stewart's genius was to place these things before us and then get out of the way. He has placed hints in the text, the italicized passages which give us objective truth, sandwiched between Ishi's misadventures. What he is saying is, in despite of ourselves, Earth Abides.If you enjoy the subject, try Walter Miller's \"Canticle for Leibowitz\", or Clifford Simak's \"City\" or David Brin's \"The Postman.\"Dave","I enjoyed this one. It is a very good read and certainly gives us some food for thought. We do need to remember when this one was written as to social attitudes, etc., but if we keep this in mind, it is good. I suppose you could read the book for it's social commentary, relate it to unspellable philosophical stances, blah, blah, blah, as one reviewer did, or you can read it for a very nice story to read on a rainy weekend. I enjoyed it, will probably read it again and highly recommend it.","As I write this, negative reviews of this novel (one or two star reviews) are few and far between. However, I am compelled to join the minority. I could not, in good conscience, recommend this book to anyone. Maybe one needs to be an aficionado of the \"End-of-the-World\" genre to appreciate this book, but I found it to be contrived and unrealistic. The idea that most of the population would die off due to disease, but that the book's protagonist would choose to tool around the countryside calmly musing on a variety of generally immaterial and irrelevant matters seems absurd. Also, for quite awhile, he manages to encounter ONLY unsavory or potentially dangerous fellow survivors. The entire un-dramatic tone of the book seems way out of proportion with the incredible tragedy that has befallen the earth.I very, very rarely leave a book unfinished, and will usually force myself to complete any book I start. But, as they say, \"too many books, too little time\". I could not see giving up valuable reading time on a book that offers so very little to the reader, so eventually put this book aside. For me this is the most gravely negative review I could give a book.","This novel is possibly the worst piece of drivel I've ever tried to force myself through, and I didn't make it. I quit, and honestly I almost never do that. Ish is maybe the most detestable figure I have ever had the displeasure of meeting on the page. He's a passive aggressive psycho, a terrible father and leader, and the last man you would want to rebuild civilization. In this type of scenario, anyone with any intelligence that came into contact with him would disengage quickly. I simply might have shot him for being a drain of precious resources. If the whole point centers on the fact that most or any man would fail in this situation, I would have preferred that Stewart kill off Ish in a 20 page short story.","I see many people loved this book, but having just finished it, I just don't get the appeal it has for so many people. I found it incredibly boring and tedious. I do not exaggerate when I say I spent an afternoon struggling with it, nodding off to sleep every two or three paragraphs. To his credit, Stewart raises a number of issues about science and human nature, but it is done in the context of an uneventful story. The first book in years that almost made me abandon it halfway through, but I fought it out to the end. I remained disappointed.","Wow I can't remember the last time I started to hope something bad would happen to the main character in a story. Worst main character in a book ever. Annoying, Lazy, sexist, racist, boring and anti-religionist. Maybe it was the slow story line. Maybe it was the fact that NOTHING happens to the characters after the first 100 pages. I don't know. But I hate this book. I felt like yelling \"Get up and do something!!\" The power goes out and he sits. The streets start to flood and he sits. The water stops running and he sits!! Then he starts to think of himself as a god!! haha. The best part of the book is the end. Why? (spoiler)he dies and you don't have to read anymore.Sorry to ramble but my mind is cloudy now from finishing that \"book\".Do not buy this book. Get it from the library read the first 75 pages then take it back.","This book is dull, slow, and predictable. I read most of it hoping that it would pick up but it never did. I usually like these type of disaster books too. Lucipher's Hammer is ten times better than this one. I really have no idea how this book could have 5 stars.","Having skimmed the other reviews, it seems that one had to read this book as a young person and use those glowing memories to enjoy it. Since I approached the book fresh, the flaws are glaring.The main character, Ish, is pretty dull. There isn't much dialogue in the book, so most speech is communicated through his hearing others and describing what they meant. Since he's not particularly insightful, reading is slow and the pages creep by.Civilization seems completely lost despite the fact that books, machines, etc. remain intact. Ish rules The Tribe, who are a step or so above a Neanderthal group. They even walk from place to place like hunter-gathers. How about using the million and one bicycles laying around if you can't figure out how to get gas for a car?The book is not poorly written, just improbable and boring.","The concept of how civilization slowly succumbs to the forces of nature was an interesting concept. That part of the novel was very good. Ish the main character of the book was the leader of a small community of survivors. He sees himself as the most intelligent of them all and for some reason wants to keep it that way. He locks up a library and only he has access to it. Once children are born and old enough to go to school he cancels it, no children of the new world learn to read. Nobody seems to want to become self-sufficient but relies on the products of a past civilization. A stranger comes to join them and Ish murders him out of jealously that his role might be challenged. From then on he carries the hammer he killed the stranger with, with him all the way to his death. No interest was ever sparked by anyone to learn to read, farm, make things or anything else. Everyone lives off of canned goods for 20+ years. I won't say anything more in case the reader of this has not read the book and would like too. Ultimately I was disappointed but would recommend it anyway.","Earth Abides is a book about no matter what happens to the race of people, Earth will always abide. A Man named Isherwood Williams somehow survives this fatal virus that is going around killing the whole human population. Ish then spends almost the rest of his life driving across the country searching for survivors. When he finally meets a group of survivors he \"marries\" one of them and has about twenty children with her.Ish does find a few survivors, however it was definitely not enough to keep me interested in finishing the book. I thought this book was long, drawn out and sometimes too boring. If George R. Stewart, the author, would have spiced it up a bit with more science fiction things happening. For instance if more abnormal things happening to the humans than just death like it was a flesh eating virus and then something else happened with the virus. The genre of the book is Science Fiction. The plot this author had in mind was a god idea however if it was only about one hundred pages shorter and the ending with the twenty children was cut then it would have been easier to keepinterest.So all in all the book had very few parts that could have beenedited out and still would have made sense. The idea of the book and the plot of the book was good. I like the little reality the book had in it. Again if there were more science fiction, and less pages, it also might have been better. So that is why I gave the book a measly two stars out of five. I think this a reasonable amount and I commend the author on his work. I would recomend this book to someone who loves to read and is interested in books about little science fiction and little reality.","The protagonist is arrogant, lazy and stupid. He likes to sit around smoking cigarettes and thinking about how much smarter he is than all the other survivors while his wife cooks him meals and takes care of his children. He doesn't bother to teach his children to read, and he doesn't bother to learn anything medical or mechanical or any other potentially useful skills in a post-apocalyptic world. At one point he runs across some other survivors who are Black, and he thinks about how he could stay and \"be king\" of them because he is white. The ultimate self-absorbed old white man fantasy.","If almost all the people in the world were dead, and you had to spend your life with an egotistical, chauvanistic, racist white guy with absolutely no redeeming qualities you'll love this. Archie Bunker would have loved this guy. I, did not.Old does not have to be disfunctional.","Though it feels a little dated having been written over four decades ago, &quot;Earth Abides&quot; deserves its place with great 1950s era end-of-the world books like &quot;On the Beach&quot; and &quot;Day of the Triffids.&quot; The scenario is similar to the one Stephen King used in &quot;The Stand&quot; though the plague wipes out a much larger number of people and there is little spiritualism here. What affected me most was the latter part which shows the years passing in the life of the main survisor. I rarely get emotional while reading, but this story did it to me.","Global plague vectored through air travel has beenfeatured in recent films, television specials, andthe news. Set between the European Black Death ofthe late 1600s and this decade's African Ebola,Earth Abides deals with the hope, struggles, andresignation of modern-day plague survivors. Withfewer than one percent of the world's populationsurviving, how would you fare? What wisdom wouldyou pass on to those younger than you? The Centerfor Disease Control intimates that world-wideplague is more a question of When, rather than If.So... how do we begin the day after?Over the years, I've read this provocative bookseveral times, and have enjoyed it more each time.For those who enjoy Crichton's works(Jurassic Park, Congo, or Eaters of the Dead),Earth Abides is a rare find. Kay O'Cullane.","Stewart did an excellent job of putting your hand on thehammer! Classic tale of &quot;What if I were the last man onearth?&quot; Best read out loud at least twice in your lifetime.","I dont write too many reviews any more and I dont want to make this into a flame session but let me get this right Corie (from your review).The book is literally about the last man on earth, and you're indifferent to the character's guarded and self preserving manner. I think you are completely out of sync with the theme, let alone the character. This is a brutally honest portrayal of a human being (with all his short comings) in the wake of oblivion. Not a butterfly in the midst of smoke. It's a reactionary tale, one of struggle and survival. You seem to see it as moment for liberation and righteousness. If anything Corie, you have imposed yourself on this character, in the same vain you speak of.This is the individual, warts and all, and merely hating him does not render this book yucky.As for the racial tone that you claim, as quoted by Powell Timothy \"...its revolutionary (for the time) treatment of racial issues was particularly powerful in the mid-20th century when the book was published, and influenced many contemporary artists, most famously Jimi Hendrix. \"Earth Abides\" was Hendrix's favorite novel, and inspired some of the songs on his first album\"Perhaps, if some of you better relate to decisive characters, you should watch the post apocalyptic TV soap drama, 'Jericho' instead. There you will find your cliche depictions of heroes and villians.","Okay let me tell you how I really feel. WOW!!!I hesitated to buy this book after hearing it did not have much end of the world violence, no undead or lots of dead and has a more clean antiseptic air about it. They were correct but what it lacked in that area was more then made up in the quality and depth of the characters and the uncanny ability of the main character Ish to pull you into the story and carry you along in his experiences. I would compare Earth Abides to a movie from the 30's or 40's where there was more dialog and depth as opposed to many of today's films/books based more on spectacular visual effects and lots of gore but lacking in most every other area and are soon forgotten.(And I like some of those books and movies).Earth Abides has a much stronger human touch or bond as you see Ish from a young man dealing with a plaque that wiped most of humanity away and his final death at old age. What transpired between youth and death for Ish is something I guarantee you will remember for the rest of your life. I have read numerous Sci Fi books and rarely has any reached a level comparable to Earth Abides. This book is a keeper that I will definitely read again in the future.","This book reaches across time and avoids the technology trap. It hits home in many circumstances and is an excellent read. I liked its energy and symbolism. It avoids being grim and actually gives you hope for a disastrous future.","A worldwide virus has killed off nearly all the world's population. Ish starts exploring a world with no rules and few people. He finds some other people and they form &quot;The Tribe&quot; to restart their civilasation. Interesting book, and it actually survives pretty well considering how long ago it was written. There are very few passages in the book that date it significantly.","Earth Abides by George Stewart is one of many post-apocalyptic novels written during the height of the Cold War. However it is quieter and more introspective than most of its peers, something made evident by the manor of disaster that devastates mankind in the novel. Instead of a nuclear inferno, a viral plague almost eradicates humanity. Isherwood &quot;Ish&quot; Williams is trapped in an isolated cabin recovering from a snakebite when the epidemic is unleashed. When he heals and ventures outward, he discovers the near extinction of his species and begins a search for others who immune to the disease.That section is interesting but Earth Abides becomes a truly outstanding novel when Ish discovers others and they found a new society. Stewart takes a sociological approach to this development. He gives a fascinating account of a community completely isolated from other communities and a generation living in a Garden-of-Eden-state, completely isolated from its own past. One of the novel's best moments occurs when an untrustworthy visitor comes to the area and Ish and the other elders must decide what action to take. Their decision will surprise you. Both in the post-apocalyptic genre and the field of science fiction in general, Earth Abides is a gem.","I 1960, I was nine years old, I remember staying up all night during summer vacation to finish it, I still love this book!","I found this book totally by happy accident, and it remains one of my all-time favorites. What is chilling is that the basic premise of the book is quite possible and believable, given diseases like Ebola that are out there. He gave real-life examples of other species that became overpopulated, and then were nearly wiped out by a plague. What is man but another species of animal on this planet, and we are not immune--look at the Black Plague, for example. A truly unique look at what might happen to the earth if we are nearly wiped out, and what might happen to the people left to survive afterward. A great read!","The start of this novel was magical for me - so engrossing and so convincing. But then it descends into the comfortable and the suburban. Is this the fate of all human communities? More disappointing was the ugliness of some decisions made by the community - and for me these were far from inevitable or even justifiable. These were presaged on p132 of the SF Masterworks edition - '... except for Evie, the half-witted one, who should never be allowed to have children.' How attitudes have changed since 1949 when this book was written!","This book is about what is wrong with us as humans. The beginning of the book is very interesting as the main character, drives around the country to see what is left in the aftermath of the disease that has wiped out most of the population. After that the book goes downhill. The characters are not that likable. The children are brats, and the adults lack the conviction to make them better people. The items which are in the story aren't realistic (it is very unlikely that gas would not be usable after 20+ years even if stored well), and overall the story just wasn't very interesting to me.","Was disappointed in this book. Expected there to be more action and survivors to be more aggressive in making a better life for themselves. In my opinion people would not act this way in a disaster. They would try to make things better.","This is one of my favorite books of all time and one of the few books that I can re-read. Oddly enough I almost find at times I want to live in the horrible world that is created in the story. Maybe that says more about me than it does about the book though.","I have read this book several times over the years, I really favor this type of fiction (science?) This book is so well written it has stood up to the test of time, as good as any newer fiction of the same genera. Give this book a chance, you won't be sorry. You don't have to buy it, I saw a couple of copies in my local library, I'll bet most full size librarys have a copy. Happy reading.","I loved this book from front to back. Its a beautiful story with characters you can invest in. I have passed it around to many friends and they agree its moving.","This book stands the test of time! A great survival/end of the world book that entertains as much as WWZ (without zombies). Like \"I Am Legend\", Earth Abides tells a great tale of survival of a lone man on earth (without vampires). Love the progression/deterioration of the man made world described here as well as how society evolves. Epic in scope this book covers an entire lifetime, not just a few months or years. I've read this several times and will again one day I'm sure.","Apparently, Amazon shows when a book was last published in the details section, but not when the work was first published. Earth Abides was written in the 40s or 50s.It's an interesting read, but coming with 21st century sensibilities, with ideas of the horrifying chaos and violence should civilization fall from the likes of 2012 (the movie) or Stephen King's The Stand, Earth Abides seems very pastoral and unrealistic. I won't spoil it with too much detail, but two examples are 1) one character is able to drive from California to New York after 99% of humanity had perished. Wouldn't the roads be full of abandoned cars? 2) There's no horrifying killings, rapes, cannibalism, robbery, diseases among the survivors ... something that we know does happen when authority breaks down from real wars in Africa and elsewhere, but in this novel, the only dangers are from failing electricity and running water.I'm not being fair. Stewart is probably reflecting the more naive era of the 1940s or 50s. The book does flow very nicely and I especially LOVE the very nostalgic and melancholic last few chapters of the book.","One of the handful of true classics in the Apocalyptic genre that are Must reads. This account follows a survivor in a post-pandemic world that decimated the human race as he seeks out other survivors and begins to rebuild. Excellent read from page one!!! Solid and believable story line, great characters, and very entertaining! Includes \"year zero!\"","I love the apocolypse genre - so thought provoking, and Earth Abides is one of the best I've read so far. I was surprised I'd never heard of it before seeing someone on a message board mention it. I decided to give it a try, and am so glad I did. This has now been moved into my books to read again, and that really doesn't happen often.I didn't realize how long ago this had been written until the main character described going into a house and sitting down to rest on the \"davenport\" - how long has it been since we heard that term?Really though, the premise is such that it really doesn't matter when the book was written. The same thought provoking situations occur. Highly recommend.","Long ago, when I was about 12, I read a book by George Stewart called Fire. I remember enjoying this book. When I came across The Earth Abides last year I remembered thinking that I might enjoy this one based on my prior experience with his earlier book. Besides I liked the title. Well my enthusiasm started to wane after reading the first 100 pages or so. I started to think that perhaps my taste had changed in the intervening decades. In Fire, I had found interesting his asides where he described the fire and its growth. Here, when he interrupted the story in an aside describing changes to the world and the decay of mankind's works, I found it distracting and thought it broke the narrative flow. Several times I found myself saying \"that is not the way people would behave\" and second guessing the author- fighting against the direction the author was taking us. I thought that perhaps the story, being written in the late `40's, was dated. However, about two-thirds of the way through the book, right about the time when a couple of the colony members were sent on a cross country trip to see what was going on in the rest of the country, I had a major change of heart. It was like a log jam breaking. I suddenly let go of my preconceptions and opened my mind up to his vision, his story. I found the story suddenly compelling and the characters believable, and the writing, while not on the level of a Saul Bellow, moving and effective. I found his description of civilization slipping backward, and the growth of the colony into a tribal, superstitious society, in contrast to the protagonist's scientific \"modern\" leanings, very powerful and imbued the story with a powerful melancholy. However, the book is not necessarily all depressing. Indeed it makes clear that mankind would survive- and the earth would abide until his eventual return. Looking back, writing in the first person was very effective. The final chapter is a beautiful and fitting ending.","I don't think I've ever read a book where the author has done more research than Stewart has done for this one. Not only did he have to do all that research, but he had to sit down and think things through: the rise and fall of ants, the mountain lions running out of food in the mountains, the sheep being lost. It was truly amazing. It also brought to light several things that would and would not happen if man were gone. Some of them are bad and some are good. Stewart gives a fair, unbiased (and likely acurate) picture of an Earth where most humans have suddenly dissappeared.","I found the premise of the book interesting and, for the most part, it was well executed. However, the characters' passivity and lack of ambition is very frustrating. The people who survived the plague seem to have lost the will to achieve! Stewart seems to deliberately portray all characters except Ish and Joey as somewhat limited, despite the fact that they actually contribute more to the continued survival of the community that the \"smart one\". Ish seems content to just go along and then regret that things haven't advanced. Ish doesn't ever seem to gain any understanding that he could have taken the initiative to broaden the scope of the community. Even in the context of the time the book was written, the women are treated as objects. There is no indication of deep thought or emotion from any of them.","I first read this book when I was a teenager and read it again last week (30 years later.) I was surprised at how much I remembered from it (I have completely forgotten books I read 6 months ago!)Of course the book is dated, it was written over 50 years ago and of course technology and social attitudes have changed. Of course the main character is flawed and of course we think we could all have done better, but wouldn't fiction be boring if every character were perfect?I loved the descriptions (in italics) of the breakdown of civillisation, about how plants and animals evolve when \"man\" dissappears.I've looked at some of the reviews for this book and am not surprised that most enlightened readers have given this book 5 stars. Neither am I surprised to see the occasional reader give it one star and to read their vehement reviews. These show that the book has worked and all its readers have strong opinions about it.","This book is with out a doubt one of the best I have ever read. Stewart portrays the end of our world, as we know it and tells the story of a man's need to survive in a world he no longer knows and trusts. This novel is not one of action and amazing death defying feats, but one of a man's introspective thoughts and of the will to live in a world that has been brought down by it's own ignorance and naivet&eacute;. This book is like a huge juicy red stake, there is almost too much meat to handle. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to think, and think seriously about what it means to be human!","A must read for fans of apocalyptic fiction. Even though it was published in 1949 nothing about the book seems dated. It deserves its ranking (by David Pringle) as one of the 100 best Sci Fi novels of all time.","I read Earth Abides the first time over 35 years ago. It is one of the few books that genuinely presents an &quot;end of civilization&quot; as we know it and does it well without a lot of fanfare. This is a discriptive story that I plan to read again.","A friend lent me this book many years ago. I loved it. But I forgot the title and author and when I recently wanted to reread it no one was able to help me. I searched and searched for it to no avail. Finally someone on a sci fi newsgroup was able to help me. This book is fascinating. It is one of my all time favorites. The author has an incredible imagination and you really believe this is what would happen if civilization were to die off. It is so full of vivid details and really makes you think.","This is a book everyone should read; a book worthy of being read over and over during a lifetime. I've read it twice and will probably read it several more times. The subject of a disastrous plague almost wiping out civilization is written in such a way that it's entirely believable. It's fascinating to see how Mr. Stewart's characters face survival. The very last part of the book is a bit confusing, but then life viewed from the point of a very old person may be very confusing.","I throroughly enjoyed reading The Earth Abides because it compelled me to consider what motivations there are for the individual to continue living. I felt the most interesting part of the book was the notion that the individual must actively define what direction his life is to take, the setting of the story added to the importance of this decision and entertained different options and the validity of those decisions.","I stumbled across this book a few decades ago when living in Japan for over a year. I was hungry for English words in a good book. It surpassed my expectations! The plot is beautifully developed and makes a surreal world believable. The human struggle and resourcesfullness was absolutely heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time. I cared so much about the outcome of the characters, I couldn't put it down! Very few books lure repeat reads like this one did. After misplacing it during my returning to the U.S., I hunted for a another copy everywhere to no avail. Finally, when it appeared in the dark corner of a small used bookstore, you would have thought I struck gold. Years later, at the end of a job interview, I was asked to name my favorite book--probably to ensure that I was cultured reader. Without hesitation, I recommended \"Earth Abides\" in full glory. The irony is that I'm not typically a science-fiction reader, leaning more toward drama and suspense. Well, that's exactly what this book offers as no other! If you have time to read only one book, make it this one!","I like reading older books, and this one certainly fits the bill as it was published in 1949.It was written in an older style with minimal dialogue. It's also written in the first person which makes it very subjective.I found Ish, the main character, at first, bland and uninteresting. But as I read he grew on me.I would recommend the book as one version of how things may evolve after a widespread plague and only a few survivors.It is well written, although in some scenes I found the dialogue a little too 'bible-ish'. I also found some plot developments a bit unrealistic. I believe it is an ingrained characteristic in humans to want to survive, to lash out at fate and try to beat it. I don't think that, as in this book, people would just give up and live off the remnants of the old world forever (or until the next generation picks up the ball). I think people would automatically try to herd cattle and sheep and try to start gardens and orchards.Another weak point is how the author seems to avoid the harder scenes in the book. When something is done about Charlie, when Joey contracts the disease and it's outcome, and when Ish's wife finally dies. All these main moments in Ish's life are avoided by skimming over them.All in all I do recommend this book, but it is not for readers wanting action. It's for readers wanting to think.I'll remember for while the passage in Chapter 2 of the last secion where we discover that Ish did make a impact on the outcome of the tribe. It reminded me that sometimes just by doing what we think is right we affect the outcome of our own immediate environment, our tribe.","Maybe today the plot of \"Earth abides\" is nothing new, but when it was written, in 1949, it surely was. Professor Stewart's only book in science-fiction quickly turned into a milestone concerning apocalyptic themes. William Brinkley's \"The last ship\", Pat Frank's \"Alas, Babylon\", Nevil Shute's \"On the beach\" and Stephen King's \"The stand\" all come to mind as having similar ideas, although each of the five books mentioned have their own characteristics and deal with the subject of \"end of human civilization\" in unique ways.\"Earth abides\" is more like a one-man chronicle. Isherwood Williams, a reclusive geology student, finds himself a survivor of an unnamed \"Great Disaster\" that has wiped out 99% of humankind. During the course of the book, Stewart tells the reader how Ish, as he calls his main character, learned to live again, without all the comforts of civilization, forming a new family, than a new community. Ish thinks of himself as \"the last american\", and Stewart explains very well why that is so.Although not overtly a \"dark\" science-fiction story - like \"On the beach\", for example -, \"Earth abides\" has a subtle way of making the reader very uneasy and impotent as he turns the pages. This book was written almost sixty years ago, but has a very modern feeling about it - not scientifically, of course, but if we think about how Man deal with his peers and with nature, Stewart's book will ring some known bells.Grade 8.7/10","I fully expected to enjoy this book. I've read piles of books in the same genre - The Stand, The Road, Plague Journals, etc. This is notably different in that there is absolutely no faith or hope - there is no striving for better, there is only just getting by.I was very put off my the narrator's belief that no one else possessed any intellect. I've met loads of blue collar workers who would have done a much better job in getting things started. I simply can't imagine a group of people who would settle for canned food instead of growing their own. Who would settle for no electricity? I can't imagine having access to a library and not researching how to start a power plant back up. There was no planning - just living day to day.I guess I have a different belief about the nature of man. And, as others stated, I don't know that the author had children or interacted with them. They are sponges and want to learn. They can be inspired - he was simply ineffective - it was his fault then that he couldn't get them motivated.","After reading Earth Abides (for the second time, in the early 1960's), I was moved to write to GRS, which I had never before done, with any author!My letter was passed on to his address via his Literary Agent in London, and arrived in San Francisco three weeks after his death.I received a treasured return letter from Theodosia Stewart, his widow, and after a few exchanges of letters, she invited me to come to San Francisco to meet her and that she would give me access to all of his notes and work in the archives at The Bancroft Library at Berkeley University.I took up this offer, and in 1985, travelled to California - my first flight!!!I have written an account, with photographs, of the people I met and the places connected with GRS, many of whom I am still in contact with, and will some day publish this account, but the above serves to show what an effect this book had on a young (38 years) englishman, to pull me across the world.The high points of my visit were meeting Theodosia (Ted) Stewart, visiting \"the house on San Lupo Drive\", and standing on the smooth slabs at Indian Rock Park.All of this came from reading \"Earth Abides\".","I hate to add a note of dissent to all the glowing reviews but this book really frustrated me. It`s not that it was badly written though I found the style a little clinical. I guess that is just a reflection of the personality of Ish, through whose eyes we see the unfolding of the years following the devastating plague. Myabe it was his character that annoyed me so much and basically put me off the book. He seemed to consider himself so superior to those about him and become almost unbalanced in his lofty plans for his favourite son. I found it hard to believe that everyone else in the community apart from him was so darn thick. I also found it very sexist, even though i know that only reflects the time it was written. The author`s attitude to race relations was dedfinitely more forward-thinking than towards women, who were mainly portrayed as baby-obsessed brood-mares. Even Em, the main female character was seen as reacting to events on an instinctual rather than intellectual level.The apathy of the community also bothered me - would people really be this unconcerned about their children`s future? Decades later and they hadn`t taught the children to read so they could learn how to do all that stuff they`d eventually need - like how to make candles, when to plant crops, how to weave fabric, etc etc. I can`t believe they were STILL living off tinned food all those years after and hadn`t even bothered to domesticate any horses or grow vegetable gardens! I prefer the English series Survivors, which I feel tackled the practicalities of having to provide and produce absolutely EVERYTHING necessary to life for yourself much better than this did.","First, as a story, the character development is poor and any drama is virtually non-existent. There are a few opportunities for drama, but in each case, the author fails to draw in the reader and make them care. Similarly, there's little to cause the reader to become invested in the characters. You could read abstracts on the characters and get as much out of them as reading the novel.Secondly, the \"hero\" is annoying and a bit contemptible, but perhaps this is the author's goal. Regardless, it made me like the story even less. In short, the hero prefers to sit around and do nothing while he complains inwardly about the dullness and laziness of his \"tribe\". This goes on, and on, and on... In short, I eventually got tired of the hero's endless elitism and hypocrisy.Perhaps the author's message is that the hero didn't understand while the simpletons did. Perhaps his message was that civilization is overrated compared to a simple and primitive life, we should stop worrying, live in the now, leave the rat race, etc, etc. If so, his delivery of that message is painfully boring and repetitive for the reader. At the end of the book, I really didn't care if there was a message or what it was.On a positive note, the prose used to break up chapters was often well-written. It just wasn't enough to make up for the bad execution on the actual story.","Every time the protagonist passes judgement on other characters, have a drink.Every time the protagonist compares himself to a god or demi god, have a drinkEvery time the protagonist says \"Oh! Mother of Nations\" or \"Oh Joey!\" have a drink.Every time the protagonist refers to himself as the last American despite there being evidence that other communities of survivors have formed, likely with their own elders, take a drink.Every time you find an editing error, have a drink.You may want to take it one chapter at a time so you are not utterly intoxicated. The book was most interesting for the interpretation of what post pandemic America could be like. However, the story moves slowly and the dialogue is stilted and awkward. Not as good as I had hoped for.","I know this is the grandfather of post-apocalyptic fiction but some of the attitudes expressed in this book are so dated and unrealistic that they pulled me out of the story. There are lots of poetic passages and lyrical writing but the hero is surprisingly unsympathetic and uncharismatic for my taste.","The premise of the story is interesting, especially in our time of ridiculous overpopulation of this planet and the ability for any virus to move worldwide in a short time, but the story wasn't especially well written. I really can't see so much of current civilization being lost as Mr. Stewart expects. Also, there wasn't very much character development.","An aging story. I liked the book on a whole, but the middle and end dragged into tedium.The first half of the book was very interesting to me, and I enjoyed the writing immensely. The last half of the book, on the other had was very, very slow.By the time the end came I was ready for it to be over, and did not much care what happened to everybody after that. good riddance.","The book must be praised for being quite different from most sci-fi of its time. Much of the narrative is spent taking a look at the details of the slow collapse of man's works after he is gone. If you enjoy \"Life after People\" you will enjoy this. However, Stewart's Apocalypse is a gentle one, with little evidence of panic or struggle as mankind fell.I also love that the timeline spans many years, interspersed with important episodes from the anti-hero's perspective. Having a hero that was not a superman was definitely different for the time, as was his pessimism. I loved the cross country adventure and the gradual expansion of the Ish's tribe as it met others. The book felt a little like Asmimov's foundation, which is a good thing.I thought the ending sequence [minor SPOILER alert] concerning how old age affects one's cognitive abilities was particularly well done.This could have been one of my all time favorites, if not for two things :1) the main character's egotism was hard to swallow. Perhaps the author expected he would be disliked? I doubt it however.2) Dated 40's attitudes. It feels racist AND classist (in the author's/Ish's description of the other survivors).I do highly recommend this novel, but with the grain of salt.","I have just finished reading \"Earth Abides\" for the fourth time. The first time I read it I was in my early twenties after having been lent a copy by a friend. Like so many readers, the story haunted me and many years later I decided to buy a copy of my own to read again. It was out of print in the UK at that time but I did eventually manage to obtain a copy in the States. I read it again and again. I am now 59 and the member of a book club which had \"The Road\", another post-apocalyptic story which has recently been made into a film, as one of its reads. This had a rather mixed reception from members and so I told them about \"Earth Abides\". I am delighted to say that every one of our members has read \"Earth Abides\" and enjoyed it.I notice that, like me, 90% of reviewers are happy to give \"Earth Abides\" 5 stars. Out of curiousity I have read the reviews of the minority who give it less than 3 and I have the following comments to make. Those who say \"what happened to all the dead bodies?\" need to read the book again. There are numerous references to what happened in the final stages of the epidemic, the way that they dealt with the dead and the dying, the emergency centres that were set up and the subsequent places that Ish avoided on his travels because of the smell of rotting corpses etc.Another popular criticism of the book is the apparent inability of Ish and his tribe to be creative, to teach the children to read, or to make any progress in salaging anything of the previous civilisation. I have had about 30 years to think about this one myself and I am not convinced that given the small, random group of survivors that Ish had at his disposal, and the lifestyle that they had gotten used to, that things could have turned out differently. For me the whole point of the story was that in a situation where the population slips below a certain threashold it is not possible to hang onto civilization as we know it and that a new civilization has to be born. The children of the tribe instinctively knew this and taught themselves the skills they would eventually need to survive. Think about what happened to previous so-called civilisations in our history to what happened to them in times of climactic change - they disappeared.The haunting part to this whole story is the question what happened next? For me \"Earth Abides\" will be one of the best books I have ever read or am ever likely to read.","Audible.com recently recorded what I think is the first ever audio version of George R. Stewart's classic novel, Earth Abides, so I decided to give it another read. I've read it before of course, but it's probably been almost 20 years since the last time, so I was excited to get into it again.Written in 1949, Earth Abides, is probably the earliest \"modern\" example of a pandemic post-apocalyptic novel. It follows Isherwood Williams, known as just Ish, for a period of about 50 or 60 years, starting after The Great Disaster, an unknown plague that wipes out all but just a few pockets of survivors. We see The Tribe, as they call themselves, started from just seven survivors, as it develops into a group of over a hundred people in the hills of San Francisco.There are hundreds of reviews of the book around the web, so I'll just stick with a few thoughts. It' definitely a good book (it won several awards and is credited by Stephen King as an inspiration for The Stand), and I really enjoyed it myself, but I can see how if you're not a super-fan of the post-apocalyptic genre, you might think it's a little slow in places. The first third or so feels like watching Tom Hanks in Cast Away; there's basically zero dialog as Ish travels around the country looking for other survivors. Even when a few of them gather to start a community, the writing style is mostly descriptive, without a lot of talk.But the material that's covered is perfect for anyone who wonders about how civilization would fare after an apocalypse. Would the children born into the new world be curious about the old one? Would they care to learn to read or to carry on the knowledge of the \"Old Ones\"? Would they view the Old Ones as people like themselves, or would they look on them as gods who created all the indecipherable wonders they see around them?Ish struggles with the answers to these kinds of questions as he tries to preserve and pass on enough knowledge to keep some semblance of civilization, if not simply his people, alive. They face actual dangers, such as wanderers bearing disease, but the greatest threat to the future of The Tribe is their apathy. The few from Before are comfortable enough in their current existence to not want to bother reclaiming the comforts of the old world, and those born after don't know enough about what they're missing to care either. So they live off the corpse of the old world, eating wild animals or out of cans for decades, not bothering to learn how to plant their own crops or keep their own farms.So, if you're looking for a primer on how to keep a small community alive in an urban environment after the collapse of civilization, this isn't it. This is almost an anthropological study, seen as it's happening, of the recreation of society from scratch, and as it goes on, we're not sure if that society will turn out to be recognizable to those of us left behind or not.So like I said before, if you're not a fan of the genre, or are looking for a more action-oriented story, this might not be for you. But for a true fan, Earth Abides is one of the \"Big Ones\", on most every list of the best post-apocalyptic novels ever written, so if you haven't read it yet, you really should.","I first read this book in the 60's as my husband and I were in university. I carried it for about 20 years and lost it and life took over and I never replaced it. But my mind has continued to reflect on passages, in fact, I will tell someone how racial prejudice starts and I got it from this book. It covers a frightening time but the ingenuity, focus, and just \"I will not die\" leaves in the reader ideas that will live with you forever.This morning, I couldn't stand it and went to look for it and found it here at Amazon. Thank you, thank you.","I haven't read this book in at least 35 years yet I feel like I read it only last week. This story was unique in it's treatment of humanity and it's approach to the end of the world. This is not a Man conquers over all obstacles story. The future is bleak but the characters are real humans faced with the end of their civilization. They abide, after a fashion, but not near the same as the humanity we know. I wonder how this might have been done with man's dependence on technology even greater today. This is a classic and deserves more attention.","While doing research in a remote cabin, Isherwood Williams is bitten by a rattlesnake. Emerging from a short delirium, Ish returns to civilization only to find that a new virus has wiped out 99.9% of the Earth's population. Ish sets out to see if he can find any survivors.The story is told in an irregular fashion, slowly detailing Ish's immediate experiences, then speeding into the future only to slow again for years that are more important. I enjoyed the haphazard narrative, but wished that the author had focused more detail during several essential emotional scenes regarding birth and death.The focus of the story revolves around Ish's struggle to preserve the American society against superstitions that threaten to govern the new society. The author touches on many of the possible earth changes that might happen in such a catastrophe. Some systems immediately fail while some last for many years. Fans of Stephen Kings \"The Stand\" will enjoy this similar, yet simpler tale.","Earth Abides was a great book. It is not what you would call an action-packed sci-fi novel. Rather, it is extremely thought provoking. It makes you think about the meaning of life, human relations with other men and with nature, your place in the world, and the value of what you do. Although written in the forties, it is still very relevant because it also makes you question the value of our increasingly faster and busier lifestyles and constant striving for more advanced technology.Yes, like some reviewers did, you can argue with some details, but if this is your main concern you are taking quite a shallow view of it and not seeing the forest for the trees. The beauty of this book is not so much in the details, but in it's enormous scope and ambition.This was a book that I could not put down and one that I think will long influence me.","Earth Abides is an interesting take on the human condition. Whether you agree or disagree with what the author is trying to say, it is definitely a book that makes you think about the story line and characters.While I disagree with most of Stewart's assumptions, it is well written and thought provoking. Definitely a classic that should be read again and again.","\"Earth Abides\" is NOT a science fiction novel, which is probably why many readers...have been disappointed. It is much more a social commentary, a critical examination of the human race, and a thoughtful analysis of where the human race really rates in the grand scheme of things. Thematically, the novel has more in common with Daniel Quinn's \"Ishmael\" than King's \"The Stand.\" Stewart asks us to consider the true meaning of \"civilization\" -- is it all about electricity, running water, and refrigeration? Or is it more about community and survival? Stewart's main character tries valiently to convince the new race of Americans to work together to reform the kind of civilization that led to world overpopulation in the first place (and that overpopulation, he theorizes -- in very Quinn-like reasoning -- results in a very natural plague that wipes out most of the human race). The lessons learned in this compelling novel are both profound and frightening. Could it be possible that some day our ancestors, generations in the future, will look back on us as odd and strange creatures who depended too much on invention and not enough on ourselves? In some ways, the novel is about the conflict between intellectualism and naturalism. In other ways, it's about learning to deal with change. However you read it, \"Earth Abides\" is a terrific book you won't soon forget.","As always, interesting to see the vast number of five star review for a book deserving of maybe three. Would be quite fascinating to easily see a breakdown of reviewers' ratings showing number of reviews at each star level - would we see most people rate things at 5 stars?I just finished this book, and have been thinking about why it was so bad. It never captured my interest, the characters were cardboard, astoundingly enough the plot was nearly nonexistent and worst of all, no conflict/tension!After the initial collapse, our hero drives across the country, from San Francisco to Manhattan, making trivial contact with a few people apparently for the purpose of seeing an empty New York City. He then returns to California, where he proceeds to settle down for the next 20+ years without doing anything except mosey down to the local abandoned grocery store to snag some canned food.My big insight from reading this book was realizing most people were essentially lazy before television was invented.There are so many other better genre books, including _On The Beach_ and _Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang_.","The book, first written in 1949 tells a story that could be just as true today. A pandemic that sweeps the contenent leaving few survivors. Isherwood (Ish) Williams is the protagonist. His life is the focus of the story, with interaction with a gradual collection of a few other survivors, that results in a slowly growing tribe. Well worth reading and rereading a few years later.","This book is great and I found it on Amazon at a great price. it shipped promptly and arrive in great shape.","Written in the 50s, it talks about ecology when nobody even knew the word. Ish watches the world spasm itself back into equilibrium after man is removed from the equation. Add elements of anthropology and sociology and and you have a truly remarkable book. Read it. NOW!","First published in 1949, Earth Abides is George R. Stewart's take on what would happen if all of the human population of Earth, except a few scattered survivors, were killed by a vicious disease. The tale is presented entirely through the thoughts and experiences one man, i.e., Isherwood Williams. Ish is a graduate student when the \"Great Disaster\" leaves him alone in the Oakland CA area. He eventually finds a few other survivors, including Emma (Em) who becomes his partner and the mother of his children. Ish and Em and their small band of survivors create a fledgling community that struggles with immense hardships to survive. However, they do survive and their community \"The Tribe\" grows slowly. Ish, as the only educated person among the group, becomes a leader and eventually becomes revered almost as a God after many years. Ish remains a thinker throughout his life, and a worrier through most of it. The book is very interesting and presents much credible (at least based on the 1949 knowledge base) information about what the world would be like and how it would change if humans cease to be a significant force. It also presents much logical information about how a very small human community would struggle to adapt and develop a simple but functioning social organization. Much of the book presents Ish's thoughts about how to help his tribe survive and also how to motivate or manipulate them to develop skills and knowledge that might enable them to develop a new civilization in the future. At times, I did not like Ish, but I usually understood the logic of his thoughts and actions. Although things did not work out the way Ish wanted, he finally realized that the tribe and Earth's changing environment would interact to determine the future without his help. I found this book to be a slow but interesting read. It was also intellectually stimulating and engendered much emotion. Reading this science fiction classic is well worth the effort.","I have read this book multiple times and have totally been immersed in WHAT IFS. I have talked more about this book than about any other book that I have read except for The Source by James Michener.. The idea of the world actually existing after most of the people have died from an unknown cause is so thought provoking. Most people I have talked to and let read my book have been as impressed by Earth Abides as I have been but then there are the very few who thought that they could do better if they had been in the same circumstances. I always thought that I would eventually have to go back to cave man status. It is a book that should be read in college. I would totally recommend it.","This book is less about an apocalyptic event that kills most humans and more about the reemergence of society and the influences that geography, history, and personal beliefs have on it. Ishi, the main character, strives to bring back the scholarly lifestyle he values, but is faced with convincing the new generation of its value in a world where his children are free from the society he knew.","One of my favorites that I surely will read more than once. I loved how you got to read about the main character from the age of 18 to his death. The book is amazing at telling the story of how they all survive and how mankind seems to revert back to tribal and superstitious beliefs. I almost wanted to jump in and live this life with them even though their hardships seemed too much to bear.","See this movie and gain a perspective on where we came from. Who we are and where you are going. Buddha jesus all the same guy. Whi knew?","I have read all of Stephenn King's books, so when he wrote that this book was his inspiration for writing The Stand, I knew it would be good. I purchased Earth Abides in a London bookstore a few years ago, but somehow it has gone missing. So I was very surprised and exited when I saw that it was being offered as a kindle book. I have now re-read Earth Abides and it is truly a great work of fiction. It really gets my imagination working, and makes real just how fragile the human race is.","I enjoy Post apocalyptic sic fi but this was not that entertaining after a while.","With so many books available to read, is this one worth your time? Ultimately, you'll have to make that decision, but I hope my review can help in some way.There are some technology issues with the story that clearly show it was written in the late 1940's; however, these don't detract too much from the story.There are also a few typos in the Kindle edition, which I assume is a scanning problem when converting to eBook format.The two main issues I had with the book are:1. Food - It is unrealistic to think that people would be subsisting off canned food for 20+ years, let alone, 40+ years at the end of the book.2. Future generations - Without ruining the ending, the book makes a plot decision on how Ish decides to pass knowledge on to future generations. I liked two aspects of what he did, but I thought the rest was foolish.I liked the book overall, but I didn't necessarily think it was a \"great\" work.","This review is a spoiler! Don't read on if you are intending to read it for the first time!I had heard many times that this was a classic that would haunt me for life. But I was not impressed, partially because there were things that were left unanswered. I may have missed something - what was the significance of the car on the bridge at the end? Modern man's constructions were all around him...the Golden Gate Bridge, for example. Why the car? Why did they want him to die there, instead of with their tribe? I thought it weird, too, and unlikely, that he saw so few bodies in the aftermath. I liked the hammer symbol a lot - and the fact that he passed it on to the young man he'd chosen - and why. I liked that his gift of leadership helped humanity live on. I also liked the way that he changed his desperate struggle from lecturing - to action...his building of the simple bow and arrows. I loved that he continued to describe the inevitable and looming corrosion of the modern world. That did make him the last American - his final months spent with his oldest friend. Those things saddened me a great deal.I have read another holocaust book that WILL haunt me for life...perhaps because it was on such a massive scale, and yet confined to only one remaining group of characters. The book is The Last Ship, by William Brinkley. I've read it 3 times, as has my oldest son.","This is an extraordinary novel, wider appreciation of which has probably been hampered by categorization as science fiction. While there are some slight anachronisms (the book appeared in 1949) the ideas, and the narrative, are disturbingly fresh. To me the most stunning - and frighteningly plausible - theme was how fragile &quot;civilization&quot; is, and how quickly everything could collapse even though the material and intellectual basis for &quot;civil society&quot; remained intact and available.","In short, I liked the first half of this book - the plot is intriguing and you don't want to put the book down! But after reading 2/3 of the story you expect something more to happen but the tempo goes down, the main character gets more introspective and the flow of the narration starts to falter. The book starts to get boring and you just want to get through to the end to see what the end will be like. With a better pace all the way through, I would rate this book higher.","Chris FitzgeraldEnglish 10Mrs. Cruces5-20-02Earth Abides Evaluative EssayThe novel Earth Abides, written by George Stewart, took place in San Francisco,California. This science fiction novel focuses on a plague that has spread across the NorthAmerican continent and is threatening the human species. The novel contains the life thatan individual survivor, Isherwood Philips (Ish), lives. A majority of the population hasseized to exist. Ish is an important part of the Plague because he is a biologist. Ish goesthrough his life in this novel by bringing other characters into his life. Ish is one of thesurvivors that has the intelligence to form a tribe and become the leader of this tribe. Ishhas a compassionate soul and struggles to help other survivors find their way.Earth Abides is a very interesting novel. This novel is easily enjoyable because ofits connection that it gives of the key characters who are intertwined in a drama that isdealing with a cataclysmic event of a Plague. This makes the novel a good read. Thiskind of event is very possible considering the times that we live in now. This novel doesnot only relate with people coming together to struggle for survival. It also deals with anevent that could very well take place.This novel is great for anyone over the age of about 12 years old, because of theway that this novel is set up to involve thinking and real life experience to understand thetrue meaning of the novel. Anybody who is looking for a good science fiction novel willlike the great novel Earth Abides.","I bought this book based on the overall good ratings.I speed read through most of it, hoping it would pick up. I can't stand the idea that these people weren't a little more intelligent and chose to preserve what they had and plan for the future without technology. They had a whole freakin' University Libary for pete's sake!Out of the whole book I got that Ish was the only inteliigent one but didn't have the teaching skills to subsequently teach the next generations.If you like post-apolcolytipic books, then I highly recommend \"One Second Later\" by Fortschen. The spelling may be off slighly....I don't have the book here. There is a line-up at work to read it. This book scared the hell out of me. And as a professional health care worker I could see the devastating domino effect happening like this book portrayed. Like the book \"One Second Later\" says, \"Its not IF, but WHEN.\"","If they did an audiotape of \"Earth Abides\", only Ben Stein would be up to the task of delivering the text into spoken words. The novel wastes no time getting into its subject matter. Within the opening pages, an unknown plague wipes out the vast majority of humanity, leaving the remnants to either rebuild civilization or bear witness to its final collapse. It sounds promising, but the delivery never comes.The story is narrated in the first person by \"Ish\", a young college student whose circumstances enable him to survive the disaster. Very early on, the reader gets the first inklings that this novel will serve as a sounding board for George Stewart's various preoccupations. The first hint is the dominant theme that nature has some innate sense of population control that strikes suddenly and absolutely on all levels, and this is explored not just in discovering what happened to humanity but also in a number of situations as the story advances.In fact, Ish seems to be merely a mouthpiece for a number of observations, ideas, and insights postulated by Stewart. For a work of fiction, \"Earth Abides\" reads more like an apocalyptic version of \"Future Shock\", the landmark Alvin Toffler sociological study. Unfortunately, it reads as dryly as \"Future Shock\" as well. All of Stewart's ideas are presented in a dry, impersonal manner, which precludes any emotional connection with the story itself and thus lessens the impact of these insights in the end. Recommended only for the most voracious of sci-fi readers.","\"Earth Abides\" is one of the best books I have ever read. Even though it was written in 1949, it seems to me like it could have been written yesterday. Very thought-provoking and memorable. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who desires a good read. I couldn't put it down. I finished it several days ago and it still stays in my mind. I bought this book for my Kindle, but I think I am going to order a hard copy too - it was that good.","Even at 60 years old this book still resonates as to the plight of man and his insignificance in the universe. Told as a simple story of survival of the species it gives the reader pause for thought about many issues. Well written without much superflous wording. Great detail on the impact of man and what his loss would mean to the planet.","Hello,The main character, Ish, manages to spend over 20 years mostly clutching his worry beads and freting. By the end of the book you just want to slap him and ask, \"What the hell is wrong with you\". His character is indecisive, and whiny. Over 20 years and the most productive thing he did was teach the kids how to make crappy bows and dig a well. If the characters in this book are supposed to be examples of the best way humanity could cope post SHTF we are probably all doomed. The only thing I can think of is that among the characters all had IQ's of 95 and Ish had an IQ of 100. This is more a human drama story (written in a most boring way) written around an apocalypse than it is anything else. If your interested in realistic post SHTF stories don't waist your time here. If your interested on how a small community could waste +20 years post SHTF in blissful denial with only one character recognizing the denial but doing nothing but hand-wringing about it than this is the book for you.","I found this book sitting on my mother's shelf, and after reading the description, couldn't wait to begin delving into it. The description of the book makes it seem like it's going to be very intriguing and exciting. It failed in that area. (And it's rare for me to dislike a book)In general, I really dislike the character. He shows no real or genuine emotion and is very full of himself. He is a geographer, but thinks of himself as a philospher. Which in his book, I guess that means spending a lot of time thinking about how unintelligent and hopeless everyone is. Including his wife and children. In fact, he had around five children, but you only learn about three of their names, and he spends his time only liking one of them. Since this book was written in the 40s, there are some racist and misogynistic undertones.The first two-thirds were mostly boring to me. He spends the majority of his time traveling across America and describing the scenery. When he's not doing that, he's judging people.Overall, I only like the last third of book, and that had nothing to do with the character. Instead, I enjoyed the process that could happen if civilization were lost, and the reforming of it.","I first read this book when I was 19 years old in 1974. At that time, most novels in this genre were post-nuclear where the United States and the Soviet Union were foolish enough to unleash their hellfire. This one takes a different approach. There are no mutants, no zombies, no cannibals. The end comes, as it has for so many human civilisations, from a disease that was not created in a lab but evolved from an earlier less virulent agent. Think avian influenza.It is based on the premise that any species that becomes so very numerous and lives in such dense number is vulnerable to a sweeping pandemic that kills many or almost all of the species. In this case, humans have skated by since the Black Death hit Europe and killed one third of the humans in Europe. A disease appears, but owing to the mobility of our species with rapid global transport, it manages to sweep the planet before anyone is really aware it is there.As with all pandemics, there are generally some individuals who survive either by peculiar circumstance, slight differences in genetics, or just pure luck. In Ish's case, it was more a combination of circumstance and luck. He has gone to a cabin to rest from the stresses of life and is not even aware at first that a new disease is abroad in the world. He just happens to be hiking and suffers a snake bite. The story suggests that he became ill with the disease at the same time and that venom and the disease basically worked against each other; thus, sparing his life. Once he recovers, he discovers a world empty of people. He takes a trip across the country from his starting point in California to New York City then down through the South and back to Los Angeles. This is where the first clear difference appears between this book and most all others. In this story, there are small numbers of survivors, but most are too shell-shocked and skittish to approach. So North America and presumably the rest of the planet is beginning to restore its natural balance, and the marks of humans are slowly being swallowed up.The second difference is that this story demonstrates what I think is the most realistic outcome for the survivors. Most do not have the skills to survive from nature and starve or die from injury, but some begin learning to survive. Ish is one who does. It follows him through the remainder of his life and the one or two generations that are borne from the small collection of survivors who collect around him. Unusual intelligence is not something that results from all matings. Mostly it is average intelligence sufficient to learn survival skills from the parents. Ish will make efforts to ensure some civilisation survives such as reading and writing, but even with that humans change. Domesticated animals survive in feral forms or die out. Predator and prey balance is gradually reestablished. Suburbs gradually revert to forest or grasslands. Natural fires become part of the norm, again.This book is an adventure but not in the same way of a story such as Alas Babylon or the movie 2012 (abominable science in that one). This is an adventure in that the world returns to a form that produced humans in the first place. This is a book for mind and heart more than the thrill. It has stood without becoming as dated as most of these books do. The words 'computer', 'radiation', and 'desperate' do not appear. I think more than anything, the survivors take a while to realise that their lives are not going to return to the way they were. I give this novel all the stars allowed and would give it more if I could.","I really enjoyed this book, George Stewart uses an interesting writing devise to describe time passing without you as the reader feeling as if he is grasping for ideas.Right from when people start dieing and the world changes the whole pace of life changes and this is captured really well and I feel is conveyed very effectively.I also loved the insights into what happens over time to various things that we are accosted to, cats, dogs, corn and cars. I know, I know I sound a little weird but it works !At only 337 pages this is not a taxing read, its definitely worth throwing at your younger readers in the home wanting something that is a little more challenging","I would like to say that in reading other reviews here that dislike this book, the people in this book remind me greatly of many people I have known. Yes, they didn't seem to try very hard to continue civilization, but then he explains that and ponders that at great length. Yes, the main characters were annoying and all too real. All the people that say, \"I would have done this!\" or \"they should have done that!\" are just getting what the author wanted you to do, think about it.They characters in the book, the few rag tag remnants of civilization, fail to even prepare for the inevitable illness that befalls them, typhoid. Just like all of humanity in 1949 failed to prepare for the pandemic that wipes them out. And just like we have still failed to prepare for the coming pandemic of today.This is a cautionary tale that is enjoyable to read. What I would say the the people who don't like it is, And what exactely have you done lately to prepare civilization for what the World Health Organization has recently stated is \"inevitiable\"?","&#8216;Earth Abides&#8217; by George R. Stewart comes with a considerable reputation. First Published in 1949, It was the first winner of the International Fantasy Award although it is clearly science fiction of the world catastrophe kind. That said the book isn&#8217;t extra-speculative in approach, it is set in much the same time as it was written, in an America of that late 1940s early 1950s. The main character, and narrator, of this disaster novel is Isherwood Williams a post grad geography student, Ish is one of the few survivors of a plague which has decimated the USA (and by inference the world). The book tells the tale of what happens to civilisation after the fall and describes Ish&#8217;s attempts to preserve some of it into the future. The story is told and progressed in a series of accounts, the exploration of the USA, the founding of a community, the growth of that community etc. It is written in a straight forward narrative style, with an occasional aside to speculate on the ecology, and traces the life of Ish from the time of the plague to his death. Through this journey Ish will face loneliness and find love, the small community he gathers about him will both flourish and suffer tragedy, and all along Ish chronicles things with his eye on history and ecology.For me, one of the main strengths of this book is that Ish is one of the most relatable protagonists of just about any book I&#8217;ve read. Ish is the sort of person who we&#8217;d like to think we would be in this situation. This is not to say Ish is perfect and he&#8217;s certainly no hero. He has a methodical and intellectual outlook to tackling situations, but he suffers as many failures as triumphs. This gives the book an emotional depth uncommon in a lot of SF and it is this humanity within the characters and their simple plight which drags you into the story. I think this is the book&#8217;s secret, it has the ring of truth. The characters send you through a gamut of emotions from nostalgia to anger, we care about them and are emotionally invested in there future.I don&#8217;t often read disaster novels and it took me some time to build up to read it, I wanted to read it because of its reputation but somehow I always seemed to find another book I needed to read first. Finally biting the bullet I found after only a few pages it had become compulsive and it ended much too soon. Whilst I have read some high enjoyable and great books both before and since, it is this book I find that sticks in my mind and the one that I contemplate upon. This book deserves all the praise it has received, and it has widely been proclaimed a masterwork. That it isn&#8217;t more widely known today is a shame. This book has probably become, even against my will, my favorite SF novel.","The premise of this novel is that mankind suddenly experiences a biological holocaust in the form of a new disease--a form of super-measles that wipes out all but a tiny remnant of mankind. The author explains that &quot;mankind had too long been rolling an endless succession of sevens&quot; and that like all animals that had multiplied out of turn, the sudden catastrophe was inevitable to set the balance back to what nature intended. This novel tells the story of a very small group of survivors, and suggests what life would be like under in the aftermath, and perhaps, more profoundly, what such a scenario might mean for mankind.The author's premise is that little or nothing of civilization would survive such an event. In the story **very minor spoiler** although the survivors make attempts at preserving the skills and lessons of civilization, this eventually becomes impossible against the tide of events sweeping mankind back not just to barbarism (in which some skills and beliefs might have survived) but to downright savagery and superstition. The most profound thought that the author successfully imparts is that all of the traditions, skills, and manifestations of our civilization could--and would--be lost in a single generation. Unforgettable is when one of the characters in the story looks out at the ruins of the San Francisco Bay Bridge (before it too passes away) and asks--&quot;who built this.&quot; The protagonist thinks for a second and answers: &quot;the Americans built it.&quot; The next question is &quot;who were the Americans?&quot; I have never forgotten this exchange, which I felt illustrated brilliantly how important it is for one generation to impart the best ideas of civilization to the next, and how easily all our achievements and successes might be lost in the face of a global catastrophe.The reader need not and probably will not agree with all of the author's conclusions about what would happen in this scenario. Would we really lose the skill of a written language? Would we really fall all the way back almost to the Old Stone Age? The author will challenge the reader's own thoughts on this subject, and that is fine. One need not agree with all of the conclusions that the novel contains to enjoy this story.Although written many years ago, upon re-reading this novel recently I found that it had lost little or none of its impact or relevance. It features a bit more prudishness than a modern novel might contain, but in my opinion is none the worse for this. The story is well-told, the prose is quite good, and the storyline moves along all the while capturing and retaining the reader's interest. This is a novel that I would recommend to everyone.","I could almost feel the age of this book when I read it. It is slow, the main character is an idiot (in my eyes), and he spends most of his time thinking about single-handedly saving (well, rebuilding) civilisation. Delusions of Grandeur. No critical thoughts about civilisation as realized in 1940/50 America, either: \"Modern civilisation is good. We need to rebuild it at once. End of argument.\"I took two things from this book - first, sheep are the most stupid animals on this planet. And second, people may come and go, but Earth Abides. The Author managed very well to show me that, by having his protagonist realize a few pages before the end that he isn't the center of the world. Wow. Finally. I was waiting for this for about 200 pages.This could have been done with a much shorter and faster-paced book. Still, the book poses some interesting questions, and it's vastly better than what you get today when being shown post-apocalypse worlds (I'm thinking along the lines of the Mad Max movies, or Waterworld, etc - the book never sells out this cheaply). So, all in all, Earth Abides earns it's place on my SF bookshelf. A serious book that tries to seriously investigate the end of civilisation as we know it, and guide us into the new world that rises out of it.","I could not put this book down. It challenged me, it entertained me, it made me cry.When I run across a copy, I buy it and give it to friends.","Perhaps because I've read several recently published books that deal with life after \"the end of the world as we know it,\" I found this book to be slow moving and even boring at times. However, I enjoyed moments of nostalgia when presented with phrases like \"tourist court\" and \"I pressed the starter button on the car.\" Brought back memories. Sadly, the world as we knew it then has already ended.","Anyone who has read Alas, Babylon or Lucifer's Hammer needs to read this also. The premise is a panepedimic wipes out almost the entire population of the earth. Earth abides, but Man is almost extint. The turning point comes when the main character realizes that civilization as he knew it is over. He then turns his energies into teaching the Tribe to be self sufficient.A very good read, very on point and topical for today's world.","This book was hard for me to read simply because the pain of the main character became my pain while I read. In the aftermath of the end of the world You experience fear, loneliness, pitty, love, hope and finally resolution through the narrator Ish's observations.This is no adventure novel but it is a hard hitting look at just how much we truly rely on the trappings of the industrialized world to get by and how naked we would be without them. Although the book ends on a bit of a hopeful note you can't help but mourn for all that's been lost as well as watching the rest of the world's knowledge die slowly over the generations.This book made me ask what if it were me? A mark of a good thought provoking book.","Earth Abides by George Stewart is an incredible book. It follows the main character, Ish, as he tries to make sense of a world where humans are nearly wiped out by disease. What makes this book special, is that it's protagonist is a deliberate, thoughtful man that brings the story a sense of realism that is rarely seen in this kind of fiction. It is very interesting to see how and if civilization can survive such a \"Great Disaster\". The story benefits by being completely plausible, and even though the book was written over 50 years ago, it is still fascinating today. I highly recommend this reading.","A grossly interesting book, perhaps the actual first, to explore the thought of \"what to do to survive in post-apocalyptic America with little skills and a hammer\" - all avenues are skillfully probed and prosed.The first quarter of the book captivated my imagination with the wandering, scavaging and, ultimately, surviving. The middle half was deeply interesting to see how one man could restructure his life so that Americans could live after the plague. The last quarter was filled with expectation and anxiety, seeing how the family has turned out and whether or not the new Americans will prosper as they had before.","At the beginning of Earth Abides, Isherwood Williams, a graduate student alone in the wilderness and working on his thesis, is bitten by a poisonous snake. For several days, he drifts in and out of consciousness. When he is at last able to drag himself to civilization, he finds that a virus not unlike the common flu has mutated into a deadly strain, and the world is suddenly devoid of people. The rest of the book follows Isherwood as he discovers the strange freedom of the empty world, struggles to find other survivors, and works to rebuild civilization.Earth Abides is a sweeping saga, stretching across decades and roaming across North America. Most of the story takes place from inside the head of its protagonist, at a range so close that it takes us several pages to learn his name, as he simply does not think of his name that often. Stewart infuses the story with concrete details and scientific observations, giving it a strong sense of authenticity. Caught up in and believing the action, we are completely absorbed in the efforts of Isherwood Williams to survive and thrive in this strange new world.One trap lurking for any story, but particularly a science fiction story like this, is that of becoming quickly dated. Things change daily, and what is fascinating and new today will soon be old fashioned. Stewart has given his story a certain timelessness, at least so far, and I think he achieves this effect by incorporating very little medium-range technology. By this I mean that things are either seen close up, as in hands working with tools that change slowly, such as hammers, or are seen at a distance, such as the lights of San Francisco. In the middle distance, very little attention is paid to devices that evolve quickly, such as televisions, radios, and automobiles (other than the venerable Jeep). The result is that Earth Abides does not suffer from a feeling of being out of date, and it could easily be imagined to be a present-day story.One interesting feature to me as a writer was the use of interstitial chapters called Quick Years between each of the three major sections. These bridge the time gaps between the primary sections of the book, recalling the primary events in the passing years through Isherwood's eyes. This device lets the author tell a sweeping story while keeping the bulk of the detail in the activity at the turning points. On first glance, this sudden shift in gears seems likely to distance the reader, but Stewart handles the narrative so deftly that the reader finds the story as engaging viewed at this speed as when it is slowed down.Ultimately, Earth Abides is a masterful work. The author gives us enough detail and character to connect deeply with the story, then stays out of the way, allowing the story to unfold with its own power. The result is a riveting and deeply moving tale about all of us, how strong and resilient we are, but also about how fragile we are, how tenuous our grip on the world is, and how little it needs us.Do not miss this story. But do not, however, try to finish it without a generous supply of tissues. You will need them.","I heard about \"Earth Abides\" from someone reviewing \"The Stand\". In their review, they indicated \"The Stand\" was a one for one rip off of \"Earth Abides\". I decided to investigate this accusation and started reading an old edition of George Stewart's book. This book investigates what could potentially happen to human civilization if most people died from a highly contagious disease. The decay of civilization is seen through the eyes of the main character, Isherwood Williams.First, what was my impression of the book? I enjoy reading sci-fi and have read my share of \"end of the world\" books including \"Alas Babylon\", \"The Stand\", \"War Day\", \"The White Plague\", and most recently \"The Road\". I did not enjoy the writing style of this author. It was not fluid and was archaic. However, the subject matter was interesting as was the thought the author put into the story. Ultimately, the author kept my attention.How does this book compare to \"The Stand\"? They are two entirely different books. \"The Stand\" is more realistic in depicting the immediate aftermath of a plague. However afterwards, it becomes more of a \"good versus evil\" tale whereas \"Earth Abides\" seriously contemplates the state of civilization years after the plague. All in all, both books are worthy reads.\"Earth Abides\" is at times is an awkward read. However, the story is interesting and well thought out. All in all, I recommend the book.","I swear it seems that all the reviewers of this book seem desperate to convince people that they've been able to read for a really long time.\"I first read this book back in Vietnam...\"\"I first read this book about thirty years ago...\"\"When I first read this book, I was only twelve years old, and...\"Great, we get it, you're old, and you can read.Ahhh... Anyway, despite my grumbling, I do agree with the essential point that these reviewers made--that this is a book that pulls you in, that surrounds you with a \"world entire,\" that creates a place that you inhabit completely from page 1 to page 317 (in the edition I have, anyway), that creates a world that you'll find hard to forget.The book, \"Earth Abides,\" tells the story of a man who emerges from a long period of solitude to discover that more than 99% of the planet's humans have been killed by a powerful virus, the man himself having likely survived only because of having been bitten by a snake around the same time.The book's descriptions of the abandoned world are awesome, enlivening and atmospheric, and for some of us no doubt a secret dream come true. It gets even cooler whent the man decides to take a road trip across the newly desolate America--from California to New York City. That's the book's first section, and was probably my favorite part of the book, but the book remains interesting and engaging throughout. The man meets a woman, they have children, they meet others, they form a community, and then--this seemed a bit hard for me to swallow--they basically let all of civilization go, and three generations later they're basically a tribe of primitives who are happy and functional, but who can't read, can't use any of the technologies created by mankind, and believe the sun revolves around the Earth. Yeah, that happened kind of quick....Set your disbelief aside though, and read this. It's well-written, nicely paced, and enjoyable, and the depictions of the man when he's really old seem totally accurate in their depiction of the sort of fuzzy and uncertain warmth of old age, though I'd need to have this book's other reviewers confirm that to be absolutely sure.One of my only complaints about the book would be the 1940s mentality that saturates the main character's logic: at one point he says in a sort of wistful tone that maybe one day they might be able to care about such things as race again, he contemplates making himself king of two frightened black people that he meets, and he laments that the his community's lack of law has made it impossible for them to require that an insane girl be \"put out of her misery.\" At first these comments were kind of amusing in a kitschy way, but then they really started piling up, and didn't make his character more endearing to me.Overall though, this was a great book, and like almost everyone else who's read it, I'm sure I'll be thinking about it for years.","This novel did more than entertain, it made me think. Everything that we hold of value weakens when weighted against what is essential in continuing our existence after such a catastrophe. The main character \"Isherwood\" had such a difficult time with the notion of the \"Old\" world being forgotten. What impressed me was that their continued existence was not dependant on the \"Old\" structure of things. If all the demands of our everyday life are absent what is left?I am pleased to have read this book. I'll be honest I was reticent about reading a sci-fi from 1947. This was well worth it.","This is a great read, but before you spend the $50 for this paperback, go check your local used book stores and thrift stores like Goodwill, I got my copy of the 1962 version for 69 cents and it is in great shape at a Goodwill store.","Several reviews have noted what they call the essential pessimism of the book: Man Has Fallen, Civilization Is No More, etc. Well, yes, that is all there. But what is also there is a profound triumph of the human spirit: Civilization is Dead - Long Live Civilization. I will NOT spoil the ending, but book ends with a rebirth - an obvious societal pregnancy if you will - of a new civilization, one profoundly in keeping with the new conditions of their brave renewed world.One can imagine a sequel, and I wish Stewart ahd written one!I first read this book almost 50 years ago, and have re-read it multiple times. It is one of the best \"transition\" books ever written. I recommend it on several levels.","I have been searching for this book for the past 35 years. It was a story I have never forgotten since reading it in my teens. I applaude the publisher who has reissued it. Can't wait to read it again and share it with my friends.","Misinterpretations abide, it seems, when it comes to this book. This &quot;disaster&quot; novel merely uses the disease plague scenario as a backdrop to explore human nature. There are many subtle examples here of how individuals develop as adults, how everything people know and believe is dependent on their own life experience and frame of reference. Most of all this is about the myriad of seemingly small things that people take for granted every day and do not even notice, seemingly unimportant things which are really the foundation of society and culture. Here the characters are stripped of all their artificial interests, and are left with only that foundation. The genius of this story is that it will leave you wondering just how independent your own thoughts and views are. There might be many reasons people go in the various directions they go in life, the least of which have to do with independent choices. This book is much more than a disaster novel, it is a fascinating look at sociology in action. And always in the background, amidst all the human trials and tribulations, Earth and non-human life continue as they always have, oblivious to human superiority. Hence the title, and the ultimate humbling message.","One of the better disaster novels to come out in this century, Stewart essentially takes the Robinson Crusoe point of view and applies it to (then) contemporary America, having a plague wipe out most people, even though the rationale that it's because people are too numerous is a little on the shaky side, he should have just taken the Solaris route and said he didn't know. Would have made things more interesting. However, in itself the novel is an excellent and very realistic portrayal of people struggling to live after everyone else is gone. Nobody has any real need for ambition since everything they could ever want is right there. The main character is the only one who can think ahead far enough to see that the children have to be taught so that civilization can come back but when the book ends it's unclear if that will ever happen. The point I think is to show that we're not better than the animals when it comes to civilization and that our intelligence doesn't necessarily make us better, an old point, to say the least but one that should be stated often. Evolutionarily the human race just got lucky and as quick as we rose (a million years isn't that long really when you figure the age of the planet) we can fall just as fast. And the thing that makes Earth Abides so more real is that civilization isn't restarted, to have that happen would seem unreal, a small group of people does not a civilization make and to have them turn into some sort of super-community to go across the US and return society to what it was before would just seem unrealistic and that would have ruined the point of the book. The way it's written now is much more interesting because even though it's so depressing, it feels that much more likely and thus in the end is more satisfying.","I don't think that any of the reviewers have mentioned this, but I think that there are important details in understanding the book. George R Stewart was an English professor (at UC Berkeley), but he has a real strong feeling for the land, landscape, weather and nature. He wrote about storms, the Donner Party, and other geographical subjects, especially relevant to California.The story is set in the East Bay, and has many identifiable locations and views .that add a certain warmth and familiarity to the story, even after six decades. The tribe lived in easily identifiable Oakland/Berkeley hills of the late 1949's.Ish is initially bitten by a rattlesnake in the Sierra, which would have been familiar to many in Berkeley (then and now)-the mountains, not the rattlesnake. He has respectful and loving depictions of the UC Berkeley Library, which Ish needs to break into- Stewart would have used the library regularly. He described the natural changes in animals and plants that would be expected in the hills. He describes a fire which occurs across the Bay, in San Francisco and the northern Peninsula. Finally, the last scene has the tribe walking across the Bay Bridge. That is the same bridge that exists today (although it will be replaced in a few years).BUT the most important thing is his name. Ish (\"Isherwood\") really stands for Ishi., the famous Indian survivor studied by Kroeber at Berkeley in the early 1900's. That is a well-known piece of Berkeley lore, and Stewart was certainly familiar with it. ... Ish, the last survivor of a dead tribe....","A virus wipes out most of humanity within a couple of days. I've read many scifi novels that begin this way, and most of them spend the majority of the subsequent pages describing the ensuing social chaos in dystopian detail. Earth Abides takes a completely different tack. There is no swaggering little Napoleon lording it over a tiny flock of survivors--there are simply too few people left. There is very little deprivation--people can comfortably survive for years on the leftover canned goods in every corner store. Indeed, there is very little drama of any kind.This is more of a character study of two entities. One is the protagonist, Ish, an anthropologist by training who sees his role primarily as that of an observer of the slow, inevitable decay of civilization. He makes half-hearted attempts to save vestiges of knowledge but is mostly content to watch what happens to the environment around him. The question of what would happen to the planet itself--along with all the plants and animals--without its human caretakers, is the true core of this novel. I heard Octavia Butler recommend this book as one that inspired her, and now that I have read it, I can see why. Thoughtful and surprisingly gentle, it highlights the gifts possessed even by apparently unremarkable people to make a life out of what they are given, supported always by the ultimate Mother: Earth.","Being a fan of apocalyptic SF (among other things), I ordered this after seeing it on several peoples's lists of the greatest end-of-the-world/post-apocalyptic novels. It tells the story, of Ish Williams, who is one of a handful of survivors of a sudden plague that kills off something like 99.99% of the world's primate poulation. Earth Abides describes, in linear chronological fashion, the subsequent 50 years or so, following Ish who becomes the leader of a small band of survivoirs and eventually the shaman-like last survivior of the pre-plague people.The book was written in 1949 and feels very dated, in terms of dialog, ideas and socio-political themes. There are distinctly (although thinly veneered) anti-technology, elitist and generic christian motifs running rather crudely throughout, all of which turned me off. In a couple of places, the author's science is arguable or just plain wrong, and some of his plot devices (cars that still work after sitting on a lot for decades) feel contrived. All this aside, the writing itself just isn't that good.The main character, Ish is a neurotic misanthrope. No genius himself, Ish is nonetheless an incredible intellectual snob, judging everyone around him including his loving wife, to be of lower intelligence than he. A young (already lonely and alone) graduate student at the beginning of the novel, this remarkably unlikeable character goes on to comment negatively about the intellectual capacities of everyone who comes along in his life, except for one grandson that he deems worthy to become his successor.There is very little action, and many descriptive passages about changes in the earth and its flora and fauna following the disaster. The latter are fairly interesting, but not as interesting or well-researched as more recent works (e.g., After Man: A Zoology of the Future). The novel is unfortunately, not particularly well written. I guess, being written in 1949, one has to award points for originality, but compared to dozens of novels and a number of non-fiction works published since then concerned with the fate of the earth after man is gone, there is not much here that warrants this novel's amazing longevity.I understand how this novel could have been very popular when it was published. I am, however, at a loss to explain this novel's huge popularity and staying power today. That it remains in print 61 years after first publication is astounding to me, as are all the 5-star reviews. Virtually all of the ideas and themes visited have been done better by others who are much better, and more interesting writers. One particularly acute contrast is with James Van Pelt's \"Summer of the Apocalypse\", that I read immediately after \"Earth Abides\". It is far superior in every respect, although a superficial description of each makes them sound very similar. Nevertheless, they could not be more different.I was very disappointed by this \"classic\" and would not recommend it on any level.JM Tepper","A plague wipes out most of humanity, and one man (Isherwood Williams) tries desperately to save a piece of civilization to pass on to the generations of survivors. The first part of the story deals with his survival of the plague, and his journey around the country looking for signs of survivors.He returns to his home (in the Bay area of California) where he finally meets a woman (Emma) whose courage convinces him to start a family, which becomes a 'tribe' as a few other survivors come to join them. He tries to pass on as much knowledge as he can to the children of the tribe, but his efforts are largely in vain as civilization continues to regress. Ultimately he realizes a way to pass on some very basic knowledge to help his descendants in the future.The author does an excellent job of dealing with the plague, the after effects of such a plague on nature, as well as the slow decay of the cities and infrastructure of our civilization. He also describes well drop into a primitive society that would result from the plague. There is also an interesting moral dilemma when the tribe has to deal with a potential threatening outsider who tries to join them.The flaws of this story are few. There are a few sections which clearly take place at roughly the time when the story was published (1949). As a result, some of the references to technology and personalities make those sections of the story feel a bit dated. This only happens a few times though, and doesn't really hurt the story.This book won the first science fiction award given when it won the International Fantasy Award in 1951. In 1987, it rated 28th on the Locus All-Time Poll of All-Time SF Novels, and in 1998 it tied for 41st on the Locus poll of SF Novels written before 1990.","I read Earth Abides and was stunned with what a great book it was. Its attention to detail was unparalleled, its character development was exceptional, and its plot never got dull. Every part of the book was breath-taking, from the opening sentence to the closing words.Stewart wrote Earth Abides in third person and includes italicized background information which helps the book play before the reader much like a movie. Stewart doesn't just tell the reader the story; it is like they can see it for themselves. The reader is left to ponder many comments made by characters, and is allowed to reach conclusions for themselves. The thought provoking way in which Earth Abides is written was my favorite attribute of the book.Some books can be read and enjoyed, but do not really leave a mark on the reader. This one reshaped the way that I view the world. I have read hundreds of books, and consider this perhaps the best I have ever read. In one word, it was &quot;awesome.&quot;","Do you know the joyous feeling you get when you just happen upon a book quite by accident, read just a few chapters of it, and realize that it will be of great signifiance to you? Well, that was my experience with this book! I can't believe that I was not introduced to this book before now. It is with some sadness that I just completed reading it.My degree of connection with the main character, Isherwood Williams (Ish), astounded me; therefore, I must admit that my reaction to this book is quite subjective. It as is though the author looked into my mind and wrote a book about me in a post-apocalyptic world, including my greatest virtues and worst vices. The descriptions of the thoughts, triumphs, failings, joys, and frustrations experienced by the main character are poignantly honest and real. Metaphorically, this story seems to describe, with regard to many things, my existence in this, our so-far non-apocalyptic, world. For example, I find that I constantly struggle to define what I think to be the appropriate balance of individuality and community/state in our world. If you are one who consciously ponders such things or pursues a study of philosophy, I believe that you will view this book as a masterpiece. It just made my top 10, that is sure.I feel that I have gained much in my reading of this book. Mostly, I come away from this reading experience with a renewed feeling of peace and a reassurance in myself and the human spirit. I will no longer, I think, become quite so frustrated with regard to certain things or people in this world.&quot;Am I happy? Yes, I am happy. Things are as they are, and I am part of them.&quot; - Jack, great grandson of Isherwood Williams (Ish), the Last American.","That about sums it up for me. All others on this theme (with the honourable exception of John Wyndham's \"The Day of the Triffids\") are just cheap imitations. Earth Abides is the real thingCivilisation, and some 99.99% of the human race, is gone. The few survivors, all traumatised by what has happened to them (some more obviously than others, but they all are) either just commit suicide, drink themselves to death, live out their lonely lives in some familiar spot, or, as with Ish and his companions, get together into little \"tribes\".Having already read a few reviews, I get the impression that there are few neutrals on this one. You either love it (the majority, including me) or hate it. For me, Earth Abides' big virtue is precisely what some people seem to dislike about it. Its characters are just dead ordinary. Even Ish, the nearest thing to a brain among them, is too passive and contemplative to be more than a titular head. There are no survivalists who have long been waiting for the day; no jacks of all trades, conveniently endowed with all the needed skills, and above all no \"natural leaders\" (aka bullies and control freaks) out to remake the world in their own image. (Perhaps Charlie had some ambitions that way, but fortunately he is bumped off before the question can arise). They are in fact just a bunch of very average or even below-average people, trying to make a life for themselves amidst the ruins of the world. That, I suspect, is pretty much how such an aftermath would really be.Indeed, on considering the matter, I feel Stewart did a really good job of making his characters internally consistent. They are, essentially, the ones who come through the end of the world - and just react with a shrug. \"The human race is almost entirely wiped out, civilisation's gone and we're all back in the Dark Ages. Now what do I do about breakfast?\" Well, to be fair, Ish does throw up in the sink when it finally \"sinks\" in that his parents won't ever be coming home, but that's where it ends. If he ever considers the matter again, we aren't told about it. The other characters take a largely similar attitude. Em apparently had a family pre-Disaster, but never talks about them, while Ezra and the others have even less to say. They just write off their losses and \"move on\".Well, fair enough. That is probably exactly how they need to be in the situation. This attitude is probably what allows them to come through without being driven into insanity and/or suicide. But of course it has consequences. First off, it implies a decided lack of empathy toward fellow beings. Unlike some reviewers, I'm not particularly disturbed at their willingness to hang Charlie, and to at least consider \"mercy killing\" of the retarded Evie. Given such personalities, this is exactly how they would be. Indeed, it says much for their basic decency that they agonise as much as they do over the first decision, and never take the second one at all. Stewart has made his characters act \"in character\", as an author should.Secondly, however helpful this attitude was in seeing them through the immediate aftermath, it is far less so when it's time to think of rebuilding. Having taken the Disaster itself almost in their stride, they are likewise accepting of its aftermath, and generally take only such action as is forced on them by circumstances. The \"Lewis and Clark\" expedition in Year 22 is distinctly exceptional. And Ish's basically solitary disposition stultifies his attempt to educate the children. The only one he can \"reach\" is an academic loner exactly like himself, after whose death he essentially gives up. Stewart has wonderfully portrayed how the virtues which were such a help at the start of the book have now turned into vices.Loooking back on it (I first read the book at age ten) I have some minor gripes. In particular, the Great Disaster itself seems more than a little \"sanitised\", with mankind dying and all the bodies neatly tidied away, during Ish's two-week absence. Somehow, that does not quite carry conviction. Apart from that, however, my only real complaint is that Stewart was content with a single book, when the theme deserved a trilogy at least.Read and enjoy","First of all, I think D.D. Shade's analysis of today's society on Earth Abides is unsubstantiated. This book is still a great book today because it is a classic. A classic, by definition, relates to all time. The assination of JFK or MLK would not have had any greater impact on this book. This book, like Ish, will continue to stand the test of time because of it's overall classical themes. That man is the complicating variable on the planet earth. Regardless of if a man or men die, the earth abides.","I read this book in High School in the 70's in Saratoga Ca. I have a teenage daughter and I can't fathom that she is not required to read these types of books anymore. My mind constantly wandered with Ish. I dreamt of what I would do in that situation, of how I would react. Needless to say I finished the book in one weekend well ahead of my classmates, and decided to just start it all over. I recomended the book to my Mom, and she also fell in love with it. Ever since we are both on the lookout for others like it. I have read most of them (The stand, postman, alas babylon, on the beach, SWAN SONG (the best), plus mony other forgetable tales), and thank Earth Abides for my passion for these books. I wish someone would write another that is as good as this.","I have only read 2 books more than once - &quot;Earth Abides&quot; by George R Stewart, and &quot;The Quest of Aah&quot; by Alexan Farelane. If you read one book a week for 70 years, you would only have read 3,640 books in your lifetime. There are millions of books you will never be able to read - even with the Reader's Digest versions! Life is way too short to read the same book twice - except for books which can change your life. These 2 books are &quot;Life Changing&quot; books. The thing which most appeals to me with &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that our hero is just an ordinary guy and his failures are at least as impressive as his successes. He starts off with the best of intentions, becomes an unwilling leader by default, and is unable to persuade the other survivors of the need to maintain and/or restore the facilities and civilization we have come to take for granted. I KNOW that this is exactly how it would happen for me, if I was in his place! I know what I'd want to have happen, but circumstances would prevent me from being able to make it all happen.&quot;The Quest of Aah&quot; is a fantasy about the seven levels, the seven valleys, higher planes of existence, stages on the journey from Earth to Heaven, some of which any spiritual person can relate to, and anyone on a secular plane can be entertained by. The novel is presented as a memory, and is the way we hope it will be when we reach the end of our lives. It is completely different from &quot;Earth Abides&quot;, but if you like speculative fiction, then it is worth a read (or TWO!)","This is a story of the first years and the ensuing decades in the lives of the very few survivors of a natural plague. At first, there is a detailed overview of one survivor's (the main character and often narrator per se) actions in the first several months after the plague. This account of the &quot;short-term&quot; impact of a plague has been seen in other SF stories and might seem repetitous. But where this story is different, and where this novel is in a class of its own, is where the plot goes when this survivor meets others and small families begin and a community develops. The challenges which are faced by and met with by this group are detailed, yet are those involving environment and illness which are perhaps expected. But more interesting is what new moral values that arise and what &quot;holdover&quot; values (school, religion) which are attempted to be maintained, but are not or can't be embraced by the new generations which follow. The book follows the community though several decades, jumping years and stopping to go into detail about an event or time period -- but giving several pages in between as a summary to provide a good junction between sections...thus keeping the story flowing. The book ends with the natural death of the main character and seeing that the new generations have embraced a &quot;new and different&quot; value, knowledge, and societal system which is suprisingly similar to another culture -- and perhaps quietly challenging the reader to ask whether or not such the result is good or bad; and, whether or not the result was destiny, or the result of proper or improper actions of the original group of survivors. For a book written in the late 1940's, it was very, very far ahead of it's time.","After reading Earth Abides in 1968 as a 10th grader, I have read it six more times, getting a new insight of the book each time. My son (11yrs of age) has now read it twice with the same enjoyment as I have. It is a book that makes the mind think, wonder and dream the &quot; WHAT IF&quot; and &quot;COULD IT REALLY HAPPEN&quot; questions. Read it, sit back and think it. After the hair on the back of your neck sits down. Then read again next year.","I first read this book when I was 14, having borrowed it from the school library. I read it twice more in the following year. It affected me deeply and since then it has quite often crossed my mind to find the book again and re-read it. How surprised and happy I am after idly checking this website to see if that title would come up! I plan on ordering the book so I may savour every word of it all over again!","When my teacher first informed our class that we were going to read a science fiction book, my heart sank; I hated science fiction books! However, when I started to read Earth Abides, I found myself becoming engrossed in this book. The plot and the characters were something new and fresh to me in this age of quick storytelling. This was actually the first book I didn't skip to the end to read the final chapter because I was bored. It held my attention the whole time, and I was disappointed when it ended. This book reminds me of the movie &quot;Deep Impact&quot; because of the armageddon plots. I hope this is turned into a movie because it will probably be just as good as the book!","Of the novels written on this subject, I think I have read them all, this is by far the best. Most interesting is the authors attempt to regenerate civilization. Methodically covers natures reaction to the demise of man, fascinating! &quot;The Stand&quot;, &quot;Alas Babylon&quot;, &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; are all outstanding; &quot;Earth Abides&quot; stands alone!!!","I have read this book at least 6 times over the years. It ranks in my judgement with Jules Verne's, &quot;Mysterious Island&quot;, and Johann Wyss', &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot;. I have also read these books at least 7 times as well. I feel the three books could be invaluable in a survival library. They all teach survival in different circumstances!","Typical? maybe today, an age where every scenerio of doom has been played over and over again like some bad rock song. Fear not! This book is good. It was fresh once. . .now it reminds us of what fiction use to be written like. Like a good Doyle or Burroughs. I liked it.","Earth Abides was written by George Stewart and released in 1949. The story follows the main character Ish, short for Isherwood, as he is one of the few people to survive a pandemic that kills the majority of the human population. Ish has an interesting perspective on the incident as he has an academic background and tends to view events through in a very historical, geographical way. Ecology and population dynamics are frequently discussed throughout the story. Stewart explores population fluctuations in nature in comparison to the die off of humans. Much of the story takes place in California, near San Francisco and follows Ish through most of his life following the outbreak. On a practical level, this book contains more generalized preparation information such as the durability of canned food, hunting and gathering methods and the continuation of life without public water and electricity. While Earth Abides is certainly entertaining, it also provides a very unique perspective on the end of civilization and it will leave you with some very interesting ideas for your consideration.","I read Earth Abides months ago, and I still find myself thinking about it often. Some of the reviews I read before I read the book mentioned the book remaining with the reader for years and years; I didn't expect that to be the case for me, but now I think it will. We take so much for granted, both things and people, but what would we do if life as we know it basically vanished? How would we manage alone? What abilities would we need which we don't have now? So much to think about!","This book is not so much about the end of the world itself; instead, it uses the end of the world - the end of most of mankind, anyway - as a plot device to explore how a new, small, totally contained society would develop out of the leavings of the old one. This task it accomplishes quite well; the growth of the Tribe in San Francisco and their mythological beliefs, traditions, and practices is fascinating, if a little slow-moving in several parts. But because societal development is the primary concern of the novel, the little details are simply glossed over, and there are so many technical errors or things left unexplained that it had a tendency to lift me out of the story and re-engage my disbelief. For instance, most of mankind is wiped out by a mysterious, very viral disease, but it's never explained what the disease is, where it came from, or why some people are immune. In fact, the main character of the book comes down out of the hills after it's all over, having no idea what was going on the \"civilized\" world, but he shows a total lack of curiosity about what happened to everybody that I found unbelievable. And when several survivors get together, they never discuss where they were or what happened to them when the Great Disaster (as it's called in the book) went down, which I think goes totally against human nature. And the survivors continue to live off the leavings for forty or more years afterward, eating canned food that must have long since gone bad and even smoking cigarettes that had to have been unsmokeable after at least a year. They never bother to start even a rudimentary garden - an idea which I think would have occurred to just about anybody - but somehow manage to live in nearly perfect health until old age without eating any fresh fruits or vegetables. Again, I understand that these details weren't important to the author, but they were important to me, and so these little problems served to disrupt what was otherwise a well-written, intriguing take on the old end-of-the-world plot.","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it.

The internal debate and conflict and the final resolution are wonderful. The characters are personable and easy to relate to. More importantly, in the time of the H1N1 virus and other diseases, a harsh and jolting wake-up call to humanity and civilization. Worth every cent.","This book is amazing in that it was written so long ago (1949). I have had dreams for as long as I can remember that resemble this story, but I only read it this year. It's a quick read but one must pay attention to keep up. Some things that were not accomplished by the people are disappointing, but since technology has changed the way we live in the last 60 years so greatly, who's to say what he would rewrite today. Overall I really liked it. I started reading this at a friend's house and just had to buy to reread again.","One of the best realistic future novels I have read, I enjoyed reading it many years ago,and reading it again was just as enjoyable, couldn't put it down, its not the usual science fiction story, but a realistic account of how ordinary people would react in these conditions, I highly recommend it I.M.J.","read it in Jr. High and it is still just as great today at age 67.","I first read this book back in 1967. At that time I was a kid and the whole story seemed to be nothing but \"science fiction.\" I read about the way Ish went through his life, with a disbelief that it could ever happen here and now.However, today I look at the possibility that civilization could be shattered by the loss of what we have come to consider the essential necessities of life - electricity, water, gas, gasoline, telephone, computers, drug stores and grocery stores. Now when I read Earth Abides, I realize that this story could actually happen to us. The problems that Ish had to deal with are now possible. As I read this story, I found myself wondering how I would handle dwindling supplies, the threats of animals and disease, the decreasing availability of items that spoil or evaporate, the social interaction with people, both good and bad. I wondered how I would deal with the lack of food, water, and medicine? Would I be able to survive in a deserted city with no electricity? With terrorists threatening to destroy our way of life, this book could be a survival guide for the modern man.I especially found the greatest distress in this book was the way knowledge was lost. First Ish wanted to read and then it became less important and then the books fell apart. Ish became an antique with knowledge of things that meant nothing to the younger generation that was growing up around him. This book should be used to teach us all a lesson - that we must keep the flame of knowledge burning all the time or we could lose it so very fast.","This 1949 novel is one of the earliest explorations of the theme of a doomsday plague. Our hero, named Ish, is a young college student who returns from the mountains to find out that an airborne virus has wiped out over 99.99 percent of the population in remarkably tidy fashion, leaving behind only a handful of survivors.It is hard to rate a book like this. On the one hand, it is well written, and, despite a few implausible suppositions, manages to explores a number of interesting ideas and insights.But there is a big problem: Our hero, Ish, is completely wicked -- an amoral, self-worshiping, arrogant, elitist monster; and the author seems to be on his side. I understand that books of this type tend to be misanthropic fantasies, and even understand the appeal. But I cannot stomach Ish.Ish is not particularly upset by the tragedy, since he never had much use for his fellow man. Still, his first reaction is to contemplate suicide. He can think of no reason to live. How this differs from his outlook before the tragedy is unclear, but he apparently bemoans the loss of superior human specimens who are mirror images of himself -- detached, scientific, rational, and essentially amoral. He ultimately rejects suicide, only because he decides it might be scientifically interesting to observe the continuing downfall of humanity. That he might try HELPING his fellow survivors never occurs to him.It immediately occurs to him that there must be other survivors, but just as quickly concludes that the shock of the tragedy will soon destroy most of them as well, because of their difficulty adapting. He calls this theory \"secondary kill\". On his first day of searching, he finds no less than 5 survivors, but immediately writes them off as not worth saving, according to his quasi-darwinian \"secondary kill\" theory. He then drives entirely from the west coast to the east coast and back, without ever finding a single human being who he thinks deserves life. No matter how many survivors he finds, he persists in regarding himself as the last surviving human. Only Ish counts. (Again, how this differs from his outlook before the tragedy is unclear).He then returns to his California home and sits around eating out of cans and reading books. While reading the New Testament, he ponders the fact that Judeo-Christian morals are obsolete, since he has no neighbors to love. My jaw dropped. What about all those traumatized survivors he abandoned to die according to his detached and rational \"secondary kill\" theory?But then he starts reading the Song of Solomon, and realizes he wants a woman. Almost immediately, a beautiful woman, a fellow elitist, drops out of the blue and into his bed. Soon a handful of survivors, who Ish persists on regarding as inferior beings, gather around them and form a sort of a tribe. This is one of the more implausible aspects of the novel. Ish a leader? He may have all of Hitler's faults, but he has none of his virtues.Happily for Ish, all of the other characters (except for one man whom Ish murders) have personalities even less forceful than his own. He arranges to marry off all the tribe's children, including his own daughters, at the far-too-young and not-entirely-willing age of 13, without a peep of protest from his own wife or anyone else. (Incidentally, this is a terrible scheme if you want to preserve a high level of culture, which Ish claims is his goal). Nor does anyone protest his scheme to murder a newcomer for the crime of having a venereal disease. The only person he has any regard for is one of his many sons, who he thinks of as a mirror image of himself. But then tragedy strikes, dashing Ish's hopes for the preservation of Ish-manity.Very early on, Ish remarks, almost out of the blue, that he does not want to become a god. This is such a strange thought that I think he doth protest too much. In any event, it is virtually all he achieves. For instance, his efforts as schoolmaster, though failing to teach, succeed in instilling superstitious reverence for himself in his pupils.","Unlike all contagious diseases before this one that traveled over time, this contagion sprung up globally at about the same time. For practical purposes the human race is extinct. Isherwood \"Ish\" Williams survives the pandemic, but wonders if he is the last man on earth.In what was once called California, Ish eventually meets up with a small rag tag band of shocked survivors. As his cohorts just try to live, they turn to Ish, more an introspective loner, as the leader. Reluctantly he takes charge not knowing what the future will bring or even if there is even going to be a future.This is a reprint of a highly regarded post apocalypse tale first released in 1949. The story is actually told over a period of years broken into five major parts of which the above only briefly touches on the first two sections. Ish is a terrific protagonist whose belief in survival changes over time as he observes his little colony mature. Thriller fans will enjoy this strong after the doomsday tale that in some ways shows its pre-information age initial publication, but remains a strong cautionary story.Harriet Klausner","This review will be short and simple as there are tons of detailed reviews already available.Earth Abides is great. It turns over and over in your head for days, weeks, months, & years.. just as a great book should. Not only does it provide a glimpse into the possible future, it also shows what it was like back in mid-1900s America. Definitely a thinker's book. I'd recommend it to anyone, ESPECIALLY if you like post-apocalyptic/last man on earth type tales.","Many of the previous reviewers state that they originally read this book a long time ago, and how it stuck with them over the years. For me, the pleasure of reading Earth Abides is a very recent event, but I do know that like those other reviewers, this will be a book that will stay with me for a long time.Originally published in 1949, Earth Abides still reads fresh. It describes the life journey of the graduate student \"Ish,\" a more intelligent that average, bookish, slightly passive young man who is one of the few human survivors of a catastrophic virus outbreak. Early on, he travels from one side of the former United States of America to the other, and back again. Living in the home of his parents, he slowly meets other survivors: some are compatible and eventually group together to become members of The Tribe, others who are not, and do not. Earth Abides is a tale of the survival of a man, of a group, and of a planet without the continuing influence and domination of human civilization.This is fundamentally a book of journeys: a travel across post-apocalyptic America, within the remnants of the surviving San Francisco Bay area, of some of the Tribe's offspring attempting another cross-country journey, but most powerfully, it is the journey of Ish, as a survivor and young man, as a reluctant leader, as a torch-bearer of the hope of the re-establishment of the former Civilization, as a semi-god and The Last American, and finally as an old man who accepts that man will survive in new ways, not in the old ways, and that no matter what, that the Earth itself will abide.","A few days ago I listened to a lecture by renown geneticist Francisco Ayala. He discussed a simple experiment demonstrating Darwin's concept of natural selection. If you take a test tube holding 10 cc of the bacterium E. coli, it will hold approximately 20 billion organisms. Adding a drop of a modern antibiotic like gentamicin into the tube will result in the survival of some 200 cells (out of the original 20,000,000,000). However, since those cells are now gentamicin resistant, in only a few days the tube will again hold 20 billion (now gentamicin resistant) E. coli cells. The only E. coli cells that made additional copies of themselves were the ones with the mutation for gentamicin resistance. Evolution has occurred.What happens when the human race is hit with a viral \"antibiotic\"? What happens when a population of 6 billion humans is suddenly, within a week, turned into a population of 600, scattered across the planet?One thing is for sure... the population won't rebound in a few days.College student Ish Williams is one of the survivors. Although he thinks it is because he suffered a rattlesnake bite during the plague, unless all the other survivors also had a similar snakebite (even in places rattlesnakes don't exist), he probably already possessed whatever mutation that made him plague resistant.From his home in the San Francisco Bay region, he drives across country, looking for survivors while seeing first hand the beginnings of civilization's decay. As for survivors, they are rare indeed. But some people, like Ish, did survive.Back in the San Francisco Bay area, Ish and a few companions begin to rebuild civilization. But when the survivors don't include an engineer, a physician, a teacher, a scientist, or even a farmer, our \"survival knowledge\" is limited indeed.Author George Stewart wrote this book in 1949, so a number of the technological issues are quite dated. Nevertheless, survival isn't easy. Ish and others have to deal with exploding populations of wild cattle, and rats, and dogs. They have to find something besides canned food. They have to ensure water is still available. And they have to teach the children, so they don't forget.\"Yes, [Ish] reluctantly concluded, this matter of the children's beliefs was extremely serious. In the Old Times [pre-plague] the beliefs held by the children of any family or small group of families might be momentous enough, but still those children on growing up would come into contact with other beliefs and make adjustments. Besides, there had been a great, even overwhelming, mass of tradition - the tradition of Christianity, or of Western civilization, or of Indo-European folkways, or of Anglo-American culture. Call it what you wished, it was still so tremendous that you might say it was omnipotent, for good or bad absorbing the individual.But now their little community had lost much of the tradition. Part of it had been lost because no seven survivors... could preserve and transmit all of it. Part had been lost because for so long a time there had been no big children to pass on the tradition to the small ones. The oldest of the younger generation had been taught games by their parents, not by older comrades. The community should therefore be plastic to an unprecedented degree. This was an opportunity, but also a responsibility - and a danger....Now, more certainly even than before, he knew that he had the opportunity to be the founder of a religion for a whole people. What he told the children in school, they would probably believe. He could insure their memory of it by mere insistence and iteration. He could tell them that the Lord God created the earth in six days, and found it good. They would believe. He could tell them a local Indian legend that the world was the work of Old Man Coyote. They would believe\" (p. 222-223).Sobering, and interesting. Stewart ends by writing, \"Men go and come, but earth abides\" (p. 345).","I first read this novel over 20 years ago in a college history course. It's a story that has stayed with me, and I recently wanted to discover if the book was a good as I remembered it to be. Well, in one sense, it was: Stewart's style is still powerful, the plot timely, and the characters all too human in how they react to the end of the world as they've known it. What I also discovered was how dated this novel is, for some of the same reasons it's still a good story: 'Ish', the main character, is right out of the Cold War era, as he's chauvinistic, detatched, and more than a little pompous at times. The plot is all too familiar to our post-modern world (and King's 'The Stand' has some similarities): some kind of plague wipes out most of the world's population; Ish, bitten by a rattlesnake right before this happens, survives. The first part of the book really puts the reader into a world where Ish fears he is the last survivor. Even when he encounters others, he feels no connection to them. On his cross country trip, he sees no reason to stay with even the kind people he meets; instead, he returns to his parents' house, where he begins to plan for some kind of rebuilding of the former society. Eventually, he meets 'Em', a mixed race older woman, and they collect a small group of survivors who try to continue life as they knew it, children are born, and 'The Tribe' grows. Inserted in the narrative is Stewart's description of the title: as mankind and his works diminish, animals, native plants, nature itself transform and overtake 'civilization'...\"Men come and go, but earth abides\" (345). At times, Stewart and Ish overdo it with the dramtic language. Ish is not always the most sympathetic character, pompous and seeing himself superior to most of The Tribe. The Tribe doesn't seem to really have the energy to truly rebuild -- or even build anew -- another existence; the incident when the water system breaks down is the best example: even Ish realizes that the survivors and their children don't have either the desire or the knowledge to fix the problem and continue to enjoy indoor plumbing. Even the digging of latrines is never really finished, as no one seems to care when the work gets too hard. One does feel for Ish when he finally realizes that no one cares about the old education; The Tribe essentially regresses to hunting and small farming, but also seems happier than the 'modern' man ever was. Stewart had a good idea of modern man's virtues and foibles, and also provides a thought-provoking study which makes the reader ask \"what would I do in this same situation?\" You can also see, historically, where this novel fits into the US Cold War fears of complete annihilation of our 'great' way of life, and the land of plenty that the US was in this era: how do the survivors eat? They plunder the cans in the supermarkets for decades. The Tribe simply forages off of what's left behind, and at no time does it seem that the leftovers will ever end. It's an interesting comment on the world Stewart knew, and a compliment to the abundance in the US in the late 1940s, when the novel was first written.","George R. Stewart's main character isn't as helpless as a quick glance at the first page reviews may imply. He is a character that is able to do significant hands-on tasks such as auto mechanics, hunting, lead a small surviving group of humanity, and teach and school children. He is just not an expert in these fields, which isn't too surprising for a random person, but in many cases his knowledge and aptitude turned out quite useful. It's just that when one is dealing with what could be the last of humanity, a lot is needed for the human race to go on. Written in 1949, Stewart's Earth Abides makes one reminiscent of that time and of what was available then. Stewart takes some time to describe what happens to the other mammals, although I'm not sure if the prey vs. predator equilibrium was a new idea at that time since he does elaborate on it quite a bit. His visions of primitive and/or overly religious societies in humanity's backslide in certain areas will be quite well known to those that follow more modern writings and films of `the end of the world' genre.The setting takes place in three time eras, one right after the disease that wipes out most of humanity, one 22 years later, and the last at over 42 years later-probably 50+ years. The first takes place more or less in the time the book was published, 1949. The other one has to realize would then be taking place in what would then be 1971. Now Stewart makes the 22 years go by fairly quickly, but thinking about what happened in the real world between 1949 and 1971, the James Dean era, the hippy movement, Vietnam War, the start of the oil crunch, makes one realize a lot can happen in 22 years as opposed to what Stewart writes. What Stewart seems more to be writing about, isn't the end of the world, but the laziness of man, which eventually becomes a downfall for some and something that needs to be overcome. Now I don't know if he was writing about something he saw in his workplace or in the armed forces if he was in WWII, but he does take it to an extreme. Sure some people may just be tired of an 8 hour workday, when there's so many aspects of life out there, but it's hard to believe one would maintain an utterly lazy lifestyle for 22 years, when there wasn't any need to worry about food for the short term, or how one's retirement plans were going, and instead, without these shackles on one's mind in terms of worrying about the future, not feel free or have interest about how to rebuild society. There are some groups of people in the real world that if you get two of them together, they'll come up with three visions for the future as opposed to almost no visions by the characters of the novel.The book is also a bit too ideal. Maybe it really was like this in 1949, but the world as I've seen it would have the character's in marital disputes, the usual utterances of \"you suck,\" some saying to get rid of old man Ish, let's move our group, this in no good, that is no good, and so on. However, what makes this novel different from, say the usual post-nuclear-war book, isn't just healthy young men surviving, but a random group of people surviving that somehow have immunity to the disease (although one could say those that have built an immunity by being bitten by a snake represents a certain group of people and that would skew the randomness that Stewart tried to set up in the survivors), so his vision of the type of characters that survive may have some credibility.Overall it was a fun book to read. Stewart has a flowing, easygoing style that makes you want to keep reading to see how things turn out. It does get a little slow around the 200 page mark, so, as in other books, you just have to plow through it to get to the end. I'd recommend this book. It's one of the better post-apocalyptic novels that came out in the 40's and 50's, and is a compelling read.","I read this book in the 60s, just over a decade after it came out. When I read some of the reviews here, I decided to skim through it again. What had surprised me were the negative reviews. I remembered the story as a very interesting one, with characters I could appreciate, if not like.What I found different was the fiction that has come along in the past 40 years. In \"the old days\" fiction often was more thoughtful with less action and more introspection. Characters did not always solve the problems with which they were confronted (although I must admit that this was not the case as often in science fiction). Stewart in Earth Abides gives us a world in which nearly the entire population of the earth has died from a pandemic. Ish, the main character, spends much time alone in the beginning. As the few survivors begin to gather together, they look to him for leadership, something he's not certain he is qualified to do. The exception is that he is well read, and his greatest passion is to preserve the library in the area in which he lives.(spoiler lieth here) Some of the reviewers here seem surprised at the deterioration of civilization amongst the group. Were they as surprised if they read Lord of the Flies? True, those characters were all children, but many of Stewart's characters are uneducated or unsophisticated, who never understand Ish's preoccupation with the knowledge housed in that library. They are too busy learning to survive with none of the trappings of modern life, and without the tools to re-create that life. The story is depressing as one reads the slide into savagery. But what is represented is one possible outcome should such a holocaust occur in the world.For different outcomes, try reading Day of the Triffids (there be monsters), or Malevil. Or see the old b&w; film Things to Come. This was once a very popular sub-genre of science fiction and many possible outcomes have been depicted.","Wow, just wow. I can see that a lot of better reviewers have already had their say, but I've never been this moved and impressed.I was concerned about getting a book that was so old, but there really weren't many references that took me out of Ish's shoes: The lack of TVs, the attitude of and towards the African Americans (to avoid using his words), and to entertainers of whom I only recognized Bob Hope. Other than that it could have easily happened today.I'm pleased by how the book was ordered, with most of the chapters covering only a year in detail with a chapter about the intervening years between sections. It probably would've been easy to pad out those years rather than summarizing them, but it would've been too much.Most of all I like the short sections in the middle of chapters, largely in the first section, that help to break it up and provide a omniscient viewpoint and a break from Ish's lesser understanding and awareness. The portions relating to how the different plants and animals were affected interested me greatly.I'm very happy with the ending as well. Overall the book has several good thinking points. Definitely one I would suggest to others.","Glowing reviews, word of mouth praise and the subject matter all left me eager to read Earth Abides. Unfortunately this book fell far short of my expectations. The premise of a global plague is truly fascinating (and frightening), especially in light of recent world events, but the story drags on in such a depressing and mundane fashion that reading the book became a chore rather than an adventure. The lead character's over inflated opinion of himself is so prevalent through out the book that it prevents any character development on the part of any other survivors. Over 300 pages and you barely get to know any of them. That would not have mattered so much if the author had done a better job of portraying the aftermath of the plague. Too little attention was paid to what would happen to the local environment. Impacts are generally glossed over in short, simplistic passages. Survival was no more difficult than raiding the local grocery store and opening a can of beans, even after 20 years. I never felt the horror and struggle for survival that one would expect with such a global catstrophe. The technology in the book is certainly dated but I didn't find that a distraction. This is not an enjoyable read. Better classics on man wiping himself out include \"On the Beach\" and \"Alas, Babylon\". For a more up to date adventure try \"Ill Wind\" by Anderson & Beason.","I love to read, so there are very few books I don't finish. I usually slog through even the bad ones. Here's my take on this book. I was looking for a novel about how people came up with creative ideas about how to survive in a world after civilization is wiped out. This book dealt with that facet somewhat in the first hundred pages. After that most of the book deals with moral issues. \"What are the moral or ethical responsibilities of survivors\" is the main theme of the rest of the book. After an ok start, the whole rest of the book seemed preachy and a little like the author was trying to coerce me into agreeing with his point of view. Three-quarters of the way through the book I quit reading, because there were no characters I was interested in enough to care what happened to them.","Written by a self-righteous professor of English Lit from Berkeley. The authors preconceived notions about the ignorance of rest of us comes across pretty clearly, as his protagonist constantly judges everyone based on his perception of their intelligence. Book was very poorly researched....the protagonist and his children live mostly off of 20-30 year old canned food for most of the book (something that would probably kill you). He fixes up a jeep and then fills it with 20 year old gasoline (which is unusable a year or two after its refined). He raises his offspring in total ignorance...his greatest achievement being to teach them how to make a bow and start a fire (teaching them to read was apparently not important). Worse end of the world book I've ever read.","The plot in Earth Abides is very simple. It is basically the ongoing struggle one would face in creating a perfect society. The setting is in San Francisco, California after a great disease has struck and wiped out 99% of the human population. The main character is a survivor named Ish. He survived the disease an interesting way, and then sets out to build a new society. Through his trials and errors you find out the complexity to people and modern society. You understand the restraints that society has on a person, even if it is not present. For example alcohol is a big part in the novel. Without anyone to stop them, people begin to drink themselves to death.Earth Abides' plot is thin, and dragged to eternity and back. The author spends the majority of the second half of the book reasoning about worthless issues. They were worthless because they do not apply to the main theme of survival. This makes you very confused, as the book is already hard to follow. He also spends a good deal of pages with Ish's inner thoughts, which are basically a bunch of complex nonsense. It is very hard to put your self in his place, and understand his thoughts. He becomes so paranoid with every decision he makes, that he becomes overly analytical.This book could possibly be amusing to very patient adults. It has close to zero action, and does not keep you turning pages. In reality it is the exact opposite, it puts you to sleep. Anyone who likes a book that keeps you interested, Earth Abides is not for you. The only person I would recommend this book to, would be an insomniac who needs to find a way to get to sleep.","Not really SiFi. Fiction and Apocalyptic yes, but after a very few chapters to grab your interest, author drifts off into non-related daydreaming, repetition and his personal philosophy on various character's lives. I'm betting that he was a self proclaimed authority and certainly a pipe smoker.No science, little innovation, but it goes on and on. You keep hoping it will get better, but unfortunately, it doesn't. How it won any award remains a mystery to me. If you are looking for an exciting science fiction work, sorry, but this isn't it.","Having loved this story 20 years ago as a teenager, it pains me now to find that it is surely the worst novel on my bookshelves. All the characters are two-dimensional. The dialogue is uniformly stiff and amateurish. The story's hero is arrogant, aloof and dismissive of anyone he perceives as inferior. Since he actually perceives *everyone* as inferior, the book quickly becomes very tiresome. Perhaps the saddest aspect of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that the story is clearly and shockingly the fantasy of someone who dreamed of existing in a world without people, or at most with just a thin sprinkling of simple folks over whom he could rule as their intellectual master. &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is a truly awful book.","I love a good post-apoc book, but this one just wasn't that great. Other than the narrator, the male characters aren't very well developed and the female characters were even worse. The jumps in time threw me off and the overall plot just didn't grab me.","I'm surprised so many people rated this book so highly. It's hideously dated, both in language, and in writing style. Not even in the same ballpark as something like The Stand. It was interesting to think about what path civilization would take without a unifying threat after an apocalypse, but the writing just ruined it for me. No great character development at any point, a lot of cliches and brushed over details. It kept me reading, barely, mostly to see if it went anywhere. Pretty disappointing though.","I am a fan of similar themed books. But this one just does nothing for me. The only interesting aspect is the (almost consuming) focus on how other animals in the biosphere react to the human population crashing down.But that doesn't make up for these huge flaws:1) The interpersonal aspects are awful.People just don't relate to each other the way the author describes.2) Dominated bi sudo-Christian bible verse that gets added in to say something meaningful is happening3) The storyline takes place so long ago that it is hard to see it as anything but a time-piece.4) Racist, sexist views embedded very deep in the assumptions5) Overall a very boring story line. No emotional growth in the characters and no growth in the community or plot. Just terrible, really.","My hobby is reading . I enjoy reading stories. all kinds of stories by bestselling authors or never heard of authors. always looking for a good story. In my search I have read some great stories, some not so great and just plain awful. but only three times have I ever disliked a story where I could not finish it. This story was so bad not only could I not finish it I would like a refund. the story line could of been interesting. The writing was horrible. I hope it is a long time before I come across a book this bad again.","I read this book when I was in my early teens during a time when I read many sci-fi books. This one stuck with me. I won't repeat what others have said, but this book struck me as a beautifully told story about a horrible, if remote, possibility. I'm happy to stumble over it here and see that it's still in print and people are still reading it. I guess it's become somewhat of a classic, and it deserves to be.","This story is as contemporary as it was when it was first published in 1949. Except for a few references to the availability of hand cranked phonographs, there is no indication that this disaster and it's aftermath didn't take place in the present. The story is told entirely in the third person. This would generally seem to be tedious, however is simply does not loose its hold on you. The writing is careful, the author is economical in the use of words that describe concepts. The premise of the story is simple: a deadly virus sweeps the earth and within a few weeks all of mankind is gone. There remains only isolated individuals who eventually find each other and begin life again in the altered world.I first read this book in my early thirties. It impacted my life to the point that I always referred to the reading of this book as one of the turning points in my life. I have now reread it with the perspective of 20 additional years and it has the same impact. I was so struck with the understanding Stewart conveys of the emptiness of contemporary life. This emptiness is not to be construed as useless. The grand civilization we have constructed is great, is a monumental, exciting and dynamic achievement. But if you put all these achievements against the needs of a group of people that will eventually have no access to prepared foods, electricity on demand, water and heat or cooling, instant access to far away members of their family, by telephone, car, plane, fax, etc., you soon see what the hero saw: What the emerging generations needed was a basic knowledge of hunting and gathering. Laws become obsolete, customs change to suit the need of the group, language changes and a thought that resonates within me, is the idea of the God of the Bible. Because the Bible refers specifically to groups of people and their interaction, what is there to refer to, when the groups and the interaction are gone? For me, the consummate fundamental Christian, this is very thought provoking and brings me into another dimension: to examine my faith and trust and what it is I have faith and trust in and for. This book should be required reading for Sociology, Anthropology and Psychology students. Absolutely wonderful!!","This was one of the first books I read as a kid. I was enthralled back then with the idea of a plague wiping out the vast majority of people so my father suggested \"Earth Abides\" as a suitable read. I enjoyed rereading the book as an adult recalling the same fascination with the storyline as I did over 25 years ago. The author tells the survival story of Isherwood Williams, a man who evades a plague due to a counteraction to a snake bite.The author peppers the pages with intricate details such as Isherwood's realization that he is a good candidate to survive the aftermath since he was young and fit and had his appendix removed. Even so, he took care while descending a flight of stairs, concerned that even the slightest injury could be fatal in a post-pandemic world. At one point, Isherwood sees a Coke-a-Cola sign in the distance flashing on and off (like they used to do in the 70's) and wonders how long the power will stay on without people maintaining the infrastructure. Later as children are born to the survivors, he feels no need to correct their improper English since there was no longer a basis for proper spoken word.An interesting point about this storyline is that presumably those that did survive the epidemic would have had a natural immunity to the disease, but those like Isherwood, surviving by a counter reaction, could pass on the susceptibility to the disease to future generations.Throughout the book Isherwood possesses a hammer that first is a mere tool, but later comes to symbolize his authority and a new justice. Along the way, many difficult decisions are faced by the people of the new society. The author assembles an extensive expanse of possibilities all logically facing the survivors of a new world. I highly recommend this book as I have for many years.","I recently re-read this book after twenty five years. The story drives with a unique force as the naturally detached observer-protagonist Isherwood witnesses the Earth and Mankind's remnants slowly re-establish a new balance. This reacquaintence also served as a reflection on myself.As a teenager, I was drawn to Ish's character, much like my own at the time: quiet, reflective, socially uncomfortable. I took great delight in identifying that the book took place in my own neighborhood: The rock where they carved the years is a perfect description of Indian Rock in Berkeley, where I climbed countless times as a kid. For years after, wherever I went I liked to see how unkept gardens took over their yards, how abandoned houses returned slowly to Nature's way, how unused roads returned to the soil at a relentless if geologic pace.As a man in my 40s I find the tale retains its fascinating hold. I still like to see how Man's works change in their own way when left alone, just as any other object in nature. Much of Stewart's description of that change rings true and is well visualized. But most striking to me was that the nature of the characters had changed in my mind. No longer were they just people like myself, making the best out of this extraordinary circumstance. The second time around, the characters were very unsatisfying. Ish is the only one with any ambition at all, and he is unable to make anything of it. This is due entirely to his personal failings: the social stiffness he never outgrew, his lack of focus, his increasingly insular view of his place in the surrounding world. I was particularly offended by a scene of &quot;crime&quot; and punishment. Yet these are not failings of the author nor of the book. Stewart was simply taking the opportunity to show that, barring the survival of some remarkably talented and organized people, civilization is not by any means guaranteed to carry on. Though &quot;The Stand&quot; is more entertaining, &quot;Earth Abides&quot; remains much more satisfying.","I first came across this book while stationed in Vietnam in 1971. The story is about the life and times of a young geologist who escapes a catastrophe that causes the deaths of almost all of the population of the world. As you read, you see how this young man copes with loneliness and then love after finding another survivor.These two begin a life together and eventually establish friendship with other survivors and then form a \"tribe\". As chapters pass by, they are named for significant events in the tribe's lives during the year.I have read and re-read this book to the point that I will need to purchase another copy in the near future.","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it. This maturity is perceptible all along this work.The story is situated in a world devastated by a sudden pestilence that annihilates most of humankind. Taking into account the last SARS epidemic that jumped abruptly from China to Canada it doesn't look an impossible scenario.This is the story.Isherwood Williams comes down from an isolate spot in the mountains to discover an empty world. He starts searching for survivors all across USA, from California to New York and back again. He finds only isolate human cells, couples or trios, overwhelmed by catastrophe and in a near catatonic state.Returns to his native town and contemplate with a certain scientific detachment the fading world around him.Mr. Stewart intercalate brief vignettes describing what happens to dogs, cats, cattle, plants, roads, dams and bridges, contrasting them with Ish's daily experiences.Little by little the story grip reader's attention and even if action is somehow slow, the book can't be put down.Human cells began to draw near each other and a rather feeble structure starts growing up.The author approaches universal questions about survival and extinction; civilization and savagery; social structure and anomie. He also examines religious values, ethics and life's ultimate sense.This book gives the reader a lot of stuff to think about. A very enticing read!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","Reading Earth Abides what struck me most was not the story, though this was certainly well told and presented, but how bravely the book took an unusual tack on its chosen topic: the survival factor of our civilisation and man himself when measured against geologic or cosmic time as represented by the planet Earth. Normally we are reasured that the embers of civilisation and man will never go out, and that we will always triumph as a species. Almost every film, book or play impresses this perception upon it's audience. And at first, as Isherwood works to rebuild, it seems Earth Abides will follow the same route. Then things start to change, and the reader begins to feel an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of their stomach; Isherwood's attempts start to fail, and the flickering ember of 20th century civilisation begins to dim. At the last, time takes its own course, and our ability to outlast even our own planet, never mind spread to the Universe as many SF books believe, is brought into question. And it is with this that the book triumphs. We are asked to question our entire society, and its true prospects for survival. One of the few books I've read that made me question the daily trip to the office, not from the point of view of myself, but my entire species, and to wonder what on Earth we are doing to ensure the real future of our species.","I did not notice the year until the second reading. The story plays out today as well as it did in the forties.Profound and thought inspiring. My wife is a lit major and had little experience with SF. This book opened a new world for her. It is unfortunate more of Stewart's work is not available.I was originally intrigued by the location. San Lupo Drive is San Luis Drive in the hills of Berkeley, CA. The rocks are Indian Rock Park. Everthing fits. Stewart talks of walking down to to a shopping district, Solano Avenue.The cleanliness of society's destruction was an interseting twist. No mess and madness. Imagine suddenly being a surviver on the planet.A good series to read is Earth Abides, Lucifer's Hammer, and Into the Woods. Throw in The Children of Men.","Earth Abides will no doubt remain one of the classic post-apocalyptic books of our era. The characters are well-developed and easy to like and the setting is as familiar as the Golden Gate bridge and the Oakland hills (where most of the story takes place). When I first read Earth Abides at the age of twelve, I thought it a fascinating and engaging tale that kept me turning pages well into the night. Now, at forty-five, I find it somewhat quirky, ethically questionable, and rather unrealistic in it's study of human nature. Despite the great effort George R. Stewart puts into developing well-rounded characters, most of their attitudes and beliefs would be more suited to the 19th century than the 21st. Racism and sexism are both a noticeable undercurrent and the academic elitism of the main character starts out annoying then rapidly becomes nauseating.Although a powerfully thought-provoking read at the age of 12, at the age of 45 I find it strongly dated and woefully inadequate. Still, it is a classic and is well worth reading for anyone with an interest in post-apocalyptic fiction, anthropology, or the foundations of social order.","This was a great book, but not an action-filled book. It is a book to generate ideas, not to get the adrenaline flowing. If it ever comes to a survival situation as posited in the book, life won't be glamorous. It will be mundane, a matter of getting food and having a dry place to sleep. Stewart gives us good reasons for why this is so.I wrote the following this morning, trying to sort out why Ish is the leader for the group:In reading the complaints of those who don't like Earth Abides, it seemed to me that many were disappointed that George R. Stewart did not create a group of super-humans to rebuild society. Why didn't they plan better? Why didn't they show more interest, more creativity? The author chose a group of ordinary people, who were used to living in a civilization doing everything for them, from providing their food, to thinking and planning.One of the points that is frequently missed for those reading \"Earth Abides\" is the way humans behave. As long as their needs are taken care of, many people tend to let the rest of life come as it will. Making plans takes mental effort, and that is where only Ish has any experience. The energy to think ahead, and to make others see what is coming, that is what makes a leader great.Ish is a scholar--he's well on the way to becoming a professor. That path makes him a professional thinker and ponderer and not a man of action. His career makes him one who watches from the sidelines without getting involved, and even if that were not the case, his personality pushes him in that direction. He is not a people person--he's a loner, uncomfortable in the company of others. He's a geek, more interested in privacy and private pursuits than in being a leader. Ish has half of the great leader equation; he has the energy to think ahead. What he lacks is the ability to convey what he sees to others.When he thinks of himself as a leader by default, he is being realistic; of his band of seven adults, no other shows any sign of talent for leading. The one person in the group with strong social abilities, Ezra, defers to Ish. George is \"dull,\" a man of craft who's job as plumber involves rushing to fix broken things; he is accustomed to reacting, not to making plans. George's wife's main concern is domestic tasks, and in this, she is a product of her age. Of Ezra's two wives, neither shows any signs of interest in planning for the group. Of all of the group, only Em leads when Ish cannot. Where he is the geek, timid and unable to marshal people, she is the one with backbone, who gets people moving when she sees a need. She lets Ish plan, perhaps, because she lives in the here and now, and only leads when she sees a clear cut need or threat in the immediate future. She doesn't worry about the future, because for the present, all the needs are taken care of.This is the group that survived the Great Disaster in Berkeley; seven ordinary people, products of a country that has professional leaders, so that the people don't have to think.There are also a number of complaints about the main character, Ish. People who disliked the book tended to write negative comments about him. In fairness, Ish is not a leader; he is a geek, one interested in private pursuits. He is introverted. Unfortunately for his social tastes, he is the sole person left in the Berkeley area who was accustomed to thinking and judging on a daily basis. This makes him the one who others turn to for ideas, the leader. As the leader, his decisions come out of his non-charismatic, introverted self. He is not a natural teacher (and in spite of this he is the only one to attempt to teach). These social weaknesses, however, are tied to his intellectual strengths. A different main character could have had different strengths, but then the reader would not have been treated to Ish's unique views as to what happened to the world after the fall of civilization.About Ish's attitude: Reviewers have accused him of acting as if others are too emotional, too black)--I think these opinions about how Ish interacts with his world ignore Ish's nature. He isn't judgmental, he is professionally distanced. In a state resembling shock, he turns a scientific eye upon the world, as if the world means nothing to him. He's lost his country and family and everything but his life's work (which was ecologist, one studying the interactions of living things and environment). If he hides behind his life's work in a time of crisis and shock, he isn't the first. Journalists do this all the time. Work now, think about yourself later.About the racist elements: Ish never really shows signs of being racist (but he was living in a racist society--segregation was the law of the land in 1949. And mixed marriages were illegal in many states). He is a product of that society. But in looking at the rural black people, his tone is almost admiration--THEY will survive when all the rest can't.","I read this book when I was in my early teens during a time when I read many sci-fi books.

A different main character could have had different strengths, but then the reader would not have been treated to Ish's unique views as to what happened to the world after the fall of civilization.About Ish's attitude: Reviewers have accused him of acting as if others are too emotional, too black)--I think these opinions about how Ish interacts with his world ignore Ish's nature. He isn't judgmental, he is professionally distanced. In a state resembling shock, he turns a scientific eye upon the world, as if the world means nothing to him. He's lost his country and family and everything but his life's work (which was ecologist, one studying the interactions of living things and environment). If he hides behind his life's work in a time of crisis and shock, he isn't the first. Journalists do this all the time. Work now, think about yourself later.About the racist elements: Ish never really shows signs of being racist (but he was living in a racist society--segregation was the law of the land in 1949. And mixed marriages were illegal in many states). He is a product of that society. But in looking at the rural black people, his tone is almost admiration--THEY will survive when all the rest can't.","I first read this book back in 1967. At that time I was a kid and the whole story seemed to be nothing but \"science fiction.\" I read about the way Ish went through his life, with a disbelief that it could ever happen here and now.However, today I look at the possibility that civilization could be shattered by the loss of what we have come to consider the essential necessities of life - electricity, water, gas, gasoline, telephone, computers, drug stores and grocery stores. Now when I read Earth Abides, I realize that this story could actually happen to us. The problems that Ish had to deal with are now possible. As I read this story, I found myself wondering how I would handle dwindling supplies, the threats of animals and disease, the decreasing availability of items that spoil or evaporate, the social interaction with people, both good and bad. I wondered how I would deal with the lack of food, water, and medicine? Would I be able to survive in a deserted city with no electricity? With terrorists threatening to destroy our way of life, this book could be a survival guide for the modern man.I especially found the greatest distress in this book was the way knowledge was lost. First Ish wanted to read and then it became less important and then the books fell apart. Ish became an antique with knowledge of things that meant nothing to the younger generation that was growing up around him. This book should be used to teach us all a lesson - that we must keep the flame of knowledge burning all the time or we could lose it so very fast.","This 1949 novel is one of the earliest explorations of the theme of a doomsday plague. Our hero, named Ish, is a young college student who returns from the mountains to find out that an airborne virus has wiped out over 99.99 percent of the population in remarkably tidy fashion, leaving behind only a handful of survivors.It is hard to rate a book like this. On the one hand, it is well written, and, despite a few implausible suppositions, manages to explores a number of interesting ideas and insights.But there is a big problem: Our hero, Ish, is completely wicked -- an amoral, self-worshiping, arrogant, elitist monster; and the author seems to be on his side. I understand that books of this type tend to be misanthropic fantasies, and even understand the appeal. But I cannot stomach Ish.Ish is not particularly upset by the tragedy, since he never had much use for his fellow man. Still, his first reaction is to contemplate suicide. He can think of no reason to live. How this differs from his outlook before the tragedy is unclear, but he apparently bemoans the loss of superior human specimens who are mirror images of himself -- detached, scientific, rational, and essentially amoral. He ultimately rejects suicide, only because he decides it might be scientifically interesting to observe the continuing downfall of humanity. That he might try HELPING his fellow survivors never occurs to him.It immediately occurs to him that there must be other survivors, but just as quickly concludes that the shock of the tragedy will soon destroy most of them as well, because of their difficulty adapting. He calls this theory \"secondary kill\". On his first day of searching, he finds no less than 5 survivors, but immediately writes them off as not worth saving, according to his quasi-darwinian \"secondary kill\" theory. He then drives entirely from the west coast to the east coast and back, without ever finding a single human being who he thinks deserves life. No matter how many survivors he finds, he persists in regarding himself as the last surviving human. Only Ish counts. (Again, how this differs from his outlook before the tragedy is unclear).He then returns to his California home and sits around eating out of cans and reading books. While reading the New Testament, he ponders the fact that Judeo-Christian morals are obsolete, since he has no neighbors to love. My jaw dropped. What about all those traumatized survivors he abandoned to die according to his detached and rational \"secondary kill\" theory?But then he starts reading the Song of Solomon, and realizes he wants a woman. Almost immediately, a beautiful woman, a fellow elitist, drops out of the blue and into his bed. Soon a handful of survivors, who Ish persists on regarding as inferior beings, gather around them and form a sort of a tribe. This is one of the more implausible aspects of the novel. Ish a leader? He may have all of Hitler's faults, but he has none of his virtues.Happily for Ish, all of the other characters (except for one man whom Ish murders) have personalities even less forceful than his own. He arranges to marry off all the tribe's children, including his own daughters, at the far-too-young and not-entirely-willing age of 13, without a peep of protest from his own wife or anyone else. (Incidentally, this is a terrible scheme if you want to preserve a high level of culture, which Ish claims is his goal). Nor does anyone protest his scheme to murder a newcomer for the crime of having a venereal disease. The only person he has any regard for is one of his many sons, who he thinks of as a mirror image of himself. But then tragedy strikes, dashing Ish's hopes for the preservation of Ish-manity.Very early on, Ish remarks, almost out of the blue, that he does not want to become a god. This is such a strange thought that I think he doth protest too much. In any event, it is virtually all he achieves. For instance, his efforts as schoolmaster, though failing to teach, succeed in instilling superstitious reverence for himself in his pupils.","Unlike all contagious diseases before this one that traveled over time, this contagion sprung up globally at about the same time. For practical purposes the human race is extinct. Isherwood \"Ish\" Williams survives the pandemic, but wonders if he is the last man on earth.In what was once called California, Ish eventually meets up with a small rag tag band of shocked survivors. As his cohorts just try to live, they turn to Ish, more an introspective loner, as the leader. Reluctantly he takes charge not knowing what the future will bring or even if there is even going to be a future.This is a reprint of a highly regarded post apocalypse tale first released in 1949. The story is actually told over a period of years broken into five major parts of which the above only briefly touches on the first two sections. Ish is a terrific protagonist whose belief in survival changes over time as he observes his little colony mature. Thriller fans will enjoy this strong after the doomsday tale that in some ways shows its pre-information age initial publication, but remains a strong cautionary story.Harriet Klausner","This review will be short and simple as there are tons of detailed reviews already available.Earth Abides is great. It turns over and over in your head for days, weeks, months, & years.. just as a great book should. Not only does it provide a glimpse into the possible future, it also shows what it was like back in mid-1900s America. Definitely a thinker's book. I'd recommend it to anyone, ESPECIALLY if you like post-apocalyptic/last man on earth type tales.","Many of the previous reviewers state that they originally read this book a long time ago, and how it stuck with them over the years. For me, the pleasure of reading Earth Abides is a very recent event, but I do know that like those other reviewers, this will be a book that will stay with me for a long time.Originally published in 1949, Earth Abides still reads fresh. It describes the life journey of the graduate student \"Ish,\" a more intelligent that average, bookish, slightly passive young man who is one of the few human survivors of a catastrophic virus outbreak. Early on, he travels from one side of the former United States of America to the other, and back again. Living in the home of his parents, he slowly meets other survivors: some are compatible and eventually group together to become members of The Tribe, others who are not, and do not. Earth Abides is a tale of the survival of a man, of a group, and of a planet without the continuing influence and domination of human civilization.This is fundamentally a book of journeys: a travel across post-apocalyptic America, within the remnants of the surviving San Francisco Bay area, of some of the Tribe's offspring attempting another cross-country journey, but most powerfully, it is the journey of Ish, as a survivor and young man, as a reluctant leader, as a torch-bearer of the hope of the re-establishment of the former Civilization, as a semi-god and The Last American, and finally as an old man who accepts that man will survive in new ways, not in the old ways, and that no matter what, that the Earth itself will abide.","A few days ago I listened to a lecture by renown geneticist Francisco Ayala. He discussed a simple experiment demonstrating Darwin's concept of natural selection. If you take a test tube holding 10 cc of the bacterium E. coli, it will hold approximately 20 billion organisms. Adding a drop of a modern antibiotic like gentamicin into the tube will result in the survival of some 200 cells (out of the original 20,000,000,000). However, since those cells are now gentamicin resistant, in only a few days the tube will again hold 20 billion (now gentamicin resistant) E. coli cells. The only E. coli cells that made additional copies of themselves were the ones with the mutation for gentamicin resistance. Evolution has occurred.What happens when the human race is hit with a viral \"antibiotic\"? What happens when a population of 6 billion humans is suddenly, within a week, turned into a population of 600, scattered across the planet?One thing is for sure... the population won't rebound in a few days.College student Ish Williams is one of the survivors. Although he thinks it is because he suffered a rattlesnake bite during the plague, unless all the other survivors also had a similar snakebite (even in places rattlesnakes don't exist), he probably already possessed whatever mutation that made him plague resistant.From his home in the San Francisco Bay region, he drives across country, looking for survivors while seeing first hand the beginnings of civilization's decay. As for survivors, they are rare indeed. But some people, like Ish, did survive.Back in the San Francisco Bay area, Ish and a few companions begin to rebuild civilization. But when the survivors don't include an engineer, a physician, a teacher, a scientist, or even a farmer, our \"survival knowledge\" is limited indeed.Author George Stewart wrote this book in 1949, so a number of the technological issues are quite dated. Nevertheless, survival isn't easy. Ish and others have to deal with exploding populations of wild cattle, and rats, and dogs. They have to find something besides canned food. They have to ensure water is still available. And they have to teach the children, so they don't forget.\"Yes, [Ish] reluctantly concluded, this matter of the children's beliefs was extremely serious. In the Old Times [pre-plague] the beliefs held by the children of any family or small group of families might be momentous enough, but still those children on growing up would come into contact with other beliefs and make adjustments. Besides, there had been a great, even overwhelming, mass of tradition - the tradition of Christianity, or of Western civilization, or of Indo-European folkways, or of Anglo-American culture. Call it what you wished, it was still so tremendous that you might say it was omnipotent, for good or bad absorbing the individual.But now their little community had lost much of the tradition. Part of it had been lost because no seven survivors... could preserve and transmit all of it. Part had been lost because for so long a time there had been no big children to pass on the tradition to the small ones. The oldest of the younger generation had been taught games by their parents, not by older comrades. The community should therefore be plastic to an unprecedented degree. This was an opportunity, but also a responsibility - and a danger....Now, more certainly even than before, he knew that he had the opportunity to be the founder of a religion for a whole people. What he told the children in school, they would probably believe. He could insure their memory of it by mere insistence and iteration. He could tell them that the Lord God created the earth in six days, and found it good. They would believe. He could tell them a local Indian legend that the world was the work of Old Man Coyote. They would believe\" (p. 222-223).Sobering, and interesting. Stewart ends by writing, \"Men go and come, but earth abides\" (p. 345).","I first read this novel over 20 years ago in a college history course. It's a story that has stayed with me, and I recently wanted to discover if the book was a good as I remembered it to be. Well, in one sense, it was: Stewart's style is still powerful, the plot timely, and the characters all too human in how they react to the end of the world as they've known it. What I also discovered was how dated this novel is, for some of the same reasons it's still a good story: 'Ish', the main character, is right out of the Cold War era, as he's chauvinistic, detatched, and more than a little pompous at times. The plot is all too familiar to our post-modern world (and King's 'The Stand' has some similarities): some kind of plague wipes out most of the world's population; Ish, bitten by a rattlesnake right before this happens, survives. The first part of the book really puts the reader into a world where Ish fears he is the last survivor. Even when he encounters others, he feels no connection to them. On his cross country trip, he sees no reason to stay with even the kind people he meets; instead, he returns to his parents' house, where he begins to plan for some kind of rebuilding of the former society. Eventually, he meets 'Em', a mixed race older woman, and they collect a small group of survivors who try to continue life as they knew it, children are born, and 'The Tribe' grows. Inserted in the narrative is Stewart's description of the title: as mankind and his works diminish, animals, native plants, nature itself transform and overtake 'civilization'...\"Men come and go, but earth abides\" (345). At times, Stewart and Ish overdo it with the dramtic language. Ish is not always the most sympathetic character, pompous and seeing himself superior to most of The Tribe. The Tribe doesn't seem to really have the energy to truly rebuild -- or even build anew -- another existence; the incident when the water system breaks down is the best example: even Ish realizes that the survivors and their children don't have either the desire or the knowledge to fix the problem and continue to enjoy indoor plumbing. Even the digging of latrines is never really finished, as no one seems to care when the work gets too hard. One does feel for Ish when he finally realizes that no one cares about the old education; The Tribe essentially regresses to hunting and small farming, but also seems happier than the 'modern' man ever was. Stewart had a good idea of modern man's virtues and foibles, and also provides a thought-provoking study which makes the reader ask \"what would I do in this same situation?\" You can also see, historically, where this novel fits into the US Cold War fears of complete annihilation of our 'great' way of life, and the land of plenty that the US was in this era: how do the survivors eat? They plunder the cans in the supermarkets for decades. The Tribe simply forages off of what's left behind, and at no time does it seem that the leftovers will ever end. It's an interesting comment on the world Stewart knew, and a compliment to the abundance in the US in the late 1940s, when the novel was first written.","George R. Stewart's main character isn't as helpless as a quick glance at the first page reviews may imply. He is a character that is able to do significant hands-on tasks such as auto mechanics, hunting, lead a small surviving group of humanity, and teach and school children. He is just not an expert in these fields, which isn't too surprising for a random person, but in many cases his knowledge and aptitude turned out quite useful. It's just that when one is dealing with what could be the last of humanity, a lot is needed for the human race to go on. Written in 1949, Stewart's Earth Abides makes one reminiscent of that time and of what was available then. Stewart takes some time to describe what happens to the other mammals, although I'm not sure if the prey vs. predator equilibrium was a new idea at that time since he does elaborate on it quite a bit. His visions of primitive and/or overly religious societies in humanity's backslide in certain areas will be quite well known to those that follow more modern writings and films of `the end of the world' genre.The setting takes place in three time eras, one right after the disease that wipes out most of humanity, one 22 years later, and the last at over 42 years later-probably 50+ years. The first takes place more or less in the time the book was published, 1949. The other one has to realize would then be taking place in what would then be 1971. Now Stewart makes the 22 years go by fairly quickly, but thinking about what happened in the real world between 1949 and 1971, the James Dean era, the hippy movement, Vietnam War, the start of the oil crunch, makes one realize a lot can happen in 22 years as opposed to what Stewart writes. What Stewart seems more to be writing about, isn't the end of the world, but the laziness of man, which eventually becomes a downfall for some and something that needs to be overcome. Now I don't know if he was writing about something he saw in his workplace or in the armed forces if he was in WWII, but he does take it to an extreme. Sure some people may just be tired of an 8 hour workday, when there's so many aspects of life out there, but it's hard to believe one would maintain an utterly lazy lifestyle for 22 years, when there wasn't any need to worry about food for the short term, or how one's retirement plans were going, and instead, without these shackles on one's mind in terms of worrying about the future, not feel free or have interest about how to rebuild society. There are some groups of people in the real world that if you get two of them together, they'll come up with three visions for the future as opposed to almost no visions by the characters of the novel.The book is also a bit too ideal. Maybe it really was like this in 1949, but the world as I've seen it would have the character's in marital disputes, the usual utterances of \"you suck,\" some saying to get rid of old man Ish, let's move our group, this in no good, that is no good, and so on. However, what makes this novel different from, say the usual post-nuclear-war book, isn't just healthy young men surviving, but a random group of people surviving that somehow have immunity to the disease (although one could say those that have built an immunity by being bitten by a snake represents a certain group of people and that would skew the randomness that Stewart tried to set up in the survivors), so his vision of the type of characters that survive may have some credibility.Overall it was a fun book to read. Stewart has a flowing, easygoing style that makes you want to keep reading to see how things turn out. It does get a little slow around the 200 page mark, so, as in other books, you just have to plow through it to get to the end. I'd recommend this book. It's one of the better post-apocalyptic novels that came out in the 40's and 50's, and is a compelling read.","I read this book in the 60s, just over a decade after it came out. When I read some of the reviews here, I decided to skim through it again. What had surprised me were the negative reviews. I remembered the story as a very interesting one, with characters I could appreciate, if not like.What I found different was the fiction that has come along in the past 40 years. In \"the old days\" fiction often was more thoughtful with less action and more introspection. Characters did not always solve the problems with which they were confronted (although I must admit that this was not the case as often in science fiction). Stewart in Earth Abides gives us a world in which nearly the entire population of the earth has died from a pandemic. Ish, the main character, spends much time alone in the beginning. As the few survivors begin to gather together, they look to him for leadership, something he's not certain he is qualified to do. The exception is that he is well read, and his greatest passion is to preserve the library in the area in which he lives.(spoiler lieth here) Some of the reviewers here seem surprised at the deterioration of civilization amongst the group. Were they as surprised if they read Lord of the Flies? True, those characters were all children, but many of Stewart's characters are uneducated or unsophisticated, who never understand Ish's preoccupation with the knowledge housed in that library. They are too busy learning to survive with none of the trappings of modern life, and without the tools to re-create that life. The story is depressing as one reads the slide into savagery. But what is represented is one possible outcome should such a holocaust occur in the world.For different outcomes, try reading Day of the Triffids (there be monsters), or Malevil. Or see the old b&w; film Things to Come. This was once a very popular sub-genre of science fiction and many possible outcomes have been depicted.","Wow, just wow. I can see that a lot of better reviewers have already had their say, but I've never been this moved and impressed.I was concerned about getting a book that was so old, but there really weren't many references that took me out of Ish's shoes: The lack of TVs, the attitude of and towards the African Americans (to avoid using his words), and to entertainers of whom I only recognized Bob Hope. Other than that it could have easily happened today.I'm pleased by how the book was ordered, with most of the chapters covering only a year in detail with a chapter about the intervening years between sections. It probably would've been easy to pad out those years rather than summarizing them, but it would've been too much.Most of all I like the short sections in the middle of chapters, largely in the first section, that help to break it up and provide a omniscient viewpoint and a break from Ish's lesser understanding and awareness. The portions relating to how the different plants and animals were affected interested me greatly.I'm very happy with the ending as well. Overall the book has several good thinking points. Definitely one I would suggest to others.","George Steward did a great job writing a novel that is timeless in nature. I thought the book was well written and the characters in the book were believable and down to earth. I could not put the book down. The pace of the book was fast and exciting. Each page of the held a new twist or further clarity in the development of each character. I especially enjoyed the development of the relationship between Ish and Em as it spanned over time and life events. George Steward did a great job writing a novel that is timeless in nature George Steward did a great job writing a novel that is timeless in nature.","I'm an avid reader. This is one of the most memorable books I've ever read. Earth Abides is a true masterpiece in every sense.","This book was written in 1949. It has withstood the test of Time.If You like a good Post-Apocalypse yarn, Read & Enjoy.","\"the Earth Abides\" is a well written book. It is now somewhat dated, but it still offers a good set of characters that are well developed and a solid story line. Good story telling, realistic characters that are well written, fine dialog, all combine to make \"The Earth Abides\" a pretty good read.","This book should be considered right up there with the classics of the genre. It's a wonderful and complex narrative that pulls you in and slowly pulls you along. It's not action packed but it is a very realistic look at a future where mankind has suffered a terrible tragedy. Highly recommended!","This timeless masterpiece recounts the most likely of the various apocalyptic ends to man's brief reign on Earth. Written from a naturalist's viewpoint, the novel recounts the fall of man following a sweeping measles-like pandemic. The author deftly informs us that the unknown disease is sirborne, that it hits only higher primates, and that the death toll is so all-encompassing that society simply vanishes. Mr Stewart also notes that the bulk of the few survivors are so devastated by the event that they become incapacitated. He also recounts nature's way of restoring an upset ecological balance and how the remaining animals cope with their new-found freedom.Ish Williams, the main character, himself goes through a period of psychological angst, but as with some persons in any crisis, recovers his equilibrium. He sees and meets others who cannot, but eventually meets an equally resolute woman. The book then briefly, but viably, notes how mores change when society disintegrates.In a section entitled \"Quick Years\", the couple meet certain other adjusted persons who have adjusted to the \"Great Disaster\", as they call it, and a rudimentary \"tribe\", so-called, comes into being. A tight, fascinating study leaves the way clear for \"The Year 22\", the next chapter.It is interesting to note how the members retain traditional taboos, remember dates and holidays, and yet slowly return to a hunter-gatherer society. Organized learning is a natural casualty, to be replaced by superstition. Obviously, the ability to conjugate verbs becomes surplusage at such a time.The tribe learns to face disease, criminality, and tragedy. Religious tenets alter in each such society. One is left with the belief that man hasn't really learned very much by all of it. You learn that the most important thing to primitive man was the bow and arrow, and fire-making. Ish preserves these for future generations, along with a less credible democratic tradition. Even the language begins to change, as history marches on.I won't spoil it by giving the ending, but you won't forget it, any more than you will forget any of the details of this incredibly well thought out, impeccably written book.Even if, as with some reviewers, you cannot accept Stewart's approach or result, you will be forced to concede that, in addition to being a great storyteller, he is an incomparable, almost lyrical, wordsmith.I hated to see the book end.","Even Stephen King admits he based THE STAND on this interesting novel. I also recommend Doherty's AREA 51 series.","Considering all the raves, I was disappointed by Earth Abides. Although the premise was interesting, it never really went any place and kind of left me hanging. I thought the discussion of how man's departure from Earth affected other species was thought provoking and well done, but the rather dry writing style and lack of depth in the characters left me underwhelmed.","All i have to say is this book is sooooo gooood!","Allow me to digress for a minute. Has anyone ever seen the Bruce Willis movie The 12 Monkeys? Anyone besides me that is? I didn't think so. Back to the subject hand. The plot of Earth Abides is similar to that movie. A biological plague devastates the United States and the rest of the world. Isherwood, &quot;Ish&quot; Brown, comes across a dying man named Barlow. After Barlow's death, Brown's the last man on Earth. If I may digress again, it's also similar to the 1971 Charlton Heston movie &quot;The Omega Man.&quot; Ish sets out on a cross-country trek to preserve our culture. In Arkansas, he finds roads in disrepair, and forests reclaiming everything. That's all I'm telling you. If you want to find out &quot;the rest of the story,&quot; READ THIS BOOK!!!","I realize this is a 'classic' of science fiction, but I couldn't find it in me to really love it. It''s good, but sooo dated in many respects. And frankly, I never really connected with Ish, the main character. Still I am glad I read it, because of its enduring status.","I read Earth Abides in the sixties as a teenager, and it is one of the few books that stays with me through the years. A beautiful, haunting book.","Every fan of post-apocalyptic stories has his own reason for following the genre. Mine is, that I like to see what the author considers most important to life in this world. When civilization and human society collapse; when food, medicine, and basic comforts become scarce; when friends are few and family is imperiled, what values will prevail? Most of the classic novels of calamity portray survivors determined to carry on, forming communities which are insular and self-reliant; learning and developing the skills and collecting the resources essential to living in a new world. Earth Abides paints a somewhat different picture.Ish is much like the heroes of the other popular disaster stories, in that he is determined to carry on; and to recover, as much as possible, the advances of civilization which are in danger of disappearing with the loss of most of the human race. Ish finds himself the head of a community and extended family; and though he is strong, educated, and resourceful, he finds nothing but frustration in his efforts to pass on his values to the next generation. His children and grandchildren have little desire to produce goods for themselves, having become dependent on the things left behind by those who died from the plague. He is unable to inspire them with his vision for keeping the great accomplishments of humanity alive.Something unique about this story is the occasional vignette describing what happens to the world around Ish, now that the human race has essentially become an endangered species. If you've ever watched the History Channel's \"Life After People\", you'll get a sense of that here - and see how these things directly affect Ish and the other survivors.I'm discovering that those classic novels which I can read many times throughout my life, and which say something new to me each time (see my reviews of \"1984\" and \"Fahrenheit 451\"), are those in which I recognize the signs of true works of genius. This is only my first time reading \"Earth Abides\", but I already wonder what it will say to me in five years, or ten, as I raise my children, or lead kids in my community, and try to impart my own values and experience to them. Will I be able to pass on those things they need to survive, or will I find myself, like Ish, disappointed, or having to realign my expectations?An engaging read, with all the hallmarks of a true classic.","I have read and reread this novel many times over the years, and this was just one of many copies I have bought to share with friends. It is the easiest reading but most thought provoking apocalyptic novel I have ever had the pleasure of reading.","This book is an interesting read about the end of civilization and rebuilding...but honestly nothing really happened in this book. The whole book seems like a huge buildup to some epic conflict/event that is going to happen, but never does.Maybe it's just a sign of the times that today's reader expects action, I always have a hard time with books written in the 50's.","This great book addresses one of the age-old curiousities so many of us have: What would I do if one day suddenly I was all alone in a world wiped clean of almost every other person?Ish, the main character, is a non-descript every-day Joe who finds himself in just this scenario. There are a few other survivors along the way, eventually forming a \"tribe.\" They all have their flaws and eccentricities which makes the story all the more believable. If you plucked a random selection of humanity and put them on a desert island they wouldn't all be super heroes! They would bumble along and learn how to survive as best they could within their limited capabilities.It was the way in which the author wrote the book that made it so great for me. The little interjections within chapters describing the changes in the Earth away from the human plot were great, and they provided context and realism to the human story. The progression through the 60 some-odd years was expertly crafted by singling out the years with momentous turning points for more detail, and speeding through the fascinating \"quick years\" in between. The descent back to a stone-age type existance twists the emotions. Sad for one who is familiar with the conveniences and comforts of modernity, but understandably necessary for the new human condition.A great novel that is considered a classic of post AP for very good reason.","I thought it started a bit slow, but in time I was certainly hooked. The writing style seemed a bit formal but I grew used to it. I found it easy to forget while reading that the setting was decades ago, as I could easily envision it happening in these times.By the middle of the book I was considering it \"required reading\" and thinking of family members I could loan it to. It definitely gains steam as the story evolves. Loved the ending, both powerful and moving.I can see that Stephen King must have been inspired by several different portions of this book to write the Stand. I consider this one better. I would have liked maybe to see it longer, with more character development of the younger generations. I suppose 900 page novels were uncommon in the time it was written, so we are left with what it is. A great, and thought provoking novel.","This book should be considered right up there with the classics of the genre. It's a wonderful and complex narrative that pulls you in and slowly pulls you along. It's not action packed but it is a very realistic look at a future where mankind has suffered a terrible tragedy. Highly recommended!","In 10th grade we read a story that dealt with the end of the world in our English class. I was intrigued. As i spoke again of this story a year later my 11th grade english teacher suggested that i read \"Earth Abides\". I shrugged off the suggestion being as though it was from my teacher (one of the lesser evils in my life) and it wasn't untill later that year when i found it on the library shelf that i finnally picked it up and began to read. I managed to rack up over 30 dollars in library fines because i litterally refused to return the book to its rightfull home. After reading it straight through three times in a row, I began to keep it under my pillow. I would pull it out at night and open it up and read randomly wherever the pages led me. Earth Abides may just be the most inspiring book I have ever read. I am now a Senior in Highschool. I since have bought a copy of Earth abides to replace the library's copy so that i could keep the copy that i had grown so close to. It is not so much the story or the people in it that i have attached myself to. The understanding of human nature and the way we react to crisis, and the way we move through life never ceases to amaze me. As I prepare myself to go into a career in Pyschology Stewart continues to be a constant inspiration in my search towards understanding of human behavior and human emotions. Also I am inspired as a writer. I can only dream that someday i will be able to write as well as Stewart. To be able to convey my thoughts or create and develope a character as well as he does would be beyond my imagination. Earth Abides leaves one person in awe and leaves them dying to read more but afraid to turn over the last page, for fear of ending the story. A wise person once said that finishing a good book is like losing a close friend. This holds true in Earth Abides. Whenever i read that last page my best friend dies with a simple punctuation mark. But as the book continues to remind us, Men go and come, BUT, earth abides.","The characters in George R. Stewart's Earth Abides symbolize many biblical people.Isherwood, the main character, is referred to as Ish throughout the novel. \"Ish,\" however, can also be a shortened form of the name Ishmael. Ishmael was a biblical wanderer who allegedly founded the Islamic religion. In the first half of the book, Ish is a wanderer, venturing all over post-apocalyptic America, eventually settling down and founding a tribe.One of Ish and Em's children, Joseph (who is referred to as Joey), is representative of the biblical Joseph. He is very gifted intellectually, and has the ability to see the deeper meaning in any situation, much like the biblical Joseph's ability to interpret drams; unlike the biblical Joseph, however, his talent is squelched, when he is stricken with typhoid fever, and dies as a result.The mentally-handicapped Evie has a name similar to the Eve, and is nave, much like her biblical predecessor. Eve is targeted by the evil serpent, and is expelled from the Garden of Eden when she partakes of fruit from a forbidden tree. Similarly, Evie is targeted by Charlie, a greasy character who lusts after her and plans to take advantage of her innocence. Before actually seducing Evie, however, he is executed by the others in Ish's Tribe, for Evie's well-being. Likewise, the serpent from the Bible receives his comeuppance in the form of expulsion from Eden and being made to walk on his belly for the rest of eternity.Ish's wife, \"Emma,\" is referred to as Em throughout the novel. This also ties in biblically, for \"Em\" can be short for \"Emet,\" a name meaning \"Truth.\" Emma is characterized throughout the novel as a strong-willed individual who helps hold the Tribe together. After Joey's death from typhoid fever, Ish asks Em if there might be a God taking vengence for Charlie's execution. Em responds, \"If there is a God who made us and we did something wrong before his eyes... at least we did wrong only because we were as god made us, and I do not think that He should set traps.\" (258) She speaks her mind, and she speaks the truth.Ezra was a biblical prophet who chronicled the return of the Jews to Jerusalem after their expulsion by the Babylonians sixty years prior. Likewise, in the novel, Ezra speaks with great foresight-much like a prophet-and lives to observe the Tribe's rebuilding of civilization.These and other biblical parallels make Earth Abides one of the most symbolic modern-day books.","Earth Abides is a great book in general but among its genre its easily one of the best. If you enjoy post apocalypse fiction then this is a must read. No hesitation at a five star review.","Excellent book! I've owned a copy many years ago, and had to have another since my old copy was lost or stolen!!!","I, too, read this book 30-something years ago. What I remember most is the boy. I think he is Ish's son. He is the only one of the new generation to wonder how that dark box (the television) once worked. And he dies! I so wanted him to start figuring things out.","i have read the last ship alas babylon year zero footfall lucifers hammer this book was the best even though it was written long ago that is the most epic story MEN COME AND GO BUT EARTH ABIDES i read it 20 years ago and several times since","One of the most interesting books I've ever read. I wish he'd focused a little more on what happened in the rest of the world than the Tribe, but an amazing book all the same.","EARTH ABIDES by George R. Stewart is one of many books that take as its theme the destruction of mankind, leaving the Last Man on Earth as a narrator. THE PURPLE CLOUD by M.P. Sheil did much the same but Sheil's book was marred by excessive racism. Stewart's book is saved not only by the logical working out of the plot by its narrator-survivor, Isherwood, but also by Stewart's clever though subtle use of using Isherwood's slowly failing senses over many decades of post-apocalyptic adventures as a metaphor for the slow destruction of the American ideal of life.As the novel opens, the reader is told that the United States has been hit by a super-plague that has spread with lightning rapidity with near one hundred percent fatality. Ish, one of the very few survivors, passes by a abandoned car on the San Francisco bridge. This car is registered to a James P Robson of Oregon. This seemingly innocuous narration is later seen as the central metaphor of the book. Years later, Ish has several opportunities to pass the car in and out of San Francisco. Each time he does so, the car becomes somehow less distinct, a fuzziness that resonates first in his mind, then in the reader's mind. As the decades pass, Ish meets isolated pockets of survivors who have forgotten their American heritage. To these barbaric Mad Max types, Ish is the Last of the Americans. They tease him, they pinch him, they see him as a failed god type who could not deliver on the promises of the fabled technology of their legends. By the novel's end, he sees them pinching him, but he cannot feel them doing so. His senses have failed him just as America's technology had earlier failed to protect its population from the plague. Just before his death, Ish remembers the car on the bridge. Was it red? blue? green? Owned by Robson? Robinson? Robertson? He does not remember. But he feels sure that America has died, its technology has long since died, but its people live on, possibly learning from the mistakes of their predecessors, or maybe not. Stewart concludes his otherwise depressing work with a hint of optimism: \"Man may come and go, but earth abides.\"","I would have given this book fewer stars if I had been able to put it down. In spite of the stilted prose, odd inaccuracies, and generally bleak view of human nature, Earth Abides' end of the world scenario is completely gripping. There's none of the pseudo-mysticism of The Stand, just pure mid 20th century sci-fi goodness. Some of the scenarios Stewart presents aren't very subtle, and his views of women and blacks are what you might expect from 1949, but if you're at all interested in the &quot;what happens after a mysterious virus wipes out most of humanity&quot; scenario, Earth Abides is worth a read.","I bought this book and read it with the hope that it would be at least as good as Alas Babylon, one of my all time favorites. It was not. Earth Abides may have been the prototype of the collapse of civilization genre of Science Fiction but it has been outdone by so many other later books I hardly know where to start.To begin with, even the main character is very shallowly drawn and it goes downhill from there. You don't really care what happens to any of these people because the author does such a sketchy job of portraying them as having any of the qualities that we need to see in a literary figure in order to identify with them. This book is a science fiction version of The Grapes of Wrath without the character development. Be prepared for sexism, elitism, stupidity, lemming like fatalism and lack of preparation for any kind of civilized future. Also the author totally fails in most respects to know and understand how long canned food will last and how quickly you might be killed by scurvy living the lifestyle described in this book. Add in unrealistic pretexts for the characters doing what they do and you have a book that drags you into editor mode thinking how you could make it better.If you why I gave this book three stars when I disliked it so much, here is why It gets one of them for concept, the second for being the prototype of the genre and the third for having an interesting beginning. Where is really falls down is the ability to deliver on the initial promise. Books and movies for the most part succeed when they take an initial premise, however, far-fetched and then elaborate on that initial premise in a logical manner. After the initial suspension of disbelief this is how they suck you in. This book doesn't suck you in but actually loses you in contradictions, flimsy pretexts, and poor research with an ending that tails off in a whimper and left me whipping through the last several pages to get to the ending only to find that there was really no \"there\" there. Earth Abides gets credit for illustrating very convincingly the complex web of technical knowledge and individual job skills as well as motivations that keep our industrial society afloat but loses all the previous credit when it fails in a primal manner to explain why rational people who didn't really want to do a lot of work would makes life choices that initially and in the long run would mean a lot more work than the alternative choice that they didn't make. A low-tech lifestyle is a bundle of work compared to learning about and maintaining some of the elements of civilization. This is where I really fault the author as I believe that a lot of things including; the shelf life of canned goods, the back breaking labor of a hunter gatherer existence without even any horses, human craving for fresh food, and basic human emotions are ignored or glossed over in order to reach a contrived conclusion.","This a truly great book that everyone should read. Now to my experience with getting. I was looking for a reasonably priced hard back edition. This one said very good condition, in a price range I could live with. When I got the book I was happy with the condition until I found a bar code on the back cover which tore the cover getting it off. They should have specified that there was this sticker on the back cover. I like to keep my books and that is why I buy hard back. I was disappointed. Not only that but there was a sticker on side that read salvation army, $2.99. I really didn't care about the price difference but it showed me lack of concern by the seller which I do not appreciate. ruscolombo","I was really looking forward to reading this book as I have lately been going through a post-apocalyptic literature jag. After thoroughly enjoying \"On the Beach\", I purchased \"Earth Abides\". While \"On the Beach\" centers on humanity's ability to stay hopeful while facing the inevitable, I was confused by the intended message of \"Earth Abides\". The book's protagonist, Ish, likes to think of himself as the forward-thinking leader of a new civilization, but he comes across as more of an apathetic dreamer. In the twenty-plus years following a devastating plague, Ish and his companions evolve from foraging through supermarkets for food to....foraging through supermarkets for even older food. And I guess that is the really frustrating element of this book- in all that time no one has the foresight or gumption to make more than half-hearted attempts at creating some sort of self-sustaining community. The 'Gilligan's Island' crew did more in two years to create a society than this motley crew does in thirty!Kidding aside, I am sure that the author is making a statement about mankind that others have picked up on and that has apparently gone way over my head. I actually look forward to reading more learned reviews of the book to figure out what I missed.","I don't think I've never read another book like this, so I'm not sure how to describe it. Very slow paced, not a lot of character development. Not a lot of explanation about where everyone went, I just didn't think enough how and why questions were answered early on. Interesting, but I really found it easy to put down. I also found some of the main character Ish's point of view about non-whites curious, yet somewhat disturbing. As if that was the way people viewed each other in the late 40s, and quite obvious lack of communication/knowledge about each other. There are some very interesting plot twists in here, none of them gory where they could be. Seems as if Stewart withheld gruesome details to focus on Ish's response to a completely changed world (no complaints here). I just find this book hard to recommend, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading this either.","I read this book years ago, lost my copy and when I heard the old time radio adaptation I got another copy. My first reading I was waiting for the clashes with other survivers, the cannabiles trying to eat them, you name it. Now after many years and another reading I understand Ish and the other survivers better. People cling to what they know, what is familiar. So did Ish. He was a bookworm, maybe even a geekish type. He loved the Hills, being solitary, studying. He was even in a profession that may have regarded less educated people as stupid (highly skilled science/engineering types come to mind) He was the last person to be chosen to kickstart humanity, to lead it back to greatness. He had the courage to drive cross country,alone, but not to keep the children in school or to take the books from the library.I liken the little colony to an office load of people who have never had to face a deadline, a change of upper management, or a takeover. They plodded along doing things the way they always did until circumstance forced an issue- the water, the visitor, there own need to bring in new blood. Ish knew what needed to be done but he lacked the wherewithall to motivate the others. He was not the charasmatic leader found in later novels. Those by S.M. Sirling come to mind, or Alas Babylon! Ish held the colony together and prevented their complete loss of civilization. He enforced rule of law when necessary, and made hard decisions.As others have pointed out, this book will continue to be debated as long as there are two people who have read it and thought about it.","I read this book aeons ago when I was in high school - of course back then it was a lot heavier (chisled in stone). It's a great book - though a bit antiquated and an interesting twist on the post-apocalyptic genre. The symbol of the single jack hammer has stuck with me through the years to the point that I never pick up my one handed sledge in the garage without thinking of the story. If you've never read it, you are missing a real treat.","I first read this in college for an English class and it really caught my imagination. Overall, the basic plot line of the book is very interesting and thought provoking, though the writing is not what I would call first rate. I like the fact that the book focuses on the fate of civilization in the wake of an overwhelming catastrophe without resorting to the seemingly inevitable appearance of zombies or other un-dead as is the case in so many other post-apocalyptic stories. I also like that the story balances optimism and pessimism, rather than going totally pessimistic a la 'The Road'.","I won't quibble with the author about such things as the shelf life of gasoline. I found this novel an intriguing insight into the era in which I was born. The author draws conclusions about post-apocalyptic civilization that, while I find them disturbing, are certainly possible. He casts the role of the antagonist not as the greed, lechery, or lust for power among others outside his tribe. Rather, the antagonist is the lethargy of a group of survivors who live by scavenging and whose creative urges never develop as a result.Personally, I find that a depressing scenario...perhaps because I also see it as a possibility. The main character, even though the tribe considers him their leader, is cast as one who stands outside the group. Instead of directing their energy toward creativity, he continues to see himself as an academic...an observer. Inevitably, the \"tribe\" is reduced to being a combination of scavengers and hunter/gatherers. Mr. Stewart does a good job of chronicling this decline. I simply think he (and his protagonist) accept this fate too easily.This is a book review, however. It is not a social commentary. The novel, itself, is well written and very effective in its' message. It's a worthwhile read, even if only undertaken as a study of the Amercan culture during the time period in which it was written.","So good. The good beginning and the good ending more than make up for the sometimes-boring middle. The whole, of course, is poetic. The author intended that and he succeeded. And he succeeded in making a post-apocalyptic story that is not dystopian, as so many of these contemporary stories are, and moreover is actually hopeful and, in the end, optimistic. And Stewart is to be thanked for that, as much as for anything else he has done here. As others have said, the novel certainly is worth reading again and I will do so.","At first, I found it hard to get past what I considered the author's naivete. Afterall, 99% plus of the world's population dies out, but there are few bodies...a plague of rats with the same result...the streets, even within the population centers, are virtually clear of stranded vehicles, etc. But, then I realized, this book was not about personal survival, it was about the survival of knowledge. Armed with the world's knowledge and a fine brain, Ish is only able to bequeath to his survivors a hammer, archery skills and the ability to make fire without modern means...despite his best efforts. This scenario of lost knowledge is even more probable today with Wikipedia taking the place of public libraries for many of our youth. An anthropological masterpiece! A must read for those planning to rebuild civilization after its collapse. (It's hard to believe this was written in 1949)","Earth Abides is a 1949 science fiction novel by George R. Stewart. When a plague all but wipes out the human race, a young introverted intellectual decides to observe the way the world responds to the sudden removal of humans, and, later, works to reconstruct certain aspects of civilization while battling to keep education alive.This is a thoughtful book: one of Stewart's primary themes here is a philosophical take on civilization: its pros and cons, what is gained and lost through starting over, and whether parts or the whole are worth rebuilding. Stewart, with the world's last scholar as his main character, does a wonderful job with this.But while Earth Abides is all about ideas, Stewart mostly punts on the moral and theological ramifications, as his characters move on quickly when these themes present challenges. In a world where people can't help but focus on death, that's a missed opportunity.In addition to the book's philosophical emphasis, Stewart's post-apocalyptic world is generally free of unrest and violence. While this allows Stewart to focus on his themes of rebuilding, his characters are rarely in much peril, and there's never much suspense. Yet as Stewart charts the life of his protagonist through the years and decades, the reader becomes invested in and attached to the character, passive and powerless though he may be, and this is why the novel is compelling, and why the reader will not mind the book's many philosophical detours.On the whole, Earth Abides is an intelligent, poignant and melancholy novel, and one of the finer and more influential works in the genre. Bonus points for an interracial relationship during a hostile era.","\"At the funeral of Homo sapiens there will be few mourners.\"I loved this book. So many end-of-the-world tales center on violence, war, superhuman heroes and unrealistic resolutions. Earth Abides is unique. It follows the story of \"Ish\", a biologist who was busy doing research alone in the mountains of California when a virus swept around the planet wiping out all but a few members of the human species. Immune to the virus, possibly because of a well-timed snakebite, Ish proceeds to explore the empty world. He travels across the United States, returns to the west coast, and helps establish a small community with a handful of survivors.Earth Abides is special because it all seems so real and down-to-earth. Ish is a scientist who makes keen observations and comes up with brilliant solutions to problems. But he is always very human. The character never drifts in a formulaic larger-than-life hero who can save the day. I also like the realistic mix of survivors. No, they aren't all Mohawk-wearing rapists and murderers. No, they aren't all highly intelligent saviors of civilization. They are an assortment of people one might see walking down any sidewalk in any city. Some smart, some dumb; some nice, some not so nice.Earth Abides covers a lot of ground, stretching out many years beyond the disaster. It is fascinating to read the author's description of crumbling cities and vanishing highways. It reminded me of the fine nonfiction book, The Earth Without Us.This book was a pleasure to read and I highly recommend it.\"At least,\" he thought, \"life is quieter.\"\"Yes, a tribe is like a child. You can show it the way by which it should grow up, and perhaps you can direct it a little, but in the end the child will go his own way, and so will the tribe.\"\"Men go and come, but Earth abides.\"","Earth Abides is a great book. It has always been one of my favorites. George Steward makes it easy to put yourself in the situation of being the last man on earth. This is the kind of book that you will read over and over through the years.","After reading this book in a college Sci Fi class at Berkeley almost 20 years ago, it remains one of my all-time favorites of any genre. It is positively amazing that it is almost 50 years old because it reads so thoroughly modern and relevant. The story grabs you right from the outset and doesn't let up. What makes &quot;Earth Abides&quot; so special is that it can be read on many different levels. While reading it for the first time, I often had to peer out the window to make sure there were still people around! Don't miss this sure bet","As a fan of non-alien, post apocalyptic novels, I sometimes struggle to find truly good books to read. Well, Earth Abides is a truly GREAT book, and you will not regret this choice. The book is well-written and unforgettable. It was written in 1949, but wears its age well. I was even able to enjoy its social perspectives toward women and race. George Stewart, like Mark Twain in Huckleberry Finn, really struggles with the social beliefs of his time, and questions both racism and sexism without overpowering his remarkable story of survival.I'm an avid reader. I especially like realistic science fiction, but don't limit myself to the genre. I rank Earth Abides in the top 5 of ALL the books I have ever read.","Earth Abides, written in 1949, tells the story of the fall of civilization from deadly disease and its \"rebirth\". It is actually three books in one: the disintegration of the world, the establishment of a new collective culture, and the moral weights of leadership. I initially read it as a post-apocalyptic novel and was rewarded with a philosophical treatise on the loss of a way of life and the dangers of man oversimplifying himself. The development of the tiny band's subsequent generations is more terrifying than a plague wiping out the planet. It is a story of 'what man wrought' but not in the way one anticipates. Originally classified a \"science fiction\" novel, now, with time, it must be categorized as literature.","\"Between the plan and the fulfillment lies always the hazard. Between the plan and the fulfillment stands always the frail barrier of a human life\" - George R. StewartIsherwood \"Ish\" Williams is one of the last people on Earth! How will he survive, how can he go on?\"Earth Abides\" is a book that I have owned for quite awhile & a book that I have always planned to read next, but never did. Finally I read the book and I was not only thoroughly impressed, I was in awe of George R. Stewart's ideas about how it would all end and how we could possibly go on.I'm amazed at the amount of the poor reviews for this book, I think most people are expecting moreI Am Legendtype material. This book is not that at all, there is some violence, not alot, there are no zombies, only people & animals. Many reviewers state that Ish should have done this, he shouldn't have done that, forgetting that this masterpiece was written in 1949. The book is so far ahead of it's time, it's baffling to me how George R. Stewart came up with some of these things. Would it be much different it this novel was written today, well obviously yes.Stewart's theory of how each animal will thrive before it's numbers level off really made me think. The everyday things that you never give a second thought, Stewart brings them to the front and makes you think, what do we do now, how do we get past this?If you like to read post-apocalyptic novels, if you've readThe Roadand enjoyed it, read \"Earth Abides\"This is the road that no man finishes traveling. Men come and go, but Earth abides!Enjoy~","How anyone could rate this book poorly is beyond comprehension. This is a well written, fascinating study on human thought and action. As much a intellectual simulation as a study of the time and attitudes of that time in which it was written.","George Stewart's \"Earth Abides\" is a tale of the end of the world by way of a plague that handles the subject in a way much different that similar tales. More thoughtful, deliberate and slow than I expected. More than anything it is a look at how man's conquering of mother nature is temporary at best. Take away man, and the Earth's memory of man will be soon forgotten. At the same time, it deals with civilization - what are the fundamentals of civilization, what keeps people together, and what prompted the creation of tribes, religion, superstition, and war.Without question, I enjoyed this a lot. One of the better takes on a post-apocalyptic scenario I have read to date. No Mad Max BS, no metaphysical The Stand mumbo jumbo, no b-grade nonsense ala The Postman, just pure introspection regarding how mankind would move on, and more importantly, how the Earth would move along as if we were never thereMandatory reading.","Some interesting ideas explored in this novel, such as the true worth, or otherwise of what we today term 'education'. Stewart asks the reader to question the validity of many of our modern values upon which today's civilization is based as well as pointing out how swiftly these would erode in the aftermath of some holocast. I am not sure if Ish made the correct decision when he completely abandoned the school for the children. There was only the one chance to pass on the knowledge of reading and the communication value it holds, and once lost it would be gone for ever. Also, the future survival of 'The Tribe' would have benefited enormously if future generations had access to much of the knowledge contained in the library.Another interesting point was how &quot;The Tribe', or rather 4 of its members, so quickly decided on the death penalty for Charlie.There appeared to be a complete lack of any real emotions in any of the characters. This was particularly noticable at the start of the novel when Ish looses not only all his friends, but his family also. There seemed no grieving process, and although he was certainly sad at the loss of Joey and Em, I did not feel his pain.Stewart could have written a far longer novel without loosing my interest and much more could have been included. The 'Quick Years' passed too quickly for me and I could have handled a few more hundred pages without loosing interest.Altogether an excellent read. We are asked to question so much of what we today hold as important. He questions our complacency, which is always a good thing.","Do you know the joyous feeling you get when you just happen upon a book quite by accident, read just a few chapters of it, and realize that it will be of great signifiance to you? Well, that was my experience with this book! I can't believe that I was not introduced to this book before now. It is with some sadness that I just completed reading it.My degree of connection with the main character, Isherwood Williams (Ish), astounded me; therefore, I must admit that my reaction to this book is quite subjective. It as is though the author looked into my mind and wrote a book about me in a post-apocalyptic world, including my greatest virtues and worst vices. The descriptions of the thoughts, triumphs, failings, joys, and frustrations experienced by the main character are poignantly honest and real. Metaphorically, this story seems to describe, with regard to many things, my existence in this, our so-far non-apocalyptic, world. For example, I find that I constantly struggle to define what I think to be the appropriate balance of individuality and community/state in our world. If you are one who consciously ponders such things or pursues a study of philosophy, I believe that you will view this book as a masterpiece. It just made my top 10, that is sure.I feel that I have gained much in my reading of this book. Mostly, I come away from this reading experience with a renewed feeling of peace and a reassurance in myself and the human spirit. I will no longer, I think, become quite so frustrated with regard to certain things or people in this world.&quot;Am I happy? Yes, I am happy. Things are as they are, and I am part of them.&quot; - Jack, great grandson of Isherwood Williams (Ish), the Last American.","This really great fictional accounting, by G.R. Stewart, of what our future might be, remains my favorite of the genre. I've just reread it for perhaps the third or fourth time - with some years in between. And although just a little dated it retains the vitality of adventure, promise and hope within a story of global tragedy. Considering current media hype about a possible Bird Flu pandemic this is an enlightening and enjoyable reading experience.","George R. Stewart's &quot;Earth Abides&quot; was written in 1949, so of course there are some anachronisms that occasionally jolt the reader. The Giants play at the Polo Grounds and the Dodgers at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. There are no interstate highways and radios all have vacuum tubes.These minor historical curiosities aside, what truly amazes is the timeless of Stewart's story. How many science fiction novels from 1949 still rate the glowing reviews of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; you will find here? By comparison so many modern sci-fi stories are formulaic, written with short, choppy sentences, shallow characters, and action sequences ready made for transfer to the screen.Stewart's vision of the future, where education and especially reading, slowly fad away after an apocalypse applies more to today's world than that of his own. His characters have little ability to bring back the technological remnants of the dead world, and truly, if 99% of the people on the planet were to disappear how many of us have the skills to keep the power going, the water flowing, and automobiles running decades after the disaster? His characters adapt to their environment in the most natural way.In the nearly four decades I have been reading books this is one of a handful that has made a memorable impression and which I consistently continue to recommend.","When the protagonist entered the Bancroft library at the Univeristy of California, and the author described him handling the books and the care which was taken when he left, was so beautifly described I almost cried. Living in chaos but leaving in such a humanly way left a strong message of the power of books and libraries that needs to be an inhernt value to our culture.","It seems like this book was super-great when I first read it about 40 years ago. I haven't been able to forget it. I am excited to see it is in print again---but why was it ever out of print? It is timely, provocative and just plain great reading for any age.","I read the Earth Abides, after listening to a friend describe this story as one of the most impactful he had ever known. Several years later in the early 1980's, I stumbled across a slightly used copy in a bookstore. George Stewart tells a fascinating tale of a post apocolyptic vision staged in the East Bay section of the San Francisco Bay area. This story has stayed with me and endures as a valued set of images. The struggle to make sense of the horrific and nonsensical was intuitively accurate. The story revealed in human terms the everyday efforts of a small group of survivors, suddenly stranded and adrift. The beneficiaries of a hulking but hollow industrial infrastructure that no longer served those who remained and their succeeding generations. The unfolding &quot;descent&quot; of industriatized society as well as the marginalization of technology was at once fascinating and frightening. The ending left me stunned, yet wisened.","My 12 year old daughter is reading Alas, Babylon right now and was discussing the plot with me. I immediately remembered reading Earth Abides over 10 years ago and was wondering if it could still be found. Obviously, there are lots of fans. What a compelling story about the potential future of mankind. Should be required reading in school","I read this book when I was 12 or 13 years old (more than 30 years ago) and it had a lasting impact on me. I have long since forgotten most of the &quot;classics&quot; I have read but this story has stayed with me through the years. Friends think I'm nuts when I say things like &quot; as you yourself, Ish, well know!&quot; right out of the blue. I just stumbled across it at Amazon and immediately ordered it. I can't wait to read it again!","I first read this book about 20 years ago, it caught my eye because the opening date used in the book is my birthdate 12/22/47. Have read it many times since and it never fails to make me re evaluate my current situation and really look at what is important and what is not. This is a must read book for me at least once evey 18 months.","I read this book 10 or 20 years ago, and I still think about it nearly every week. Where would I choose to live? What would I try to save? I have even thought of making my own screenplay adaptation based on the book. If the author needs help or motivation, then please e-mail me!","Read this book when you're really depressed. You will realize that things are not all that bad. Earth Abides provides hope. Even if everything we hold dear, everything we assume to be permanent, everything human disappears, the dream will survive.This is not the metaphysical good v. evil crap of Stephen King, nor the bang-bang rootin' shootin' end of the world of the pulps, but a quiet look at what the world would be like if mankind silently slipped away.","This book was captivating, and exciting. It makes you think abou the fragility of life, and how quick things change. This should be read at least once in your life. Stewart was 40 years ahead of his time when he wrote this and you don't want to miss out on it.","To read this book for the first time, at 10 years of age, is to enter suddenly into the reality of the fragility of the material society into which we are submerged.How could everyone really die off like that? This was MY town! MY Bay Area! MY UC Berkeley campus playground! A major metropolis! Fascinated, I couldn't put the book down. Living in Oakland, Ca. in the late 60's, I avidly looked out the windows when traveling through the East Bay, striving to see that little pony, running and running and running.It was beyond my comprehension that a thing so large as the Bay Bridge, which my grandfather had had a hand in building, could fall apart! I had thought such a thing would take ages and ages to break, not just a generation.All it takes is an earthquake, a dash of sea salt and a virulent bug.","Despite its age and archaic language, Stewart's practical knowledge of nature makes this one of the best epoch-ending books ever written. Other stories reveal this knowledge but unfortunately, are out of print (Storm and Fire). You've probably read enough reviews to know what the story is about, but be prepared for some radical thinking compared to today's social standards. This was written when many words were compounded by hyphens. When you read of the tail-gate on the station-wagon, don't be shocked. We really wrote that way back in the late forties and fifties. His story reflects the way things were then, not now, so you'll likely find this story as alien as many future fiction stories. We really have evolved that much. Enjoy one of the great SF stories of all time. It certainly is my favorite.","This book is a &quot;must read&quot; for those of us living in Northern and Central California. His descripitons bring the story home. I have assigned this book to students for extra reading. I believe it should be assigned reading in our local high schools.","While the first half of the book is OK, the second half drags. There were lots of places in the second half where more detail would have helped, instead the narrative became choppy and incomplete.","This review is only of the Kindle edition not the book. There are too many typos and editing problems in the Kindle version. Stick with a hard copy.","After I picked this up I realized I read this book a long time ago. Because the time setting is over 60 years ago some of the language and terminology has passed into disuse but, what would you expect? Entertaining and thought provoking.","I read this book about 35 years ago as a paperback and just decided to read it again as a Kindle edition. I liked it much more when I read it as a teen, now in my 50's it seemed kind of slow. It's not one of those books you read over and over again.","I first read this book as a senior in high school, and it's stayed with me all this time. Some typos and poor editing in this edition, but the story is worth reading and sharing with friends.","From start to finish, the book was entertaining if not thought provoking. I enjoyed the the perspective of the main character throughout the book and each encounter. He was much more relatable than most protagonists in the genre. I recommend this book to anyone looking in the survival / post-apocalyptic genre.","For the year written, it seemed ahead of it's time. It does not compare to &#34;Alas, Babylon&#34;. At one point I put it aside and read another book. Though, as the principal aged, his thought's and actions, were first class.","Warning before you read, no cannibals or massacres are devices used in this novel. It is a thinking man's teotwawki! I totally enjoyed sharing the thoughts of this quiet man who watched his world rebuild. Great balance for all the survivalist info I glean from all my other beloved shtf reads!","Starts off great, slows down too much in the middle but finishes well. If you are looking for a Robinson Crusoe post-apocalyptic type read this is not for you. Nothing like \"The Stand\". All the characters are at best low end of average and manage to accomplish very little over the 42 year span of the book. Somehow, I liked that about the book. The writer gets a little too esoteric though. Still, one of the better reads I have had this year. Written in 1949 and I got a hoot out of picking the small things that dated the book. Everybody smoking is an example.","A thoughtful examination of the slow collapse of civilization in the lives of a small band of survivors brought together by one man who remains their leader until old age. In general, four stars, in science fiction genre alone, five stars.","George Stewart has crafted a science fiction tale that stands up fairly well to the test of time. Although it was first published in 1949, the language and ideas are still immediately relevant today. What would happen to you if civilization fell apart? How would you survive? How would people treat each other?The tale unfolds gradually, without suspense. For me, this was not quite the memorable novel that the highlighted reviewers described. I read the whole thing, but I could have easily put it down halfway through, since I did not develop a deep emotional attachment to the story or its characters. The novel is told in the third person, but through the eyes of Ish, the main character. This unusual point of view puts the reader at a distance. I didn't feel that I really knew any of the characters in the book, except for Ish.Ish has a bland personality. He is one who accepts his lot in life, even his lot in death. As the workings of civilization fail, he notes their passing. In the end, he does little to oppose his tribe's drift back into the stone age. This engendered my main disappointment with the novel. Why did the author make the protagonist so weak? There have been great novels fashioned out of weak characters, but ultimately I did not find greatness in this book. It is well written, but it did not fulfill my expectations.","This isn't badly written but, it didn't hold my interest like a really good Sci-fi book will do. It has a good story line but, the characters lack personality. It is interesting to read a book that was written as Science Fiction years ago.Earth Abides","Given a copy of \"Earth Abides\" in 1976 while stationed in Atsugi JA. This novel takes a single premise and projects the \"what if\" to a very logical and believable conclusion. I have read this novel three times since, each time obtaining a different prespective on the way human nature molds our life's decisions. Ranks with 20,000 leagues u/sea, The Time Machine and other SF stories that will stay within your mind years after the final page has been turned. One of the very few works of fiction that I recommend to friends - if you're searching for a believable work of science fiction \"Earth Abides\" will exceed your expectations.","I liked this book, its a very good view on what things could be like for the few survivors of a near species-ending pandemic. Written some time ago it does tend to be dated, but not annoyingly so. I knocked off a star due to the fact that it is somewhat navel-gazing in its execution. There's alot of deep thinking going on by the main character. Given all of this, its still worth a read and will IMO promote some thinking of your own.","The story of a world decimated by a fast-moving plague, Earth Abides follows the life of Isherwood, a 29-year-old loner who, while camping, suffers a rattlesnake bite that saves his life. After recovering from the snakebite (and other symptoms), he makes his way back to the San Francisco Bay area, where he finds his parents gone and the city deserted. Indeed, only a few people remain after the scourge that killed millions.Written in 1949, Earth Abides is a philosophical sci fi classic--it takes place before rock and roll, before microwaves, and way before computers. As Ish bands together with a few survivors to found a new civilization, he must decide what is important to keep from the Old Times, and what can be abandoned. The charm of Earth Abides is that it is as much a portrait of the mid-20th century as it is a futuristic fiction. It is the story of the last Americans.","The first scifi i ever read. Published , i believe, in 1949,the language is still current and still moving. Love a book that makes me think about the end of the world...","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it. This maturity is perceptible all along this work.The story is situated in a world devastated by a sudden pestilence that annihilates most of humankind. Taking into account the last SARS epidemic that jumped abruptly from China to Canada it doesn't look an impossible scenario.This is the story.Isherwood Williams comes down from an isolate spot in the mountains to discover an empty world. He starts searching for survivors all across USA, from California to New York and back again. He finds only isolate human cells, couples or trios, overwhelmed by catastrophe and in a near catatonic state.Returns to his native town and contemplate with a certain scientific detachment the fading world around him.Mr. Stewart intercalate brief vignettes describing what happens to dogs, cats, cattle, plants, roads, dams and bridges, contrasting them with Ish's daily experiences.Little by little the story grip reader's attention and even if action is somehow slow, the book can't be put down.As the story goes on human cells began to draw near each other, grouping and interacting again. A rather feeble structure starts growing up.The author approaches universal questions about survival and extinction; civilization and savagery; social structure and anomie. He also examines religious values, ethics and life's ultimate sense.This book gives the reader a lot of stuff to think about. A very enticing read!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","In this profound ecological fable, a mysterious plague has destroyed the vast majority of the human race. Isherwood Williams, one of the few survivors, returns from a wilderness field trip to discover that civilization has vanished during his absence. Eventually he returns to San Francisco and encounters a female survivor who becomes his wife. Around them and their children a small community develops, living like their pioneer ancestors and gradually returning to a simpler way of life. It may seem odd to say that a book in which the majority of the world's inhabitants die is life-affirming and spiritual, but I'm going to say it anyway. I have read this book again and again over the years, and each time I come away from it with a deep feeling of peacefulness and confidence in the power of Mother Earth.","I have been a fan of PA fiction for over 30 years. My first PA novel was the children's novel \"Beyond the Dark River\" by Monica Hughes - a novel which I read when I was eleven. It hooked me on PA fiction and ever since then I have been trying to find as many novels or movies that I could get my hands on.I had read good things about Earth Abides online and was looking forward to reading it. Can I say how disappointed I was? Perhaps it was the era in which it was written, but all I could think of throughout the book is that the new civilization would have been much better off without the pompous a$$ of the main character Ish. \"They thought of me as a God.\" Good grief!If I could have rated this movie a zero I would have. Take this one out of the library if you must, you'll be glad that you didn't waste your money on it.","Even if Stephen King did base THE STAND on this book, he takes the idea of a world-wide plague and develops it much better than Stewart. I understand that EARTH ABIDES was written in the forties, but the stilted style of writing used and the attitudes and world view of Stewart's main characters are so jarringly anchronistic that I could never forget I was reading a book --- it never transported me into the world that the writer was trying to create. The italized asides within the chapter explaining what was happening elsewhere (i.e., lice, cats, ants, etc.) were interesting but not enough to save the book as a whole. LUCIFER'S HAMMER, WAR DAY, or THE STAND are all much better &quot;end of the world&quot; type books","It's been awhile since I read this book, but what I remember about this book is that it insults you and basically says that if you haven't gone to college and grad school that you cannot be intelligent or sire intelligent children. The author writes this book about the one truly intellegent person left alive. He portrays the rest of the survivors, who are average non-college educated, blue collar types, as little more than simpletons. The main character and the author doesn't even try to have the survivors learn to use the left over technology to help better their situation because they are too dumb. When they reproduce only Ish sires an intellegent child. The rest of the chilren are all dumb like their parents. Bah, that's it. My hatred for this book is off my chest. I don't reccommend it.","Having loved this story 20 years ago as a teenager, it pains me now to find that it is surely the most badly written book on my bookshelves. All the characters are two-dimensional. The dialogue is uniformly stiff and amateurish. Worse, there's a faintly fascist tone running throughout the entire story that I failed to notice as a callow youth, but that now reveals itself on almost every page. Perhaps the saddest aspect of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that the story is clearly and shockingly the fantasy of an author who was very probably an insecure misfit who dreamed of existing in a world without people, or at least with just a handful of simple folks over whom he could rule as their intellectual master. If Stewart had spent some time in analysis, &quot;Earth Abides&quot; might never have been written. It is a truly awful book.","Plot Kernel - A deadly virus has nearly annihilated the human race, leaving all other life untouched. Civilization has ended. A survivor searches for others and eventually joins with a woman who lost her family in the epidemic. In time, he becomes the leader of a few families who have intermarried and who together live off the abundant supply source of the otherwise uninhabited city.","I love post-apocalypse fiction, but I can't figure out why everyone likes this one. The first 1/3rd of the book is great, as the main character experiences what becomes of his world after everyone else dies. Then it's as if the last half of the book was written by a female. It's mostly introspective, about how the character feels, and nothing really happens. If you want a page turner from front to back, read 'Alas Babylon','One Second After', or 'Without Warning'. I would donate this book to my local library, but I would feel guilty knowing some poor guy might pick this up and waste as much time on it as I did.","Great story of what would happen if a lazy / self proclaimed intellect survived the human apocalypse. Ish may have let thousands of years of basic knowledge disappear without getting off his highchair for a second. But, in the end at least \"Jingle Bells \" survived his incompetence and carried on.","I was very excited when I received this book, because I had read great reviews about it. However, it did not hold up to my expectations. The first two thirds of the story consist of the main character driving back and forth across the country looking for survivors (that is as far as I made it- leisure reading should not have to be a chore). When he does encounter survivors, he only stays for a brief time to visit with them and moves on. That is it. There are no conflicts. There is no tension or threat from others or nature. No plot. He simply drives back and forth looking for people, discovers them, and then moves on. I have never read anything more boring, not even required readings for courses I have taken. Perhaps this book was the first of its kind when it came out, and that may be why it has such acclaim, but the storyline is nonexistent. On the up side it does have some very well written descriptions of the land and animals (that is the only good thing I can say about this book).","Wordy, verbose, unrealistic. Meeting around a table with the woman who eventually gives him children, written like a bad female romance novel.Emotionally mature hunter-gatherers evolve from his haphazardly raised progeny. Unrealistic ending, which was a slog to get to.","If you are easily depressed or get melancholy, do not read this book. If the thought of the human race dying out and mother earth thriving gives you the warm fuzzies, then this book is for you. After the major opening disease-kill tragedy there's *some* hope for man... then less hope for man... then a little more hope for man... then a *lot* less hope, and on, and on. It's an emotional roller coaster that, on average, only looses altitude. In the end, earth wins, man looses. I had 100 pages remaining to read and finally had to flip to the last page so. I. could. just. &quot;end it&quot;. Yuk. Two weeks later I still have a bitter taste in my mind. If you like sci-fi's such as &quot;ender's game&quot; I predict you'll hate this book too. My hope here is that I've saved somebody else the pain.","Great book. I really enjoy apocalyptic fiction. I have read a lot of it and this one has got to be towards the top of my list.This book takes on more of an human approach to the end of the world. There is not a great deal of action but the pace does not get sluggish. Unlike most end of the world fiction this one has a much broader scope and looks at the future of a \"Tribe\" of survivors instead of just the main character. Plus in most of these type of stories there is one main challenge and once that is defeated the story ends and that is all. Not at all the case with Earth Abides.The best part of the book for me was the 2nd half. There is a heart touching story of the main character and his son. Since I can't give away any spoilers it is hard to say what I like about the end other than the way the book hints at what life has become but only through glimpses of the main character.The reason I didn't give it five stars was the length. While it never drags it could have had some parts cut out and not effected the book at all. In fact, more than once I read something went to the next page and read such a similar page that I went back to make sure I had really turned the page. It only happened three times tops but still you start noticing that there could have been some trimming done.Great book, cheap book, fun read.","One of the origional Apotholyptic tales. Since this is probably how it will all end, it is internesting to see the authors views on environmental \"take back\" from humans. Good read, young or old.","I read some of the rave reviews by others which made me decide to order this book. Of the end of the world genre, I would say this rates near the bottom.I guess what annoyed me the most was how far off the author was to guessing how the world would decay... I'll list a few examples and let you decide for yourselves.1. The rate of decay of everything was grossly exagerated. Rail lines reduced to nothing but a pile of rusty chips in only 30-40 years? Entire houses rotting away and completely gone in just 10-15 years? Huge dams rotting and breaking after only 5 years? Very silly scientific assumptions.2. The lack of doing anything worthwhile for a so called smart man. He can only teach just one child to read? Doing basically nothing to improve his life over the course of 40 years?3. He comletely underestimated human will. The children in the tribe lacked any kind of basic intelligence. The author probably never had kids and assumed they are stupid without a formal education.You know what, this isn't even worth my time to continue listing all the flaws. Trust me, spend your time watching one of the recent Discovery Channel episodes on the end of the world without man, it would be much more compelling then this book.","I just finished this book, and I have to say it was interesting but nothing really special. I read The Stand many years ago, and loved it, although it was extremely unrealistic. Earth Abides has the realism, but it overdoes realism, without too much excitement. Basically if you have some time and want a quick read, pick this novel up, but if you are looking for a spectacular sci-fi or post apocolyptic book you are better off picking up another novel.","This tale of the apocalyse is very thorough in its examination of all of the changes in the ecosystem if man were to disappear from the earth. The first half of this book is a real page turner as the main character travels the countryside to discover what has become of the great cities of the U.S. after most of the human race has been wiped out by a deadly disease. Unfortunately, the second half of the book sinks into mediocrity as Ish's small band of survivors shun the \"old ways\" in favor of a return to illiteracy and primative life, which makes the second half kind of not belieavable. Christians [should] be offended that the author has absolutely no respect for and even argues against the existence of God in this book. Nevertheless this is a great book and worth the time and money.","The Greatest Book I've Ever ReadIn the book Earth Abide, By George R. Stewart thesubject at hand throughout the book is the survival of man. Thisbook takes place in San Francisco California where a vast plaguehas almost wiped out all of the Homo-Sapiens. This book followsthe life and times of one man (Isherwood)and his struggles to rrebuild his past American life. This is very heart warming thatour culture would last to the breaking point of our species. Ihope you all feel the same.Isherwood starts out in the mountains on a school studytrip. This is when he became sick from a rattle snake bite. Hereeven before the plague he had to struggle for his life. \"I justhave to cut the bite holes and extract the poison,(Stewart 12).This characteristic shows that he is a survivor and foreshadowshis success aaginst the plague.He also in many other ways begins to stabilize hissurvival iin this book. He ensures safety by meeting othersurvivors and creating a tribe. He tries to edjucate their youthwith their past culture, but loses the young ones to moreexciting activities. He even tries to better the adults, but hefaces complete anguish because not a single person cares. \"Nothanks, were going to play with the bulls, and go dodgin,(Stewart 44).Isherwood thorugh much heart ache and disappointment,goes for one last hurrah to save his people. He teaches his twomiddle aged boys to drive, and sends them in a cross countrysearch of survivors. When they return, it was to no avail. Theygave up and found no one worth finding. Ish is lost agian tothis new world.This is a reamarkable book that is one so captivating iscauses internal turmoil in yourself. By reading of a quitepossible tradgedy, it makes life much sweeter. Also by seeinganother man struggle so hard for all that we stand for isinspiring. Even though Ish couldn't accomplish what he wantedit's good to see he had a moment of clarity at the end of hislife. For then he realized how the only constant is change, andthat Earth Abides.","This book Earth Abides by George R. Stewart is about a man who passes by a massive disease which basically obliterates the US. This man, Ish, has to come to realization of this huge crisis and try to find survivors. It goes on and on about his thoughts and shows the struggles that he faces it the horrid situation. He goes around america finding survivors and ends up making a huge family in the end.This book was basically boring and depressing because it was just lagging on and on about how he thought of everything. It made you want to fall fast asleep at times too. (something that i obviously did) I am one of those kind of people who likes adventure and this book had none. It just was one of those books that wanted to show how horrible things could happen to us if we don't watch it. It sort of chilling and makes you depressed to think that it could happen. George R. Stewart was probably giving a good message out when he wrote this, but in the sense that people want to live there lives without this catastrophe, it is not very good.I would not recommend this book to kids under the age of 12 because it probably is too advanced for them. Also because kids do not have to worry about this sort of horror happening to them at that young of an age. People who need to sleep at night and want to fall asleep fast, please read. If you like adventure and mystery in a book, please go find a different book.","The book held great promise in the first few dozen pages... a believable plague and a believable reason for the protagonist to have survived. It goes rapidly downhill from there. The lead character, Ish, is pompous, self-absorbed, grating, and oh so very tedious. Even giving credit to the fact that the book was written in 1949, there are some very basic errors. Canned goods don't remain safe after 20 years, nor does gasoline remain usable. I kept reading hoping that the book would go somewhere, but it really never did. If you must download this book to your Kindle, do yourself a favor and pull down the sample. Read it, enjoy it, and move on. There's NOTHING more there. If you persist, don't say that I didn't warn you.","2 stars for the \"human\" emotional experience but the book lacked excitement and was mostly dull and depressing. The year of the rats, grasshoppers, etc. How original - not. The only thing the people did was marry more than one wife and breed. No one learned from \"George\" on how to keep the plumbing and houses in good order. No formal schools were set up so everyone learned to read so civilization could rebuild itself. They talked and made plans but never followed though.Ironic their small group refused to breed with a pretty but dim witted female because they didn't want dim witted children yet in terms of learning, each successive generation became dumber anyway. The author must like caveman because his little \"tribe\" is rapidly devolving into that era.","Many of the rave reviews for Stewart's post-apocalyptic novel are by readers who first read it many years ago. After prodding from a trusted reader-friend, I read it last month for the first time. Our hero, Ish, is uninspiring, and the other characters are wooden. Although the premise is a clever one, and many of the events that occur are unexpected and therefore interesting, it's difficult to get caught up in this story of mankind's fate after a disease wipes out most of humanity.Everything in the novel occurs within one man's lifespan, and it is therefore not surprising that Stewart exaggerates character traits so that mankind will swiftly evolve. But the characters are so unenlightened - Ish is the only one interested in teaching children to read, and he gives up after a while - that it's hard to take seriously Ish's assurance (to himself?) that these are average Americans.In short, an interesting concept but flawed in the execution.","This classic book reminds us how greatly our civilization affects our surroundings yet how temporary and insignificant we are in this world.Mr. Stewart has written a book that keeps pressure on the reader to think introspectively. The style is easy to read and allows such personal thoughts to mingle with the words being read.","If seen only as an example of early writing in this genre - mankind after the apocalypse - this should be taken as an acceptable novel as compared to later attempts in the same vein. The characters don't really develop and just seem to stumble along without learning how to cope beyond what they knew &#34;before&#34;, which makes for a somewhat plodding read.","There are plenty of other reviews that go more in-depth as to why this book is amazing at the top of the list, but i just wanted to contribute to its stats, and give you my .02$Its memorable to the core, i read it almost a year ago now, and have read a decent handful of post-apocalyptic fiction between now and then, and this one really stands out in my mind.From the very beginning it was gripping, and only got better. It didn't focus on the die-off, but on the aftermath, and how it affected the environment, wildlife, and the anthropological ramifications.Once he does meet up with fellow survivors, there's no great battles with cannibals, not even starvation, but just life. The book really gets down to the core of what it is to be human, and what is important, and how different types of people have different priorities, and how these different ways of thinking would affect the rebuilding of human society in a near extinction level event.It both gives you hope, then rips it away, and makes you question what is really important in life. It makes you wonder if the way of life we are living in our modern world is natural, or a freak coinsurance. perhaps it would happen again if somebody hit the &#34;reset&#34; switch.","A bit dated, but a good read nontheless. Some parts are very wrong (such as gasoline, tires, and batteries for a jeep keeping so long, or that all of the stores of weapons and ammunition back when it was written (M1 garands, M1 carbines, 1911s, and all of the civilian models) not being available after the military and most people are gone. But still very imaginative and well written.","This was a real change for me, which I was looking for in a book at the moment. Not an &#34;action&#34; book, but still holds you spellbound at times, and often I couldn't put it down. It had it's slow areas, but not enough to distract from the total experience. A thought provoking story from the 40's I believe - but you will find yourself thinking about things in every day life a little differently. Definitely a good read!","I found this book to be amazing. It is a very detailed -- at times almost too realistic -- depiction of life after an apocalypse. I found Stewart's handling of societal changes quite believable, and more sophisticated than many more modern works. He also does a great job drawing characters that we can believe.I read somewhere that the author was shocked that this is still on the top of many \"The Best of Science Fiction\" lists. Since he set out to write a literary adventure story, and not science fiction. So be it.Whatever you call it, though, it is riveting.","It led the way for so many great apocalyptic yarns, and was influential in literature and in creating an awareness if the fragility of society. Isherwood was a paradigm for most civilized men. He was content to observe life, and was only dragged into life by his wife. When society fell, he calmly observed the fall of civilization, along with it. He dreamt of rescuing civilization...but settled for surviving on it's leftovers.I wonder how many preppers read this in their formative years.","I have read this book several times and it is a timeless classic. It leaves you feeling what the main character would feel under the scenario that this book was created.The World Without Us","The latest post-apocalyptic fiction seems to focus on dealing with deadly infected persons. What if they just all died and a small group had to start over. This book focuses on a main character who is more human than the supermen of modern apocalypse, he's not an ex-special forces operative with pre-med and a welders certificate who grew up on a farm. He's a little lazy, has some relationship issues, a mediocre teacher and in the end is just a normal guy dealing with population events.","A very original and unique plot, particularly given that it was written in 1949, makes this book a great read and not to be missed for fans of the post-apocalyptic sci-fi genre. Most every book since written in this genre borrows elements from this book. The pace of the story moves well and there are many sub-plots which are interesting (in particular, the main character makes frequent introspective observations that are thought-provoking about humankind). Of particular note is how relevant the book is today, over 60 years after it was written.My main negative critique is the general prose and writing style. It is impossible to believe that the author was an English professor... very basic sentence structures, little in the way of character development, and a ridiculous over-usage of exclamatory statements from the novel's characters (literally hundreds of exclamation marks throughout the book). The Kindle version had a number of typos as well.Still a worthy four-star book given its deep and compelling observations on humankind and a very clever and original plot.","I read this book about 15 years ago and had completely forgotten its name, but this book kept coming back to my mind over the years and I had to search and rediscover this book. What made this book to stay alive in my mind were my own thoughts and ideas that I have developed during the years about how civilizations grow and develop trends like religions, life styles etc.The central character of this story, Ish was an ordinary man before the plague that wiped out the whole world. In the new civilization, he, oblivious to himself, started assuming the role of a leader. The civilization, against his own wishes, started looking up at him as their spiritual leader.Most of the story is made up of his reflections and ambitions for the new civilization. He intended the new civilization to be based on the old one, taking advantage of the technological developments already in place. But, the civilization chooses to follow its natural progression and he found everyone around him to be very comfortable with the barbarian way of life.It is a thought provoking book. Must read for anyone who is a thinker !","This was one of the early end of the world novels where the survivors try to restart society. Though there is a lot of scientific inaccuracies, what makes this book great are the characters. If you liked Stephen King's The Stand which also had great characters, then you should like this one.The main character is Ish. Ish seems to be someone that we all strive to be. Caring and smart. Ish also, has the son that we all wish our children would be like. Ish's son is the smartest of all the children and he simply idolizes Ish.Ish uses a hammer (a basic, I guess Stanely model) as his symbol of power (or his sceptre) over the survivors. Undoubtedly, the hammer is to pass to Ish's son when Ish dies.The big project for the survivors is to get an old automobilie repaired enough to explore other lands and try to find other bands of survivors and get civilization back on its feet. I don't want to give the rest of the plot away only to say that this project turns out to be a big mistake.","A brilliatnly written socio-sic-fi. Though the book is a bit austere for the scope fo the catastrophe, it is truly a wonderful tome! Like the later work of Stpehn King's The Stand, Earth Abides explores the questions and illustrates the harrowing reality that might be if a \"super\" disease were to kill most of man-kind.Thought provking and beautifully crafted.","Earth Abides, a novel by George R. Stewart, is an excellent novel that depicts a possible scenario for a post-apocalyptic world. It provides people with a fantasy realm with questions of what could happen and what will happen all through the eyes of the novel's main character, Ish. He joins up with a couple of survivors in what he sees fit for the new world and they create a society that tries to cope with it. George Stewart further enriches the story with character chemistry and strong elements of theme.Themes of survival and love are strongly present throughout the novel. Ish's strong will to contain the community he had once known pushes him to survive so he can teach the next generation of what good can become of it. His relation to Em also draws out the love and caring in Ish.George Stewart uses chemical equations between characters to draw an exact importance of each person in their society. He chooses a man named George who is a carpenter to build and repair homes. He has a friend named Ezra, who acts as an advisor to Ish. They all piece together to form Ish's envision of a good society.The topic that concerns Ish the most is the community he had once known. Ish, who is trying to inflict positive change in society, is cursed with the inability to change himself.Throughout the book, he learns to trust his society and the future, which is dependent on him to lead them. He learns of the differences between the two generations and tries to blend in. He goes through many experiments, which has led in to some disaster and many good.Earth Abides is a great novel about the fantasy and high possibility of a post apocalyptic world. The characters and themes in the novel are beautifully inscribed drawing an essence of drama and suspense into an already stone set feeling of both feelings. Reprising themes of love, survival and many other themes are present to enrich the story. Earth Abides, a novel by George R. Stewart, is a novel I'd recommend to anyone who is interested in character chemistry and the post-apocalyptic ideology of George R. Stewart.","Societies Rise and Decline but the Earth Abides In the classic apocalyptic novel Earth Abides George R. Stewart creates a nightmare on earth that could occur tomorrow when a massive unknown epidemic obliterates almost all of society. A young man named Ish is forced to search for companions on this barren, naked earth void of human life. He searches for sensible people to aid him in his quest for survival and mental sanity. Em is the person who keeps Ish sane and through her love and courage helps him to face the future. Together they find a group of companions, and together they establish a tribe in the Berkeley Hills in the Bay Area. George Stewart1s powerful and realistic writing captivates the reader and makes one imagine how each of us would react in Ish1s situation. Even though his novel gets rather slow in the middle with few dramatic events adding to the plot, Stewart demonstrates the harsh situations and triumphs of life this small nucleus of mankind must face without modern society. Stewart1s writing fascinates the reader by exploring the actions of the offspring of the original seven tribe members and shows how people develops without modern society and all its conveniences. Stewart shows how all-human societies have come about, by tracing the development of this small tribe that survives a cataclysmic disaster. In the novel Stewart puts Ish and the tribe through many difficult trials as they struggle to survive. He is able to create an almost unimaginable situation and turn it into a reality. Each character is developed so well that the reader is able to experience the events. Ish1s leadership is strengthened by Em1s courage and Ezra1s loyal friendship. Because the reader can relate to these believable characters in this unbelievable situation, it is easier for the author to relate his point. Stewart fascinates the reader by showing how man develops with all his customs and superstitions and without a modern society. While reading about the tribe1s triumphs and failures we are able to step back from the modern world and see how civilization perhaps developed. The author examines the growth and characteristics of individual characters. What each of them bring to enable this tribe to survive, show how a society begins and flourishes. Em brings her courage, Ish brings his knowledge and his leadership, George is the carpenter and so on. Each member of the tribe contributed to the betterment of the whole society. Then at that point we are able to see the growth of society again, as if it was cut out from man1s actual past history, when ancient tribes started to develop. . At first the challenges are just simple, to fulfil the basic necessities of survival like shelter, water and food. Once these needs have been fulfilled, the tribe progresses to larger concerns such as education of the younger generations, keeping records and calendars, rules and exploration. Eventually the tribe integrates with outside members sometimes successfully, sometimes not. For instance when Charley comes back with the Robert and Richard he brings disease and chaos to the tribe. The tribe had the difficult decision of banishing him or killing him to protect their way of life. Many of them, including Joey who was the hope for the future as a leader because of his intelligence, die because of this outside influence. Later however the tribe successfully mingles with another tribe, which helps their society grow because there are more possibilities for men and women to find mates in a larger society.All through the novel Stewart accurately demonstrates the development of a simplistic society with all its triumphs and failures, to symbolize the history of human development. He is able to show that future societies would develop as past societies have as long as basic human needs are met. When people have food, shelter and more importantly significant human relationships then a society can begin. The society that Stewart creates starts with two people who found each other in the midst of chaos. They unite with others with whom they are compatible and from this small group a multi generation society formed. In his lifetime Ish saw a society develop. He saw his children and grand children and great grand children living happily. Through Ish1s eyes, the author masterfully shows all of us how societies rise and decline but how through it all the earth itself abides. Stewart in this famous apocalyptic novel captures the reader and artfully demonstrates the nature of human societies.","This book is one of the most moving and realistic surival novels that I have ever read, the suceive plauges of Domsicated animals and pests for one, and the point that the most brilliant minds of of western, and Gobal Civilization would break under the strain of the end of civilization seems all to true. Though the very end of the book was depressing(as San Fransico burns, and the Part about the new Human tribes) but even though civilization is pushed under, it is suggested that it will rise again in the far future though as we watch civilization unravil as Isherwood tries to pick up the peices is heart breaking, his attempt at a school is sad and the way that he finally breaks under the strain of being remembered as a god. This is a great classic of Sf Read this book!!","It really made me think about the sensativity of the planet and society of every day life.","Earth Abides is a great book for the reader new to the science fiction genre. Isherwood and Em are strong characters. The building of a new society is intriguing. I read this book over 25 years ago and I still remember it fondly as my introduction into science fiction books.","I have read and re-read this book over the years. It is riveting, entertaining and more than likely prophetic. The bomb that may destroy us all is the one we can not defend against, the incurable, quick-acting and all powerful virus. A nuclear Dooms-Day could not be more horrifying.","The well conceived story captures the imagination from the start. That's why we buy books like this...right? The intellectual and forward looking main character reminded me of the captain in &quot;The Last Ship&quot;. Read it!","This book is way ahead of it's time in exploring the way mankind can be taken down by virtue of the adaptabiliy of micro-organisms exploiting the large population of world ranging individuals. This book is scary that way, not to mention the writing is incredibly good. George Steward shows a love and understanding of ecosystems and how culture can be shaken and lost by the loss of the majority of constituant members. How Isherwood Williams copes with his deminishing expectations for the next generation is realistic and shows how most of us adapt to the whims and caprice of what life can throw at us. This book could be a world shaker if given a good rewrite updating the 1940s slant. With what we know now that Steward seemed to predict would come about intuitively, this work would be very popular today. Don't let that stop you from reading this great, great book.","I wandered in here and was suprised to see that the book was still in print, and how many people had read and loved the book. This was recommended to me about ten years ago by the author's grandson, and I agree with many other readers. It is a timeless and thought-provoking end-of-world scenario. It is a strong argument for compulsory education as well. Very enjoyable.","A half-century ago, Stewart saw too clearly a future which could, indeed may yet, come to pass. He, and only a few others, survive a world-wide plague. How he attempts to preserve his society - how he prioritizes, what agonizing choices he and his 'flock' make, the compromises they have to accept - makes for among the finest end-of-the-world books ever written. Ish, the main character, is no less uncertain, no less fascinating, than Macbeth. Ish is clearly the everyman each of us could see in him/herself after a catastrophe impossible to imagine. A long book - it could be no less - by its end, one hopes for a sequel. It is not clear whether Stewart is optimistic about this future - and that too is appropriate. For every reader will probably come to a different conclusion as to where the 'tribe' is headed based on his/her own perceptions of what Ish did correctly or otherwise and what the reader might have done differently. No modern home library is complete without Earth Abides.","George Stewart provides a compelling &quot;thumbnail&quot; picture of mankind and how adversity can bring out the best and worst in people. This mini-saga is so well written and loaded with such a rich mix of characters and situations that the reader cannot help but wonder what tomorrow might bring. If you enjoyed Sarum you will love this","I was introduced to this book at a time when the world was beginning to fully envelope the &quot;benefits of technology.&quot; As part of the computer generation, for whom the desires of the world could be acquired at the click of a mouse, Earth Abides awoke in me a deep appreciation for the distance we have come and the importance of the most basic lessons in life. For more than 15 years I have been looking to recapture the insights I discovered in reading the book as an impresionable teenager. How ironic that is technology that now presents me with the opportunity to read it again","I have spent twenty years &quot;selling&quot; this book to friends and acquaintances as a must read. Some &quot;got it&quot;. Others didn't. Read it. If you &quot;get it&quot;, you will re-read it many times again! If you &quot;don't&quot;, hey, it takes all kinds","This magnificent book tells the story of one man's struggleto recreate and rebuild society in a world where societyhas abruptly ceased to exist. Set in the Bay Area and rifewith haunting moral and ethical questions. Every student -heck, every HUMAN - should read this one at least once. I'vebeen through it more than ten times since I read it incollege. TIMELESS.","As the lead character copes with the demise of civilization, we find an elegant creativity that challenges the mind and helps us see the world in new ways. This is one of the greatest books I've ever read and certainly one of the most haunting. I strongly recommend it to anyone. Another along the same lines is Malevil","This in one of the finest &quot;Last Plague&quot; genre I have ever read. Fascinating from beginning to end. It is the ACKNOWLEDGED inspiration for THE STAND by Stephen King !!","Facinating concept. It's far ahead of it's time. Written in 1949 it could easily be updated to any time. It must have caused quite the controversy when originally published. Each time I've read it, I've found something new. A perfect book for discussion groups","I am a fan of similar themed books. But this one just does nothing for me. The only interesting aspect is the (almost consuming) focus on how other animals in the biosphere react to the human population crashing down.But that doesn't make up for these huge flaws:1) The interpersonal aspects are awful.People just don't relate to each other the way the author describes.2) Dominated bi sudo-Christian bible verse that gets added in to say something meaningful is happening3) The storyline takes place so long ago that it is hard to see it as anything but a time-piece.4) Racist, sexist views embedded very deep in the assumptions5) Overall a very boring story line. No emotional growth in the characters and no growth in the community or plot. Just terrible, really.","My hobby is reading . I enjoy reading stories. all kinds of stories by bestselling authors or never heard of authors. always looking for a good story. In my search I have read some great stories, some not so great and just plain awful. but only three times have I ever disliked a story where I could not finish it. This story was so bad not only could I not finish it I would like a refund. the story line could of been interesting. The writing was horrible. I hope it is a long time before I come across a book this bad again.","I liked the book but all the characters were technologically ignorant. Even in the forties they had small portable generators but this was ignored in the book. One part of the book basically said they let all the lights go out. People knew about generators then and if not you would've have soon found out.","I'm not talking about the pandemic itself; I'm talking about the aftermath. I found the lack of progress of the human race, as detailed in this book, to be very unlikely. Even assuming that out of initial group of adults in Ish's group, Ish is the only highly intelligent one, I found it really hard to believe that the adults wouldn't bother to teach the kids how to read and do math, so that they'd be able to use the libraries to learn the skills they'd need to survive. It didn't make sense that there would only be two main characters with any sort of curiosity about *anything*. Why was knowledge of carpentry lost when The Tribe's carpenter died? Didn't he train anyone in his craft? Didn't anyone want to learn?I expected this book to outline some sort of return to the land, which would be much more realistic than having The Tribe live off canned food for forty years. This book spends way too much time expounding on how intelligent Ish is without showing him actually doing anything to help the human race.","I had heard excellent things about Earth Abides. I have always liked post apocolyptic books, and this is often the first recommendation by people. I tried reading it once, but thought the writing was detached and boring after a few pages, so put it down, and gave it away. Then, i saw the audio version on sale on audible.com, and downloaded it.I know this book was written in 1949 or something, and those I've talked to, comment on that as if its an excuse for blatant and rampant sexism and racism. But, I'm sorry, there is not accepatance in me for any of this no matter when it was written.The women are portrayed as either blood sucking, parasitic whores or blank and faceless wombs. Even his dog, a female dog, is described as ungrateful, needy and parasitic, expecting to be taken care of without giving anything in return, and provides in no way useful in the way of dogs, that I can remember. She is named Princess.The first non-whites that are encountered are identified as \"Negros\" and are described as unattractive, nervous, hesitant and lice ridden, living in a cabin with cheap and rickety furniture although there are far nicer houses empty for the taking. Our main character trades a dollar bill for eggs, and the \"negros\" are well pleased. So, they are poor, dirty, and stupid.Then, there is our main character, he is an unappologetic arrogant elitist who deems 99% of those he meets as unworthy of living. He decides that they will all die \"secondary\" die off because they are stupid, crazy without will to live. He drives around in his car, looking for people, but yet finding none, eventhough he infact comes across people. None of them are \"worthy\". He even makes a list of why he will survive were the others will die, and the list includes that he is solitary, and never cared much for people anyway. Which seemed strange to me, since he had found 4 or 5 people in one day's search. Its not like the world is entirely empty.I gave it two stars, because initially, I was interested in the observations of the earth and the cities and how nature is taking over and civilization is breaking down, but with no engaging characters or furthering of a worthwhile plot, I quickly lost interest and had to force myself to go on, looking for even a glimmer of the amazement and awe others seem to view this book. I found nothing of the like.","One-and-a-half stars really. Not much happens in this book.The main character spends most of his time musing over the fate of the earth and observing the effects of erosion on human artifacts, now that most of the world's population has been wiped out. One of the racier sections I recall was his observation of a storm water drain overflowing.It took two or three pages.However, the book is readable enough to fill in a bit of time while trapped in a hospital bed for a few days, and might even have earned as many as three stars from me, were it not for the &quot;hero's&quot; much over-inflated sense of self worth which manifests itself on nearly every page, most often by refering in his thoughts to all of his friends as simple, stolid, dull, or just plain stupid.Not to mention what he thinks of those whom he doesn't count among his friends!Maybe we are not meant to like the &quot;hero&quot;, but I think we are, and I can't help thinking that this story could be written by one of those aneamic, spotty, embittered social outcasts that one often finds lurking in the shadows at science fiction conventions, more at home with his onanistic fantasies than with any human being. I quote:&quot;...he realized that in some ways...he felt a new security and even satisfaction at the contemplation of a solitary life. His worries in the old days had been chiefly about people. The prospect of going to a dance had more than once sent him into a sweat; he had never been a good mixer; no one had asked him to join a fraternity. In the old days, such things were a handicap to a man. Now, he realized, they were actually a great advantage. Because he had sat on the edge of so many social gatherings, not quite able to mingle in the conversation, listening, watching objectively, now he could endure not being able to talk, and again could sit and watch, noting what happened. His weakness had become strength. It was as if there had been a blind man in a world suddenly bereft of light. In that world, those with seeing eyes could only blunder about, but the blind man would be at home, and now, instead of being the one who was guided by others, he might be the one to whom others clung for guidence.&quot;His intellectual snobbery becomes glaringly obvious as he begins to meet other survivors, and is at it's most repellant when he discusses &quot;half-witted&quot; Evie, whom one of the other survivors found &quot;dirty, grovelling, and unkempt, living in filth with merely enough intelligence to open cans to feed herself on whatever they contained, without cooking or preperation.&quot; This doesn't seem too much of a crime, and neither does the only other thing that seems to be &quot;wrong&quot; with her, that she can't hold a conversation. Nevertheless, the &quot;hero&quot; goes on to say:&quot;It would have been better, he had often thought, if they had merely put a can of sweet ant-poison within her reach somewhere.&quot; Of course, we must remember that when this book was published, in in 1949, social policy in the US was still under the sway of brianiac and boffin advocates of eugenics, and many &quot;subnormals&quot; and &quot;moral degenerates&quot; were still being sterilized by court order, despite the widespread revulsion over the results of Nazi social engineering procedures based on the same premises. A good antidote to the attitutudes expressed by this book is to be found in Jonathan Kellerman's excellent thriller &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot;, wherein eugenicists lurk behind a spree of cowardly murders. Kellerman's book is also recommended as a healthy locus for introspection by any readers of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; who find themselves agreeing with the &quot;hero's&quot; attitudes and solutions.","Overall this book didn't impress me enough to ever recommend it to anyone else but it also wasn't horrible. The beginning explanation of the plague and the prehistory of the character are so vague that the rest of the book is ruined. Doesn't stand anywhere near books like The Stand or Swan Song.","I would not recommend this book. UNLESS you are having a hard tiime falling asleep!! The main character, Ish is supposed to be an educated man who survives a deadly world wide virus. He uses his aledged power of observation to observe how the people around him, who are incapable of doing anything without his help survive. Unfortunately for the people around him, Ish seams to be unable to do anything but watch and complain.","Earth Abides is a disaster story where aplague almost wipes out humans. Becausewe grew too prosperous we had to die, according to the author, that is just the way things work. So the few survivors get by never trying to improvetheir lives, having no ambition the human race lapses into hunter gatherers with only superstition as a guide. Thisbook is a waste of a good oportunity. Insted of saying &quot;Hey, we can occomplishthings if we work hard and perservier.&quot; The author tells us &quot;Hey, we're almost as good as cockroaches and if we drop our standards, we too can can eek out ameager existence.&quot;I don't have to pay people to depress me, I can do that all by myself. What awaste of time and money.","I read this book a number of years ago, and forgot about it. Recently, I saw it on the shelf, and decided to re-read it. After forcing myself to read it, I understand why it was easy to forget.The main character, Ish, is highly arrogant and self-righteous. Ish, only Ish, has the power to drive civilization back from a total collapse. Ish has a son, Joey, who worships Ish, and Ish drinks it up. Joey is The Saviour, The One, a child who must be taught the abstract ideas which created Civilization. Nothing else matters.The side-characters are all inferior. These are the people with skills to survive. This includes artistic skills which doesn't include the formal education which _must_ be part of any \"real\" artists training.The most interesting part of it all is the background story of how the Earth really abides without Man trying to impose his will. Structures decay due to natural events; forests and wild-life reclaim the land.It may be a classic book, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a good book!","Can't believe the negative reviews of this extraordinary novel. Read it for yourself. Then, you will appreciate life as we know it today. You will sleep well, adore more your family and friends, and rest assured that Earth abides.","I read this book about half way in sophmore year, and quit reading it. Now I'm 20 and I decided I'd give it another try. I have about 60 pages left, and I gotta say, this book is one of the slowest I have read, up there with the lord of the rings fellowship. I know it's a classic, but man, I can't even read this book for more than 30 min. at a time. Usually I blaze through books within a few days, but I'm probably on a month and a half with this book. I work a lot, so I dont usually have much time for reading except while I'm going to the bathroom and before bed, but wow. I mean the book is ok, it's not bad, it's just not a pageturner, which is what I usually go for. The main character Ish is very paranoid, thinks to far into detail over everything, and is in my opinion is a coward. I also feel like there is too much side tracking in this book. It's also very repetuous. I feel like there is too much thinking and too little action about anything. In some ways I relate to the main character, because I overthink a lot of things, I'm not the biggest strongest guy, nor the most handy, but that doesn't make it any more interesting of a read. It kind of defeats the purpose of me reading a book. I read to meet interesting characters, be engrossed in a story that is not mine, and to entertain my mind. I don't want to read about a character thinking. If i did want to read about that, I would read a philosophy book and do the thinking myself, or better yet, I'd read nothing and just think. When I think of books taking place in a post apocalyptic world, I think of a little bit more than this gives you. There could have been a lot more interesting scenarios in the depicted world than the one focused on in this book.I will say though that this book does use an interesting vocabulary, and I've learned a few new words. And the part's in Itallics are by far the best parts of the book. These parts do truly make an impression in your mind, and I would rate these as 5 star. Some of the itallicized parts are very deep and meaningful. I love this quote out of one of those parts \"Between the plan and fulfillment stands always the frail barrier of a human life\"Overall: Id say it's worth reading, but it's by far not the best book ever like some of the other reviewers are saying. I liked Cormick Mcarthy's \"The Road\" as a post apocalyptic story better, it seemed more real, and it moved at a quicker pace.","I read this book when I was in middle school, probably 1982, and it's impressive that it seemed futuristic even at that time when it had been written decades earlier. With the imminent release of \"I Am Legend\" I was reminded of this book again as a different take on post-apocalyptic literature.I said it was memorable but flawed because it gave an interesting early look at the idea of a pandemic, and the aftermath of such, but didn't seem to give a realistic take on the survivors' civilization. Why would people suddenly give up their institutes of religion, for example? Historically, when has this happened? He has black people in the south growing cotton \"just because\" and worshipping crocodiles (I don't know if this was a racist component or not.)In the end, his view was rather too cynical and unrealistic about the way people react to the loss of technology. Technology isn't what makes people great, it is their values. I think he didn't realize that.","I first read this book in high school -- 1964! And, loved it soo much I &quot;forgot&quot; to return it to the library &lt;blush&gt;. I've re-read it numerous times over the years and enjoyed it every time. I hope you enjoy it, too. It's a tremendous read.","If you like post-apocalyptic sci-fi, as I do, you'll probably enjoy this book. The book starts out strongly but peters out toward the middle after the narrator settles down and becomes embarrassingly introspective about how himself and what it takes to build a civilization. Parts of the book are clumsily written and pretentious. If you want better apocalyptic fiction, try John Wyndham or John Christopher.","I love end-of-the-world fiction. Call me a gourmand of it, if you will. Well, one story I had missed was, &quot;Earth Abides&quot;. So, I read a lot of reviews here at Amazon and I decided to buy it.I gave it three stars because I did not finish it. Usually, I can read anything. Even bad fiction becomes a challenge to conclude; disappointing fiction is a different story. It's just isn't my type. Though, I can appreciate what others see in it.Summary: A fellow goes off hiking and is bit by a rattlesnake. After his near-death experience and recovery (lasting about 2 weeks), he comes back to society to find no one home. The book follows his life as he: travels, struggles, meets other survivors, starts a fledgling society.The strengths of this book encompass one man's struggle to survive an unthinkable situation. It is wonderful at explaining some the effects of a global disaster in which only the people are gone. Our ordinance remains. But all eventually decays. The next generation of human society loses it cerebralness, but gains an innate link to the earth. Man exterminated by a virus with extreme prejuidice has now become just a creature not a ruler of the earth.In fact, just as I am typing this out; I am getting excited to read it. But, here come the negatives.The weaknesses are few, but very important. Characterization. Stereotypes abound, while the earth abides. Women are merely wombs needed for their matronly duties. Which would be true in this case. But there is no other extrapolation of feelings and thoughts for the women other than a prehistoric regression of their being and worth. All other characterizations are weak. The protagonist grows on in years but not in emotional or intellectual depth.There are other things that I did not like in the book. When things start to break down, our hero does nothing to stop it; even when he has others to help him. On grand scale, when the infrastructure fails, nothing is done. Not even attempted. One man may not be able to save a power plant or water system. But a group could. Well, possibly. After all, they have all the time in the world. Even if the those infrastructure repairs are ignored, what about personal systems? Our hero is a graduate student in Geology, and this book was only written 50 years ago. The Cold war is in it's infancy. Bomb shelters, survival gear are not unheard of. Oh well. That's what I don't like.Conclusion: I think if I was a teenager I might have read this book differently. But being in my early 30s and a scientist skews my notion of this type of fiction. Please read this book. You may be able overlook, or not even think what I pointed out were points against it. Personally, I'd suggest reading, &quot;The Stand&quot;, &quot;Warday&quot; or &quot;I am Legend&quot;.","I hate this book. I truly hate it, more than any other novel I've ever read outside of fundamentalist hate-drivel. That's saying a lot for me, given that I love reading and I particularly enjoy sci-fi books and those with apocalyptic themes (morbid, yes, but what can you do).The reason I loathe this book with the burning fire of ten thousand suns is the blobs of useless goo that pass for the main characters. They don't DO anything. Sure, they do the usual things like eating and sleeping and scratching their nether regions, but that's about it. As I read through this train-wreck I wanted to grab a bullhorn and scream into the book for them to do something, ANYTHING, to better their situation or try to learn something new or to show an emotion of any kind. The author has the main characters sitting around and eating out of tin cans and twiddling their thumbs for-get this-forty-two YEARS. Not a few months while they get the hand of harvesting fresh food, not a year or two while they learn new trades or research better ways to go about things, but forty-two freaking years.They don't even bother to teach their kids to read. There's one kid named Joey, whom the main character Ish keeps thinking, \"Garsh, he's the one!\" (repeated often), and ponders the possibility of teaching this precocious seven-year-old how to read, but Joey suddenly dies of illness. Presumably, so does civilization, because the passel of thirty-odd other kids running around at this point are deemed by Ish to be either too stupid or too disinterested for him to bother getting out of his Lay-Z-Boy and teaching them the ABC's. Obviously the author has never been around children. The ONE thing he does teach them, and he refers to this as his \"legacy,\" is to show them how to make a bow and arrows.The basic message of the book is \"Yup. We're screwed, folks, so give up early.\" Frankly, if I had been in the situation that these main characters were in, I'd do my damnedest to rebuild and make use of the remaining human world around me. I'd teach my kids how to read and how to use all the technology around them, and if I didn't know how to use something I'd find out how. I'd learn to farm and how to turn the electricity back on and basic medical care. I sure as hell wouldn't be sitting around for forty-two years staring at the wall.The only thing that kept the first half of the book from being used as toilet paper (don't ask about the other half) is that Stewart drops in the occasional interesting factoid about what would happen in nature if there suddenly were no longer any human beings. These facts are nicely offset from the story, set in their own paragraphs and in italics, so if you're interested in this sort of stuff you can skim through and read them fairly quick.","I was looking for a good \"end of the world\" type novel, and after the amazing reviews, chose this one. Disappointed hardly describes it. This is one that as a quick reader (usually finishing a novel in less than two days) it took me over a week of forcing myself to keep picking this back up. This was so anti-climatic it was boring.The most interesting thing about the story wasn't even told! One day, Ish wakes up to the aftermath of a world stripped of most humanity. Personally, I would have liked to read about the actual acts of the end of days, not the leftover start over.So Ish decides to drive all over the U.S. just observing, meeting some people along the way. Again, pretty dull. It is described well, and the writer is a good writer, but he doesn't seem to have anything to tell. He could have had more conflict, more interesting character, but it lacked this. In fact, until the end of the book, I didn't even know how old Ish was in the beginning. For a book that focuses on this main character, and pretty much the first quarter of the book is all about Ish, there is very little backstory and knowledge of him. Unacceptable.Instead the focus is on everything going on, well not going on, around Ish. The lack of people. The mess. The fires and fallen trees. Where has electricity and where doesn't. The looting.The most interesting thing he actually wrote about was the rise and fall of other species. I would have LOVED to read more about THAT! However, his telling of the ants, which was brilliant, was summed up in a few paragraphs while he took ages to tell the most boring parts.It also was unbelievable to me. Granted, this was written in the forties. But I hardly think for as long as time passed, even in simpler times, that people would live as they did without making more adjustments until they absolutley had to. I suppose some people might be that way, and I guess we'll never know until it happens.Honestly, I would have been more interested in reading about the other survivors than Ish, who was a procrastinator and thought very little of those closest to him.I would not recommend this book. Yes, it does stick with you. But not in a good way.","This book sucks. Cars don't run on 20 year old gas, canned goods go bad after time, You should probably learn how to grow your own food and get your own water before 20 years has passed... This book is not only dated, but just plain stupid in it's aspects of survivalism.","First, let me start off stating that I know this is suppose to be a classic; however, I found little to like in this book. It is a very, very long story where nothing happens...really. After a couple hundred pages I started to skip forward, looking for something to peak my interest. Nothing ever happens in this book...let me sum it up for you. 1) Plague, 2) a few people find one another, 3) they plant plants, 4) they plant more plants, 5) they watch the ants and rats die out, 6) they have kids and scribble on a rock for 20 years, the end.If you want to read a great post-apocalypse book, get One Second After or The Road. Either of these books blows this dull piece out of the water.","EARTH ABIDES is such an amazing book. In fact, I happened to keep my high school copy rather than returning it before graduation. Deep down, I think my teacher knew and was happy to take the loss.I have three books that I will not part with - EARTH ABIDES, THE STAND, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. EARTH ABIDES and THE STAND have a lot in common. I am surprised, as were others, by all of those who gave this book such a low rating.The story tells the tale of a college student, Ish, who is working on his thesis up in the mountains. He gets bitten by a rattlesnake and heads to lower ground for help only to discover the human population has been wiped out thanks to some weird plague. The story becomes Ish's quest to live as supposedly the last human on earth.First, I want to clarify that this book was written in the 1940s. Those who complained about the writing being poor, one guy even said the book was written in the 60s and he is wrong, need to look at the times. The world in the 1940s was far different to today. If you cannot adapt to the language differences, skip this book. While I find it rather narrowminded, I also understand the world is full of people who just can't stand something that is different to the norm.In the 1940s, they didn't have the computers, men were working away from their family farms, they'd become used to modern technology, so it isn't surprising that Ish would have allowed so many things to slip by for decades. If the world ended tomorrow how many can honestly say they would know how to irrigate their crops? How many even know how to garden?At heart, EARTH ABIDES needs to be viewed with the consideration of the differences in time. It is and always will be my favorite book.","I am a 62 year old grandmother who has read hundreds of books, but no book ever moved me like this one. It is the story of one thoughtful, intelligent young man spared during a world wide epidemic that wiped out most of the population. While we always expect that the end will come with a bomb that distroys everything, this time, all the infrastructure was left intact. The plants and animals that had evolved to be dependent on humans also succumbed and Mr. Stewart deals with this in a remarkable and sensitive way. Today human beings have brought civilization to the brink, but this book reminds us that no matter what, the Earth Will Abide.","However, if you want Mad Max or his clones go elsewhere. Since I read this book back in grade school it has always been on my shelf, in fact I usually have 2, one personal copy and one copy to give to friends. I read many of the reviews of this book and wonder if some of these people read the same book. To me Earth Abides is one of the most uplifting books ever written. This book shows that no matter what comes, life and happiness will happen. No matter all Ish's failings to teach his people, his Greatgrandchildern are happy, they do not miss what they never knew. He teaches them to survive and they will teach themselves the rest. Again I say if you are looking for an actionpacked end of the world book I would recommend Daybreak-2250 A.D. by Andre Norton. However if you want one of the best books written that will make you think about humanity and all its failings and gifts, READ THIS BOOK! I just wish I could have given it 15 stars instead of just 5.","Ish, a college student, survives a rattlesnake bite and mysterious illness alone on a mountain camping trip. When he recovers, he can't find anyone and slowly realizes a plague has wiped out the human race. He wanders across the country, finding only a few stunned survivors and makes an intelligent and courageous decision to not join the first people he finds. After a period of terrible isolation, he finds Em, a true survivor like himself. They are happy together and attract five other survivors. A tiny little tribe grows around them. Ish devotes his life to trying to bring back civilization as he knew it. He fails at his superficial efforts at farming and at educating the children. He succeeds beyond his deepest dreams at giving his descendants the tools they need to create a healthy, happy way of life. The novel works as a thought-provoking study of what do you do when the world collapses around you. It has some weaknesses. Here and there, the fact it was written in 1949 shows. One can argue that Ish would have been able to get the children to read if only he hadn't been such a boring pedant and he could have been a better farmer if he'd been willing to explore alternate ways and crops. The book's strengths greatly outweigh its weaknesses. For one thing, with not much action, it's a true page turner. This is a fantastic novel to discuss and to argue about and to ponder the fundamental question it raises. What would you do for the rest of your life if you survived the end of the world?","First off, I should state that this novel was written in the late forties, and thus reflects many of the prevailing attitudes of the time. It is rather sexist, and even vaguely racist (although neither element is malicious, just ignorant) so if you think that may ruin the novel for you, then you probably want to skip it. That said, if you can look at \"Earth Abides\" in the context in which it was written, you will find a thoughtful, entertaining novel.\"Earth Abides\" is predicated on a super-virus wiping out the overwhelming majority of the Earth's human population, while leaving the rest of the animal kingdom unaffected (at least directly). The story follows \"Ish\" as he struggles both to survive, and come to grips with the loss of civilization. Over time, a community of survivors gels around him, and they work to scratch an existence out of the ruins of San Francisco.Stewart takes a rather bleak view of the survivors of the holocaust, not to mention their children. Rather than trying to reestablish \"civilization\" they slip into a more or less Stone Age existence, supplemented by the leavings of a culture they are completely alienated from, and that is not understood by the children at all. While I understand that Stewart was seeking to comment on what makes up a \"civilization\", and what the natural human condition is, or should be, I think he introduced an element of wishful thinking into his narrative (strange as that may sound). It is extremely unlikely that things as fundamental as literacy would completely disappear within two generations, and while they might very well fail, I suspect that survivors would at least attempt to maintain electricity, water supplies, etc.Where this novel really shines, and what I found most interesting to read, was Stewart's descriptions of the ecology of a North America largely depopulated of humans. He does a superb job of predicting the fluctuations in various animal populations, and I believe that the long-term balance that he predicts is probably not far from what would actually happen.Ultimately, \"Earth Abides\" is an entertaining novel that leaves one thinking about how they would react in similar situation. While I don't necessarily agree with the way the novel plays out, I was constantly challenged to come up with an explanation as to why I thought things might be different. In the process, I gained a deeper appreciation for the depth of Stewart's characters, and the challenges he pitted them with. If you enjoy \"apocalyptic fiction\" this is definitely a book for you, but even if you have not strong feelings for the genre, I suspect you will enjoy the excellent characterizations, thoughtful story and wonderfully realized world.","This book attempts to answer the age old question, \"what will earth be like without humans?\". In a word, BORING, just like this novel. Don't get me wrong, there are some great parts to this novel with real drama and action and intrigue and heart-wrenching feeling. Unfortunately, those parts are few and far between, and they are between mountains of tedium and monotony. I will give George R. Stewart credit for doing his homework scientifically, historically, culturally, etc, and I have no doubt that if a horrible plague ever wiped out nearly all of the human race, this is probably a really accurate depiction of what would occur. However, and this is why i give this book such a low rating, there is a vast difference between writing an accurate book and an entertaining one. In many ways this book is very similar to other post apocalyptic novels like The Stand, The Road, The Book of Eli, On the Beach, etc etc etc, however, where those novels shine and where this novel falls flat is in the art of story-telling. Basically, this novel has no story other than the mere survival of the last remaining humans. There is no plot, no antagonist (unless you count harsh nature herself), no great task to complete, no long journey to take, and no lesson to be learned. When gone is the human race, the earth and everything on it will still be here, and in the closing words of the author, \"Humans come and go, but the Earth Abides.\"","I really enjoyed this novel from the apocalyptic genre very much. It was not a fantasy good versus evil type of story but rather a speculative look at how civilization might fare if there was a sudden die-off of 99% of the population. In this story there is a sudden plague of such devastating severity that nearly everyone is dead within a couple of weeks of its outset. This book does not focus on the plague or the sufferings of the infected and dying people. No grisly oozing bodies are found in these pages and very little trauma or grief. We enter the picture shortly after the dust has settled, so to speak. The story is not about the plague but about its aftermath. It is told from the perspective of one man who survives and traces his experiences as he goes in search of other survivors and finally settles back in his native California and makes the foundation of a new \"tribe\" of civilized human beings. This book was written in 1949 so it is doubly interesting because it not only gives us a look at the author's speculation about the factors that make up civilization and the interesting trials and successes that might arise, but it also gives us an amazing look at the huge changes that have taken place in our consciousness just in the short period of years since it was written. It has the unexpected bonus of actually confirming some of the points the story originally was designed to suggest. Even though the author seems as though he was an open-minded, perhaps even liberal thinker, the book contains ridiculous racial stereo-types, as well as skewed ideas about the personhood of mentally disabled people and also of women. Women are shown as being entirely domestic and dependent. Cigarette smoking is still very much a happy pastime in this brave new world and is enjoyed by men and their pregnant wives without a care in the world. When a plague of ants becomes a problem the main character, Ish, sprays himself and his pregnant wife down thoroughly with DDT, a substance that is used several times in the surviving world to overcome pests. I found these old-fashioned ideas very interesting when coming from a \"reasonable\" man that no one of his time would have considered to be prejudiced. The book is a thought-provoking page-tuner. I kept imagining that I would have done things in a much different way from the main character but I found the ideas and reasoning to be essentially sound and worth contemplating. This is an interesting look at how the Earth might rid herself of the virus called mankind and is certainly a good look at the power of her self-healing capabilities. I definitely recommend this book.","I first read this book when I was 8 years old. My dad had left it out and I grabbed it up and read it. Even at 8 years old I found this book gripping and thought provoking. As I grew older I would find a copy and read it, and each time I would gain something new from reading this book. I am 45 years old now and I am feeling the urge to read it again. I think the reason why the survivors did not \"rebuild civilization\" was because they were all in shock--their whole world (friends, lovers, children) had been wiped off the face of the earth almost overnight. If you add to this the author's stated premis that the survivors were mostly average to dull, then the story makes more sense. I recommend this book to anyone, it's a sci-fi classic. I also think the movie \"The Omega Man\" might have been inspired by this book.","Many reviewers here expected something different, I think. They are dismayed.They have all the elements properly arranged but do not see how they add up. Ishi characterizes himself as intelligent and the others as inferior to him in cognitive ability, yet he fails in almost all his undertakings.At the first sign of trouble he goes home and sleeps in his boyhood bedroom, then returns there and takes up a permanent residence in the old home place -- this infantile reversion is culture-shock but he can't see it. He is supposedly trained in ecology but is taken by surprise every time the local ecology adjusts itself to mankind's absence -- this emphasizes the futility of a college education in a survival situation. He carries a prejudice against negroes yet marries a mulatto and doesn't even realize it at first -- his blindness extends deeply within him. He tries to educate the youngsters but cannot hold their interest -- he is too disconnected from their reality. He has in front of him all the ingredients for success -- yet fails on his own terms, which are unreal.And yet, he does succeed, doesn't he? In spite of himself he does manage to attract a group which survives and stays together. Gradually over the course of his life he becomes ever-farther removed from reality, while the children take over the lead. They develop the skills they need to live in the new world almost while Ishi is not looking -- they become \"wild Indians\" wearing skins and shooting arrows.Ishi was the name given to the last member of a tribe of California Indians, the Yahi. In 1911 he was brought in by white society and nursed back to health by the Kroebers, with whom he lived. The Kroebers were a university couple, anthropologists. Their daughter Ursula was born in 1929 and grew up with Ishi in the house. Ursula's married name is LeGuin; she has won many awards for her science fiction. (Google 'Ishi' and see.)Ishi also is the short form of Ishmael, a name for the Wandering Jew of legend; Melville's \"Moby Dick\" begins with the sentence, \"Call me Ishmael.\"In short, Ishi is sort of the Dagwood of survivalists. Arnold Schwartzenegger would not star in the film version. Despite his shortcomings and failures, life actually does go on. In fact he is a lot like you and me. How well do we know ourselves? How well do our everyday decisions turn out? Once Ishi says to heck with it and lets things slide, things get better just like in real life.Stewart's genius was to place these things before us and then get out of the way. He has placed hints in the text, the italicized passages which give us objective truth, sandwiched between Ishi's misadventures. What he is saying is, in despite of ourselves, Earth Abides.If you enjoy the subject, try Walter Miller's \"Canticle for Leibowitz\", or Clifford Simak's \"City\" or David Brin's \"The Postman.\"Dave","I enjoyed this one. It is a very good read and certainly gives us some food for thought. We do need to remember when this one was written as to social attitudes, etc., but if we keep this in mind, it is good. I suppose you could read the book for it's social commentary, relate it to unspellable philosophical stances, blah, blah, blah, as one reviewer did, or you can read it for a very nice story to read on a rainy weekend. I enjoyed it, will probably read it again and highly recommend it.","I've gotta confess I was not very excited to read this book, having obtained on a bargain and postposed its reading for about a year, when I eventually got to it, I was absolutely blown awaythe writting, althought not brilliant, is very polished and takes you throught the wonderful adventure of the end of mankind as we know it, throught the vast territory of a deserted united states, and tells us how it would slowly and rapidly decay in its various facets, until it would stand almost naked, a fertile ground for life anewcoming throught the plagues caused by the broken ecosystems and among the difficulties tapped by the human intervention we give for granted, it sets up a perfect place for the second half of the book, in which civilization begins again, necessarily different of how it came about in the first place, offering us exciting reflections on how we are and how we'd be, on values and life and growth, we age with the original characters, and by the time Ish is an old man we can see this new world throught the eyes af an old man, we understand and are subjected to the same hoplesness as him in the development of the new world, yet the hope of life, free of our cultural bagages and preconceptions, grows and leaves you a great aftertastean incredible novel, terribly underrated, which should be cherished and shared","Several reviews have noted what they call the essential pessimism of the book: Man Has Fallen, Civilization Is No More, etc. Well, yes, that is all there. But what is also there is a profound triumph of the human spirit: Civilization is Dead - Long Live Civilization. I will NOT spoil the ending, but book ends with a rebirth - an obvious societal pregnancy if you will - of a new civilization, one profoundly in keeping with the new conditions of their brave renewed world.One can imagine a sequel, and I wish Stewart ahd written one!I first read this book almost 50 years ago, and have re-read it multiple times. It is one of the best \"transition\" books ever written. I recommend it on several levels.","An astonishing science fiction novel in the apocalyptic vein, written in 1949, and despite a surprisingly few dated references, a story that remains both entertaining and relevant. In the beginning, protagonist Isherwood Williams (with the unfortunate nickname of \"Ish\") is one of the few survivors of a virus that wipes out a majority of the human population. Ish is in his twenties, an over-educated outsider, who stands on the margins of society analyzing and contemplating what he sees. After a solo excursion across the county and returning to the Bay Area, California, he slowly joins up with an assortment of characters, and becomes the de facto leader of \"The Tribe\". The struggles that confront them are meticulously well thought out and explicated by the author while rarely dragging down the narrative. The slow decay of an industrial society with no one left to manage it and the natural environment no longer held at bay serve as the antagonists. There are no sci-fi pulp orientated elements such as giant mutant killer ants (for better or worse). Threatening the Tribe are scourges of rats, wild dogs, and other animals, as various species overpopulate until starvation brings their numbers down again. There are outbreaks of disease to be dealt with and wild brush fires caused by dead trees no longer cleared away. The novel deftly provides details such as what happens to the plumbing when city reservoirs dry up and fall into disrepair. The real strength of the book, however, is how Ish is forced to confront what knowledge and wisdom needs to be passed on to the future generations in order to rebuild society. Hence with his intelligent introspective nature, interwoven into this entertaining story are thoughtful reflections on what purposes societies serve, what they protect us from, and even what they blind us to and cause us to take for granted. This is a timeless classic our own civilization would be mistaken to let slip into the \"out-of-print\" abyss.","Well almost everything has been already written about this book but I have one new curiosity not yet mentioned by anybody. In fact it's this curiosity that caused me to only give it a three star rating. To enjoy this book I had to believe that the handful of survivors world wide all loss basic curiosity. I can understand the total grief, the total denial and complete loss of the few who survive. I cannot understand the total and complete loss of curiosity. All around the survivors they have the tools, the machines and all the books but nobody has any interest in them. The leader of the survivors gives only lip service to the books but does nothing to really grow from them. Nor does he use them to learn the psychology of how to motivate his tribe. He only once attempts to do anything and at that it's only an after thought. He comes up with an idea that sparks the survivors into thinking about rebuilding a jeep but that's all. Aside from this his tribe cares about nothing. His tribe lives only day to day but seem forever lost in the now and blind, uncaring and unwilling to look to the past and what it can offer to help then survive in the future. The author never mentions curiosity or its loss in any of the timeline that the book traverses. It's as if curiosity never was part of humankind. All in all, I could enjoy the book without curiosity but it left me wondering what if it had included it in the story.","This is the 'end of the world as we know it' novel that all others are compared to. Even though it was written in the 1940's (copyright 1949) it is timeless, not aged at all, a great literary work.It all starts when the main character, Ish, is bitten by a rattlesnake and laid up in a remote cabin, unconscious for an extended period of time, while, unknown to him, a plague destroys over 99% of the population. There begins a superb story of the trials and adventures of one man, and eventually a small group of people, as they battle nature and themselves, and attempt to re-establish civilization. This is one of those rare novels where characterization and plot and setting all mesh together into one beautifully written yarn, that after reading it, you will never forget it, it is that powerful. If there ever existed the proverbial page turner, this is it. Of course, being written in the 1940's no mention is made of personal computers, CD players, and the like, but if civilization was gone these most likely would be of little use anyway.The philosophy and human interest angles contained in this book are well done. The scenes and descriptions of the demise of civilization and peoples' reactions to it, depicted by Stewart, seem very realistic. Your heart will be with the characters of this book when you read it.","Earth Abides is a thought provoking look at how the world would go if almost all people were eliminated from the picture. Some very interesting looks at the eco-structure, reformation of small societies and how they would interact from the short term to the long term. The book has some very sad and touching aspects that help you relate to the characters. The technology is a little outdated because of when the book was written but you can get past that. Overall, a very good book. One I would think in a few years I might like to read again.If you liked &quot;The Stand&quot;, and have wondered what would might happen 50 years afterwards. This is the book for you.","I have been looking for this book for a long time. I read this book for an Environmental Science class at Long Beach State about 20 years ago and it made such an impact on my thinking about the environment. Every time I see grass growing up through the cracks in the street or the roots wrapping around pipes I think of the book. While the environment seems quite fragile, it appears that it is not a fragile as we think and we are the fragile ones.","Let's start with the book's obvious problems. First, the author is a creature of his times -- the 1940's, and his views relect those times. He is paternalistic towards African Americans and women, and he feels that people without much formal education are not very smart or capable. Second, his main character, Ish, is not likeable; he is lazy, selfish, unloving (for the most part), rather anti-social, inflexible, and egotistical. (I am not sure that the author intended Ish to be unlikeable, as Ish is also a creature of his times.) Third, the author's view of the post-apocalytic world does not ring true; even given the dolts that the author has chosen to survive this catastrophe, surely more of the modern world would have survived -- at least for a few generations. (Example [MILD SPOILER]: would middle-class Americans ever decide not to teach their children to read? If there ever were a group of people who needed to know how to read, it would be this new generation!) Fourth, I do not find the biology/physics of this new world to be believable. (Example: where did all of the bodies go?) Fifth, the \"mother earth\" motif that runs throughout the book is hackneyed -- though, in fairness, it might have been fresh in the 1940's.Still, I liked the book. It is a book of ideas dressed up as a post-apocalyptic tale. What does it mean to be human? How does one balance the needs of the group against the needs of the individual? What is culture? What aspects of life/culture have value? What is love? What role should religion play in society? What role should education play? How does one go on after a devastating loss? How can people relate across generational lines? Can one generation truly lead another? What is happiness? What skills in life are most important? When is violence justified? What does death mean? How does one motivate and lead others? What does \"fun\" mean? How do small group dynamics play out? What function do rituals and symbols play in life? How do cultures adjust to rapid change?I did not usually agree with the author's answers to these questions (when he provided them), but they did challenge me. I have thought a lot about the book since completing it.","I agree with another reviewer who said it is a measure of this book's greatness that I still think of it now, fifty years after I read it.Fire, by the same author, is also unforgettable.This from a guy who can re-read a mystery he read three years earlier and not remember who done it.","A horrible disease sweeps the planet in days, killing just about everyone. Isherwood Williams is for some reason spared from this plague, and finds himself a survivor in a barren society. The book follows the course of his life, and that of other survivors, as they live out their days in a new world.My opinions ran wild with this book. For reason I will explain further along in the review, I started out very much enjoying the book, then my interest waned, and finally something clicked into place in my pea-sized brain, allowing me to finish the book on a strong note.I found it very easy to step into the mind of Ish. He reacted in a way to his situation that I felt was very natural, while learning how to cope with life alone. I don't want to give much of the plot away, but roughly the first third of the book deals with Ish's life alone. Ish starts out as something of a loner and a worrier, and seems to adjust to the world...for a while. Soon, he becomes desperate for a purpose, and with that notion, sets out to find out \"what happened\".Later, Ish struggles with his own weaknesses while trying to decide how to save the future. Through it all, Stewart keeps the characters consistant. I found it refreshing that he didn't try to thrust someone into the heroic role. For whatever reason, this earned him a good amount of credibility with me.A note on the writing style; I believe this book was written in 1949, so the flow of the book seemed a little odd to me. Some of the conversations just didn't flow well, and I chalked that up to the age of the book. On the other hand, Stewart's timeline fit right in with the world we live in today, and did not really date the book. Except maybe for spraying DDT around like it was air freshener.Around the middle of the book, I started to lose interest. I guess for me the story sort of bogged down with Ish trying, and consistantly failing, to get his people to try to focus on the finer things in life. As I said earlier, when things finally \"clicked\" for me, I found myself appreciating this part of the book more, as it fit in very well with who Ish was and what his purpose was.The ending was just magnificant. I very much felt what Ish was feeling, and clearly saw that he had finally accepted that things were going to work out for his decendants, even if things didn't turn out exactly as he had planned. I can't stress enough how good of a job Stewart did with the ending.This is not an action novel, and at points did become a bit too philosophical for it's own good. For me, it all came together at the end, but it might turn some people off. Also, as mentioned above, the writing style can seem a little strange, but overall this book shot far up my favorites list. This book easily get's five stars from me.","\"Earth Abides\" is one of the best books I have ever read. Even though it was written in 1949, it seems to me like it could have been written yesterday. Very thought-provoking and memorable. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who desires a good read. I couldn't put it down. I finished it several days ago and it still stays in my mind. I bought this book for my Kindle, but I think I am going to order a hard copy too - it was that good.","Even at 60 years old this book still resonates as to the plight of man and his insignificance in the universe. Told as a simple story of survival of the species it gives the reader pause for thought about many issues. Well written without much superflous wording. Great detail on the impact of man and what his loss would mean to the planet.","I love the apocalyptic genre. I had high hopes for this book and it started off good as the main character travels across the country during the aftermath of the disease (which he did not witness first hand while it was happening). After he meets up with a group of fellow survivors, they form a small community and from then on the whole book just seems to be pointless and boring. I got excited when the main character's two sons decided to take a trip across country, but the story line did not follow them on their trip and we found out little of what they saw and experienced when they returned. That infuriated me. Overall, this book was disappointing.","I have been a huge fan of the TEotWaWKI (The End of the World as We Know It) genre for quite some time. In a conversation with a fellow fan, I revealed that I have not heard of this book. After the shouts of shock and consternation died down, I was strongly urged to read it.Boring!Most of the book is taken up by the main character (Isherwood Williams) going on and on about what he or others should do. Then he does nothing! It got to the point that, after an actual interaction with another character (rare though they were), I dread the blah-blah-blah that was about to come.The only reason why I finished this book (and kept this from being a single star review) was the insight it provided on the age in which it was written. These are the things that stand out for me:* Being apologetic for not killing or running off the supposed mentally dificient member of the group.* It seeming to be OK for younger folk to painfully pinch very old people when they don't respond as expected (so much for respecting your elders).* The shame in having to bypass a mountain lion rather than killing it.* Killing a calf only for its liver, and killing its mother just because it was in the way.* Fear that a kid may be too smart and the need to keep it from reading too much.* Purposely not using reference material when trying to do something for which they have no experience.* Seeming lack of desire for good food. Whatever is around is good enough. No need to go out of your way to make something good.* The only time sex is implied is for making babies or cast aspersions upon someone's character.This was an exercise in anti-intellectualism and anti-sensualism. I'd rather be killed in the plague than to have to live with this bunch.","I've read many of the \"apocalyptic\" books. This was a quiet one. Since it was written in 1949, that might explain that. It was a pleasure not to see the F-word at all, and so many of the other obligatory modern slang phrases. It did avoid any positive reference to religion, so it is \"modern\" in that respect. Not exciting at all, and somewhat sad. Probably would appeal to women and those who consider themselves as intellectual or literary critics. Me, I just wanted some action from this book--not.","Why is this kindle book \"not available to kindle customers in Australia\"? SHAME on you Amazon. This was the best book I ever read as a teenager and I so wish to read it again","I read this book years ago (in the early 80's I think). It was my first post-apocalyptic novel and there are pieces of it I still remember. When something kills most of the people in the world, Stewart takes us into middle America. A dog named Bridget (I think), an Irish Setter, sits and waits for her people to come home. Bridget's bewilderment and her mourning is what I remember. The protagonist is a teen-aged boy who struggles to survive. Along the way he meets a housewife in her 30's, and she eventually becomes his wife. She's lost her husband and children and there's something she's hiding--a secret that illustrates how the world has changed since 1949 when Stewart wrote \"Earth Abides.\" Earth Abides ends on a positive note with humanity not quite back to square one. If you like \"everyone dies-but-us\" books and you're sick of flesh-eating zombies and vampires, I recommend it.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005F6569Y/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title","I read this book as a teenager. I've shared it with everyone from siblings to grandchildren and they all agree. It's a thought provoking look at a possible future for the earth. A must read for everyone!","This is a remarkable science fiction novel that has stood the test of time. I read it in the early sixties and recently bought it for my daughter.","What an excellent book! I read this on Vacation in Cancun, and couldn't put it down. I may have missed a couple good vacation days totally engaged with this story. Well worth it.","See this movie and gain a perspective on where we came from. Who we are and where you are going. Buddha jesus all the same guy. Whi knew?","I have read all of Stephenn King's books, so when he wrote that this book was his inspiration for writing The Stand, I knew it would be good. I purchased Earth Abides in a London bookstore a few years ago, but somehow it has gone missing. So I was very surprised and exited when I saw that it was being offered as a kindle book. I have now re-read Earth Abides and it is truly a great work of fiction. It really gets my imagination working, and makes real just how fragile the human race is.","I first read this book when I was in high school. That would be early '60s. It was one of those stories that was foundational in my own thinking. It was a pleasure to read it again after all these years. It is one of the earliest of the apocalyptic genre and its themes are timeless and the characters unforgettable, as you yourself Ish well know. It is still fresh and engrossing to read.","After having read many apocalyptic scifi novels; this is defenitely utopian. SPOILER: The disappearance of all the victim of the plague is suspiciously clean. Also, the simplification of the breakdown of infrastructure seem a bit too clean. However, having dealt with these questions, Stewart frees the book to deal with the most preponderous question: How do the Survivors of a great diaster rebuild civilization?","After reading this book I can no longer get myself to read anything else. There is just no other fiction novel, I believe, that can possible be as good as this book.It's so incredibly thought provoking and engrossing I can't stop reflecting on it.","This is a classic sci-fi drama with interesting survival and sociological study. Long but entertaining and I can recommend it.","This is an enduring futuristic fantasy novel that is hard to put down. The characters are well developed and sympathetic without being heroic. It is easy to image yourself in the protagonist's position, and contemplate how you would react. It really makes you think about what is important in your personal life and in society. An excellent novel for anyone with an active imagination.","This book is so old I was leary about reading it...I have to tell you..even though this book was written so long ago..this book will stick with me forever...the characters are memorable and you are right there with them..you laugh and cry with them!!! i will always remember this book..i am so glad i read it!!!","this is a very well written sci-fi/apocalyptic thriller. it isn't so much as a thriller but an exploration of the human race (in the POV of Ish, one of the most memorable fictional characters IMHO). I love the line \"between the plan and the fulfillment lies the frailty of human life\". so many quotable and thoughtful quotes. this is not for sci-fi readers who like action-packed plots - this book has depth, it satisfied me as a realistic portrait of life after an apocalypse. in fact, if there really is an apocalypse, i believe those who had read Earth Abides will be more than prepared to deal with it.","Excellent book. Still current though written in late 1940's. It is a novel that sticks with you. I have read many disaster books, end of world stories, but I have to say this one is my very favorite.","Lost Books -- Review Number 1 Earth Abides by George R. Stewart D. D. Shade 6/11/98Had Isherwood Williams lived to see our day, with it's social and political decay, he might not have worried so much about &quot;preserving&quot; our culture. As it happens in George R. Stewart's book, the devastating viral plague that cleanses the earth of nearly all human life occurred approximately 50 years ago. Long before the assination of John or Robert Kennedy or Martin Luther King, Jr. Long before the war with Vietnam. Before we put a man on the moon and then cut the space program. Before the pervasion of television and the computer revolution. Before the escalation of the cold war, AIDS, or most of the great serial killers. In other words, Earth Abides takes place in a time that many Americans with gray hair look back upon with nostalgia. The post World War Two years, when those of us between forty and fifty were born. The boomer years. A time of great prosperity. A decade that saw the birth of rock-n-roll, hamburgers, and Oreo cookies. Yet it was a time of great poverty for some. When restrooms, restaurants, and the seats in public transportation were separated by the color of ones skin. When equal pay for equal work was unheard of and a woman's place was in the home. A time when the word 'communist' was the dirtiest and deadliest thing one could call another. An altogether strange time, know as the fifties. It is into this world that Isherwood suddenly finds himself alone. Victim of a freak snakebite while out in the wilderness working on his graduate thesis and survivor of an even more freak accident, the development of a viral plague that wipes out humankind in a matter of weeks. It is altogether fitting that someone named Ish, this is how he signed his name to a hand scrawled will while delirious from the snake bite, should find himself alone in the world. Ish, David Pringle tells us , is a direct reference to the historic Ishi, a California Indian who became famous as the last living representativ! e of his tribe. Ish spends at least a quarter of the book searching for others. He finds a few, lucky people with great immune systems, and in the process stumbles upon the woman with whom he shares the remainder of his years. Together they try to build a community and at the same time rebuild civilization as they had know it. You will have to read the book to learn of Ish's heroic triumphs and failures as he tries to make sure the future has a heritage. Although following the traditional post-apocalyptic formula, that of the earth being cleansed by some means and leaving a few to rebuild civilization, Earth Abides offers some interesting commentary on some central moral questions of our/that time. One of those is racial unrest. Given the nature of European and African American relations in this nation in 1949, Stewart was taking a quite a risk when he developed one particular central character, Em. Ish chooses a strong willed, able, out-spoken, African American woman to be his mate. She was not the first female Ish found, nor was she the best looking, but she had within her the strength to become the mother of a new civilization. Ish recognized this and fell in love with her quickly. And Ish was right-Em alone had the strength and courage to bear the first child in the small community that had grown around them. There was no one who knew how to deliver a baby, and that was frightful enough, but the greatest fear was not knowing if children born into the world would inherit their parents immunity to the plague. Earth Abides is considered a classic by several sources but to my way of thinking, it deserves that exalted position in speculative fiction for having been a forerunner is demonstrating that black and white can live together. Stewart further shows us how important is the relationship between past and future. He does this symbolically through the vehicle of a 4-pound, single-jack hammer. At the beginning of the book, just before the snake bite, Ish is exploring a cave and finds this hammer. It is the! kind miners used in the old days when rock-drills were placed by hand. It is called a single-jack because it can be used with one hand. Ish notes the pleasure he feels when he finds the hammer because of its tie to the past. Even delierous from snake bit, he remembers to take the hammer with him. He keeps it with him throughout the book. As the community grows around Ish and Em, the hammer is used each year to chisel the numbers of the year on a big rock in the hills above where they live. It is always present on the mantel in Ish's living room. And at the end of the book, when Ish has grown old and the younger men, his and other's children, sense that he is ready to pick a new leader for the community, they wait in a circle at his feet for Ish to pick the next leader by giving them the hammer. The importance of tradition to the family and the community is symbolized in the single-jack. John Clute and Peter Nicholls feel that post-apocalyptic or disaster stories are so popular because they appeal to secret desires we all share: a depopulated world, escape from the constraints of a highly organized industrial society, and the opportunity to prove one's ability to survive. I choose the latter of the three. Post-apocalyptic speculative fiction provides a window from which to view the &quot;stuff&quot; of which humankind is made. The writer of a disaster or holocaust story can pit humans against the worst possible odds. The post-holocaust novel gives us the ability to perform an experiment that in reality would be unethical-to put a group of people in hell and record their progress getting out. Earth Abides is a moving, triumpal story of just such a group. No single character in Earth Abides has the stereotypic appeal of Bruce Willis or Nicolas Cage, and yet I came to love them all and worry about their conditions because they were real people. People with many of the same problems and weaknesses I have. People whose actions made me stop and wonder what I would do in the same situation.","I had been really looking forward to this book. Sadly, it really didn't deliver. I found the story telling very linear, the main character Ish, lacking in any real depth and the logic of how he and his small band of people survived, very questionable.I found the first 1/3 of the book interesting. The main character Ish, travels the US in search of other survivers of the deadly plague that ravenged the world. It read more as a travel logue than an sci-fi book, but never the less, was still interesting. However, one would be better served reasing the book, \"A world without us\".Ish, seems nonplused by the vanishing of humanity. The character uses \"logic\" to deal with the situation, but calls those who are enotional or \"crazy\" as being in shock. Frankly, it appeared to me that Ish was in shock, due to his lack of emotion over the loss of basically everyone. It was as if he rationalized it this way, \"wow, everyones gone, oh well, I'm lonely, but that's the breaks\".Finally, gathering enough other stragglers together to form \"the tribe\", they seem to live solely on old can goods from local markers for...22 years!!. I don't know about you, but the last thing I would eat was a can of food that was 22 years old.It appears as if everyone in the \"tribe\" was hit with the stupid stick. Any normal parent would teach their kids the basics of reading and writing, not these folks, it's as if they all just gave up. Plus there is a point in the story where it's highlighted that none of the children even know numbers! WTF? Any normal parent teaches their kids how to count their freaking fingers and toes!Also, the book was written in 1947, yet no one in the book knows a thing about gardening! No one had victory gardens during the war? No one lived on ration cards?It's like all these people dropped out of the sky.There are some many other things wrong with this book, I could go on for pages.Why did I give it 3 stars? 1 for it was a post apocolypic story, the second for the first 1/3 was okay, and lastly, the 3rd star because there were some mildly interesting moments.Beyond that, it's like a group of morons running around in a dark room trying to find the switch.","If you're manic depressive you definitely don't want to read this book. Normally, I love exploring the delicious idea of an end of the world scenario, then having the opportunity to start over. But, I was amazed at how much I hated this book. The characters simply showed little redeeming value and did little but live off the works of the last surviving generation. God, how I slogged through the entire book, hoping that it would get better, that I was going to learn some valuable life lesson or something. It never came. When I finished the book this morning, after reading it in spurts over a period of a month, I really was depressed!The writing is workman like, which is sad, because there's not a poetic line in the whole book, with the exception of the title itself. Oh well.","Having just finished reading Earth Abides, by George R. Stewart, my mind cannot put it down. When I began the book, I expected an apocalypse type novel, and it is that, but it is very much more. I was drawn into the existence of the main character, Isherwood Williams, in such a profound way that I am quite at a loss without him. He is not a formula hero, in that he has human frailties. He is a ponderer and a worrier, much like me. Perhaps that is why I was able to relate to him so easily. He takes nothing at face value, instead he is always fretting, contemplating, and evaluating. His successes are mitigated and his blessings are mixed, as is often the case in real life. There is nothing about the book that is formula, which is a rarity in this genre. On the contrary, it is a truly original work, replete with both adventure and philosophy. The writing style flows beautifully, without an unnecessary phrase or a word out of place. It is a true work of literature, one of the best books I ever read. I am sure that its effect on me will endure, and I will remember this book and its vivid characters for the rest of my life.","I first read this probably 40 years ago and I've re read it over the years, most recently last week.This is a book that stays with you and I was surprised how much I remembered. But I had forgotten just how emotional it was. Stewart's prose seems simple and utilitarian but has real depth of feeling.It's a terrific book.","Very well written and interesting plot. Kept reader wondering what was next. Could not put the book down. I have it on my e-reader and will read again","A friend let me borrow this book to read and I could not put the book down. I do reccommend anyone reading this book, even to this day I still am thinking about the story. It does make you think of how you would be able to work things out when everything you know has disappeared. Great read, I loved this book so much that I had to get a copy for myself!!","I've read a lot of Science Fiction in the past 35 years and found this just ok. I guess I didn't get the underlying message. There was little action, little adventure and basically a bunch of slackers degenerating back into the middle ages. The main character Ish was an odd duck that I could not relate to. I guess I just don't get it.","I felt that this book is very monotonous in how the main character of the book travels around the country looking for people and answers to what happen to the world. he will go in to extreme detail in minor occurrences like seeing something like a body or a hammer. i think this book is very good and has a good plot and deep thesis but i wouldnt recommend this book because it is a slow pace dragging book.","I first read this novel, borrowed from the library, in 1963 and was intrigued by the by the author's detailed descriptions and unique story line. I purchased it in 1987 and re-read it, then loaned the book to a friend and lost track of it - but it was every bit as enjoyable again. Now, I'm 68 and purchased it thru Amazon and re-re-read every word in detail. It is still a tremendously powerful novel and challenges the readers to place themselves in the past and future. What would you do to rebirth a civilization? How could you cope in those first, empty days. What regrets might you have as you witnessed the demise of literature and art? What, then, the consequences as the \"Earth Abides?\"","Isherwood Williams is away in the mountains pursuing his graduate field studies in geology. In our iPhone, instant connectivity world it is hard to imagine the isolation this kind of trip entailed in the 1950's when George Stewart wrote his book. Recovering from a snake bite, Ish stumbles back from the hills to find most of humanity wiped out by disease. We follow Ish through the remainder of his life as he comes to terms with a changing Earth--an Earth on which humanity is a barely noticeable presence.The absence of humanity is not only a stark fact, but is emphasized by the author's writing style. Ish is a clear introvert and we experience much of the Earth's change through his internal monologue. Even when he encounters, interacts with, and teams up with other people, this produces very little dialogue. This style underscores the aloneness of the book's characters. It's not loneliness, in the emotional sense, but a continuing reminder that other people no longer play a significant role in the world.The Earth itself becomes an evolving character in the book. We experience the successive rise and fall in populations of insects, rats, dogs and other species as seasons in the Earth's changing life. The diminishing resources scavenged by human beings from cities and storehouses are important to their survival, but also serve as markers of change as the Earth sheds the thin layers of Man's influence. This change is not progress, nor is it overly mourned as decline. It is thoroughly described and documented as inevitable change. Ish observes it and reacts to it. But neither he nor the other characters influence its path or pace.Read and compare this book with two other classics of post-Apocalyptic fiction:Alas, BabylonandThe Day of the Triffids. These works also follow their characters through crises, scavenging, and attempts to preserve the technology and civilization of the past. They are both more optimistic and more social in narrative style and in the strategies followed by their characters. After reading them, return to Earth Abides and appreciate it for the melancholy and aloneness felt by both its characters and its readers. It is a good story, a moving experience, and a skillful integration of message and writing style.","The premise of this story is the elimination of 99% plus of the human race as a result of a world-wide plague. The plague only effects humans. All other species of life continues to live and in some cases, thrive. Does that sound like something you've read before? I don't think so. In this story the plague kills slow enough to allow the living to bury the dead, thus the streets are not full of dead bodies and the freeways are empty. The remaining few gather themselves into small \"tribes\". The leader of the tribe in our story was a history professor at a major university which is very close to the location of the University of California, Berkley. As a professor he observes the progress, or regress, of his tribe as a student might and creates a tale that would be appropriate for an Anthropology class.Equally interesting to the \"student\" is the impact on the ecology as a result of the loss of mankind. It is truly amazing how much control man has and the impact of his sudden removal. To give even examples would be to deprive the reader of experiencing it themselves. Although not a long book it covers a period of around 70 years or more. It does so by summarizing periods of 10-20 years into short chapters. The author does an excellent job of maintaining continuity in this manner.I would recommend this book hold-heartedly to the serious reader, not because it is a difficult read, for it is actually quite an easy read, but because it is not an action adventure story but a serious look at the possible destiny of mankind. A destiny which I for one would hope we would be better than. The story was written in 1949 but would vary little if written today. An \"end of earth story\" with a very modern premise would be \"One Second After\" written in 2009 which was fascinating to read back-to- back with Earth Abides and which I will be reviewing separately.","Earth Abides is well worth the read. It is difficult for me to suggest precisely why that is so, thus very little actually happens through the course of the book.I suppose there may lay its charm. It's simplicity seems to add plausibility. My impression is that there was much more hype than the title deserved, nevertheless, it certainly deserves some.","With nearly 300 reviews of this book at Amazon, I hardly have to give a summation of the story. I was swept along by the narrative, and I identified greatly with Ish, the protagonist of this post-collapse novel, perhaps because of affinity with his personality. However, I do not give it 5 stars because I happen to differ with the kind of fall-back-into-pre-literate-history climax. Ish should have done a lot more than he did to preserve literacy and a connection with tradition. True, the memory of the Iliad and the Odyssey and the real horrors of the Holocaust is not something we could describe as essential for the survival of mankind, but I could not blithely accept the disappearance of the history and the literature of our human species. There is much that is terrible in our history, but much also that is heroic and even sublime.However, I must say this book is one that will stick in my mind for a long time, and it is rare today to find a book that will have that effect. Most of the books today that are lauded as \"good reads\" are just entertainment for a few hours but are quickly forgotten. Not so with \"Earth Abides.\" You may argue with certain aspects of the novel, and/or certain philosophical conclusions of its author, but once you've read it, I doubt that you will be able to dismiss it or pretend you didn't spend a few hours with the survivors of \"the plague.\"","I read this book when I was a freshman in High School, after it was assigned by a cool female sci-fi teacher. At the time I didn't care much for reading, but I read Earth Abides cover to cover. The book changed me, turned me into a reader and then a writer. That was over 30 years ago, and still I so often think about various sections in the book. Now, here I am, ready to purchase another copy and reread the incredible novel, just to see again how it still so deeply affects me. Earth Abides is powerful, memorable, and deeply moving--it is everything a book should be.","This is, if not the best, at least one of the best books of its type ever.The story is told with a grittiness that makes every page crackle with life. I read it first in high school, and have read it several times since. I was so happy to see that Del Rey Books re-issued this timeless classic in 2006.A whole new generation of readers will be able to enjoy Stewart's amazing novel.A. C. Ellisauthor ofIn Pursuit of the Enemy,Worldmaker,Soldier of 'Tween, andSHADOW RUN: Book I of The Ancients' War","Isherwood (Ish) Williams has recently finished grad school and is camping in California when he is bitten by a rattlesnake. At first the injury seems minor, but he rapidly descends into a delirium-filled illness. After several weeks, he gradually regains his senses wondering how a simple snake bite could have affected him so strongly. He heads back into town and find everyone gone. It seems a bit odd at first, but Ish thinks to himself that perhaps it is Sunday (he has lost track of time). He eventually comes across a newspaper that describes a devastating plague that has swept across the country, and he becomes aware of the full magnitude of the catastrophe that has struck the United States and the World. What follows is one of the best stories about post-apocalyptic survival ever written.This book is divided into three sections, the first two taking the lion's share of the space. In the first section, Ish discovers the plague, realizes he is one of the few survivors, and decides to take a cross country trek to see who and what else has survived. In the second section, set 22 years after the first, Ish has settled down with a small number of other survivors who start families in the SF bay area. We see the first and second generations of children born after the plague who have no concept or awareness of what we would term modern civilization (and all that implies for better or worse). We follow the slow decay of the remnants of the earlier civilization, and the construction of a new way of life. In the final section, Ish is an old, dying man reflecting on his life and all that has happened. In between each of the three major sections are brief vignettes that cover the major events of the the chapters that are set decades apart.This is largely an introspective tale about Ish's thoughts and emotions as his world crumbles around him and is rebuilt and transformed. If you're looking for a story about a lone survivor battling mutant zombies or some such thing, you'll be disappointed. In the first section, Ish is just trying to make sense of what happened and figure out what he wants to do. In the second, he tries to teach the children of his small community something about what life was like prior to the plague and maintain some continuity with the past. One of the children ask him what an American was, and Ish finds that it isn't so easy to explain. In the third section, Ish is the only pre-plague survivor left in the community, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren now unrecognizeably changed to cope with their new environment. There is some action in this story, but not much. One of the best aspects of this story (and this genre in general) is that the author explores what would happen to all the trappings of modern life if the machinery just stopped. In some ways, the changes would be immediate and profound, in others, changes would take more time.The bottom line is that this sad, introspective tale woven around some Biblical themes is an all-time classic in my view and definitely recommended. There are some outdated (or just plain different) ideas and ways of thinking in this book (Stewart wrote it in the late '40s I believe), but don't let that stop you from reading the book. Stewart conveys a message and asks some questions that are relevant to people and human nature whatever epoch they happened to be born in. People will be reading this 100 years from now. I read this book (along with Alas Babylon) many years ago as a teen and decided to re-read the pair again. There are many powerful images from this book that I still remember now decades later. My view now has changed a bit as I can understand Stewart's central message better, but no matter what you think about this genre in general, this is a timeless story that you'll never forget.","What happens if mankind is almost wiped out yet the infrastruce remains relatively untarnished? What skills are most valuable in such a situation? Once Maslow's hierarchy of needs has been fulfilled, what comes next? Can a society regress but improve simultaneously? Can extreme preventive measures be moral? I love a Mad Max post apocalyptic tale, but the seemingly pedestrian situations and questions posed in this book continue to haunt me long after reading it.","I read this book 35 years ago while in junior high. It captivated me. I pondered (as only an adolescent can) what I would do if I were Ish. What would I do if I came home from a trip into the mountains and found the world dead of a plague. How would I respond? What would I do? How would I survive? How would I cope?I read it again when I was in high school and the same musing returned. I found it in my box of \"things\" several years later when I was 23, after I was married. I sat down that afternoon and read the entire book. Again it affected me - but in a different, more mature way. After I had children, I gave it to my daughter to read when she was 16. She found it to be a very fascinating read on the sociological impact on man of a devastating plague which leaves only a few scattered survivors. I have lent my copy to several people over the years and everyone who reads it finds the book to create emotion and ponder what they would do in such a situation.The mystery and appeal of the book lies in the writer placing the reader into the conscience of the main character named Isherwood \"Ish\" Williams. There are several undertones within the book - one of which is the role of the reluctant leader, the second the \"sacramental\" image of the hammer. It also shows the tendancy of man to desire religion.This book review, I hope, motivates someone to read a book that they may not have read by simply looking at the cover. You will be mesmerized by this well written classic... I guarantee! (I have been mesmerized by it 5 times now in the past 35 years)","I remember first reading this book in High School almost 30 years ago - the story of Isherwood Williams and his struggle to survive in a world where 99% of the people have perished in a biological holocaust. Well written, it keeps the readers attention pretty much throughout. While the book suffers a tiny bit of \"out-dated-ness\" (no mention of cell phones, or the internet) it is still an excellent and well-thought-out read about the demise of our techno-centric civilization. I especially like the way the book takes you through the passing of years, and eventually decades - to a future that makes you step back and say \"Yeah, I can see that happening...\" Enjoy the book, it's a great read!","I just read this book again. I don't know how many times I've read it and I enjoy it each time. I bought it at a used book store in Las Vegas years ago and I'm so glad that I did.","Disappointed. I'm slowly learning to pay more attention to Amazon's negative reviews to get a more calculating grasp of a book's contents.Apparently civilization goes out with a very orderly, civilized whimper. As the police and military forces crumble along with everything else in a matter of months, civil order magically maintains itself with little looting. Perhaps a feasible conclusion to reach, but much more fleshing out was needed to explain the psychosocial motives for such an end to 99%+ of the human race.The author makes no effort to create a story arc--this is a poorly written fictional ethnography, not a novel. The plot mirrors the personality of the plodding, coldly methodical protagonist.Most of the other characters are two-dimensional and cliched, following personality and behavioral stereotypes you'd expect from a 1949 bog standard. While this is feasible /to a certain extent/, the author proceeds with no introspection about it, as though the Leave It to Beaver cast was instantaneously transplanted into a world without people.On the positive side, the author makes distinct efforts to present the ecological side effects of humanity's disappearance. But this saving grace grows old, too, as the novel plods through the decades following the apocalypse.Now that I think of it, I believe that's exactly what the author intended, realism be damned. He imagined a band of primitive hunter-gatherers in the withered skeleton of an American city, and worked backward to see how it would fall into place. Too bad verisimilitude was the first casualty, normally a hallmark of the genre.","I wanted to like this book. I really did...but after getting into it, I had to stop and put it down. The plot is just too unrealistic, and the main character Ish is robotic and boring. As some other reviewers have stated, Ish shows almost no emotion after literally 99.9% of the human race is wiped out. He reacts clinically, robotically, and without apparent emotion after he returns to his parent's house to find everyone dead or missing. \"Hmm, that's interesting. Everyone's dead.\" He takes a freakin' road trip to \"look for survivors\" --yet leaves them all behind--deeming them unsatisfactory companions. This is justified by stating that Ish enjoys solitude. Umm...sorry, I enjoy the outdoors and solitude as much as anyone, and no normal person would react in such a way. Ever hear of the \"mad trapper\" or \"cabin fever\"? That's what really happens to people denied human interaction. Madness. Depression. Paranoia. Suicide. A longing to see another human face.The author, an English professor, must have fancied himself in the role of Ish--a purely logical, Spock-like Vulcan wandering around an empty world. This was a mistake--don't make the protagonist (and hero) of the novel to be a clone of yourself--the savior of the new society, a professor. Gag. I just couldn't buy into that. I also didn't like the author's prose--dry and dull. I can see why some people liked the book, but it just didn't do it for me. I'm thinking things would be a lot more like \"Lord of the Flies\" than \"Earth Abides\"!","The reviews I noticed are fine reports on this fine book. However, one point may have been overlooked. This is the first book I'd read (my first read was back in the 1960s) that used the term ecology. Mentioning this point will deepen the other reviews.","Stewart's books was perfectly creepy and emotional. I identified with the protagonist greatly, and do not feel he was too passive or overly-cerebral. Truth be known, in the few crises I have known, I've often reacted much like him. Okay, I'm a little more attached to things than he is, but I feel this is a plot contrivance to allow the story to go forward.Having read and re-read &quot;The Stand&quot; quite a few times now, I was struck by Stewart's decision (1) not to gather large groups together, (2) not to restart civilization (e.g., electricity, running water, et al), and (3) to cover such a large span of time. &quot;The Stand&quot; covers perhaps up to a year after a plague wipes out 99% of the human race. This book covers over a half-dozen decades. I feel that all three of these decisions demonstrated a far more likely result than King's use of dreams as a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; to gather persons into two camps for the &quot;final conflict&quot; between good and evil.Born in 1976, I am only now becoming aware of these post-apocalyptic classics. I have now finished &quot;On the Beach&quot; by Nevil Shute, &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot; by Pat Frank, and of course this one. The first two dealt with the all-too-real Nuclear Nightmare that even I experienced (though all those younger than me can't even remember there being a USSR). Shute's book was &quot;a stern warning of things to come&quot; and &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot; was more of a man vs. nature story.But this one, it dealt with the nightmare that first captivated me in &quot;The Stand&quot; - a world decimated by plague, leaving the infrastructure intact. While Stewart did not pick up the thread the way I wish he had - that is, some form of civilization being preserved, rather than yet another &quot;Time Machine&quot;-style primitive culture that barely recalls our culture. However, Stewart does spend a great amount of time talking about the decay of this world, and that fascinated me. Storm drains clogging, water seeping into houses and rotting the carpets, termites collapsing houses over the work of decades, dust settling into the corners of the Golden Gate Bridge and grass growing there, and the work of rain and frost on the Northeast roads. All of this riveted me.My biggest complaints are mostly minor, such as (1) how could running water go on for 20 years? (2) why did it take so long for the electricity to run out, and the biggest one (3) why were there no signs of panic (e.g., looting, riots, massive traffic jams as swarms of panicked people ran about in civilization's death throes, et al).My biggest gripe, however, is spiritual. Nobody in this book, even former churchgoers and clergy, feel any need to reach out to God. Admittedly, I'm biased, being a Christian, Biblical scholar, and future University prof. But I am a rational being, and I feel a rational argument can be made for the spiritual side of man, a characteristic that even the protagonist recognizes, even if he can't properly articulate, let alone address, this &quot;God-shaped hole&quot; in each of us.Now, I realize that science fiction, even more than other genres, allow us to paint on a blanked canvas (the devastated world) our worldviews on such things as man's innate goodness or evil, the necessity or redundancy of God (e.g., church, Scriptures, etc.), the expression of our social nature, the necessity (or redundancy) of modern technologically-dependent society, and so forth. I understand that we're not all going to agree; I don't feel it's my job to insist on homogeneity amongs everyone. However, if I wrote a book along these lines, I would make sure to include atheists, skeptics and agnostics, along with members of other religions (at varying degrees of dedication) along with those persons I feel &quot;make sense&quot; from my perspective. While by no means do I feel &quot;all religions lead to God&quot; or that &quot;you just need to be sincere,&quot; I do agree that any description of a post-apocalyptic (or any other) reality, in order to be fair to the multiplicity of human thought and experience, must recognize that &quot;it takes all kinds.&quot;That said, I did find myself chilled by the spiritual apathy evidenced, among other things, by the community's perception of &quot;Evie,&quot; the mentally-challenged pariah. &quot;We don't want no idiot children ruining the gene pool&quot; the protagonist declared in some fashion on numerous occasions. While I may see, in a survival-based world, the necessity of taking precautions, I did feel that the cold and unfeeling attitude (&quot;should we have even let her live?&quot; Ish asks himself repeatedly) was frightfully inhumane. There is no &quot;all are created equal&quot; here, no &quot;all are God's children&quot; here. While I understand expediency, I do not feel it must be carried out heartlessly.However, apart from this one real gripe, I truly do recommend this book to anyone interested by such things, like me. After borrowing this book from a library (copies are hard to find!) I've decided to buy it. I suppose that's the best recommendation I can give...","This novel, Earth Abides, written by George Stewart takes place in San Francisco during present times. A worldwide virus overtakes and wipes out the entire human race, leaving only a select few alive. Of these few is a man named Isherwood who goes in search of other survivors to band with. He meets a woman named Emma and a few other people who start a new civilization. It is not easy, however, and they are constantly hitting head-to-head with nature, fighting for survival. As in any other society, there are some people who challenge the law that was laid down in the beginning. As a result, certain members of the tribe are divided. Unity is essential for survival...will they make it? Only time will tell.The author of this book was probably raised in a Christian environment because there are many Biblical references in this book. For example, one of the characters in this novel is named Ezra, as is an Old Testament prophet. Stewart&#65533;s Christian roots are evident in the way he unravels his novel and the double meanings behind some of his story. For example, a child named Joey is born to Ish and Em that is far more intelligent than any other of the many children. Ish finds hope in this young boy because he knows that Joey&#65533;s outstanding brightness will one day be of great use to future peoples, just as God had much pride in His son Jesus.This novel is a wake up call to the reader in that it brings attention to how weak and vulnerable humans really are. What if mankind were to die today? Would people have their affairs set in order?This novel is a fictional story but has real-life applications. For example, there are real people facing real starvation and shelter needs. Stewart portrays very well the thoughts and feelings of each of the characters, which enhances the story line.Earth Abides is an excellent novel. It is extremely well written and it flows nicely. Anybody thirteen years of age and older should definitely read this book because it captures the reader&#65533;s attention and has the ability to transport the reader to a world no longer inhabited by humans. Younger children may not be able to understand some of the vocabulary in this book and may be easily confused due to the complex plot line. However, I give this book a two thumbs up.","Despite the quality of Stewart's writing, which is elegaic at its best and readable at its worst, this is a very creaky and dated work. Certainly, you have to make some allowances for the culture and time in which books are written, but like John Wyndham, Stewart seems handicapped by an assumption of the rightness of bourgeois values, especially when it comes to women. The book does address this, and in some ways is all about the struggle to maintain these values in a world where they are making less and less sense. But, you get the feeling that, in terms of sociopolitical change (as opposed to the obvious physical change - the old infrastructure has been destroyed), it's a case of 'apocalypse? what apocalypse?'. Stewart's characters are like Hollywood western stereotypes - the men are either upright patriachs or shifty loners; the women are wives and daughters who appear strong but are really just there for breeding and cooking. There are works which do tackle the obvious questions of the use of social roles in a society totally different from that which created them, most notably the vastly under-rated New Zealand film, The Quiet Earth (if I've remembered the name right). Read Stewart by all means: it isn't a bad book, but it isn't the classic it's built up to be.","Many readers will find this book very frustrating. It describes in one lifetime the dissolution of civilization on the planet. We know that if even a handful of humans survive a major disaster they will probably cling to the fundamentals of civilization a bit longer than one generation.In particular we will cling to reading and writing. These are the foundation skills of civilization. Writing systems are one of the foundation stones upon which civilization is built. The notion that we would allow a generation of kids to grow up without teaching them to read and write is tantamount to criminality.But if you stop seeing this as a single generation book, and think of it more as though Ish, the lead character, is able to see through many generations, then the story becomes much more believable.With all the talk of avian flu and the potential for a super virus this book seems eerily relevant to society today. Much more so than when it was written. Throughout the book we have metaphors for the natural balance of nature as we see one rampant population of animals after another expand and then die back to sustainable levels. And the question must always be, is the human population on earth sustainable?The answer is clearly no! And if we don't do something about our population levels and our resource consumption, this book may well represent our future on this planet.","First, I would like to say that just about everything to say about this book has been said. Most reviews are accurate, there are some great characters in this book and Ish does have some intense experiences, however I have mixed emotions as far as this book goes.Ish's long time companion Em, is a reliable and loving character, Ish & The Tribe look to her for strength and wisdom, time & again she delivers. She is loved and respected by all, but when she passes away, her death is all but over in one paragraph. It is similar with old George, he is a lovely character, like a grandfather or old uncle, I would have liked to see a few pages devoted to his passing. This is not the case. This leaves me a little flat.Some parts of the story are deeply moving ie when the boys return after their adventure and a stranger is with them. He is the carrier of desease and when he will not leave when asked, a solution must be found. The elders have to make a decision that chills them all to the bone. Great reading, but when Em & old George die it is almost glossed over.I enjoyed this book, but I would not recommend it as a light read. If you are into PA stories and you like deep intense stories, then I guess this is for you.If you are after action and adventure, stay away.","I know this book was first published in 1949. I can overlook the unlimited shelf life of canned goods and gasoline. It's the main character \"Ish\" who ruined this story for me. He is your typical elitist douche bag who confuses a large vocabulary with intelligence. With a university library at his fingertips, this mental giant could not learn the basics of survival (agriculture, animal husbandry, auto repair, food storage etc...)in his lifetime! I muscled through the book hoping it would redeem it's self in the end, but I ended up losing eight bucks on my kindle and three days of my life. If you want to read this \"classic\" be prepared for constant complaining about the stupidity of others while doing absolutely nothing to better the situation. Hubris abounds with his superior attitude and god complex. He's also a bit of a racist (Not for his use of the word \"Negro\", but for his temptation to use the black people he encounters to make himself king!) and a sexist.","One of the best realistic future novels I have read, I enjoyed reading it many years ago,and reading it again was just as enjoyable, couldn't put it down, its not the usual science fiction story, but a realistic account of how ordinary people would react in these conditions, I highly recommend it I.M.J.","read it in Jr. High and it is still just as great today at age 67.","I found this post-apocalyptic story well written, but a bit slower paced that other titles of this genre. I attribute the pace to the era in which this book was written. I would consider this a must read, especially if you have read On the Beach and Alas, Babylon.","I have read this book several times. Once you start,...it's hard to put down.","I liked this book, though the introduction claiming i would remember the book forever and so on. Well, intro's like that turn me off a bit. It certainly is intriguing in a rather simple way. The later seems to add a certain plausibility which makes it much more believable. It's always a trade off, exchange a little drama for a little more realism. In all, a nice balance. I must say that the book is well written.","An excellent read -- an excellent re-read. The book is both entertaining and thought-provoking. If you like science-fiction with an apocalyptic theme, you will like this work.","great book about the aftermath of humanity and how the world deals with our absence, follows a young grad student from the extinction of man to the establishment of a new human society.","I think this is a post-apocolypse classic because of the unique perspectives the author presents. Rather than focusing on theh flu epidemic that wipes out the majority of humanity, the author focuses on one man's experience of it through the rest of his life as he joins with other survivors and the beginnings of their \"tribe\" come together. There is really less \"action\" than one might expect as the author tells the story of \"post-flu\" life and the subtle, slow changes that emerge as human beings begin living more in balance with the planet. A very beautiful story really as humanity comes to know iteself apart from \"civilization.\"","I did a comparison of this book with Childhood's End for A-level English. Two more different sci-fi books would be difficult to come by and that was the point. Earth Abides is a quiet story, full of the thoughts of Ish and the story of the community he helps found after a plague wipes out most of humanity. There is no scientific details as none of the characters have the expertise to know them. It a human story - not a science one. Some details are given of how the impact of humanity is gradually wiped from the planet and how the survivors - well survive.Don't expect explosive action or tales of daring-do. What you will get is an insightful book - even after all this time - what you will want to read a second and third time. Definitely one to keep - close!!","This was by far the best book I've read in a long time, in terms of pure quality. Coming off a run of John Grisham books before it (and after, I'm reading another Grisham story now), it was amazing how different the quality of the story was, and how much more thought-provoking. Grisham tries for some philosophical stuff in his books, but didn't come close to what you find here.The story itself was Ok...not fascinating alone, though surprising. A few things I certainly didn't expect to happen transpired. But what made it worthwhile was the \"what if\" factor. Imagine living through the apocalypse. Ponder the questions it raises:- What would I do? Seek other people? Focus on survival? How to judge others, and how easily to settle in with them?- How strong are the author's, and lead character's biases in the story? We get their perspective so strongly it's not clear sometimes what the reality is?- What about Charlie? There's no way I'd make the same vote as the characters in the book - so I think. But if I had lived as they had for 22 years, would that change my opinion? How can I know? (answer to that last question - I can't).Is there some deeper answer in the book about what the meaning of life really is? If we strip everything we have today away, we go back to a more primal state where the search for food, water, shelter and safety are paramount in our minds. So how much of what we experience now is a product of civilization and society, rather than our true nature? The memorable line which was something like (I don't have the book for a direct quote) \"I'm happy. Things are as they are and I'm a part of them.\" says a lot doesn't it? Goes back to Buddhist philosophy really - focus on the present. When there's no guarantee of the next meal, when there's no shelter because a fire can burn it all down, when wild animals lurk, how much time do we have to ponder, to worry, to debate? And does that make us happier - meeting our primal drive to just...be?I'd highly recommend this book, my \"top\" recommendation whatever that means. It covers ecology, philosophy, sociaology and so much more...I waited almost two years to read it. It's a shame I waited that long.","I have read this book at least 6 times over the years. It ranks in my judgement with Jules Verne's, &quot;Mysterious Island&quot;, and Johann Wyss', &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot;. I have also read these books at least 7 times as well. I feel the three books could be invaluable in a survival library. They all teach survival in different circumstances!","Typical? maybe today, an age where every scenerio of doom has been played over and over again like some bad rock song. Fear not! This book is good. It was fresh once. . .now it reminds us of what fiction use to be written like. Like a good Doyle or Burroughs. I liked it.","I first read &quot;Earth Abides&quot; in a borrowed copy in the early 1950s ... and many, many times since. My problem then was losing the title --- but never the story. Finally, in the late 1960s, my 15-plus year project of telling the story over and over in search of a title (and a copy of my own) paid off. That copy, well thumbed is well kept. It's on my top shelf, handy for a quick read every couple of years or so. I just finished it again today ... not the first time I've made it through in one sitting and then regretting hitting the last page. In part, the book helped lead me to the East Bay (Clayton) in the 1980s and my time there also makes the story real and special. Now it's back to the top shelf ... the only proper place for this really &quot;great read!!!&quot;","I read this magnificant book over 30 years ago and I still canNOT get it out of my head. I was born and raised in the Berkeley/El Cerrito area. While reading EARTH ABIDES, I could visualize, with extreme clarity, all the areas mentioned in the book. I actually put myself in the possibility of REALITY while: the electricity ran out; the overgrowth of flora/fauna; the animals going wild; seeking tires at dealerships on Shattuck Avenue; seeking other humans in Berkeley, the UC Berkeley library; the creating of another human generation; no racial hostility; etc. I just ordered two more of EARTH ABIDES to give to friends who grew up in the Bay Area. They will be astounded and will love it. Although written in 1949, and what is going on in the world today, was this another prophecy?","Like most of the other reviewers, I too have read this book many times. There is some-thing about this story that stays with you. I can't say I have had the same feeling about any other book.","I read this book over 15 years ago and to this day I still cannot get the story out of my head. I wish I can find another copy so I can read it again and even pass it onto my family and friends.What made this story so remarkable was how logical the story line flowed. Everytime I ponder that faitfull question of being one of few left on Earth, I try to take into account the possibilities of how Earth will &quot;reset&quot; iteslf around me. Would I want to stay in Florida, move back to California, or go on a quest to some distant land and build my own civilization?Anyway, I highly recommend this book for those who have ever pondered the question of being the &quot;last person on Earth.&quot;","I first read this book at 11 yrs old (1965), and have read it 4 more times throughout my life. I continually think about this book and always recomend it to friends. I grew up in the desert with not much to do BUT read,when I finished it the first time I had to start over right away, Ive NEVER done that with ANY other book!!! have fun reading it!!!!!","It was a must read for my Physical Geography class. We were supposed mto read it from a Geographers point of view. My teacher prefaced it with &quot;this book was written in the 40's and it is sexist - so ladies please don't let it irritate you.&quot; I however, didn't find it sexist I found M, the lead female charachter, a strong and wonderful woman. I also liked the fact that there was interracial marriage and poligamy. Forward thinking ideas in the 1940's. All in all it is a good weekend read. But, it is way corny! Especially all the text in italics.","As a long time reader of sci-fi, this novel-EARTH ABIDESs is the single best story ever written. I have read it more than 30 times. From the time Ish begins his relent measures to understand what has happen, the start of rebuiding a social group, the developement years, and the final bridge location with Ishs' final thought of &quot;Men may come and go but Earth abides&quot; stirs thoughts of --how would you perform in a like setting.","What more can be said? Get it and read it!!! I first read it about 35 years ago and it has stayed with me. The book impressed me then and it impresses me now.","I started becoming interested in the post-apocalyptic genre after watching a few episodes of the TV show \"Jericho\" (which is quite interesting in Season 1). While searching this category on Amazon, \"Earth Abides\" popped up a few times along with several other titles. I picked up a copy and read it last weekend. The plot and the characters are mildly interesting and I guess I should cut it some slack having been printed back in 1949. However, I have to say as you get more than halfway through the book, the story line just seems to drag on and on and is generally pretty boring. As I neared the end I found myself skimming from page to page and just praying it would finally end. The copy I bought was used and I threw it away when I was done to prevent someone else from wasting their time with it.By comparison, I also bought a used copy of \"Alas Babylon\" (also printed in the 1950s time frame) and I can safely say it is a far more interesting read after only being about 100 pages into it.","I was very disappointed in this book. It was slow, boring, filled with uninteresting characters, and the writing was extremely stilted. And I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to accept that automobiles would still operate after sitting around with gasoline in their tanks for thirty years. I skimmed through most of the book hoping something interesting would happen, but I was utterly dissappointed. There are better books in this genre, don't waste your time with this one.","As I write this, negative reviews of this novel (one or two star reviews) are few and far between. However, I am compelled to join the minority. I could not, in good conscience, recommend this book to anyone. Maybe one needs to be an aficionado of the \"End-of-the-World\" genre to appreciate this book, but I found it to be contrived and unrealistic. The idea that most of the population would die off due to disease, but that the book's protagonist would choose to tool around the countryside calmly musing on a variety of generally immaterial and irrelevant matters seems absurd. Also, for quite awhile, he manages to encounter ONLY unsavory or potentially dangerous fellow survivors. The entire un-dramatic tone of the book seems way out of proportion with the incredible tragedy that has befallen the earth.I very, very rarely leave a book unfinished, and will usually force myself to complete any book I start. But, as they say, \"too many books, too little time\". I could not see giving up valuable reading time on a book that offers so very little to the reader, so eventually put this book aside. For me this is the most gravely negative review I could give a book.","This novel is possibly the worst piece of drivel I've ever tried to force myself through, and I didn't make it. I quit, and honestly I almost never do that. Ish is maybe the most detestable figure I have ever had the displeasure of meeting on the page. He's a passive aggressive psycho, a terrible father and leader, and the last man you would want to rebuild civilization. In this type of scenario, anyone with any intelligence that came into contact with him would disengage quickly. I simply might have shot him for being a drain of precious resources. If the whole point centers on the fact that most or any man would fail in this situation, I would have preferred that Stewart kill off Ish in a 20 page short story.","I see many people loved this book, but having just finished it, I just don't get the appeal it has for so many people. I found it incredibly boring and tedious. I do not exaggerate when I say I spent an afternoon struggling with it, nodding off to sleep every two or three paragraphs. To his credit, Stewart raises a number of issues about science and human nature, but it is done in the context of an uneventful story. The first book in years that almost made me abandon it halfway through, but I fought it out to the end. I remained disappointed.","Wow I can't remember the last time I started to hope something bad would happen to the main character in a story. Worst main character in a book ever. Annoying, Lazy, sexist, racist, boring and anti-religionist. Maybe it was the slow story line. Maybe it was the fact that NOTHING happens to the characters after the first 100 pages. I don't know. But I hate this book. I felt like yelling \"Get up and do something!!\" The power goes out and he sits. The streets start to flood and he sits. The water stops running and he sits!! Then he starts to think of himself as a god!! haha. The best part of the book is the end. Why? (spoiler)he dies and you don't have to read anymore.Sorry to ramble but my mind is cloudy now from finishing that \"book\".Do not buy this book. Get it from the library read the first 75 pages then take it back.","This book is dull, slow, and predictable. I read most of it hoping that it would pick up but it never did. I usually like these type of disaster books too. Lucipher's Hammer is ten times better than this one. I really have no idea how this book could have 5 stars.","Having skimmed the other reviews, it seems that one had to read this book as a young person and use those glowing memories to enjoy it. Since I approached the book fresh, the flaws are glaring.The main character, Ish, is pretty dull. There isn't much dialogue in the book, so most speech is communicated through his hearing others and describing what they meant. Since he's not particularly insightful, reading is slow and the pages creep by.Civilization seems completely lost despite the fact that books, machines, etc. remain intact. Ish rules The Tribe, who are a step or so above a Neanderthal group. They even walk from place to place like hunter-gathers. How about using the million and one bicycles laying around if you can't figure out how to get gas for a car?The book is not poorly written, just improbable and boring.","The concept of how civilization slowly succumbs to the forces of nature was an interesting concept. That part of the novel was very good. Ish the main character of the book was the leader of a small community of survivors. He sees himself as the most intelligent of them all and for some reason wants to keep it that way. He locks up a library and only he has access to it. Once children are born and old enough to go to school he cancels it, no children of the new world learn to read. Nobody seems to want to become self-sufficient but relies on the products of a past civilization. A stranger comes to join them and Ish murders him out of jealously that his role might be challenged. From then on he carries the hammer he killed the stranger with, with him all the way to his death. No interest was ever sparked by anyone to learn to read, farm, make things or anything else. Everyone lives off of canned goods for 20+ years. I won't say anything more in case the reader of this has not read the book and would like too. Ultimately I was disappointed but would recommend it anyway.","Earth Abides is a book about no matter what happens to the race of people, Earth will always abide. A Man named Isherwood Williams somehow survives this fatal virus that is going around killing the whole human population. Ish then spends almost the rest of his life driving across the country searching for survivors. When he finally meets a group of survivors he \"marries\" one of them and has about twenty children with her.Ish does find a few survivors, however it was definitely not enough to keep me interested in finishing the book. I thought this book was long, drawn out and sometimes too boring. If George R. Stewart, the author, would have spiced it up a bit with more science fiction things happening. For instance if more abnormal things happening to the humans than just death like it was a flesh eating virus and then something else happened with the virus. The genre of the book is Science Fiction. The plot this author had in mind was a god idea however if it was only about one hundred pages shorter and the ending with the twenty children was cut then it would have been easier to keepinterest.So all in all the book had very few parts that could have beenedited out and still would have made sense. The idea of the book and the plot of the book was good. I like the little reality the book had in it. Again if there were more science fiction, and less pages, it also might have been better. So that is why I gave the book a measly two stars out of five. I think this a reasonable amount and I commend the author on his work. I would recomend this book to someone who loves to read and is interested in books about little science fiction and little reality.","If you like this kind of book, you must read this one. Written in the late 40's, this is the grandaddy of all apocalypse stories.","Earth AbidesEarth Abides, a novel by George Stewart taps into people's fascination of being the last one on earth. In this book the main character Isherwood Williams (Ish) survives arattlesnake bite in the mountains and returns to find almost every single person dead from a cataclysmic plague. Ish survives the plague and explores. While exploring he finds other survivors and they try re-founding American civilization. They live above San Francisco Bay in the Berkeley hills.Although this novel is well written and very real, I did not like it. The author put a lot of thought into it but it just didn't interest me. This book wasn't all boring, it hadsome good things about it. One of which is how it was frightening because this could really happen to mankind if we don't watch out, but there was more dull things than scarythings in this book. I also thought that it was weird that Ish and the rest of the community were so interested in caring on civilization instead of thinking about their own survival.The only reason that I finished this book is that it is based in the bay area and that is where I live so I can relate to the scenery that the author describes. If you didn't live in the bayarea then this would be one more thing that wouldn't interest you.I would not recommend this novel. It is interesting at the beginning but then gets boring. It is too long and the author seems to drag on subjects to the point where I don'tcare anymore. If you were going to read this book I would say it is best suited to high school or college students. If a young person read it I don't think that they would understand it.","This book Earth Abides by George R. Stewart is about a man who passes by a massive disease which basically obliterates the US. This man, Ish, has to come to realization of this huge crisis and try to find survivors. It goes on and on about his thoughts and shows the struggles that he faces it the horrid situation. He goes around america finding survivors and ends up making a huge family in the end.This book was basically boring and depressing because it was just lagging on and on about how he thought of everything. It made you want to fall fast asleep at times too. (something that i obviously did) I am one of those kind of people who likes adventure and this book had none. It just was one of those books that wanted to show how horrible things could happen to us if we don't watch it. It sort of chilling and makes you depressed to think that it could happen. George R. Stewart was probably giving a good message out when he wrote this, but in the sense that people want to live there lives without this catastrophe, it is not very good.I would not recommend this book to kids under the age of 12 because it probably is too advanced for them. Also because kids do not have to worry about this sort of horror happening to them at that young of an age. People who need to sleep at night and want to fall asleep fast, please read. If you like adventure and mystery in a book, please go find a different book.","The book earth abides was about a man who passes up a massive disease that spreads throughout america and basically obliterates it. It has this man, Ish, come to realization of this huge crisis and shows his struggles to find civilization.

As the book goes on it shows the will of human survival and the horror of this situation.I thought that the book was a little too slow. I am sort of a adventure book reader and this book had slim to none. It just went on about Ish's thoughts for like 2 chapters at a time. It made you want to just fall asleep everytime u read it. It was dull most of the times, but it does make you think how bad it would be if that sort of thing happened to the country.I would say that this book would not be very appealing to young kids because it is too advanced for them. I would recommend this to people who need to fall asleep at night definately. Also if you like to hear about the deep thoughts of a person who has no one to talk to for weeks, read this book. If you are an adventure or mystery reader who likes action, do not get this book.","\"Men come and go, but Earth abides.\" These chilling words written by George R. Stewart leave the reader feeling bare and stripped in the popular science fiction novel \"Earth Abides.\" A novel I read and still can't decide what to think about it.This book is filled with puzzling situations, frustrating moments, and mind-bending problems that make the reader ask, \"What would I do?\"Plague has struck the world, and people are dying by the millions. A lone survivor, Ish, on a mountain camping trip manages to fend off the disease with snakebite. He returns to a frozen, empty world, and is determined to find civilization and life in the seemingly dead planet. Most of the people he meets are in shock, having seen the horrors of death and destruction of the planet and are stupefied, unable to talk sense or even take care of themselves. One man Ish comes across is drinking himself to death; only eating things out of cans and seems only half-alive. Through his journey's, Ish has a growing urge to settle down and establish life as he knew it again. He alone must save the human race.I thought this book was very interesting, at first. The beginning was intriguing and exciting to think about. But after a while, the idea became old, and boring. Ish just begins to muse over the world's pathetic state, talk about how he's the only intelligent person left, and even starts to become a little snobbish to say the least. The way women were used merely as wombs, though logical in such a situation, got a little annoying also. The detail and wordiness left my mind to wonder away from the book, and I even recall something as simple as a storm drain overflowing taking up two pages to talk about. Ish's endless attempts to get people to think and work for themselves also become a bit momentous and bothersome. It really makes you want to slowly go crazy along with Ish, as you read his \"bible\", page after page of musing nonsense. I really wanted to tell him to start enjoying life and give up on trying to control everyone's thoughts and actions, just to let things go. But there were moments of truly beautiful writing and raw honesty that drew me out of the droning slump. When Ish finds something to believe in, though, it was really disappointing to have it destroyed so suddenly. Ish becomes so obsessed with saving the world, he becomes very self righteous and stuck up, he transforms from a hero into someone you are sick of and increasingly angry with. The author looses his grip on the story and turns the book into a guide of what to do if you find out the world's population has come to an end, and it's up to you, being the only truly sane and intelligent person, to save the planet. The character's personalities fade, and you are left with a bunch of names and occasional dialogue.The novel begins with a bang, and ends with a whimper, which makes the reader want to whine as well. It was not something I'd want loved ones to read, but I would highly recommend the first two hundred pages, and then move on to something else. The people who say they truly enjoyed this book through and through, in my opinion, are liars. It's a thoughtfully written piece, and deserves the recognition it receives, but if you are looking to be entertained, find another book, \"Earth Abides\" will leave you out in the cold.","It's amazing how despite half a century of technological advancement the Earth Abides is largely just an expanded version of the Red Plague by John Steinbeck.","Good story, but a bit unbelievable. Characters reasonably developed.Mostly clean, no gratuitous sex or violence, but some crude language.","Excellent book.. Highly recommend it. Very well written. Takes you through generations. a great read!","Dated but thought provoking aptly describes this novel. Set in post-nuclear holocaust America. excellent.","earth abides may have been original when it came out a zillion years ago but it's dated now and can't compete with stories being written today. the hero is some boob who survives the plague only by stepping on a rattlesnake? wow. and then he can't even teach children to read. why not? there are some good moments here and there, but in the end this book is a yawn.","When I write &quot;one of the most memorable books I've read,&quot; that's saying something, because I've kept up a pace of reading at least four books a week since before entering Kindergarten and am now 67. I borrowed EARTH ABIDES from the library a year after it came out, in 1950, when I was a 14-year-old high school sophomore, reading everything and anything labeled &quot;science fiction.&quot; I didn't own the book until fairly recently, but it stayed vividly in my memory. I could call up characters like fussy Maureen, stolid George, loyal Em and the tragic genius child, Joey. I remembered the fascinating journey across America, the vague frustration I felt (even so young) over Ish's passive character and the generally negative slide of the tribe from scavenging off civilization into what appeared almost to be an Upper Paleolithic lifestyle at the novel's end--not even qualifying as barbarism.But it's Stewart's refusal to tread the usual Golden Age sci-fi path and make Ish a superscience hero that makes the novel very special. Ish may be a scientist, he's academically bright, but like many people he's low in energy, street-smarts, and foresight. By and large his motley clan possesses even lower survival skills. They aren't much different from the Valley Girls in another good story in the end-of-the-world genre, the movie NIGHT OF THE COMET. Both are based on an understanding that if the human race's average IQ is 100, half the people who are likely to survive a major disaster aren't going to be awfully competent. Stewart certainly knew that, and it provided both the uncanny realism and the rather depressing pessimism of this story. It's fascinating to note that the other reviewers have noted both aspects of EARTH ABIDES.","George R. Stewart weaves at once a beautiful and hauntingly believable tale with this novel, one that I've never been able to forget...or wanted to. Once considered dated, with the lessening of global nuclear tensions, the scenario Mr. Stewart envisions for a possible worldwide catastrophe, one brought about not by bombs but disease, has once again come to the forefront and become the most plausible ingredient in mankind's demise. More even than the fact that this is a truly enjoyable read is the deeper message Earth Abides shares with the reader as it reaches down and touches our very hearts, defining what it means to be human in an inhuman environment. The symbolism involved in Isherwood Williams' desire to keep a hammer with him for the future as a tie to the past is obviously an unconscious comment on his personal hope of rebuilding a fallen civilization. A hope that goes unfulfilled in his life time and maybe many lifetimes to follow. The insight into the human psyche that Mr. Stewart demonstates as he carries Isherwood from his youth at the beginning of the book to old age and finally death at the end and Isherwood's subtle change of attitude during that process, rings exceedingly true and speaks volumes about Mr. Stewart's keen and perhaps unique ability to put into words what it really means, or at least should mean, to be human. I've rarely read a book more than once because I just don't have the time, but I've read Earth Abides several times since I was a teen and I know I'll read it several more times before I too reach that stage in my life that Isherwood assures us won't be the calamity our youth oriented culture would have us to believe.","Due to a multitude of rude comments regarding this review I will edit to please. Here goes... NON-SPOILER ALERTI can't expound upon this book as some of the reviewers have. Nor can I recall in exact detail everything in the book.But I can add value in this way.... I read this book 30 years ago, and I still think about it. I can remember the xxxxxx, the xxxxx that xxxx the main character, the waves of xxxxx xxxxxx after the event... the xxxx, the forced xxxx, the eventual shut down of the xxxxx xxxxx as the xxxxxxxxx started to xxxxx. The shift from xxxxxxxxxx( for years) to xxxxxxx for themselves.The last breaths of the xxxxxxx and the xxxxxx for the xxxxxxx, the xxxx which every year the xxxxxxx took up to the xxxxx and xxxxx the time since the xxxxx.30 Years.... and I still think about it. How many books, movies, songs... etc... do you expect to think about 30 years down the road. You probably wouldn't even remember the title let alone a rough outline.Will I read it again? Certainly! I ran into a young lady reading this on the subway a few years back, and we had a wonderful conversation... it's that kind of a book.SPOILAGE AVERTED --- Skol","One thing that disturbs people about Earth Abides is its incredible humbling realism about the human condition. People who read it come away profoundly unnerved by the idea that civilization is not something guaranteed to come into existence if we lose it and that it requires an enormous convergence of many different kinds of stimulus to create the energies needed within a race of men to bring it into being. Even the most gifted races of people on the Earth can barely hold it together in the best of times, George Stewart shows us how easily it can all fall apart and remain in a primeval condition for untold generations.The protagonist Isherwood suffers from the same disease that afflicts even the best of men - he lacks direction, loses initiative, becomes too preoccupied with the daily stresses of living and watches his life trickle away in the post apocalyptic environment without ever seeming to summon the right kinds of ambitions to carry out his grand dreams of rebuilding the old world.Stewart was quite prophetic considering when this book was written because many modern anthropologists have since confirmed that many previous civilizations have died out precisely because of this &quot;critical threshold&quot; of the division of labor and sheer numbers of vanished races being too low to sustain a breeding population and achieve the critical mass that leads to a progress oriented civilization. Stewart was very perceptive too be able to articulate this phenomenon and even narrate its exact trajectory following the loss of so many people who were vital components in the world that Isherwood regrets the demise of.The most disturbing aspect for me was that I see much of the exact decay of western civilization going on right now all around us and we have not even have a catastrophic plague yet. The same loss of purpose, of drive, of a sense of our own individual worth as a nation and a desire to maintain our sovereignty is slowly giving way to the degenerative notion of a world socialist government of faceless consumers who lack any culture beyond the food court and cineplex.The terrifying thing about the book &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that it is the story of our world and the modern era ... even before we suffer the inevitable collapse of our civilization in the physical sense. The reality is that we see it all crumbling around our eyes into the multicultural carnival of formlessness and we often find ourselves as helpless and feckless as Ish himself in doing anything about it.Highest rating, possibly on the top 100 list of best fiction I've ever read. I consider Stewart to be the author of a modern classic in publishing this book. It is so much more than simply speculative fiction, it contains eternal truths.","As I look at the many Amazon customer comments, I see a real split between very favorable and unfavorable reviews. This seems to be because some readers are looking for conventional science fiction/fantasy or adventure. Much as I love those genres, this isn't it, so if that's what you're looking for, save yourself the trouble and don't read Earth Abides. If you do read it, don't expect it to be something it's not.Earth Abides is a book for people with a strong streak of curiosity, who cannot resist thinking and speculating about the human condition. If this is you, few books will satisfy you as well as this one. It first captivated me when I was 14 - yes, there are teens who would be very excited by this book - and I am now on my fourth reading. There is no other novel to which I have returned so regularly. If you are possessed of this curious, speculative streak, then you will appreciate the protagonist, Ish, who himself is driven to understand the horrible event that has overcome the world and to raise and shape a new world. You will also appreciate the realism of the action and characters, and the underlying drama of the situation and tragic heroism of Ish, and you will not for a minute miss the contrived drama and heroism that make for conventional action fiction.","I read this book in '75. Since then I've been pretty much obsessed by it and other eoc novels (End Of Civilisation). I've looked for a book that had similar 'feel' to it. Unfortuntaly 'The Stand', 'Alas, Babylon' or 'Swan Song' don't capture the same magic. The closest I've come to simulate the read experience that was 'Earth Abides' is Alfred Coppel's 'Dark December' or Brian Hodge' 'Dark Advent'.Out of all 300+ eoc novels I've picked up over the last 25 years, 'Earth Abides' STILL ranks as the best. It's probably my all time favorite novel...I think I'm going to go read it again...","First published in 1949, this novel won the 1951 International Fantasy Award in Fiction (the first one awarded) even though this is not a true fantasy novel. The International Fantasy Awards were originated by four British science fiction and fantasy fans (Leslie Flood, John Beynon Harris, G. Ken Chapman, and Frank A. Cooper) for the 1951 British science fiction convention. The awards lasted between 1951 and 1957. George R. Stewart (1895-1980) was a Professor of English at the University of California in Berkeley. This well-read novel is about life after a plague has killed all but a few people on Earth. Isherwood Williams, a graduate student in geography, returns from a trip to the mountains to find everyone dead. He travels throughout the land and finds a female survivor. They settle down in the Bay Area around San Francisco and a small community grows around them. As time goes by, Isherwood tries to teach the children reading and the knowledge of the past. As the decades go by, he discovers that he is the only one who recalls the greatness of the past. Humans have become a band of hunter-gatherers. History has come full circle. &quot;...men go and come, but earth abides.&quot; Carl Sandburg considered it one of the best novels of its time. It is regarded by many as a masterpiece and was a precursor for many later disaster novels (note that one of the voters of the International Fantasy Award was J. B. Harris, whose pseudonym was John Wyndham and author of another classic disaster novel, &quot;The Day of the Triffids.&quot; One of the earlier reviewers suggested that Wyndham was a better disaster writer. But, &quot;Triffids&quot; came out in 1951, and Wyndham still chose &quot;Earth Abides.&quot;). The name &quot;Isherwood&quot; is a direct reference to Ishi, the last surviving member of a California Indian tribe who was brought to the University by Kroeber of the Anthropology Department (many science fiction enthusiasts are very familiar with Kroeber's daughter, Ursula K. Le Guin). Ishi is still quite famous in the study of native American cultures. This book has had such an impact in the development of the science fiction genre that it is now required reading for all serious students of science fiction and speculative literature.","Very rarely do I finish a book and immediately recommend it to other people. Mostly books help pass the time and end up portraying the same plot; another female FBI agent trying to catch a serial killer who ends up stalking her. However, after reading Earth Abides I called up my brother and told him to pick it up. The book, while written some 50 years ago is still topical. The book takes you on a journey of how a person survives after a disaster that wipes out almost the whole population. It then takes you deeper, you find yourself emotionally involved with the character. And you realize that George Stewart has moved from an tale of physical survival into a tale of emotional conflict. The transition is smooth and the two easily complement each other. If you enjoy reading about a world where civilization has been wiped clean and a new world must start over. I highly recommend this book. The writing was engaging and intelligent without confusing you. The storyline was deep and involving. Overall, the main character becomes immediately identifiable. The book ends; but the world created by George Stewart lives on in our imagination. And, I believe that is a definition of a good book.","As of this date there are 158 reviews of George R. Stewart's Earth Abides here in Amazon.com. I'm not sure that writing a 159th will really add any value or if anyone will even make all the way to #159 to see it. But I feel very strongly about this book and to the intrepid reader who gets this far, I hope it helps you to decide to give the book a try.I was 12 years old in 1968 when my Mother gave me this book to read. She was (and still is) a voracious reader. But she has never liked or appreciated science fiction. Then again, she never considered this book to be science fiction. I read the book in one day that summer and have read it at least a half dozen times in the 35 years since then. And I would agree. Although often voted as one of the best science fiction books of all time, I don't really think of it as science fiction. Stewart was not a science fiction writer. Rather he was more of an ecological writer looking at how the planet behaves in relation to specific circumstances. Two of his other novels, Fire and Storm are good examples of this.One area I differ strongly from my Mom is, I do have a good appreciation for science fiction as well as other apocolyptic fiction. Ray Bradbury, Frank Herbert, Robert Heinlein, Philip Jose Farmer and Issac Asimov have thrilled and entertained me for years. But Earth Abides was what got me started and remains my favorite piece of fiction.Earth Abides is a simple \"what if\" story. What if virtually every person on earth died and only a handful were left? Given the book's publication date in 1949, it was groundbreaking. No one had really written a novel on this topic before this. Virtually all the other books in this genre owe a debt of gratitude to Stewart. Books such as The Stand by Stephen King, Alas Babylon by Pat Frank, Malevil by Robert Merle, Lucifer's Hammer by Niven & Pournelle and Swan Song by Robert McCammon included.Stewart must have had his influences, but not from a book or author of this kind. Therefore the story does not focus on war or technology or industry (or science fiction). Instead it is a tale of how the people might behave under the circumstances, the struggles they deal with, the decisions they make and the decisions they fail to make. It is also a tale of how the earth changes and the previous efforts of mankind are so easily erased.Some reviewers here have criticized the main character Ish as being too passive. But this is a part of the novel that rings very true for me. How agressive would one be after living through a time when virtually everyone else dies? Wouldn't most people struggle to survive, never mind thrive?I won't give away the plot for anyone who has gotten this far. Plus if you've made it all the way to this review, you've seen the plot described almost 158 times. In the end the book is both depressing and uplifting. It is depressing in that most of man's advancements appear to be lost by the end of the book. But it is uplifting to realize that the earth heals itself and in the end man will start fresh.The book is both a product and a victim of it's time period, the late 1940's. Some of it will feel a little dated, after all it's over 50 years old and think what has happened in those 50 years. But remarkably, it still comes across as fresh. And with very little update could be brought up to present day and still be a powerful piece of fiction.All in all this is a great read for most people. For those looking for a hard core science fiction look at the end of the world, go watch the Terminator movies.","&quot;Earth Abides&quot; is a wonderful literary work. It's a shame that it's catalogued as a work of &quot;science fiction&quot; because it is so much more than that. I'm sure that many serious literary fans have failed to pick up on this teriffic book because of that &quot;tag&quot;.The book has a tremendous &quot;hook&quot; line - that being, &quot;almost the entire human race is eradicated by a terrible catastrophe&quot;. The plot is very believable and amazing when you consider that the novel was written in 1949. Author George Stewart is a great storyteller and has created some very interesting characters. The hero of this book, &quot;Ish&quot;, is both a &quot;superman&quot; and an &quot;everyman&quot;. He is both the leader of his tribe, but also easily led. His development as a person and as the head of his people is a wonderful progression throughout the book. His wife, &quot;Em&quot; exhibits all the great characteristics of the strong woman behind the &quot;great man&quot;. And, let me say that the symbolism of Ish's hammer was a very interesting facet of the book.My only criticism (and it's a pretty minor one) is that the book did not go into enough detail regarding the disaster and how other people throughout the country were affected. I think that this would have added some rich &quot;body&quot; to the storyline.All things considered though, this indeed is a book for the ages.It belongs with some of the best works of that era, such as &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot;, &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, and later &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. As an educator, I would really urge school officials to add this novel to their list of great American Literary selections for high school students.But, do yourself a favor - go to the library or your local bookstore get a copy of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; and delve into this great classic with its timeless message about the unshakeable human spirit!","I read this book based on other reviews - having searched for good post-apocalypse novels. After reading Cormac McCarthy's \"The Road\", I was preparing myself for a depressing, yet thought-provoking read. \"Earth Abides\" was a thrill to read, and I kept turning back to remind myself that it was originally published in 1949! I thought the complete absence of any \"modern\" references to today's highly computerized world would make the story instantly outdated, but in fact, the opposite was true, for if we lost power, we would have to revert to very basic skills, just like Ish and his tribe did. This truly is a book that will stay with me for a very long time. Highly recommended!","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it. This maturity is perceptible all along this work.The story is situated in a world devastated by a sudden pestilence that annihilates most of the humankind. Taking into account the last SARS epidemic that jumped abruptly from China to Canada it doesn't look an impossible scenario.Isherwood Williams comes down from an isolate spot in the mountains to discover an empty world. He starts a search all across USA, from California to New York and back again. He finds only isolate human cells, couples or trios, overwhelmed by catastrophe and in a near catatonic state. Returns to his native town and contemplate with a certain scientific detachment the fading world around him.Mr. Stewart intercalate brief vignettes describing what happens to dogs, cats, cattle, plants, roads, dams, bridges, contrasting them with Ish's daily experiences.Little by little the story grip reader's attention and even if action is somehow slow, the book can't be putted down.Human cells began to draw near each other and a rather feeble structure starts to grow up.This is the story.The author approaches universal questions about survival and extinction; civilization and savagery; social structure and anomie. He also examines religious values, ethics and the ultimate sense of life itself.This book gives the reader a lot of stuff to think about. A very enticing read!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","I read this book over and over, loving it more each time. It gives the reader alot to think about because even though it's ficitonal, it is still possible. It is about a man who goes up into the mountains for some time, gets bitten by a snake and becomes very ill. He rests in his mountain cabin for several days, coming close to death, but eventualy regaining his strength. When he left the mountains and headed back home, he noticed the town was dead...literally. Very well written. I bought a new copy because mine was falling apart. Buy this book.","Like some of the other reviewers, I read this book 25-30 years ago. It changed how I viewed the value of the work we do. Stewart makes a strong case that if we can't maintain the infrastructure of our phyical world (roads, bridges, water works, electric plants, etc.), all our knowledge about the rest of the world is for naught.Stewart also explores &quot;events in nature&quot; and how them affect humans. In his book Storm, Stewart quotes Sir Napier Shaw: &quot;Every theory of the course of events in nature is necessarily based on some process of simplification of the phenomena and is to some extent therefore a fairy tale.&quot;In Storm the phenomena is a Siberian wind blowing south; in The Earth Abides, it is a virus. In both cases the earth is fine, but human are worst for wear.By the way, like The Earth Abides, Storm, and a third Stewart book, Fire, are set in Northern California. Everyone familiar with the great Pacific storms or the forest fires, will find these books fascinating.","I enjoyed this book and appreciated the thoughtful way in which the author depicted how the world could be with only a few humans left in it. Stewart covers a lot of topics (religion, education, environment, race, family, marriage, etc.) and how they would evolve or devolve over several decades. He describes a world where random people are left alive and those people may not be the most suitable people to live under the new conditions. The story moves along fairly quickly and generally kept me interested, if not fascinated.Some other reviewers mentioned how the main character, Ish, seems a little devoid of emotion at times. I agree, but I found another trait in main character more annoying. He spends a large amount of brainpower philosophizing and lamenting the lack of intelligence and motivation in the rest of the tribe. While Ish does some teaching, the children never learn reading or basic math skills. They also never work on any improvement projects or learn to recreate any of the basic disposable items they use regularly. My complaint is that Ish doesn't do any of those things either. I blame him for many of their failings. You could say that his shortcomings are realistic, but it drove me a bit crazy.Overall, this was an enjoyable read.","This book makes me want to explore Amazon's return policy for Kindle editions.Barring that, it has made me learn how to delete items from my Kindle.It has also taught me to pay attention to negative reviews.It is simply awful. Why, then, 2 stars?Well, the story - once you get past its one massively huge, incredibly off-putting major flaw - isn't too bad. Many folks have pointed out factual issues (ever volatile gasoline and canned goods that never go bad), and called these fatal flaws. I attribute them to the publication date: maybe, in 194x, when personal automobiles, gasoline, and canned goods were still fairly new, it simply wasn't known that they both spoil? I don't know, but those details weren't killers for me.What ruined the story, then? The protagonist. Our hero. I've read books with villians who were infinitely more likeable than the main character, Ish. He's a contemptible, amoral, elitist sociopath and I feel dirty having inhabited his mind for the past 2 days.I can kind of understand his elitish judgement of the people around him. Again, consider the context of the 1940s. Even today, college degrees are relatively rare (even though I think many of us who have them forget this fact. They are almost universal in the people with whom I associate, but still only 10% of the US population have them.), and in the 40s they were rarer still. So our disgusting hero was part of an elite at the time, and the majority of the population probably did not possess even high school diplomas. Once I realized that, he became slightly less unpalatable.However, our hero, Ish, views the near extinction of humanity with no more emotion than I view an empty of box cereal in the morning. In fact, I think I have more emotion over the cereal. His reaction to learning his parents have died? Effectively, \"eh, so what. What's in the fridge for dinner?\" Similarly, for no reason, he considers simply shooting the dog that accompanies him and, later, decides to shoot two cows just because. Not for survival or meat, really, just because he had a gun and they were there.He has no qualms about simply looting whatever he needs (a viable survival skill, I'll grant you), but views with contempt a group he encounters on his road trip who didn't move into a more palatial home simply because they could - and who are doing a more effective job of adapting to their new situation.He meets a couple in New York who insist on pretending nothing has changed, and looks down upon him. Yet the rest of the book, he exhibits nearly this exact behavior - living off canned food rather than adapting. He constantly disparages his colleagues in the Tribe for lacking imagination and drive, yet for all his superior intellect and thinking and ideas, does exactly nothing to drive change.I thought, eventually, that the author had made him so utterly horrible deliberately and that, over time, we'd see a metamorphosis in Ish, an awakening in him that he was not the paragon of humanity he believed. There are hints, here and there: his admitting that, though she's stupid, his wife was the true strength in the Tribe, etc. But, in the end, this contemptible human is still full of himself, believing his descendent's view him as a 'god', and, sadly, is still the same, utterly obnoxious, foul human that he started as. He takes pride in this, too, which is pathetic: to have survived the death of civilization, to have had even a weak hand in its rebirth, and to believe that the experience has left you utterly unchanged, that you would have been the same person if society had simply carried on, is truly sad.","George Stewart's super-classic is my favorite SciFi sub-genre--the demise of man by one means or another. Stewart uses a pandemic virus which is a bit cliche--oops, wait a minute, he did it first! Everyone _else_ is the cliche. His writing is dark and literary, brought to life by his protagonist, Isherwood Williams', gloomy, introspective personality. Stewart does not develop the science behind the virus, but given that he wrote the story in 1947, I suppose he can be forgiven. On the other hand, H.G. Wells and Jules Verne forcast many technological wonders in their stories, so maybe Stewart could have gone out on a creative limb just a wee bit more than he did. Nevertheless, the real gem of the story is Stewart's portrayal of the demise of mankind--not the virus that reduced his population to a handful--but the demise of his culture, his literature, his creative energy. It seems we humans are what we are because with great numbers of people scarfing up every last spot of ground and every last resource, each individual has to be ever on his toes just to turn a buck. Take away the people, say, overnight, and the detritus of their civilization becomes easy pickings for the surviving few. No need to grow anything to eat--just open up a can. When they ran out of cans, it was almost as easy to hunt for dim-witted, slow-footed domestic cattle, now living in the wild. But the real casualty was culture. Several generations after Ish, people no longer spoke Ish's English, at least not so he could understand it. Culture too appears to be a product of crowds. Stewart set the bar for this SciFi sub-genre. There have been many since 1949, including my own example listed below, but he has yet to be equalled.--Ejner Fulsang, author of \"A Destiny of Fools\", [...] 2007","This is the granddaddy of post apocalyptic novels. Whenever I read this book I see bits of so many post apocalyptic novels in it. Well written, well delivered. If you like post apocalyptic books then read this one. It wasn't until the release of EARTH THE NEW FRONTIER that I read a better end of the world book than Earth Abides. Both of these are classics in the post-apocalyptic genre.","This is a book that rewards close reading--not skimming. Written in 1949, it is still a haunting and poignant read. Those who dismiss this as cliche must remember that this is the book that gave birth to the cliche, the first truly prophetic biological-apocalypse piece of writing, and all who come after must merely stand on its shoulders. Re-released in the &quot;SF Masterpiece&quot; series, and deservedly so.","Earth Abides is a book concerning a plague that kills off most of humanity and the survivors' attempts to reconstruct civilization. The pace of the book is rapid in the beginning and the reader doesn't have to get very far before they realize something terrible has happened. We are initially with one character, Isherwood Williams, who seems emotionally well suited to survive this tragedy in which 99% of everyone has died in the space of two to three weeks. The story continues with Ish traveling across the country looking for survivors and eventually returning to his home in Berkeley, CA where he meets a woman, Em, and they marry each other. Slowly a group of people calling themselves &quot;The Tribe&quot; forms and Ish tries to lead his small group back towards civilization and away from a more &quot;primitive&quot; existence.Strengths are the good character development as well as interesting asides on how the world is readjusting to no longer having man dominate it. It offers some interesting insights on human nature and societies in general and as a disaster book ranks highly on the list. In a sense it is like The Stand except for that this plague is strictly natural, not a tool for a climatic battle between good and evil. The plague simply comes and kills humanity off and that is that.Some of the negatives are found in the style of writing. This book was written in the late 1940's and the language used is rather dry. The author seems to go overboard on his word usage and sometimes seems to be talking down to the audience a bit.Still, if you like disaster stories you should pick up Earth Abides, it is well worth any effort.Robert Merkamp","I'm not going to defend it; excellence stands the test of time, and this one has been around for decades (1949). I would simply ask you to read it for yourself.\"Ish\" came to be one of my favorite literary characters and an inspiration for my own work.","'Earth Abides' is a classic novel of the end of human civilization and it's rebirth. Unlike other apocalyptic sci-fi fantasy novels in the mold of Mad Max, there are no weapon wielding skin headed cannibals roaming the wasteland. In fact the only violence in this novel is an encounter with a pack of wild dogs and the heart rendering decision the community makes to deal with one of the human survivors. In light of recent research exemplified by books such as 'The World Without Us', 'Earth Abides' is astonishing prophetic and knowledgeable. You might say that this novel is an environmentalist's apocalyptic novel 50 years ahead of its time. The novelist's understanding of modern ecology is amazing considering when it was written. The theme of the novel is stated in the title. Human civilization may disappear but earth will abide. A modern classic that should not be missed.","Isherwood Williams is away in the mountains pursuing his graduate field studies in geology. In our iPhone, instant connectivity world it is hard to imagine the isolation this kind of trip entailed in the 1950's when George Stewart wrote his book. Recovering from a snake bite, Ish stumbles back from the hills to find most of humanity wiped out by disease. We follow Ish through the remainder of his life as he comes to terms with a changing Earth--an Earth on which humanity is a barely noticeable presence.The absence of humanity is not only a stark fact, but is emphasized by the author's writing style. Ish is a clear introvert and we experience much of the Earth's change through his internal monologue. Even when he encounters, interacts with, and teams up with other people, this produces very little dialogue. This style underscores the aloneness of the book's characters. It's not loneliness, in the emotional sense, but a continuing reminder that other people no longer play a significant role in the world.The Earth itself becomes an evolving character in the book. We experience the successive rise and fall in populations of insects, rats, dogs and other species as seasons in the Earth's changing life. The diminishing resources scavenged by human beings from cities and storehouses are important to their survival, but also serve as markers of change as the Earth sheds the thin layers of Man's influence. This change is not progress, nor is it overly mourned as decline. It is thoroughly described and documented as inevitable change. Ish observes it and reacts to it. But neither he nor the other characters influence its path or pace.Read and compare this book with two other classics of post-Apocalyptic fiction:Alas, BabylonandThe Day of the Triffids. These works also follow their characters through crises, scavenging, and attempts to preserve the technology and civilization of the past. They are both more optimistic and more social in narrative style and in the strategies followed by their characters. After reading them, return to Earth Abides and appreciate it for the melancholy and aloneness felt by both its characters and its readers. It is a good story, a moving experience, and a skillful integration of message and writing style.","Yes, this is a must-read. I found it 40 years ago and have never forgotten it. Very realistic, this runs rings around today's fantasy and sword-and-sorcery pseudo-science fiction. Countless derivative novels and movies owe this book a lot.","Earth Abides is not a typical post-apocalyptic novel. It doesn't present a world of mutants, giant cockroaches or bands of marauders. It simply shows the slow and inevitable decay of man and all his works, in the teeth of attempts by the protagonist to restore the old ways of civilization. In that it succeeds beautifully and shows us the grandeur of our world and the majesty of what we have wrought...then compares it to the greater majesty of nature and the eternal gaze of time. The novel works best as a family drama, more Swiss Family Robinson than Mad Max, and has no sensational adventures to offer other than the daily tribulations of life. For man may be a great creature, but he is still small and the world doesn't really need him at all...Earth Abides is the most meditative and serene post-apocalyptic novel I've ever read, and it's recommended for more thoughtful readers who won't be easily bored.","EARTH ABIDES is lauded as one of the most noteworthy post-apocalyptic novels ever written. It was originally published in 1949, and its author, George R. Stewart, was better known as a writer of nonfiction than fiction, but EARTH ABIDES is easily his most recognized work--it has been in print off and on for nearly fifty years.Isherwood (Ish) Williams is a graduate student working on his thesis--\"The Ecology of the Black Creek Area\"--in the wilds of northern California when a virulent virus destroys humanity. When Ish returns to civilization he finds emptiness. There are no bodies littering the streets, no signs of struggle, nothing except the surreal stillness of empty towns, streets, businesses and homes. Everything is gone, and Ish doesn't understand what has happened until he reads the bleak, desperate headlines of the last issue of a newspaper in an abandoned magazine shop.EARTH ABIDES is the story of how Isherwood Williams survives the death of humanity, and with it, modern civilization. He is man of intellect--he mourns the passing of knowledge--and he can visualize the future not as an abstract idea, but as it very well may be. Ish chronicles the remnants of humanity as they form themselves into small tribes. They live off what the \"old ones\" left. They open cans for food; they raid sporting goods stores for firearms and ammunition, and miraculously they survive and grow. Ish begins his journey as an observer, but he quickly finds himself a participant of this new world.EARTH ABIDES is one of the most troublesome novels I have read. It is troublesome for two reasons. The first is the writing--style, narrative, and plotting--drove me batty. In a matter of pages it would cycle from being an immensely powerful and energetic story to a dull, over analytical and tiresome diatribe. One of the reasons for this wild and frequent swing was the frequent, every few pages, interruption of the narrative with an omniscient perspective spoiler: It was italicized and, in a very technical and academic style, told exactly what was going to happen in the next few pages. It interrupted the flow of the prose, and generally annoyed me.Secondly, it was a very unflattering look at just how terrible it would be to survive the death of civilization. There is nothing romantic, or eerie, or wholesome, or evil, as in many other popular post-apocalyptic stories--but rather it showed the difficultly, the loneliness and down right miserable aspects of surviving past modern civilization. It read very realistic--the way it would be if our neighbors suddenly died and one or two of us were left holding the bag: suicides, drugs, alcohol and insanity all the flavor of the day.This aspect of the novel was its strength--Mr. Stewart's visions of desperation were apt and vivid. One example of this is when Ish returns to an empty world, and drives through town after town honking his horn, and then waiting for the answering honk that never comes. Ish's loneliness and desperation is palpable and completely understood by the reader.EARTH ABIDES was a roller coaster ride. I enjoyed it yes, but I also disliked it. It is a novel filled with ideas, but its impact is lessened with the over-evaluation of those ideas. If you enjoy a good post-apocalyptic novel EARTH ABIDES may be the answer, but tread warily, because some of its impact and importance has worn away with the passing years.-Gravetapping","Let me preach: I consider it a crime that _Earth Abides_ is out of print. But I can understand why. It challenges way too many of modern man's notions. It is seditious in the quietest of ways.I had never heard of this book till I wrote a review for _I Am Legend_.Some people compared both books and out of curiosity I picked it up at a used book store.Wow! Why is this book not in the canon of great works of American literature? True, it is a 300 page (in the paperback) _meditation_ by one man on the fall and gradual rise of mankind. I can understand why some reviewers loathe the book. It is an observation, not an adventure. The hero's meditations merely travel through time; through space his travels are almost incidental.Our hero, Ish, is no Odysseus. He is no Don Quijote. He is no Robin Hood or King Arthur or Moses. He is an ordinary scholar, a grief-stricken individual trying to come to terms with post-traumatic stress after witnessing the near-universal death of the human race. All he can do is make heroic attempts to _keep track_ of events and time.His meditations and road trip bring him in contact with stoic people, with depressed people, with defensive people and at one point, his Tribe encounters religious fanatics--all isolated groups of survivors trying to cope and remake society in their image.As _written by Stewart_, Ish's burden and character are not those of a civilization builder but rather of a witness to decay, ruin, and eventual rebirth, in which Ish _realizes_ that hubris and a need to control \"fate/destiny/the future\" drove much human action, human culture, and the human spirit.Ish's insights continually bowled me over as I turned page after page. His meditations on technology, progress, humanity, eugenics, government, economics, religion, philosophy, superstition, anthropology, education, and literacy (all man-made institutions) constantly challenged my views and I began an internal dialogue with Ish's character!Ish/Stewart challenges a lot of notions of what we call progress and culture. Amazing. No wonder some people have hated and, doubtless, will hate this book. Prepare to have your attitudes about culture, and civilization,--and what makes a _great literary character_--challenged.It's not one of those, what-would-you-do-in-this-scenario novels, but rather an exposition of what one man _learns_ from his circumstances. Does he challenge them? Fight back? Does he mold circumstances to his spirit or does he go along with them? Is the \"individual acting upon his circumstance and vice-versa\" _question_ some kind of cosmic constant?There are earthquakes, forest fires, city-wide conflagrations. The daily amenities are gone: water, power, fire/police protection, doctors/medicine, etc. You are on your own. What do you do? Responses are manifold. Ish's response and that of his \"tribe\" is just one. That is the brilliance of this novel. You can understand Ish's actions, but would they be yours? Would any actions make a \"difference?\" What is this \"difference\" and who gauges/judges it? Therein lies the crux of the novel. Those who hate the novel seem to resent this existential/metaphysical point.A harsher critic would say that \"events happen\" in _Earth Abides_ in order for Stewart to make his point. Fair enough. Very few characters are developed with fine detail, but that is not the point of this novel. The novel is _about Ish_, the man, his conundrums and his meditations. Not about what we would have done or written or how we would have developed the \"supporting characters.\"Oh, and the pathos in this book is very real. The human universals occur: love, births, bondings/friendship, weddings, tribalism, leadership-rivalry, loss, death. And even a morally ambiguous, ethics-challenging execution.If a few scenes don't bring you to profound sorrow, well...let's just say _I_ experienced the sorrow and emotion of the scene as the novel unfolded.I will not reveal more, but this sad and haunting novel is worth the read. This is a novel that for some reason reminded me of H.G. Wells's _The Time Machine_. Shelley's \"Ozymandias\" and Yeats's The Second Coming\" come to mind as well. Read it and buy your friends a copy. Be a friend. Be well. The Earth Abides.","In my top 5 Science Fiction Novels Ever.Earth Abides tells the story of one solitary man who survives a global, but short-lived plague by pure chance. The novel chronicles his life from that point until his eventual death and is filled with both adventure and introspection. At times the main character, Ish, is hard to like simply because his reactions are so human it's disturbing. He's no hero, and in the post-Heinlein flood of heroic SciFi novels you could be forgiven for calling this novel slow.Earth Abides reaches the lofty height of my number 3 favorite despite the fact that it DID NOT win either the Hugo or the Nebula Award, in fact it wasn't even nominated. Instead I award it this honor because it is the most brilliant example of the post-holocaust theme I've ever encountered, and that theme is a huge one in the Speculative Fiction genre. This is THE BAR, and no one has raised it in 50 years.Superbly poetic and graceful, Earth Abides is undeniably honest, realistic and human it's long, diary-like journey from start to finish. I could easily see myself as Ish... which is both a revelation and scary thought at the same time.","This is such a great book on so many levels, it's a shame that it's being subjected to negative comments from readers who have totally missed key points about the story. First off, the protagonist, Ish, is a geographer, an informed and detached observer and not meant to be a hero or role model. Please don't ladle 21st-century dramatic or politically-correct expectations onto him. He's more real than that. Second, some reviewers here are complaining that Ish doesn't teach his fellow survivors to read etc. But in fact he tries throughout the second half of the novel to do so. They just won't. Ish gradually accepts that his fellow survivors aren't capable of hard intellectual work, that the torch of civilization is going to be mostly extinguished. Ish theorizes that probably the few, functioning survivors of the global plague are going to be doltish people. The sensitive, intelligent ones that survived went mad and were deemed unfit to join the little tribe of survivors. So Ish has the human clay that he has -- simple, uncurious, habit-driven people. He's constantly frustrated that he can't rouse them to live above the level they quickly sank to -- of hunting and gathering cans from supermarkets, talking about fixing up things but never doing it, etc. The whole novel is about the unstoppable descent of the last survivors into primitivism, despite having all of the knowledge of the world at their fingertips in the library.The stopover in the south at the family of the \"negroes\" deserves to be called passe -- the book was published in 1949 after all.","A young man recovers, from what seems to be snake bite, to find humankind has basically been decimated from a strange disease. That's the way Mr. Stewart's work begins. And where does it go from there? Well, the protagonist procedes to explore the remains of the U.S. Eventually he settles down and begins a new life, in the new world that Earth has become.Even though this book might be classified as a sci-fi piece, it is a little less and more than that:- Earth Abides does not deeply explore the \"sci\" in sci-fi. There are not many explanations for the disease that destroys civilization. And there are not too many explanations either for what comes next in the book.- On the other hand, Earth Abides does a great job in exploring the psychological effects on the survivors of the demise of civilization. Moreover, Mr Stewart stretched his work through time to show us the way the first generations of the world (the survivors' sons, daughters and grandkids) would behave. This is really nice.I enjoyed this book. It really did not make a big difference on me the fact that it was written some 50 years ago (frankly, I'm not really sure if the outcome would have been different if this disease attacked us now).I recommend this book to anyone interested in exploring the possibilities and consequences of a decimation of humankind by disease (not impossible considering the bird flu). Regular sci-fi readers might enjoy it, too.Don't read this if you want a hard-core sci-fi book, if it being 50 years old is an issue for you (no Internet and cable TV here...), or if you don't want to share the protagonist's loneliness.Enjoy!","An aging story. I liked the book on a whole, but the middle and end dragged into tedium.The first half of the book was very interesting to me, and I enjoyed the writing immensely. The last half of the book, on the other had was very, very slow.By the time the end came I was ready for it to be over, and did not much care what happened to everybody after that. good riddance.","The book must be praised for being quite different from most sci-fi of its time. Much of the narrative is spent taking a look at the details of the slow collapse of man's works after he is gone. If you enjoy \"Life after People\" you will enjoy this. However, Stewart's Apocalypse is a gentle one, with little evidence of panic or struggle as mankind fell.I also love that the timeline spans many years, interspersed with important episodes from the anti-hero's perspective. Having a hero that was not a superman was definitely different for the time, as was his pessimism. I loved the cross country adventure and the gradual expansion of the Ish's tribe as it met others. The book felt a little like Asmimov's foundation, which is a good thing.I thought the ending sequence [minor SPOILER alert] concerning how old age affects one's cognitive abilities was particularly well done.This could have been one of my all time favorites, if not for two things :1) the main character's egotism was hard to swallow. Perhaps the author expected he would be disliked? I doubt it however.2) Dated 40's attitudes. It feels racist AND classist (in the author's/Ish's description of the other survivors).I do highly recommend this novel, but with the grain of salt.","I have just finished reading \"Earth Abides\" for the fourth time. The first time I read it I was in my early twenties after having been lent a copy by a friend. Like so many readers, the story haunted me and many years later I decided to buy a copy of my own to read again. It was out of print in the UK at that time but I did eventually manage to obtain a copy in the States. I read it again and again. I am now 59 and the member of a book club which had \"The Road\", another post-apocalyptic story which has recently been made into a film, as one of its reads. This had a rather mixed reception from members and so I told them about \"Earth Abides\". I am delighted to say that every one of our members has read \"Earth Abides\" and enjoyed it.I notice that, like me, 90% of reviewers are happy to give \"Earth Abides\" 5 stars. Out of curiousity I have read the reviews of the minority who give it less than 3 and I have the following comments to make. Those who say \"what happened to all the dead bodies?\" need to read the book again. There are numerous references to what happened in the final stages of the epidemic, the way that they dealt with the dead and the dying, the emergency centres that were set up and the subsequent places that Ish avoided on his travels because of the smell of rotting corpses etc.Another popular criticism of the book is the apparent inability of Ish and his tribe to be creative, to teach the children to read, or to make any progress in salaging anything of the previous civilisation. I have had about 30 years to think about this one myself and I am not convinced that given the small, random group of survivors that Ish had at his disposal, and the lifestyle that they had gotten used to, that things could have turned out differently. For me the whole point of the story was that in a situation where the population slips below a certain threashold it is not possible to hang onto civilization as we know it and that a new civilization has to be born. The children of the tribe instinctively knew this and taught themselves the skills they would eventually need to survive. Think about what happened to previous so-called civilisations in our history to what happened to them in times of climactic change - they disappeared.The haunting part to this whole story is the question what happened next? For me \"Earth Abides\" will be one of the best books I have ever read or am ever likely to read.","Audible.com recently recorded what I think is the first ever audio version of George R. Stewart's classic novel, Earth Abides, so I decided to give it another read. I've read it before of course, but it's probably been almost 20 years since the last time, so I was excited to get into it again.Written in 1949, Earth Abides, is probably the earliest \"modern\" example of a pandemic post-apocalyptic novel. It follows Isherwood Williams, known as just Ish, for a period of about 50 or 60 years, starting after The Great Disaster, an unknown plague that wipes out all but just a few pockets of survivors. We see The Tribe, as they call themselves, started from just seven survivors, as it develops into a group of over a hundred people in the hills of San Francisco.There are hundreds of reviews of the book around the web, so I'll just stick with a few thoughts. It' definitely a good book (it won several awards and is credited by Stephen King as an inspiration for The Stand), and I really enjoyed it myself, but I can see how if you're not a super-fan of the post-apocalyptic genre, you might think it's a little slow in places. The first third or so feels like watching Tom Hanks in Cast Away; there's basically zero dialog as Ish travels around the country looking for other survivors. Even when a few of them gather to start a community, the writing style is mostly descriptive, without a lot of talk.But the material that's covered is perfect for anyone who wonders about how civilization would fare after an apocalypse. Would the children born into the new world be curious about the old one? Would they care to learn to read or to carry on the knowledge of the \"Old Ones\"? Would they view the Old Ones as people like themselves, or would they look on them as gods who created all the indecipherable wonders they see around them?Ish struggles with the answers to these kinds of questions as he tries to preserve and pass on enough knowledge to keep some semblance of civilization, if not simply his people, alive. They face actual dangers, such as wanderers bearing disease, but the greatest threat to the future of The Tribe is their apathy. The few from Before are comfortable enough in their current existence to not want to bother reclaiming the comforts of the old world, and those born after don't know enough about what they're missing to care either. So they live off the corpse of the old world, eating wild animals or out of cans for decades, not bothering to learn how to plant their own crops or keep their own farms.So, if you're looking for a primer on how to keep a small community alive in an urban environment after the collapse of civilization, this isn't it. This is almost an anthropological study, seen as it's happening, of the recreation of society from scratch, and as it goes on, we're not sure if that society will turn out to be recognizable to those of us left behind or not.So like I said before, if you're not a fan of the genre, or are looking for a more action-oriented story, this might not be for you. But for a true fan, Earth Abides is one of the \"Big Ones\", on most every list of the best post-apocalyptic novels ever written, so if you haven't read it yet, you really should.","I first read this book in the 60's as my husband and I were in university. I carried it for about 20 years and lost it and life took over and I never replaced it. But my mind has continued to reflect on passages, in fact, I will tell someone how racial prejudice starts and I got it from this book. It covers a frightening time but the ingenuity, focus, and just \"I will not die\" leaves in the reader ideas that will live with you forever.This morning, I couldn't stand it and went to look for it and found it here at Amazon. Thank you, thank you.","I haven't read this book in at least 35 years yet I feel like I read it only last week. This story was unique in it's treatment of humanity and it's approach to the end of the world. This is not a Man conquers over all obstacles story. The future is bleak but the characters are real humans faced with the end of their civilization. They abide, after a fashion, but not near the same as the humanity we know. I wonder how this might have been done with man's dependence on technology even greater today. This is a classic and deserves more attention.","While doing research in a remote cabin, Isherwood Williams is bitten by a rattlesnake. Emerging from a short delirium, Ish returns to civilization only to find that a new virus has wiped out 99.9% of the Earth's population. Ish sets out to see if he can find any survivors.The story is told in an irregular fashion, slowly detailing Ish's immediate experiences, then speeding into the future only to slow again for years that are more important. I enjoyed the haphazard narrative, but wished that the author had focused more detail during several essential emotional scenes regarding birth and death.The focus of the story revolves around Ish's struggle to preserve the American society against superstitions that threaten to govern the new society. The author touches on many of the possible earth changes that might happen in such a catastrophe. Some systems immediately fail while some last for many years. Fans of Stephen Kings \"The Stand\" will enjoy this similar, yet simpler tale.","Earth Abides was a great book. It is not what you would call an action-packed sci-fi novel. Rather, it is extremely thought provoking. It makes you think about the meaning of life, human relations with other men and with nature, your place in the world, and the value of what you do. Although written in the forties, it is still very relevant because it also makes you question the value of our increasingly faster and busier lifestyles and constant striving for more advanced technology.Yes, like some reviewers did, you can argue with some details, but if this is your main concern you are taking quite a shallow view of it and not seeing the forest for the trees. The beauty of this book is not so much in the details, but in it's enormous scope and ambition.This was a book that I could not put down and one that I think will long influence me.","Earth Abides is an interesting take on the human condition. Whether you agree or disagree with what the author is trying to say, it is definitely a book that makes you think about the story line and characters.While I disagree with most of Stewart's assumptions, it is well written and thought provoking. Definitely a classic that should be read again and again.","\"Earth Abides\" is NOT a science fiction novel, which is probably why many readers...have been disappointed. It is much more a social commentary, a critical examination of the human race, and a thoughtful analysis of where the human race really rates in the grand scheme of things. Thematically, the novel has more in common with Daniel Quinn's \"Ishmael\" than King's \"The Stand.\" Stewart asks us to consider the true meaning of \"civilization\" -- is it all about electricity, running water, and refrigeration? Or is it more about community and survival? Stewart's main character tries valiently to convince the new race of Americans to work together to reform the kind of civilization that led to world overpopulation in the first place (and that overpopulation, he theorizes -- in very Quinn-like reasoning -- results in a very natural plague that wipes out most of the human race). The lessons learned in this compelling novel are both profound and frightening. Could it be possible that some day our ancestors, generations in the future, will look back on us as odd and strange creatures who depended too much on invention and not enough on ourselves? In some ways, the novel is about the conflict between intellectualism and naturalism. In other ways, it's about learning to deal with change. However you read it, \"Earth Abides\" is a terrific book you won't soon forget.","I stumbled across this book a few decades ago when living in Japan for over a year. I was hungry for English words in a good book. It surpassed my expectations! The plot is beautifully developed and makes a surreal world believable. The human struggle and resourcesfullness was absolutely heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time. I cared so much about the outcome of the characters, I couldn't put it down! Very few books lure repeat reads like this one did. After misplacing it during my returning to the U.S., I hunted for a another copy everywhere to no avail. Finally, when it appeared in the dark corner of a small used bookstore, you would have thought I struck gold. Years later, at the end of a job interview, I was asked to name my favorite book--probably to ensure that I was cultured reader. Without hesitation, I recommended \"Earth Abides\" in full glory. The irony is that I'm not typically a science-fiction reader, leaning more toward drama and suspense. Well, that's exactly what this book offers as no other! If you have time to read only one book, make it this one!","I like reading older books, and this one certainly fits the bill as it was published in 1949.It was written in an older style with minimal dialogue. It's also written in the first person which makes it very subjective.I found Ish, the main character, at first, bland and uninteresting. But as I read he grew on me.I would recommend the book as one version of how things may evolve after a widespread plague and only a few survivors.It is well written, although in some scenes I found the dialogue a little too 'bible-ish'. I also found some plot developments a bit unrealistic. I believe it is an ingrained characteristic in humans to want to survive, to lash out at fate and try to beat it. I don't think that, as in this book, people would just give up and live off the remnants of the old world forever (or until the next generation picks up the ball). I think people would automatically try to herd cattle and sheep and try to start gardens and orchards.Another weak point is how the author seems to avoid the harder scenes in the book. When something is done about Charlie, when Joey contracts the disease and it's outcome, and when Ish's wife finally dies. All these main moments in Ish's life are avoided by skimming over them.All in all I do recommend this book, but it is not for readers wanting action. It's for readers wanting to think.I'll remember for while the passage in Chapter 2 of the last secion where we discover that Ish did make a impact on the outcome of the tribe. It reminded me that sometimes just by doing what we think is right we affect the outcome of our own immediate environment, our tribe.","Maybe today the plot of \"Earth abides\" is nothing new, but when it was written, in 1949, it surely was. Professor Stewart's only book in science-fiction quickly turned into a milestone concerning apocalyptic themes. William Brinkley's \"The last ship\", Pat Frank's \"Alas, Babylon\", Nevil Shute's \"On the beach\" and Stephen King's \"The stand\" all come to mind as having similar ideas, although each of the five books mentioned have their own characteristics and deal with the subject of \"end of human civilization\" in unique ways.\"Earth abides\" is more like a one-man chronicle. Isherwood Williams, a reclusive geology student, finds himself a survivor of an unnamed \"Great Disaster\" that has wiped out 99% of humankind. During the course of the book, Stewart tells the reader how Ish, as he calls his main character, learned to live again, without all the comforts of civilization, forming a new family, than a new community. Ish thinks of himself as \"the last american\", and Stewart explains very well why that is so.Although not overtly a \"dark\" science-fiction story - like \"On the beach\", for example -, \"Earth abides\" has a subtle way of making the reader very uneasy and impotent as he turns the pages. This book was written almost sixty years ago, but has a very modern feeling about it - not scientifically, of course, but if we think about how Man deal with his peers and with nature, Stewart's book will ring some known bells.Grade 8.7/10","I fully expected to enjoy this book. I've read piles of books in the same genre - The Stand, The Road, Plague Journals, etc. This is notably different in that there is absolutely no faith or hope - there is no striving for better, there is only just getting by.I was very put off my the narrator's belief that no one else possessed any intellect. I've met loads of blue collar workers who would have done a much better job in getting things started. I simply can't imagine a group of people who would settle for canned food instead of growing their own. Who would settle for no electricity? I can't imagine having access to a library and not researching how to start a power plant back up. There was no planning - just living day to day.I guess I have a different belief about the nature of man. And, as others stated, I don't know that the author had children or interacted with them. They are sponges and want to learn. They can be inspired - he was simply ineffective - it was his fault then that he couldn't get them motivated.","After reading Earth Abides (for the second time, in the early 1960's), I was moved to write to GRS, which I had never before done, with any author!My letter was passed on to his address via his Literary Agent in London, and arrived in San Francisco three weeks after his death.I received a treasured return letter from Theodosia Stewart, his widow, and after a few exchanges of letters, she invited me to come to San Francisco to meet her and that she would give me access to all of his notes and work in the archives at The Bancroft Library at Berkeley University.I took up this offer, and in 1985, travelled to California - my first flight!!!I have written an account, with photographs, of the people I met and the places connected with GRS, many of whom I am still in contact with, and will some day publish this account, but the above serves to show what an effect this book had on a young (38 years) englishman, to pull me across the world.The high points of my visit were meeting Theodosia (Ted) Stewart, visiting \"the house on San Lupo Drive\", and standing on the smooth slabs at Indian Rock Park.All of this came from reading \"Earth Abides\".","I hate to add a note of dissent to all the glowing reviews but this book really frustrated me. It`s not that it was badly written though I found the style a little clinical. I guess that is just a reflection of the personality of Ish, through whose eyes we see the unfolding of the years following the devastating plague. Myabe it was his character that annoyed me so much and basically put me off the book. He seemed to consider himself so superior to those about him and become almost unbalanced in his lofty plans for his favourite son. I found it hard to believe that everyone else in the community apart from him was so darn thick. I also found it very sexist, even though i know that only reflects the time it was written. The author`s attitude to race relations was dedfinitely more forward-thinking than towards women, who were mainly portrayed as baby-obsessed brood-mares. Even Em, the main female character was seen as reacting to events on an instinctual rather than intellectual level.The apathy of the community also bothered me - would people really be this unconcerned about their children`s future? Decades later and they hadn`t taught the children to read so they could learn how to do all that stuff they`d eventually need - like how to make candles, when to plant crops, how to weave fabric, etc etc. I can`t believe they were STILL living off tinned food all those years after and hadn`t even bothered to domesticate any horses or grow vegetable gardens! I prefer the English series Survivors, which I feel tackled the practicalities of having to provide and produce absolutely EVERYTHING necessary to life for yourself much better than this did.","First, as a story, the character development is poor and any drama is virtually non-existent. There are a few opportunities for drama, but in each case, the author fails to draw in the reader and make them care. Similarly, there's little to cause the reader to become invested in the characters. You could read abstracts on the characters and get as much out of them as reading the novel.Secondly, the \"hero\" is annoying and a bit contemptible, but perhaps this is the author's goal. Regardless, it made me like the story even less. In short, the hero prefers to sit around and do nothing while he complains inwardly about the dullness and laziness of his \"tribe\". This goes on, and on, and on... In short, I eventually got tired of the hero's endless elitism and hypocrisy.Perhaps the author's message is that the hero didn't understand while the simpletons did. Perhaps his message was that civilization is overrated compared to a simple and primitive life, we should stop worrying, live in the now, leave the rat race, etc, etc. If so, his delivery of that message is painfully boring and repetitive for the reader. At the end of the book, I really didn't care if there was a message or what it was.On a positive note, the prose used to break up chapters was often well-written. It just wasn't enough to make up for the bad execution on the actual story.","Every time the protagonist passes judgement on other characters, have a drink.Every time the protagonist compares himself to a god or demi god, have a drinkEvery time the protagonist says \"Oh! Mother of Nations\" or \"Oh Joey!\" have a drink.Every time the protagonist refers to himself as the last American despite there being evidence that other communities of survivors have formed, likely with their own elders, take a drink.Every time you find an editing error, have a drink.You may want to take it one chapter at a time so you are not utterly intoxicated. The book was most interesting for the interpretation of what post pandemic America could be like. However, the story moves slowly and the dialogue is stilted and awkward. Not as good as I had hoped for.","I know this is the grandfather of post-apocalyptic fiction but some of the attitudes expressed in this book are so dated and unrealistic that they pulled me out of the story. There are lots of poetic passages and lyrical writing but the hero is surprisingly unsympathetic and uncharismatic for my taste.","The premise of the story is interesting, especially in our time of ridiculous overpopulation of this planet and the ability for any virus to move worldwide in a short time, but the story wasn't especially well written. I really can't see so much of current civilization being lost as Mr. Stewart expects. Also, there wasn't very much character development.","Long ago, when I was about 12, I read a book by George Stewart called Fire. I remember enjoying this book. When I came across The Earth Abides last year I remembered thinking that I might enjoy this one based on my prior experience with his earlier book. Besides I liked the title. Well my enthusiasm started to wane after reading the first 100 pages or so. I started to think that perhaps my taste had changed in the intervening decades. In Fire, I had found interesting his asides where he described the fire and its growth. Here, when he interrupted the story in an aside describing changes to the world and the decay of mankind's works, I found it distracting and thought it broke the narrative flow. Several times I found myself saying \"that is not the way people would behave\" and second guessing the author- fighting against the direction the author was taking us. I thought that perhaps the story, being written in the late `40's, was dated. However, about two-thirds of the way through the book, right about the time when a couple of the colony members were sent on a cross country trip to see what was going on in the rest of the country, I had a major change of heart. It was like a log jam breaking. I suddenly let go of my preconceptions and opened my mind up to his vision, his story. I found the story suddenly compelling and the characters believable, and the writing, while not on the level of a Saul Bellow, moving and effective. I found his description of civilization slipping backward, and the growth of the colony into a tribal, superstitious society, in contrast to the protagonist's scientific \"modern\" leanings, very powerful and imbued the story with a powerful melancholy. However, the book is not necessarily all depressing. Indeed it makes clear that mankind would survive- and the earth would abide until his eventual return. Looking back, writing in the first person was very effective. The final chapter is a beautiful and fitting ending.","I don't think I've ever read a book where the author has done more research than Stewart has done for this one. Not only did he have to do all that research, but he had to sit down and think things through: the rise and fall of ants, the mountain lions running out of food in the mountains, the sheep being lost. It was truly amazing. It also brought to light several things that would and would not happen if man were gone. Some of them are bad and some are good. Stewart gives a fair, unbiased (and likely acurate) picture of an Earth where most humans have suddenly dissappeared.","I found the premise of the book interesting and, for the most part, it was well executed. However, the characters' passivity and lack of ambition is very frustrating. The people who survived the plague seem to have lost the will to achieve! Stewart seems to deliberately portray all characters except Ish and Joey as somewhat limited, despite the fact that they actually contribute more to the continued survival of the community that the \"smart one\". Ish seems content to just go along and then regret that things haven't advanced. Ish doesn't ever seem to gain any understanding that he could have taken the initiative to broaden the scope of the community. Even in the context of the time the book was written, the women are treated as objects. There is no indication of deep thought or emotion from any of them.","I first read this book when I was a teenager and read it again last week (30 years later.) I was surprised at how much I remembered from it (I have completely forgotten books I read 6 months ago!)Of course the book is dated, it was written over 50 years ago and of course technology and social attitudes have changed. Of course the main character is flawed and of course we think we could all have done better, but wouldn't fiction be boring if every character were perfect?I loved the descriptions (in italics) of the breakdown of civillisation, about how plants and animals evolve when \"man\" dissappears.I've looked at some of the reviews for this book and am not surprised that most enlightened readers have given this book 5 stars. Neither am I surprised to see the occasional reader give it one star and to read their vehement reviews. These show that the book has worked and all its readers have strong opinions about it.","This book is with out a doubt one of the best I have ever read. Stewart portrays the end of our world, as we know it and tells the story of a man's need to survive in a world he no longer knows and trusts. This novel is not one of action and amazing death defying feats, but one of a man's introspective thoughts and of the will to live in a world that has been brought down by it's own ignorance and naivet&eacute;. This book is like a huge juicy red stake, there is almost too much meat to handle. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to think, and think seriously about what it means to be human!","A must read for fans of apocalyptic fiction. Even though it was published in 1949 nothing about the book seems dated. It deserves its ranking (by David Pringle) as one of the 100 best Sci Fi novels of all time.","I read Earth Abides the first time over 35 years ago. It is one of the few books that genuinely presents an &quot;end of civilization&quot; as we know it and does it well without a lot of fanfare. This is a discriptive story that I plan to read again.","A friend lent me this book many years ago. I loved it. But I forgot the title and author and when I recently wanted to reread it no one was able to help me. I searched and searched for it to no avail. Finally someone on a sci fi newsgroup was able to help me. This book is fascinating. It is one of my all time favorites. The author has an incredible imagination and you really believe this is what would happen if civilization were to die off. It is so full of vivid details and really makes you think.","This is a book everyone should read; a book worthy of being read over and over during a lifetime. I've read it twice and will probably read it several more times. The subject of a disastrous plague almost wiping out civilization is written in such a way that it's entirely believable. It's fascinating to see how Mr. Stewart's characters face survival. The very last part of the book is a bit confusing, but then life viewed from the point of a very old person may be very confusing.","I throroughly enjoyed reading The Earth Abides because it compelled me to consider what motivations there are for the individual to continue living. I felt the most interesting part of the book was the notion that the individual must actively define what direction his life is to take, the setting of the story added to the importance of this decision and entertained different options and the validity of those decisions.","I read this for a geography class in college. Boy, what a downer. Think Little House on the Prairie meets Mad Max, it's that skewed and contorted. Moments of trying to rebuild are perpetually dashed. In truth, what we have here is the story of a man trying to recreate the past, and how a world gone wrong prevents him from achieving his dream. He is in essence, powerless to do anything about it for the forces against him are nature itself.I do not recommend this book unless you like to read about characters who have no hope whatsoever. I think the one plus is that it's set in the San Francisco Bay Area, so there's a kind of tangibleness to it from this reader.Beyond that, I should've trashed or donated this thing ages ago.","This is one of the great books of the 20th Century. Unfortunately, a poor job was done producing it for Kindle. It seems to me that the print edition was scanned using Optical Character Recognition software and not proofed. It is full of misspellings and incorrect words due to the software limitations. If Amazon expects us to pay for this, they should make some effort to be sure that their product is correct!","The start of this novel was magical for me - so engrossing and so convincing. But then it descends into the comfortable and the suburban. Is this the fate of all human communities? More disappointing was the ugliness of some decisions made by the community - and for me these were far from inevitable or even justifiable. These were presaged on p132 of the SF Masterworks edition - '... except for Evie, the half-witted one, who should never be allowed to have children.' How attitudes have changed since 1949 when this book was written!","This book is about what is wrong with us as humans. The beginning of the book is very interesting as the main character, drives around the country to see what is left in the aftermath of the disease that has wiped out most of the population. After that the book goes downhill. The characters are not that likable. The children are brats, and the adults lack the conviction to make them better people. The items which are in the story aren't realistic (it is very unlikely that gas would not be usable after 20+ years even if stored well), and overall the story just wasn't very interesting to me.","Was disappointed in this book. Expected there to be more action and survivors to be more aggressive in making a better life for themselves. In my opinion people would not act this way in a disaster. They would try to make things better.","This is one of my favorite books of all time and one of the few books that I can re-read. Oddly enough I almost find at times I want to live in the horrible world that is created in the story. Maybe that says more about me than it does about the book though.","I have read this book several times over the years, I really favor this type of fiction (science?) This book is so well written it has stood up to the test of time, as good as any newer fiction of the same genera. Give this book a chance, you won't be sorry. You don't have to buy it, I saw a couple of copies in my local library, I'll bet most full size librarys have a copy. Happy reading.","I loved this book from front to back. Its a beautiful story with characters you can invest in. I have passed it around to many friends and they agree its moving.","This book stands the test of time! A great survival/end of the world book that entertains as much as WWZ (without zombies). Like \"I Am Legend\", Earth Abides tells a great tale of survival of a lone man on earth (without vampires). Love the progression/deterioration of the man made world described here as well as how society evolves. Epic in scope this book covers an entire lifetime, not just a few months or years. I've read this several times and will again one day I'm sure.","Apparently, Amazon shows when a book was last published in the details section, but not when the work was first published. Earth Abides was written in the 40s or 50s.It's an interesting read, but coming with 21st century sensibilities, with ideas of the horrifying chaos and violence should civilization fall from the likes of 2012 (the movie) or Stephen King's The Stand, Earth Abides seems very pastoral and unrealistic. I won't spoil it with too much detail, but two examples are 1) one character is able to drive from California to New York after 99% of humanity had perished. Wouldn't the roads be full of abandoned cars? 2) There's no horrifying killings, rapes, cannibalism, robbery, diseases among the survivors ... something that we know does happen when authority breaks down from real wars in Africa and elsewhere, but in this novel, the only dangers are from failing electricity and running water.I'm not being fair. Stewart is probably reflecting the more naive era of the 1940s or 50s. The book does flow very nicely and I especially LOVE the very nostalgic and melancholic last few chapters of the book.","I first read this book nearly 40 years ago, and loved it. I go back and re-read it about once per decade, and I never tire of it. This was the first &quot;post-disaster&quot; novel, and in some ways still the best. Because it was written in 1949 it's a bit dated in some ways, but the human element is so strong that it still holds your interest; you really CARE about the characters! One of my all-time favorites!","Recently I took it upon myself to read the twelve books describing end of the world scenarios that are being recommended by Amazon in one of its lists. Of the twelve that I read, this is by far my favourite book. George Stewart wrote a story that is both believable and entertaining. In fact, with only a few minor historical references to culture in the 1940's, one could easily think that this book was written yesterday. I regret that the other books written by Stewart are not widely available. I think he's an amazing writer. Buy and read this book. You will not regret your selection.","Though it feels a little dated having been written over four decades ago, &quot;Earth Abides&quot; deserves its place with great 1950s era end-of-the world books like &quot;On the Beach&quot; and &quot;Day of the Triffids.&quot; The scenario is similar to the one Stephen King used in &quot;The Stand&quot; though the plague wipes out a much larger number of people and there is little spiritualism here. What affected me most was the latter part which shows the years passing in the life of the main survisor. I rarely get emotional while reading, but this story did it to me.","Global plague vectored through air travel has beenfeatured in recent films, television specials, andthe news. Set between the European Black Death ofthe late 1600s and this decade's African Ebola,Earth Abides deals with the hope, struggles, andresignation of modern-day plague survivors. Withfewer than one percent of the world's populationsurviving, how would you fare? What wisdom wouldyou pass on to those younger than you? The Centerfor Disease Control intimates that world-wideplague is more a question of When, rather than If.So... how do we begin the day after?Over the years, I've read this provocative bookseveral times, and have enjoyed it more each time.For those who enjoy Crichton's works(Jurassic Park, Congo, or Eaters of the Dead),Earth Abides is a rare find. Kay O'Cullane.","Stewart did an excellent job of putting your hand on thehammer! Classic tale of &quot;What if I were the last man onearth?&quot; Best read out loud at least twice in your lifetime.","I dont write too many reviews any more and I dont want to make this into a flame session but let me get this right Corie (from your review).The book is literally about the last man on earth, and you're indifferent to the character's guarded and self preserving manner. I think you are completely out of sync with the theme, let alone the character. This is a brutally honest portrayal of a human being (with all his short comings) in the wake of oblivion. Not a butterfly in the midst of smoke. It's a reactionary tale, one of struggle and survival. You seem to see it as moment for liberation and righteousness. If anything Corie, you have imposed yourself on this character, in the same vain you speak of.This is the individual, warts and all, and merely hating him does not render this book yucky.As for the racial tone that you claim, as quoted by Powell Timothy \"...its revolutionary (for the time) treatment of racial issues was particularly powerful in the mid-20th century when the book was published, and influenced many contemporary artists, most famously Jimi Hendrix. \"Earth Abides\" was Hendrix's favorite novel, and inspired some of the songs on his first album\"Perhaps, if some of you better relate to decisive characters, you should watch the post apocalyptic TV soap drama, 'Jericho' instead. There you will find your cliche depictions of heroes and villians.","Okay let me tell you how I really feel. WOW!!!I hesitated to buy this book after hearing it did not have much end of the world violence, no undead or lots of dead and has a more clean antiseptic air about it. They were correct but what it lacked in that area was more then made up in the quality and depth of the characters and the uncanny ability of the main character Ish to pull you into the story and carry you along in his experiences. I would compare Earth Abides to a movie from the 30's or 40's where there was more dialog and depth as opposed to many of today's films/books based more on spectacular visual effects and lots of gore but lacking in most every other area and are soon forgotten.(And I like some of those books and movies).Earth Abides has a much stronger human touch or bond as you see Ish from a young man dealing with a plaque that wiped most of humanity away and his final death at old age. What transpired between youth and death for Ish is something I guarantee you will remember for the rest of your life. I have read numerous Sci Fi books and rarely has any reached a level comparable to Earth Abides. This book is a keeper that I will definitely read again in the future.","This book reaches across time and avoids the technology trap. It hits home in many circumstances and is an excellent read. I liked its energy and symbolism. It avoids being grim and actually gives you hope for a disastrous future.","A worldwide virus has killed off nearly all the world's population. Ish starts exploring a world with no rules and few people. He finds some other people and they form &quot;The Tribe&quot; to restart their civilasation. Interesting book, and it actually survives pretty well considering how long ago it was written. There are very few passages in the book that date it significantly.","Earth Abides by George Stewart is one of many post-apocalyptic novels written during the height of the Cold War. However it is quieter and more introspective than most of its peers, something made evident by the manor of disaster that devastates mankind in the novel. Instead of a nuclear inferno, a viral plague almost eradicates humanity. Isherwood &quot;Ish&quot; Williams is trapped in an isolated cabin recovering from a snakebite when the epidemic is unleashed. When he heals and ventures outward, he discovers the near extinction of his species and begins a search for others who immune to the disease.That section is interesting but Earth Abides becomes a truly outstanding novel when Ish discovers others and they found a new society. Stewart takes a sociological approach to this development. He gives a fascinating account of a community completely isolated from other communities and a generation living in a Garden-of-Eden-state, completely isolated from its own past. One of the novel's best moments occurs when an untrustworthy visitor comes to the area and Ish and the other elders must decide what action to take. Their decision will surprise you. Both in the post-apocalyptic genre and the field of science fiction in general, Earth Abides is a gem.","Earth Abides is a fantastic book. When I noticed it was written in 1949 I was a bit concerned, but it was not dated at all. The simple synopsis of the story is that everyone on the planet dies in a plague, except for a few hundred people. The story follows Ish, who was a ecologist or something and is now forced into the role of designing plans for rebuilding civilization. Along with a few others he meets and adds to his community, the book follows Ish's &quot;tribe&quot; for about 60 years. During that time the human build infrastructure deteriorates along with Ish's hopes of quickly restoring an active civilization. I would like to especially credit Stewart for including two long chapters he calls &quot;Quick Years&quot;, where he moves ahead 10 or 20 years. A less confident author would fill that 20 years with the same nonsense over and over making this a much slower and longer book.","It is a mystery how anyone could read this book and feel it is poorly written. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is a heart-breaking, gut wrenching , beautifully written novel. The only fault I had was its' length. I wanted it to go on and on. That is the highest praise I can give any book. Stephen King's Stand is a very good novel, too, but doesnt hit the emotional chords as well as this one does.","&quot;Earth Abides&quot; deals with the collapse of society after a plague has killed nearly everyone in the world. Isherwood (Ish) Williams was in the mountains when this happened, so he was spared the trauma of seeing everyone die around him.&quot;Earth Abides&quot; is probably one of the more realistic apocalypse books. A plague is tidier and more envionmentally friendly than a nuclear holocaust so the world was quite lucky. The survivors who band together are just ordinary people. No military strategists, scientific experts or specialists. No engineers or architects. They have to cope with life in a world without medical services, police, government, or farmers.Over the years, 20th century life is slipping away and Ish's tribe can't bring any of it back. Decades later San Francisco is a jungle and Ish is the last of the old race. The new race are illiterate hunters but they are also a more decent people. They treat the animals as equals, they are happier and have none of the hangups that affected 20th century society before the plague. They'll never know how to split the atom, build missiles, or damage the ozone layer.Because history tends to go round in circles I don't think civilization really died after the plague. It just went to sleep. One day it will come back, maybe in a few centuries. Something new and better. A rejuvinated world, fresh and clean.&quot;Earth Abides&quot; was a good book. It probably wouldn't work as a movie, though. Not after the criticism that &quot;The Postman&quot; got. But I thought Kevin Bacon would be good as Ish. I'm not sure who would play the other characters.","I was really looking forward to this book, and was left feeling really disappointed. I have now read all of what I consider the \"big-4\" of 50's PA literature, I found Alas Babylon and \"Canticle for Leibowicz\" excellent, \"on the beach\" overly depressing and unrealistic (but I was 16 when I read it so my opinion might have changed by now) but Earth Abides left me un-impressed.I thought the central character was so devoid of likeability and compassion it made him entirely unrealistic, in fact he came across as some sort of post-apocalyptic Daily Mail reader who spend a significant proportion of the first part of the book traversing America deciding if anyone was \"good-enough\" to share his planned new civilisation, but found the survivors too emotional, too provincial, too poor, too black, too uneducated etc etc. \"Ish\" would have benefited from a good punch in the face, and the only character who might have offered to give him one was executed for bragging about his carnal adventures whilst drunk.His long suffering and dignified wife Em, also had to make the startling confession that she was of mixed race and was beside herself with gratitude that Ish didn't then and there string her up from a nearby tree (like Charlie).The pace of the story is languid and the descriptions interesting, but for me, the entire book was held back by the attitudes and small mindedness of the central character.I am generally not a fan of the \"marauding biker gangs\" type PA style but in this case, if the Toecutter had rocked up at Ishs' house and decapitated him with some sort of boomerang, then the community and post-plague America would have been done a great service.Sadly, the attitudes of Ish probably just reflected those extant in America in the 50's but that means that the story has dated particularly badly, and although Alas Babylon also suffers from the same malady, the central character in that book is much more human and flawed and this makes that book a more engaging read.I am currently reading \"Summer of the Apocalypse\" which borrows some elements from Earth Abides, but is a much better fit for me in terms of what I like in PA books.","I first read this book when I was twelve and lived very near Berkeley. It was the first time I had seen the word \"ecologist\". The book has stayed with me for the last 59 years. I have reread it many times, and have used it as a basis for many earth sciences classes. While it is in a sense, apocalyptic, it is not preachy, or sensational, but a gentle, detailed reminder that in this day of climate change, it is not earth that is in danger, but our own and related species. That Ish, the protagonist , is an observer rather than a charismatic leader, gives us, as readers, a chance to observe with him the deeply meaningful theme that, \"men come and go, but Earth abides. One of my all time favorite reads.","Man has passed and what remains are the things built to sustain us; our cities, bridges, highways, grocery stores, street signs, power plants and dams, parked cars and canned peaches. These things do not simply disappear. Yet with enough time much will be lost to the weeds, the earth will take it back and intermingle our fallen silver coins with the pebbles of the riverbank.***As one of the founding novels of apocalyptic fiction, \"Earth Abides\" is not only a tale of what comes after global disaster but what is means to be human in the simplest and grandest sense. Although written in 1949, it continues to be praised decades later and for good reason, it is a captivating book that reaches beyond the genre of science fiction and into the heart of humanity. On the surface, \"Earth Abides\" is the tale of Isherwood Williams' survival yet it such an expansive novel that the tale of one man becomes that of all mankind.In our contemporary world we tend to forget (or deny) that individuals are entangled within society for better or worse, but the truth is that we cannot be separate from our culture, our history, and our way of life. I found this novel to be a mindful mediation on what it means to be a part of a community and a sort of Anthropological study of civilization.I was surprised and actually relived to find there were no zombies, no riots, no constant struggle to fight hordes of panic stricken survivors, but a rather calm and quiet end to the human race as it once existed. To be sure it seemed quaint; this notion of a peaceful ending in spite of sudden pandemic and inevitable death, but it was surprisingly optimistic without being wholly nave. Many people would likely continue to follow the rules of society even without the enforcers of law for a while, but with time, these things would matter less and less. And despite many who choose to do no harm to their neighbors, there will always be some men who pose a danger to his peers in malice or self-preservation.","I was surprised how well \"Earth Abides\" held up as a post-apocalyptic novel being read in 2010, even though it was published in 1949 - over 60+ years ago. It was remarkably current, in my opinion. Yes, there were a few politically incorrect/outdated views on women, race and retardation - based on this day and age. But if you read it based on the reality of 1949, some of the ideas put forward by Stewart were actually ahead of his time.This novel is not an action packed, shoot em up, zombies control the earth PA novel. It is a character study on how different people or small groups of people react or shut down in a disaster. And the way they act and react may not be what we would consider to be the best - for the individuals involved or for the salvation of mankind. But I can actually see the events in \"Earth Abides\" happening. Scary to think of but imaginable. This book stands the test of time.","I ordered the audio book based on an article that called it \"one of the best post-apocalyptic novels\". I expected a plot that would detail the heroic efforts of the protagonist to survive and thrive in the world after most of the human population dies. I did not expect the protagonist and his band of survivors to do the obvious - to be scavengers upon the bones of civilization, and to give up or not even try to keep or advance civilization's progress up to that point. The slow realization that the path of least resistance would be the course of action was one of the most depressing and poignant moments I have had in considering the future of humans on this planet. I felt I was personally witnessing the de-evolution of mankind.Of particular interest to me was that the author, George R. Stewart, chose to use a virus as the vehicle that killed most of the inhabitants, not the obvious nuclear holocaust. The fact that atomic bombs were capable of killing off the bulk of mankind was still very fresh in the minds of his readers in the late 1940's. Viruses as agents of destruction seem to be one of the very real swords hanging over our heads today, making us relate to this book even more.","George Stewart's \"Earth Abides\" is regarded as a classic of the overcrowded post-apocalyptic genre, and for good reason. But the book achieved classic status only because its post-apocalyptic setting is a secondary feature of the narrative.Stewart didn't write an adventure story about a loner/survivor who must fend off attacks from marauding mutants. In fact, given the context, there is surprisingly little action at all.Instead, \"Earth Abides\" puts you inside the mind of the main character, Ish, for an extended meditation on the nature, specifically the frailty, of human existence.Stewart ranges far and wide, if not deeply, into an astonishing array of issues, from the personal to the universal. That said, there is a core idea, which the title expresses in part:Earth abides. The dude does not.It is a pagan formulation: Earth 1, Humanity 0. And while I would put it another way, I'm at least grateful that Stewart made me think. Who needs marauding mutants?","This book has been torpedoed by some readers because it isn't \"The Stand.\" While \"the Stand,\" is one of my favorite books, what happens after the world is wiped out by plague becomes highly supernatural. Much as I like that, Stewart shows a much more realistic side of what would happen to whatever few survivors this world might have if a plague took most of us out of circulation. Any possible community would be small, and battle dogs, ants, rats, diseases, and the like. The characters here are never to be forgotten--Ish, Em, Joey and Charlie above all, and the plot stays with you long after the book is finished. I read it in the '80s when I worked on a book assembly line. Imagine my delight that it is now available again. This is up there with \"Alas Babylon,\" and just a bit less depressing than \"On the Beach.\"","Stewart's Earth Abides has long been considered a classic in the sci-fi genre and a classic apocalyptic novel (it even helped to inspire Stephen King's The Stand). And it is no wonder why. Stewart has a highly believable, excellently written story here. Though it does lose something in the the third part of the book, when Ish is an old man. One you should definately pick up.","I think I first read this book when I was about fourteen, and it made a powerful impression on me then, so much so that I could still remember almost the entire story some forty years later. But, given that youthful impressions are sometimes not all that accurate, I decided to re-read this and see if it is really as good as my memory said. It is.The scenario is simple: what would happen if a new virus suddenly wipes out almost everyone? And this is no ordinary disease, as the fatality rate is incredibly high, leaving (at most) perhaps one person in 100,000 alive. With this as a starting point, Stewart looks at his new world though the eyes of Isherwood Williams, who is something of a loner, intellectual in outlook, an observer, rather than a doer. This outlook stands him in good stead in the immediate aftermath of the great die-off, as it gives him a reason to live, to observe just how the Earth will react to the sudden removal of that pesky, environment-changing species called man. And reaction there is: ants, rats, dogs, cattle, cats, wheat, corn - each has its fortunes drastically impacted. Many of these changes are detailed in some interstitial material that is told from an omniscient viewpoint, very reminiscent of the similar technique Steinbeck used in The Grapes of Wrath, and perhaps these sections are just as powerful as Steinbeck's, though they don't have quite the great prose-poetry that Steinbeck had. By detailing these changes in this manner, Stewart makes his scenario both highly believable and very immediate.But Stewart's main focus is what happens to the very few people that are left. Ish eventually finds some other survivors, most especially the lady who will become his wife, Em, and here we find some buried social commentary that probably made this book quite controversial when it was first published in 1949, as Em is not white, a point made very subtly and never directly stated, as one of the clear messages here is that race, looked at from the standpoint of long-term survivability, is of absolutely no consequence.Another point of departure for this work from the standard disaster scenario is that there is no world-saving hero; mankind cannot get back on its feet in short order and re-establish civilization, and that the great majority of survivors would necessarily live off the leavings of the old civilization, for the simple reason that it is far easier to open a can of tomatoes than grow your own. That this same attitude of doing the minimum to survive would carry over into other aspects of post-disaster living, so that there would be little or no effort to teach children how to read or fix some of civilization's infrastructure as it slowly fails, such as electrical power or water supplies, is perhaps a debatable point, but Stewart's depiction makes this very logical and believable. Right alongside of this portrayed attitude is what do people do when there no longer is any `law': what is right and wrong and how do people cope with actions by some that threaten the survivability of the Tribe? The answer Stewart shows to this problem may disturb some people, but it strikes at the heart of the whole concept of `for the good of the many' and what personal moral responsibility is.Some have commented that this book is `dated', and there is some of this, as tube radios and phonograph turntables show just where technology was at the time of publication, but any serious reader will quickly realize that the specifics of the technology are immaterial to the thrust of this work. And perhaps somewhat ironically, there is one item detailed here that is as current as tomorrow's headlines, when Ish pulls down a book from the University shelves which details imminent climate change (keep in mind when this written!) and decides that this, too, is irrelevant to his current needs - the climate will be whatever it is, and mankind will just have to live with it.The last section of this book paints a very powerful picture of just how gods, legends, and social mores become ingrained in a society. Perhaps it's not the prettiest picture of where mankind is headed or how well he'll deal with problems, but it is remarkably plausible and will produce strong feelings of melancholy, despair, and (perhaps) subdued pride.A remarkable work which avoids just about all the pitfalls of typical post-apocalyptic works, and has a great deal to say about just what makes man man and what is truly relevant to the daily business of living.---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)","A virus wipes out 99.9% of the population, leaving the few stragglers left to figure out how to survive, organize (or not), etc. Don't be fooled into thinking that because this book was published in 1949 that it somehow won't be 'with it'. It's pretty well thought out, both in terms of what happens to the people AND everything else (dogs, cats, cattle, crops - things which other authors might leave out entirely), and in a departure (which I won't reveal here) from the usual 'we'll survive and things will eventually return to normalcy' plot so often present in this type of book.","Stewart's novel begins with a science fiction premised used by Stephen King in The Stand -- a virus quickly wipes out most of the world's population -- but from that point on, the two books (and others that have used this idea) are completely dissimilar. Stewart has little interest in the plague itself, and it is covered in a short part of the book. Rather, his interest is in how people react to being deprived of modern civilization. For years, his characters try to keep things going by teaching their children to read, and keeping memories of the old world alive. However, the drastically changed circumstances of their children's lives make this impossible, and the small group of survivors descend to a hunter-gatherer civilization.Stewart also addresses the question of what would ordinary people do who find themselves deprived of the protections of the law, and thus having to make their own difficult choices.Those who read this book expecting a typical science fiction novel will be disappointed. Stewart uses science fiction themes to explore significant issues in much the same way that George Orwell did in 1984. An excellent novel.","Apparently many of the reader-reviewers are science fiction or horror fans and thus compare Stewart's novel with that genre. Those readers are not likely to appreciate the ideas expressed in &quot;Earth Abides&quot;. Stewart was one of the first fiction writers to deal with ecology and human's place in the balance of nature and his extrapolations from anthropological thought of that period (1940's) are exceptional. It seems that many of the readers, without realizing it, got so caught up in the novel that they criticise the protagonist's character flaws as though he were a &quot;real&quot; human wanting him to be &quot;more insightful&quot; and less of a pedantic man. Those flaws appear to make him more authentic.Although classified as science fiction, the term speculative fiction is a better fit. It is interesting that the period of time covered, approximately 1948, to the present day, and although it was written in the late 1940's, it is still fresh today. Looking back, if there had been a catastrophe at that time, we would very likely today be at the point where the novel ends. A hundred years from now the novel is likely to be a classic and hopefully be on a shelf not labeled &quot;Science Fiction.&quot;","I know this is considered a classic, but, in my opinion, it does not pass the test of time. None of the characters, including the narrator, Ish, is engaging, and the passivity of the survivors is hard to accept. I don't need zombies to make PA fiction exciting, but reading about survivors who basically just live as if nothing has changed, happy to eat canned food is dull and depressing.","Well what can I say - if you want a book that will make you think about it not only whilst you are reading it but for a long time afterwards, then this is the book for you. The story is great and I thought Ish's character was great too - I know some people didn't like him (including my husband) - but I think that is just the point. He is a young man with little experience who thinks he knows everything because he has been to university, but really doesn't know that much at all. Sure he's not perfect but who is! He does the best he can and whilst we may not always agree, at least he is a believeable character. It has been a long time since I have read a book and thought \"wow\" when I was reading it and wanted to debate it for hours afterwards. The only other memorable books I can think of are \"Wild Swans\", \"Watership Down\" and \"Day of the Triffids\". This beats all of them! I followed \"Earth Abides\" with \"Timescape\" - which made me appreciate even more just how good \"Earth Abides\" really is.","\"...and the government of the United States of America is herewith suspended, except in the District of Columbia, as of the emergency...\"With those ominous words begins a classic tale of the end of human civilization. \"Ish\" (a graduate student whose given name is Isherwood Williams) is the barely tolerable protagonist who survives a rattlesnake bite (and possibly some strange infection) only to leave the forest and find a world of ghost towns. As Ish discovers, while he was in seclusion, engaged in fieldwork for his thesis, a virulent plague broke out worldwide and eliminated virtually every other human being from the face of the earth. Instead of descending into a drunken madness like one of the few survivors he meets, Ish roadtrips across the country looking for a vestige of the learned civilization he remembers. Alas, his quest comes up empty-handed, for, as he discovers, not many people have survived the plague, and those who did are (understandably) not too interested in higher education or high culture, preferring instead to focus on subsistence and maintaining their sanity. Along the way he picks up a loyal friend in the form of a dog, and finally returns to the Bay Area of California, where he meets a group of survivors and sets out to re-establish some kind of human community. In the second half of the novel, we follow the growth of this community and are faced with Ish's growing apprehension about humanity's future. Much to his chagrin, the aspects of civilization he prizes so much--music and art appreciation, reading and literature, mathematics and philosophy, etc.--seem to have no place in this new world where humans are once again a part of the natural order and not her proud conquerors.While the novel itself is quite a good read, filled with interesting speculative insights into human life after the collapse of modern civilization, Ish provides an aggravating example of the 1940s American white male ivory tower academic (his character's qualities definitely date the novel). When he encounters black survivors in the South, he muses about the possibilities of exploiting them and establishing his own little fiefdom. He continually considers his cohorts in the new community as his intellectual inferiors, even as they manage to carve out a new life in the face of this overwhelming calamity while he reads his books. That he spends more time worrying about the restoration of high civilization than about the very real issues of day-to-day survival that they face was also incredibly infuriating. Ish is at his most distasteful when he contemplates his son Joey, a boy whose sole worth seems to be the fact that he is bright and can read. Somehow, though, in spite of all his character flaws, Isherwood Williams ' arrogance and detachment are finally overcome by his circumstances, and he has, if not a complete change of heart, then at least an acceptance of the reality that \"men go and come, but earth abides.\"","This post apocalyptic book starts off strong with somewhat of a new twist on the traditional post-collapse civilization, as told by one graduate student and his struggle with a life after modern conveniences are gone. He is an observer kept alive as the second wave of deaths wash over the world by a mere need to observe and discover. I'll never forget reading as if with him while he waited for electric power to finally fail. The lights dim slightly and with this realization he waits up as a long time friend passes into oblivion. Several of the concepts are quite dated (the copy I read was re-released in the 70s but still referred to household items long since out of date and probably belonged in the original publication from '49).The main character is faced as being the only intellectual left in a small band of survivors he later deems \"The Tribe.\" This is the placement of the majority of the book and faces the questions of what humans would do with so much time on their hands? How they would adapt to a life with everything they need laying about them, but no deadlines to push them to reestablish a civilized world? It also conicals several things other books leave out, such as the adoption of odd superstitions about \"Americans\" by children who have never known a life with organized government or life outside of their small Tribe. I would give this part of the book a higher score, but the later portion fell short of my expectations and the standards set by the rest of the work.As the book continued it became quite redundant and predictable, and though I had high hopes the book would somehow redeem itself and return to it's previous glory, I was left disappointed. If you are looking for a book with a strong resolution upon completion, this is not a book for you. While I am glad I finished it (the first half was quite good), and several major problems were resolved, a larger picture of what would happen with the passing of the main character was left unsaid (though a general idea was obvious and alluded to several times). This portion of the book brought down the overall rating I could give.I would recommend this book as an easy read with an interesting take on the traditional end-of-the-world concept.","Earth Abides from George R Stewart is a good book about what would happen if suddenly the entire world population, except for a few, would die from a disease. As such, the book is remarkable as one of the first post-apocalyptic novels in existence (dating from 1949). And it is a very well thought through one too. Aiming for realism, exploring the various effects and problems the survivors would face, it renders the many successive post-apocalyptic stories as merely unrealistic popcorn stories. However, don't expect the story to \"draw you in\". The events are typically kind of boring, and even though there is a distinct set of characters, they never really develop. Further, the writing style is not always really gripping, but rather unexciting. Also the dated moral reflections might be a let down for some, but I suppose that is mainly caused by the time the book is written.The book details a number of time periods: just after the epidemic, 5 years later, 20 years later, and 50 or 60 years later. The time in between is sketched very roughly. The story centers on Ish, a survivor of the mysterious epidemic. Ish is an academic, working on his (PhD?) thesis in Biology. We learn later that if the epidemic would not have struck that Ish would probably end up as a professor (like the writer). Ish is, apparently, the only 'thinker' left on the world, and all the people he meets are about (or under) average on IQ and ideas, but not necessarily in other practical matters. Ish is an observer, not really a natural leader, and he does his best to plan a safe way for the remaining people towards a new civilization. However, it becomes clear, that even though Ish knows a lot and has many skills, that a lot of work and ideas hardly influence the people in his community and that he fails on many great planned things, even though he also has some unexpected success with small but eventually rather important things.The good part of the book, what makes it a classic, is that it explores most issues you can think off about what would happen if such an epidemic would occur. It explores the psychological effect in the beginning, the scavenging of the stores for existing goods, the mingling of very different average people in a group, the effect on the rest of the ecology by the sudden disappearance of men, the effect of aging on materials, infrastructure and goods, the way the average people would face these changes, (small) group interactions, diseases, unnecessary skills (e.g. reading), the automatic development of groups of people, and the limited effect of the ideas of the intellectual few (maybe dealing with some of the writer's own frustrations). And probably I forgot a few explored ideas as well.However, the book is not perfect, and not a classic in the sense of some Heinlein, Clarke or Asimovs that I have read. Some flaws: characters are rather stereotypical, the main character seems to be a bit thick and single minded at many points (irritating sometimes), all characters have a great lack of initiative and many times things just stay as they are, but also not all ideas are fully (satisfyingly) worked out. Also some logical plot holes exist, and timescales of things happening seem to be bended a bit to fit with the lifetime of the main character.However, in spite of the many small flaws I shortly pointed out, I can still recommend the book. It is not for everyone, and certainly not for people that look for a really exciting story, but the discussed ideas and the thoroughness in which many of those are explored (making it a kind of hard-scifi book), combined with the historical value of this book as a very early post-apocalyptic book make this book really valuable and read-worthy. If you are not immediately letdown by its flaws and if you are interested in idea-books and speculative fiction, I would certainly give this one a try.","I have been searching for this book for the past 35 years. It was a story I have never forgotten since reading it in my teens. I applaude the publisher who has reissued it. Can't wait to read it again and share it with my friends.","Misinterpretations abide, it seems, when it comes to this book. This &quot;disaster&quot; novel merely uses the disease plague scenario as a backdrop to explore human nature. There are many subtle examples here of how individuals develop as adults, how everything people know and believe is dependent on their own life experience and frame of reference. Most of all this is about the myriad of seemingly small things that people take for granted every day and do not even notice, seemingly unimportant things which are really the foundation of society and culture. Here the characters are stripped of all their artificial interests, and are left with only that foundation. The genius of this story is that it will leave you wondering just how independent your own thoughts and views are. There might be many reasons people go in the various directions they go in life, the least of which have to do with independent choices. This book is much more than a disaster novel, it is a fascinating look at sociology in action. And always in the background, amidst all the human trials and tribulations, Earth and non-human life continue as they always have, oblivious to human superiority. Hence the title, and the ultimate humbling message.","One of the better disaster novels to come out in this century, Stewart essentially takes the Robinson Crusoe point of view and applies it to (then) contemporary America, having a plague wipe out most people, even though the rationale that it's because people are too numerous is a little on the shaky side, he should have just taken the Solaris route and said he didn't know. Would have made things more interesting. However, in itself the novel is an excellent and very realistic portrayal of people struggling to live after everyone else is gone. Nobody has any real need for ambition since everything they could ever want is right there. The main character is the only one who can think ahead far enough to see that the children have to be taught so that civilization can come back but when the book ends it's unclear if that will ever happen. The point I think is to show that we're not better than the animals when it comes to civilization and that our intelligence doesn't necessarily make us better, an old point, to say the least but one that should be stated often. Evolutionarily the human race just got lucky and as quick as we rose (a million years isn't that long really when you figure the age of the planet) we can fall just as fast. And the thing that makes Earth Abides so more real is that civilization isn't restarted, to have that happen would seem unreal, a small group of people does not a civilization make and to have them turn into some sort of super-community to go across the US and return society to what it was before would just seem unrealistic and that would have ruined the point of the book. The way it's written now is much more interesting because even though it's so depressing, it feels that much more likely and thus in the end is more satisfying.","I don't think that any of the reviewers have mentioned this, but I think that there are important details in understanding the book. George R Stewart was an English professor (at UC Berkeley), but he has a real strong feeling for the land, landscape, weather and nature. He wrote about storms, the Donner Party, and other geographical subjects, especially relevant to California.The story is set in the East Bay, and has many identifiable locations and views .that add a certain warmth and familiarity to the story, even after six decades. The tribe lived in easily identifiable Oakland/Berkeley hills of the late 1949's.Ish is initially bitten by a rattlesnake in the Sierra, which would have been familiar to many in Berkeley (then and now)-the mountains, not the rattlesnake. He has respectful and loving depictions of the UC Berkeley Library, which Ish needs to break into- Stewart would have used the library regularly. He described the natural changes in animals and plants that would be expected in the hills. He describes a fire which occurs across the Bay, in San Francisco and the northern Peninsula. Finally, the last scene has the tribe walking across the Bay Bridge. That is the same bridge that exists today (although it will be replaced in a few years).BUT the most important thing is his name. Ish (\"Isherwood\") really stands for Ishi., the famous Indian survivor studied by Kroeber at Berkeley in the early 1900's. That is a well-known piece of Berkeley lore, and Stewart was certainly familiar with it. ... Ish, the last survivor of a dead tribe....","A virus wipes out most of humanity within a couple of days. I've read many scifi novels that begin this way, and most of them spend the majority of the subsequent pages describing the ensuing social chaos in dystopian detail. Earth Abides takes a completely different tack. There is no swaggering little Napoleon lording it over a tiny flock of survivors--there are simply too few people left. There is very little deprivation--people can comfortably survive for years on the leftover canned goods in every corner store. Indeed, there is very little drama of any kind.This is more of a character study of two entities. One is the protagonist, Ish, an anthropologist by training who sees his role primarily as that of an observer of the slow, inevitable decay of civilization. He makes half-hearted attempts to save vestiges of knowledge but is mostly content to watch what happens to the environment around him. The question of what would happen to the planet itself--along with all the plants and animals--without its human caretakers, is the true core of this novel. I heard Octavia Butler recommend this book as one that inspired her, and now that I have read it, I can see why. Thoughtful and surprisingly gentle, it highlights the gifts possessed even by apparently unremarkable people to make a life out of what they are given, supported always by the ultimate Mother: Earth.","Being a fan of apocalyptic SF (among other things), I ordered this after seeing it on several peoples's lists of the greatest end-of-the-world/post-apocalyptic novels. It tells the story, of Ish Williams, who is one of a handful of survivors of a sudden plague that kills off something like 99.99% of the world's primate poulation. Earth Abides describes, in linear chronological fashion, the subsequent 50 years or so, following Ish who becomes the leader of a small band of survivoirs and eventually the shaman-like last survivior of the pre-plague people.The book was written in 1949 and feels very dated, in terms of dialog, ideas and socio-political themes. There are distinctly (although thinly veneered) anti-technology, elitist and generic christian motifs running rather crudely throughout, all of which turned me off. In a couple of places, the author's science is arguable or just plain wrong, and some of his plot devices (cars that still work after sitting on a lot for decades) feel contrived. All this aside, the writing itself just isn't that good.The main character, Ish is a neurotic misanthrope. No genius himself, Ish is nonetheless an incredible intellectual snob, judging everyone around him including his loving wife, to be of lower intelligence than he. A young (already lonely and alone) graduate student at the beginning of the novel, this remarkably unlikeable character goes on to comment negatively about the intellectual capacities of everyone who comes along in his life, except for one grandson that he deems worthy to become his successor.There is very little action, and many descriptive passages about changes in the earth and its flora and fauna following the disaster. The latter are fairly interesting, but not as interesting or well-researched as more recent works (e.g., After Man: A Zoology of the Future). The novel is unfortunately, not particularly well written. I guess, being written in 1949, one has to award points for originality, but compared to dozens of novels and a number of non-fiction works published since then concerned with the fate of the earth after man is gone, there is not much here that warrants this novel's amazing longevity.I understand how this novel could have been very popular when it was published. I am, however, at a loss to explain this novel's huge popularity and staying power today. That it remains in print 61 years after first publication is astounding to me, as are all the 5-star reviews. Virtually all of the ideas and themes visited have been done better by others who are much better, and more interesting writers. One particularly acute contrast is with James Van Pelt's \"Summer of the Apocalypse\", that I read immediately after \"Earth Abides\". It is far superior in every respect, although a superficial description of each makes them sound very similar. Nevertheless, they could not be more different.I was very disappointed by this \"classic\" and would not recommend it on any level.JM Tepper","A plague wipes out most of humanity, and one man (Isherwood Williams) tries desperately to save a piece of civilization to pass on to the generations of survivors. The first part of the story deals with his survival of the plague, and his journey around the country looking for signs of survivors.He returns to his home (in the Bay area of California) where he finally meets a woman (Emma) whose courage convinces him to start a family, which becomes a 'tribe' as a few other survivors come to join them. He tries to pass on as much knowledge as he can to the children of the tribe, but his efforts are largely in vain as civilization continues to regress. Ultimately he realizes a way to pass on some very basic knowledge to help his descendants in the future.The author does an excellent job of dealing with the plague, the after effects of such a plague on nature, as well as the slow decay of the cities and infrastructure of our civilization. He also describes well drop into a primitive society that would result from the plague. There is also an interesting moral dilemma when the tribe has to deal with a potential threatening outsider who tries to join them.The flaws of this story are few. There are a few sections which clearly take place at roughly the time when the story was published (1949). As a result, some of the references to technology and personalities make those sections of the story feel a bit dated. This only happens a few times though, and doesn't really hurt the story.This book won the first science fiction award given when it won the International Fantasy Award in 1951. In 1987, it rated 28th on the Locus All-Time Poll of All-Time SF Novels, and in 1998 it tied for 41st on the Locus poll of SF Novels written before 1990.","I read Earth Abides and was stunned with what a great book it was. Its attention to detail was unparalleled, its character development was exceptional, and its plot never got dull. Every part of the book was breath-taking, from the opening sentence to the closing words.Stewart wrote Earth Abides in third person and includes italicized background information which helps the book play before the reader much like a movie. Stewart doesn't just tell the reader the story; it is like they can see it for themselves. The reader is left to ponder many comments made by characters, and is allowed to reach conclusions for themselves. The thought provoking way in which Earth Abides is written was my favorite attribute of the book.Some books can be read and enjoyed, but do not really leave a mark on the reader. This one reshaped the way that I view the world. I have read hundreds of books, and consider this perhaps the best I have ever read. In one word, it was &quot;awesome.&quot;","Do you know the joyous feeling you get when you just happen upon a book quite by accident, read just a few chapters of it, and realize that it will be of great signifiance to you? Well, that was my experience with this book! I can't believe that I was not introduced to this book before now. It is with some sadness that I just completed reading it.My degree of connection with the main character, Isherwood Williams (Ish), astounded me; therefore, I must admit that my reaction to this book is quite subjective. It as is though the author looked into my mind and wrote a book about me in a post-apocalyptic world, including my greatest virtues and worst vices. The descriptions of the thoughts, triumphs, failings, joys, and frustrations experienced by the main character are poignantly honest and real. Metaphorically, this story seems to describe, with regard to many things, my existence in this, our so-far non-apocalyptic, world. For example, I find that I constantly struggle to define what I think to be the appropriate balance of individuality and community/state in our world. If you are one who consciously ponders such things or pursues a study of philosophy, I believe that you will view this book as a masterpiece. It just made my top 10, that is sure.I feel that I have gained much in my reading of this book. Mostly, I come away from this reading experience with a renewed feeling of peace and a reassurance in myself and the human spirit. I will no longer, I think, become quite so frustrated with regard to certain things or people in this world.&quot;Am I happy? Yes, I am happy. Things are as they are, and I am part of them.&quot; - Jack, great grandson of Isherwood Williams (Ish), the Last American.","That about sums it up for me. All others on this theme (with the honourable exception of John Wyndham's \"The Day of the Triffids\") are just cheap imitations. Earth Abides is the real thingCivilisation, and some 99.99% of the human race, is gone. The few survivors, all traumatised by what has happened to them (some more obviously than others, but they all are) either just commit suicide, drink themselves to death, live out their lonely lives in some familiar spot, or, as with Ish and his companions, get together into little \"tribes\".Having already read a few reviews, I get the impression that there are few neutrals on this one. You either love it (the majority, including me) or hate it. For me, Earth Abides' big virtue is precisely what some people seem to dislike about it. Its characters are just dead ordinary. Even Ish, the nearest thing to a brain among them, is too passive and contemplative to be more than a titular head. There are no survivalists who have long been waiting for the day; no jacks of all trades, conveniently endowed with all the needed skills, and above all no \"natural leaders\" (aka bullies and control freaks) out to remake the world in their own image. (Perhaps Charlie had some ambitions that way, but fortunately he is bumped off before the question can arise). They are in fact just a bunch of very average or even below-average people, trying to make a life for themselves amidst the ruins of the world. That, I suspect, is pretty much how such an aftermath would really be.Indeed, on considering the matter, I feel Stewart did a really good job of making his characters internally consistent. They are, essentially, the ones who come through the end of the world - and just react with a shrug. \"The human race is almost entirely wiped out, civilisation's gone and we're all back in the Dark Ages. Now what do I do about breakfast?\" Well, to be fair, Ish does throw up in the sink when it finally \"sinks\" in that his parents won't ever be coming home, but that's where it ends. If he ever considers the matter again, we aren't told about it. The other characters take a largely similar attitude. Em apparently had a family pre-Disaster, but never talks about them, while Ezra and the others have even less to say. They just write off their losses and \"move on\".Well, fair enough. That is probably exactly how they need to be in the situation. This attitude is probably what allows them to come through without being driven into insanity and/or suicide. But of course it has consequences. First off, it implies a decided lack of empathy toward fellow beings. Unlike some reviewers, I'm not particularly disturbed at their willingness to hang Charlie, and to at least consider \"mercy killing\" of the retarded Evie. Given such personalities, this is exactly how they would be. Indeed, it says much for their basic decency that they agonise as much as they do over the first decision, and never take the second one at all. Stewart has made his characters act \"in character\", as an author should.Secondly, however helpful this attitude was in seeing them through the immediate aftermath, it is far less so when it's time to think of rebuilding. Having taken the Disaster itself almost in their stride, they are likewise accepting of its aftermath, and generally take only such action as is forced on them by circumstances. The \"Lewis and Clark\" expedition in Year 22 is distinctly exceptional. And Ish's basically solitary disposition stultifies his attempt to educate the children. The only one he can \"reach\" is an academic loner exactly like himself, after whose death he essentially gives up. Stewart has wonderfully portrayed how the virtues which were such a help at the start of the book have now turned into vices.Loooking back on it (I first read the book at age ten) I have some minor gripes. In particular, the Great Disaster itself seems more than a little \"sanitised\", with mankind dying and all the bodies neatly tidied away, during Ish's two-week absence. Somehow, that does not quite carry conviction. Apart from that, however, my only real complaint is that Stewart was content with a single book, when the theme deserved a trilogy at least.Read and enjoy","Anyone who has read Alas, Babylon or Lucifer's Hammer needs to read this also. The premise is a panepedimic wipes out almost the entire population of the earth. Earth abides, but Man is almost extint. The turning point comes when the main character realizes that civilization as he knew it is over. He then turns his energies into teaching the Tribe to be self sufficient.A very good read, very on point and topical for today's world.","This book was hard for me to read simply because the pain of the main character became my pain while I read. In the aftermath of the end of the world You experience fear, loneliness, pitty, love, hope and finally resolution through the narrator Ish's observations.This is no adventure novel but it is a hard hitting look at just how much we truly rely on the trappings of the industrialized world to get by and how naked we would be without them. Although the book ends on a bit of a hopeful note you can't help but mourn for all that's been lost as well as watching the rest of the world's knowledge die slowly over the generations.This book made me ask what if it were me? A mark of a good thought provoking book.","Earth Abides by George Stewart is an incredible book. It follows the main character, Ish, as he tries to make sense of a world where humans are nearly wiped out by disease. What makes this book special, is that it's protagonist is a deliberate, thoughtful man that brings the story a sense of realism that is rarely seen in this kind of fiction. It is very interesting to see how and if civilization can survive such a \"Great Disaster\". The story benefits by being completely plausible, and even though the book was written over 50 years ago, it is still fascinating today. I highly recommend this reading.","A grossly interesting book, perhaps the actual first, to explore the thought of \"what to do to survive in post-apocalyptic America with little skills and a hammer\" - all avenues are skillfully probed and prosed.The first quarter of the book captivated my imagination with the wandering, scavaging and, ultimately, surviving. The middle half was deeply interesting to see how one man could restructure his life so that Americans could live after the plague. The last quarter was filled with expectation and anxiety, seeing how the family has turned out and whether or not the new Americans will prosper as they had before.","At the beginning of Earth Abides, Isherwood Williams, a graduate student alone in the wilderness and working on his thesis, is bitten by a poisonous snake. For several days, he drifts in and out of consciousness. When he is at last able to drag himself to civilization, he finds that a virus not unlike the common flu has mutated into a deadly strain, and the world is suddenly devoid of people. The rest of the book follows Isherwood as he discovers the strange freedom of the empty world, struggles to find other survivors, and works to rebuild civilization.Earth Abides is a sweeping saga, stretching across decades and roaming across North America. Most of the story takes place from inside the head of its protagonist, at a range so close that it takes us several pages to learn his name, as he simply does not think of his name that often. Stewart infuses the story with concrete details and scientific observations, giving it a strong sense of authenticity. Caught up in and believing the action, we are completely absorbed in the efforts of Isherwood Williams to survive and thrive in this strange new world.One trap lurking for any story, but particularly a science fiction story like this, is that of becoming quickly dated. Things change daily, and what is fascinating and new today will soon be old fashioned. Stewart has given his story a certain timelessness, at least so far, and I think he achieves this effect by incorporating very little medium-range technology. By this I mean that things are either seen close up, as in hands working with tools that change slowly, such as hammers, or are seen at a distance, such as the lights of San Francisco. In the middle distance, very little attention is paid to devices that evolve quickly, such as televisions, radios, and automobiles (other than the venerable Jeep). The result is that Earth Abides does not suffer from a feeling of being out of date, and it could easily be imagined to be a present-day story.One interesting feature to me as a writer was the use of interstitial chapters called Quick Years between each of the three major sections. These bridge the time gaps between the primary sections of the book, recalling the primary events in the passing years through Isherwood's eyes. This device lets the author tell a sweeping story while keeping the bulk of the detail in the activity at the turning points. On first glance, this sudden shift in gears seems likely to distance the reader, but Stewart handles the narrative so deftly that the reader finds the story as engaging viewed at this speed as when it is slowed down.Ultimately, Earth Abides is a masterful work. The author gives us enough detail and character to connect deeply with the story, then stays out of the way, allowing the story to unfold with its own power. The result is a riveting and deeply moving tale about all of us, how strong and resilient we are, but also about how fragile we are, how tenuous our grip on the world is, and how little it needs us.Do not miss this story. But do not, however, try to finish it without a generous supply of tissues. You will need them.","I heard about \"Earth Abides\" from someone reviewing \"The Stand\". In their review, they indicated \"The Stand\" was a one for one rip off of \"Earth Abides\". I decided to investigate this accusation and started reading an old edition of George Stewart's book. This book investigates what could potentially happen to human civilization if most people died from a highly contagious disease. The decay of civilization is seen through the eyes of the main character, Isherwood Williams.First, what was my impression of the book? I enjoy reading sci-fi and have read my share of \"end of the world\" books including \"Alas Babylon\", \"The Stand\", \"War Day\", \"The White Plague\", and most recently \"The Road\". I did not enjoy the writing style of this author. It was not fluid and was archaic. However, the subject matter was interesting as was the thought the author put into the story. Ultimately, the author kept my attention.How does this book compare to \"The Stand\"? They are two entirely different books. \"The Stand\" is more realistic in depicting the immediate aftermath of a plague. However afterwards, it becomes more of a \"good versus evil\" tale whereas \"Earth Abides\" seriously contemplates the state of civilization years after the plague. All in all, both books are worthy reads.\"Earth Abides\" is at times is an awkward read. However, the story is interesting and well thought out. All in all, I recommend the book.","I swear it seems that all the reviewers of this book seem desperate to convince people that they've been able to read for a really long time.\"I first read this book back in Vietnam...\"\"I first read this book about thirty years ago...\"\"When I first read this book, I was only twelve years old, and...\"Great, we get it, you're old, and you can read.Ahhh... Anyway, despite my grumbling, I do agree with the essential point that these reviewers made--that this is a book that pulls you in, that surrounds you with a \"world entire,\" that creates a place that you inhabit completely from page 1 to page 317 (in the edition I have, anyway), that creates a world that you'll find hard to forget.The book, \"Earth Abides,\" tells the story of a man who emerges from a long period of solitude to discover that more than 99% of the planet's humans have been killed by a powerful virus, the man himself having likely survived only because of having been bitten by a snake around the same time.The book's descriptions of the abandoned world are awesome, enlivening and atmospheric, and for some of us no doubt a secret dream come true. It gets even cooler whent the man decides to take a road trip across the newly desolate America--from California to New York City. That's the book's first section, and was probably my favorite part of the book, but the book remains interesting and engaging throughout. The man meets a woman, they have children, they meet others, they form a community, and then--this seemed a bit hard for me to swallow--they basically let all of civilization go, and three generations later they're basically a tribe of primitives who are happy and functional, but who can't read, can't use any of the technologies created by mankind, and believe the sun revolves around the Earth. Yeah, that happened kind of quick....Set your disbelief aside though, and read this. It's well-written, nicely paced, and enjoyable, and the depictions of the man when he's really old seem totally accurate in their depiction of the sort of fuzzy and uncertain warmth of old age, though I'd need to have this book's other reviewers confirm that to be absolutely sure.One of my only complaints about the book would be the 1940s mentality that saturates the main character's logic: at one point he says in a sort of wistful tone that maybe one day they might be able to care about such things as race again, he contemplates making himself king of two frightened black people that he meets, and he laments that the his community's lack of law has made it impossible for them to require that an insane girl be \"put out of her misery.\" At first these comments were kind of amusing in a kitschy way, but then they really started piling up, and didn't make his character more endearing to me.Overall though, this was a great book, and like almost everyone else who's read it, I'm sure I'll be thinking about it for years.","This novel did more than entertain, it made me think. Everything that we hold of value weakens when weighted against what is essential in continuing our existence after such a catastrophe. The main character \"Isherwood\" had such a difficult time with the notion of the \"Old\" world being forgotten. What impressed me was that their continued existence was not dependant on the \"Old\" structure of things. If all the demands of our everyday life are absent what is left?I am pleased to have read this book. I'll be honest I was reticent about reading a sci-fi from 1947. This was well worth it.","This is a great read, but before you spend the $50 for this paperback, go check your local used book stores and thrift stores like Goodwill, I got my copy of the 1962 version for 69 cents and it is in great shape at a Goodwill store.","Several reviews have noted what they call the essential pessimism of the book: Man Has Fallen, Civilization Is No More, etc. Well, yes, that is all there. But what is also there is a profound triumph of the human spirit: Civilization is Dead - Long Live Civilization. I will NOT spoil the ending, but book ends with a rebirth - an obvious societal pregnancy if you will - of a new civilization, one profoundly in keeping with the new conditions of their brave renewed world.One can imagine a sequel, and I wish Stewart ahd written one!I first read this book almost 50 years ago, and have re-read it multiple times. It is one of the best \"transition\" books ever written. I recommend it on several levels.","Hello,The main character, Ish, manages to spend over 20 years mostly clutching his worry beads and freting. By the end of the book you just want to slap him and ask, \"What the hell is wrong with you\". His character is indecisive, and whiny. Over 20 years and the most productive thing he did was teach the kids how to make crappy bows and dig a well. If the characters in this book are supposed to be examples of the best way humanity could cope post SHTF we are probably all doomed. The only thing I can think of is that among the characters all had IQ's of 95 and Ish had an IQ of 100. This is more a human drama story (written in a most boring way) written around an apocalypse than it is anything else. If your interested in realistic post SHTF stories don't waist your time here. If your interested on how a small community could waste +20 years post SHTF in blissful denial with only one character recognizing the denial but doing nothing but hand-wringing about it than this is the book for you.","I found this book sitting on my mother's shelf, and after reading the description, couldn't wait to begin delving into it. The description of the book makes it seem like it's going to be very intriguing and exciting. It failed in that area. (And it's rare for me to dislike a book)In general, I really dislike the character. He shows no real or genuine emotion and is very full of himself. He is a geographer, but thinks of himself as a philospher. Which in his book, I guess that means spending a lot of time thinking about how unintelligent and hopeless everyone is. Including his wife and children. In fact, he had around five children, but you only learn about three of their names, and he spends his time only liking one of them. Since this book was written in the 40s, there are some racist and misogynistic undertones.The first two-thirds were mostly boring to me. He spends the majority of his time traveling across America and describing the scenery. When he's not doing that, he's judging people.Overall, I only like the last third of book, and that had nothing to do with the character. Instead, I enjoyed the process that could happen if civilization were lost, and the reforming of it.","I first read this book when I was 19 years old in 1974. At that time, most novels in this genre were post-nuclear where the United States and the Soviet Union were foolish enough to unleash their hellfire. This one takes a different approach. There are no mutants, no zombies, no cannibals. The end comes, as it has for so many human civilisations, from a disease that was not created in a lab but evolved from an earlier less virulent agent. Think avian influenza.It is based on the premise that any species that becomes so very numerous and lives in such dense number is vulnerable to a sweeping pandemic that kills many or almost all of the species. In this case, humans have skated by since the Black Death hit Europe and killed one third of the humans in Europe. A disease appears, but owing to the mobility of our species with rapid global transport, it manages to sweep the planet before anyone is really aware it is there.As with all pandemics, there are generally some individuals who survive either by peculiar circumstance, slight differences in genetics, or just pure luck. In Ish's case, it was more a combination of circumstance and luck. He has gone to a cabin to rest from the stresses of life and is not even aware at first that a new disease is abroad in the world. He just happens to be hiking and suffers a snake bite. The story suggests that he became ill with the disease at the same time and that venom and the disease basically worked against each other; thus, sparing his life. Once he recovers, he discovers a world empty of people. He takes a trip across the country from his starting point in California to New York City then down through the South and back to Los Angeles. This is where the first clear difference appears between this book and most all others. In this story, there are small numbers of survivors, but most are too shell-shocked and skittish to approach. So North America and presumably the rest of the planet is beginning to restore its natural balance, and the marks of humans are slowly being swallowed up.The second difference is that this story demonstrates what I think is the most realistic outcome for the survivors. Most do not have the skills to survive from nature and starve or die from injury, but some begin learning to survive. Ish is one who does. It follows him through the remainder of his life and the one or two generations that are borne from the small collection of survivors who collect around him. Unusual intelligence is not something that results from all matings. Mostly it is average intelligence sufficient to learn survival skills from the parents. Ish will make efforts to ensure some civilisation survives such as reading and writing, but even with that humans change. Domesticated animals survive in feral forms or die out. Predator and prey balance is gradually reestablished. Suburbs gradually revert to forest or grasslands. Natural fires become part of the norm, again.This book is an adventure but not in the same way of a story such as Alas Babylon or the movie 2012 (abominable science in that one). This is an adventure in that the world returns to a form that produced humans in the first place. This is a book for mind and heart more than the thrill. It has stood without becoming as dated as most of these books do. The words 'computer', 'radiation', and 'desperate' do not appear. I think more than anything, the survivors take a while to realise that their lives are not going to return to the way they were. I give this novel all the stars allowed and would give it more if I could.","I really enjoyed this book, George Stewart uses an interesting writing devise to describe time passing without you as the reader feeling as if he is grasping for ideas.Right from when people start dieing and the world changes the whole pace of life changes and this is captured really well and I feel is conveyed very effectively.I also loved the insights into what happens over time to various things that we are accosted to, cats, dogs, corn and cars. I know, I know I sound a little weird but it works !At only 337 pages this is not a taxing read, its definitely worth throwing at your younger readers in the home wanting something that is a little more challenging","I would like to say that in reading other reviews here that dislike this book, the people in this book remind me greatly of many people I have known. Yes, they didn't seem to try very hard to continue civilization, but then he explains that and ponders that at great length. Yes, the main characters were annoying and all too real. All the people that say, \"I would have done this!\" or \"they should have done that!\" are just getting what the author wanted you to do, think about it.They characters in the book, the few rag tag remnants of civilization, fail to even prepare for the inevitable illness that befalls them, typhoid. Just like all of humanity in 1949 failed to prepare for the pandemic that wipes them out. And just like we have still failed to prepare for the coming pandemic of today.This is a cautionary tale that is enjoyable to read. What I would say the the people who don't like it is, And what exactely have you done lately to prepare civilization for what the World Health Organization has recently stated is \"inevitiable\"?","&#8216;Earth Abides&#8217; by George R. Stewart comes with a considerable reputation. First Published in 1949, It was the first winner of the International Fantasy Award although it is clearly science fiction of the world catastrophe kind. That said the book isn&#8217;t extra-speculative in approach, it is set in much the same time as it was written, in an America of that late 1940s early 1950s. The main character, and narrator, of this disaster novel is Isherwood Williams a post grad geography student, Ish is one of the few survivors of a plague which has decimated the USA (and by inference the world). The book tells the tale of what happens to civilisation after the fall and describes Ish&#8217;s attempts to preserve some of it into the future. The story is told and progressed in a series of accounts, the exploration of the USA, the founding of a community, the growth of that community etc. It is written in a straight forward narrative style, with an occasional aside to speculate on the ecology, and traces the life of Ish from the time of the plague to his death. Through this journey Ish will face loneliness and find love, the small community he gathers about him will both flourish and suffer tragedy, and all along Ish chronicles things with his eye on history and ecology.For me, one of the main strengths of this book is that Ish is one of the most relatable protagonists of just about any book I&#8217;ve read. Ish is the sort of person who we&#8217;d like to think we would be in this situation. This is not to say Ish is perfect and he&#8217;s certainly no hero. He has a methodical and intellectual outlook to tackling situations, but he suffers as many failures as triumphs. This gives the book an emotional depth uncommon in a lot of SF and it is this humanity within the characters and their simple plight which drags you into the story. I think this is the book&#8217;s secret, it has the ring of truth. The characters send you through a gamut of emotions from nostalgia to anger, we care about them and are emotionally invested in there future.I don&#8217;t often read disaster novels and it took me some time to build up to read it, I wanted to read it because of its reputation but somehow I always seemed to find another book I needed to read first. Finally biting the bullet I found after only a few pages it had become compulsive and it ended much too soon. Whilst I have read some high enjoyable and great books both before and since, it is this book I find that sticks in my mind and the one that I contemplate upon. This book deserves all the praise it has received, and it has widely been proclaimed a masterwork. That it isn&#8217;t more widely known today is a shame. This book has probably become, even against my will, my favorite SF novel.","The premise of this novel is that mankind suddenly experiences a biological holocaust in the form of a new disease--a form of super-measles that wipes out all but a tiny remnant of mankind. The author explains that &quot;mankind had too long been rolling an endless succession of sevens&quot; and that like all animals that had multiplied out of turn, the sudden catastrophe was inevitable to set the balance back to what nature intended. This novel tells the story of a very small group of survivors, and suggests what life would be like under in the aftermath, and perhaps, more profoundly, what such a scenario might mean for mankind.The author's premise is that little or nothing of civilization would survive such an event. In the story **very minor spoiler** although the survivors make attempts at preserving the skills and lessons of civilization, this eventually becomes impossible against the tide of events sweeping mankind back not just to barbarism (in which some skills and beliefs might have survived) but to downright savagery and superstition. The most profound thought that the author successfully imparts is that all of the traditions, skills, and manifestations of our civilization could--and would--be lost in a single generation. Unforgettable is when one of the characters in the story looks out at the ruins of the San Francisco Bay Bridge (before it too passes away) and asks--&quot;who built this.&quot; The protagonist thinks for a second and answers: &quot;the Americans built it.&quot; The next question is &quot;who were the Americans?&quot; I have never forgotten this exchange, which I felt illustrated brilliantly how important it is for one generation to impart the best ideas of civilization to the next, and how easily all our achievements and successes might be lost in the face of a global catastrophe.The reader need not and probably will not agree with all of the author's conclusions about what would happen in this scenario. Would we really lose the skill of a written language? Would we really fall all the way back almost to the Old Stone Age? The author will challenge the reader's own thoughts on this subject, and that is fine. One need not agree with all of the conclusions that the novel contains to enjoy this story.Although written many years ago, upon re-reading this novel recently I found that it had lost little or none of its impact or relevance. It features a bit more prudishness than a modern novel might contain, but in my opinion is none the worse for this. The story is well-told, the prose is quite good, and the storyline moves along all the while capturing and retaining the reader's interest. This is a novel that I would recommend to everyone.","I could almost feel the age of this book when I read it. It is slow, the main character is an idiot (in my eyes), and he spends most of his time thinking about single-handedly saving (well, rebuilding) civilisation. Delusions of Grandeur. No critical thoughts about civilisation as realized in 1940/50 America, either: \"Modern civilisation is good. We need to rebuild it at once. End of argument.\"I took two things from this book - first, sheep are the most stupid animals on this planet. And second, people may come and go, but Earth Abides. The Author managed very well to show me that, by having his protagonist realize a few pages before the end that he isn't the center of the world. Wow. Finally. I was waiting for this for about 200 pages.This could have been done with a much shorter and faster-paced book. Still, the book poses some interesting questions, and it's vastly better than what you get today when being shown post-apocalypse worlds (I'm thinking along the lines of the Mad Max movies, or Waterworld, etc - the book never sells out this cheaply). So, all in all, Earth Abides earns it's place on my SF bookshelf. A serious book that tries to seriously investigate the end of civilisation as we know it, and guide us into the new world that rises out of it.","I could not put this book down. It challenged me, it entertained me, it made me cry.When I run across a copy, I buy it and give it to friends.","Perhaps because I've read several recently published books that deal with life after \"the end of the world as we know it,\" I found this book to be slow moving and even boring at times. However, I enjoyed moments of nostalgia when presented with phrases like \"tourist court\" and \"I pressed the starter button on the car.\" Brought back memories. Sadly, the world as we knew it then has already ended.","One of the handful of true classics in the Apocalyptic genre that are Must reads. This account follows a survivor in a post-pandemic world that decimated the human race as he seeks out other survivors and begins to rebuild. Excellent read from page one!!! Solid and believable story line, great characters, and very entertaining! Includes \"year zero!\"","I love the apocolypse genre - so thought provoking, and Earth Abides is one of the best I've read so far. I was surprised I'd never heard of it before seeing someone on a message board mention it. I decided to give it a try, and am so glad I did. This has now been moved into my books to read again, and that really doesn't happen often.I didn't realize how long ago this had been written until the main character described going into a house and sitting down to rest on the \"davenport\" - how long has it been since we heard that term?Really though, the premise is such that it really doesn't matter when the book was written. The same thought provoking situations occur. Highly recommend.","I enjoy Post apocalyptic sic fi but this was not that entertaining after a while.","With so many books available to read, is this one worth your time? Ultimately, you'll have to make that decision, but I hope my review can help in some way.There are some technology issues with the story that clearly show it was written in the late 1940's; however, these don't detract too much from the story.There are also a few typos in the Kindle edition, which I assume is a scanning problem when converting to eBook format.The two main issues I had with the book are:1. Food - It is unrealistic to think that people would be subsisting off canned food for 20+ years, let alone, 40+ years at the end of the book.2. Future generations - Without ruining the ending, the book makes a plot decision on how Ish decides to pass knowledge on to future generations. I liked two aspects of what he did, but I thought the rest was foolish.I liked the book overall, but I didn't necessarily think it was a \"great\" work.","This review is a spoiler! Don't read on if you are intending to read it for the first time!I had heard many times that this was a classic that would haunt me for life. But I was not impressed, partially because there were things that were left unanswered. I may have missed something - what was the significance of the car on the bridge at the end? Modern man's constructions were all around him...the Golden Gate Bridge, for example. Why the car? Why did they want him to die there, instead of with their tribe? I thought it weird, too, and unlikely, that he saw so few bodies in the aftermath. I liked the hammer symbol a lot - and the fact that he passed it on to the young man he'd chosen - and why. I liked that his gift of leadership helped humanity live on. I also liked the way that he changed his desperate struggle from lecturing - to action...his building of the simple bow and arrows. I loved that he continued to describe the inevitable and looming corrosion of the modern world. That did make him the last American - his final months spent with his oldest friend. Those things saddened me a great deal.I have read another holocaust book that WILL haunt me for life...perhaps because it was on such a massive scale, and yet confined to only one remaining group of characters. The book is The Last Ship, by William Brinkley. I've read it 3 times, as has my oldest son.","This is an extraordinary novel, wider appreciation of which has probably been hampered by categorization as science fiction. While there are some slight anachronisms (the book appeared in 1949) the ideas, and the narrative, are disturbingly fresh. To me the most stunning - and frighteningly plausible - theme was how fragile &quot;civilization&quot; is, and how quickly everything could collapse even though the material and intellectual basis for &quot;civil society&quot; remained intact and available.","In short, I liked the first half of this book - the plot is intriguing and you don't want to put the book down! But after reading 2/3 of the story you expect something more to happen but the tempo goes down, the main character gets more introspective and the flow of the narration starts to falter. The book starts to get boring and you just want to get through to the end to see what the end will be like. With a better pace all the way through, I would rate this book higher.","Chris FitzgeraldEnglish 10Mrs. Cruces5-20-02Earth Abides Evaluative EssayThe novel Earth Abides, written by George Stewart, took place in San Francisco,California. This science fiction novel focuses on a plague that has spread across the NorthAmerican continent and is threatening the human species. The novel contains the life thatan individual survivor, Isherwood Philips (Ish), lives. A majority of the population hasseized to exist. Ish is an important part of the Plague because he is a biologist. Ish goesthrough his life in this novel by bringing other characters into his life. Ish is one of thesurvivors that has the intelligence to form a tribe and become the leader of this tribe. Ishhas a compassionate soul and struggles to help other survivors find their way.Earth Abides is a very interesting novel. This novel is easily enjoyable because ofits connection that it gives of the key characters who are intertwined in a drama that isdealing with a cataclysmic event of a Plague. This makes the novel a good read. Thiskind of event is very possible considering the times that we live in now. This novel doesnot only relate with people coming together to struggle for survival. It also deals with anevent that could very well take place.This novel is great for anyone over the age of about 12 years old, because of theway that this novel is set up to involve thinking and real life experience to understand thetrue meaning of the novel. Anybody who is looking for a good science fiction novel willlike the great novel Earth Abides.","I bought this book based on the overall good ratings.I speed read through most of it, hoping it would pick up. I can't stand the idea that these people weren't a little more intelligent and chose to preserve what they had and plan for the future without technology. They had a whole freakin' University Libary for pete's sake!Out of the whole book I got that Ish was the only inteliigent one but didn't have the teaching skills to subsequently teach the next generations.If you like post-apolcolytipic books, then I highly recommend \"One Second Later\" by Fortschen. The spelling may be off slighly....I don't have the book here. There is a line-up at work to read it. This book scared the hell out of me. And as a professional health care worker I could see the devastating domino effect happening like this book portrayed. Like the book \"One Second Later\" says, \"Its not IF, but WHEN.\"","If they did an audiotape of \"Earth Abides\", only Ben Stein would be up to the task of delivering the text into spoken words. The novel wastes no time getting into its subject matter. Within the opening pages, an unknown plague wipes out the vast majority of humanity, leaving the remnants to either rebuild civilization or bear witness to its final collapse. It sounds promising, but the delivery never comes.The story is narrated in the first person by \"Ish\", a young college student whose circumstances enable him to survive the disaster. Very early on, the reader gets the first inklings that this novel will serve as a sounding board for George Stewart's various preoccupations. The first hint is the dominant theme that nature has some innate sense of population control that strikes suddenly and absolutely on all levels, and this is explored not just in discovering what happened to humanity but also in a number of situations as the story advances.In fact, Ish seems to be merely a mouthpiece for a number of observations, ideas, and insights postulated by Stewart. For a work of fiction, \"Earth Abides\" reads more like an apocalyptic version of \"Future Shock\", the landmark Alvin Toffler sociological study. Unfortunately, it reads as dryly as \"Future Shock\" as well. All of Stewart's ideas are presented in a dry, impersonal manner, which precludes any emotional connection with the story itself and thus lessens the impact of these insights in the end. Recommended only for the most voracious of sci-fi readers.","I 1960, I was nine years old, I remember staying up all night during summer vacation to finish it, I still love this book!","I found this book totally by happy accident, and it remains one of my all-time favorites. What is chilling is that the basic premise of the book is quite possible and believable, given diseases like Ebola that are out there. He gave real-life examples of other species that became overpopulated, and then were nearly wiped out by a plague. What is man but another species of animal on this planet, and we are not immune--look at the Black Plague, for example. A truly unique look at what might happen to the earth if we are nearly wiped out, and what might happen to the people left to survive afterward. A great read!","As always, interesting to see the vast number of five star review for a book deserving of maybe three. Would be quite fascinating to easily see a breakdown of reviewers' ratings showing number of reviews at each star level - would we see most people rate things at 5 stars?I just finished this book, and have been thinking about why it was so bad. It never captured my interest, the characters were cardboard, astoundingly enough the plot was nearly nonexistent and worst of all, no conflict/tension!After the initial collapse, our hero drives across the country, from San Francisco to Manhattan, making trivial contact with a few people apparently for the purpose of seeing an empty New York City. He then returns to California, where he proceeds to settle down for the next 20+ years without doing anything except mosey down to the local abandoned grocery store to snag some canned food.My big insight from reading this book was realizing most people were essentially lazy before television was invented.There are so many other better genre books, including _On The Beach_ and _Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang_.","The book, first written in 1949 tells a story that could be just as true today. A pandemic that sweeps the contenent leaving few survivors. Isherwood (Ish) Williams is the protagonist. His life is the focus of the story, with interaction with a gradual collection of a few other survivors, that results in a slowly growing tribe. Well worth reading and rereading a few years later.","This book is great and I found it on Amazon at a great price. it shipped promptly and arrive in great shape.","Written in the 50s, it talks about ecology when nobody even knew the word. Ish watches the world spasm itself back into equilibrium after man is removed from the equation. Add elements of anthropology and sociology and and you have a truly remarkable book. Read it. NOW!","First published in 1949, Earth Abides is George R. Stewart's take on what would happen if all of the human population of Earth, except a few scattered survivors, were killed by a vicious disease. The tale is presented entirely through the thoughts and experiences one man, i.e., Isherwood Williams. Ish is a graduate student when the \"Great Disaster\" leaves him alone in the Oakland CA area. He eventually finds a few other survivors, including Emma (Em) who becomes his partner and the mother of his children. Ish and Em and their small band of survivors create a fledgling community that struggles with immense hardships to survive. However, they do survive and their community \"The Tribe\" grows slowly. Ish, as the only educated person among the group, becomes a leader and eventually becomes revered almost as a God after many years. Ish remains a thinker throughout his life, and a worrier through most of it. The book is very interesting and presents much credible (at least based on the 1949 knowledge base) information about what the world would be like and how it would change if humans cease to be a significant force. It also presents much logical information about how a very small human community would struggle to adapt and develop a simple but functioning social organization. Much of the book presents Ish's thoughts about how to help his tribe survive and also how to motivate or manipulate them to develop skills and knowledge that might enable them to develop a new civilization in the future. At times, I did not like Ish, but I usually understood the logic of his thoughts and actions. Although things did not work out the way Ish wanted, he finally realized that the tribe and Earth's changing environment would interact to determine the future without his help. I found this book to be a slow but interesting read. It was also intellectually stimulating and engendered much emotion. Reading this science fiction classic is well worth the effort.","I have read this book multiple times and have totally been immersed in WHAT IFS. I have talked more about this book than about any other book that I have read except for The Source by James Michener.. The idea of the world actually existing after most of the people have died from an unknown cause is so thought provoking. Most people I have talked to and let read my book have been as impressed by Earth Abides as I have been but then there are the very few who thought that they could do better if they had been in the same circumstances. I always thought that I would eventually have to go back to cave man status. It is a book that should be read in college. I would totally recommend it.","This book is less about an apocalyptic event that kills most humans and more about the reemergence of society and the influences that geography, history, and personal beliefs have on it. Ishi, the main character, strives to bring back the scholarly lifestyle he values, but is faced with convincing the new generation of its value in a world where his children are free from the society he knew.","One of my favorites that I surely will read more than once. I loved how you got to read about the main character from the age of 18 to his death. The book is amazing at telling the story of how they all survive and how mankind seems to revert back to tribal and superstitious beliefs. I almost wanted to jump in and live this life with them even though their hardships seemed too much to bear.","I had great expectations when I started this book and got out of it slightly unsatisfied. The book shows pretty well what civilisation is about and how much it is fragile. Also how much civilisation relies on a few individuals only. All the lost knowledge in the library no one can understand remains as a vivid image in my mind.In spite of some theories underlaying the story being already out of date, that book poses essential issues and the empathy we develop for Ish in his efforts and trials to answer them and maintain some civilisation makes the story moving.","This is one of my favorite books. Written in 1949, it's remarkably contemporary and accessible. I love the references to hifi. It seems to me more of a work of philosophy; a meditation on humanity, relationships, change and civilization, which is precisely why it's so timeless. It's also something of a love story and there is a gentle tenderness pervades the entire story. Ish is a wonderful character. As the world is completely and unalterably transformed around him, he strives for continuity and permanence. In the end, his striving is for naught, he's failed. But there is no bitterness and remorse but an acceptance of the world around him and the love that expressed itself in his relationships with others. The story wasn't anything like I thought it would be, much better.","Earth Abides was written by George Stewart and released in 1949. The story follows the main character Ish, short for Isherwood, as he is one of the few people to survive a pandemic that kills the majority of the human population. Ish has an interesting perspective on the incident as he has an academic background and tends to view events through in a very historical, geographical way. Ecology and population dynamics are frequently discussed throughout the story. Stewart explores population fluctuations in nature in comparison to the die off of humans. Much of the story takes place in California, near San Francisco and follows Ish through most of his life following the outbreak. On a practical level, this book contains more generalized preparation information such as the durability of canned food, hunting and gathering methods and the continuation of life without public water and electricity. While Earth Abides is certainly entertaining, it also provides a very unique perspective on the end of civilization and it will leave you with some very interesting ideas for your consideration.","I read Earth Abides months ago, and I still find myself thinking about it often. Some of the reviews I read before I read the book mentioned the book remaining with the reader for years and years; I didn't expect that to be the case for me, but now I think it will. We take so much for granted, both things and people, but what would we do if life as we know it basically vanished? How would we manage alone? What abilities would we need which we don't have now? So much to think about!","This book is not so much about the end of the world itself; instead, it uses the end of the world - the end of most of mankind, anyway - as a plot device to explore how a new, small, totally contained society would develop out of the leavings of the old one. This task it accomplishes quite well; the growth of the Tribe in San Francisco and their mythological beliefs, traditions, and practices is fascinating, if a little slow-moving in several parts. But because societal development is the primary concern of the novel, the little details are simply glossed over, and there are so many technical errors or things left unexplained that it had a tendency to lift me out of the story and re-engage my disbelief. For instance, most of mankind is wiped out by a mysterious, very viral disease, but it's never explained what the disease is, where it came from, or why some people are immune. In fact, the main character of the book comes down out of the hills after it's all over, having no idea what was going on the \"civilized\" world, but he shows a total lack of curiosity about what happened to everybody that I found unbelievable. And when several survivors get together, they never discuss where they were or what happened to them when the Great Disaster (as it's called in the book) went down, which I think goes totally against human nature. And the survivors continue to live off the leavings for forty or more years afterward, eating canned food that must have long since gone bad and even smoking cigarettes that had to have been unsmokeable after at least a year. They never bother to start even a rudimentary garden - an idea which I think would have occurred to just about anybody - but somehow manage to live in nearly perfect health until old age without eating any fresh fruits or vegetables. Again, I understand that these details weren't important to the author, but they were important to me, and so these little problems served to disrupt what was otherwise a well-written, intriguing take on the old end-of-the-world plot.","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it. This maturity is perceptible all along this work.The story is situated in a world devastated by a sudden pestilence that annihilates most of humankind. Taking into account the last SARS epidemic that jumped abruptly from China to Canada it doesn't look an impossible scenario or last year Influenza.This is the story.Isherwood Williams comes down from an isolate spot in the mountains to discover an empty world. He starts searching for survivors all across USA, from California to New York and back again. He finds only isolate human cells, couples or trios, overwhelmed by catastrophe and in a near catatonic state.Returns to his native town and contemplate with a certain scientific detachment the fading world around him.Mr. Stewart intercalate brief vignettes describing what happens to dogs, cats, cattle, plants, roads, dams and bridges, contrasting them with Ish's daily experiences.Little by little the story grip reader's attention and even if action is somehow slow, the book can't be put down.As the story goes on human cells began to draw near each other, grouping and interacting again. A rather feeble structure starts growing up.The author approaches universal questions about survival and extinction; civilization and savagery; social structure and anomie.

A very enticing read!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","This book is a classic - an interesting study of what man might become with the sudden loss of cultural structure.","This book is exceptionally well written and moving, giving little regard to the amount of time passed but focusing on the actions and thoughts of Ish. The internal debate and conflict and the final resolution are wonderful. The characters are personable and easy to relate to. More importantly, in the time of the H1N1 virus and other diseases, a harsh and jolting wake-up call to humanity and civilization. Worth every cent.","This book is amazing in that it was written so long ago (1949). I have had dreams for as long as I can remember that resemble this story, but I only read it this year. It's a quick read but one must pay attention to keep up. Some things that were not accomplished by the people are disappointing, but since technology has changed the way we live in the last 60 years so greatly, who's to say what he would rewrite today. Overall I really liked it. I started reading this at a friend's house and just had to buy to reread again.","George R. Stewart weaves at once a beautiful and hauntingly believable tale with this novel, one that I've never been able to forget...or wanted to. Once considered dated, with the lessening of global nuclear tensions, the scenario Mr. Stewart envisions for a possible worldwide catastrophe, one brought about not by bombs but disease, has once again come to the forefront and become the most plausible ingredient in mankind's demise. More even than the fact that this is a truly enjoyable read is the deeper message Earth Abides shares with the reader as it reaches down and touches our very hearts, defining what it means to be human in an inhuman environment. The symbolism involved in Isherwood Williams' desire to keep a hammer with him for the future as a tie to the past is obviously an unconscious comment on his personal hope of rebuilding a fallen civilization. A hope that goes unfulfilled in his life time and maybe many lifetimes to follow. The insight into the human psyche that Mr. Stewart demonstates as he carries Isherwood from his youth at the beginning of the book to old age and finally death at the end and Isherwood's subtle change of attitude during that process, rings exceedingly true and speaks volumes about Mr. Stewart's keen and perhaps unique ability to put into words what it really means, or at least should mean, to be human. I've rarely read a book more than once because I just don't have the time, but I've read Earth Abides several times since I was a teen and I know I'll read it several more times before I too reach that stage in my life that Isherwood assures us won't be the calamity our youth oriented culture would have us to believe.","Science Fiction books are hard to remain classics given our growing understanding of science and technology. Earth Abides is an exception because it is written from the perspective of an anthropologist trying to cope with the fact that his world has been destroyed. Like many readers this book changed my life&gt; I read it in my teens, in my 20's and I guess it is time to pick it up again in my 30's.","First of all, I think D.D. Shade's analysis of today's society on Earth Abides is unsubstantiated. This book is still a great book today because it is a classic. A classic, by definition, relates to all time. The assination of JFK or MLK would not have had any greater impact on this book. This book, like Ish, will continue to stand the test of time because of it's overall classical themes. That man is the complicating variable on the planet earth. Regardless of if a man or men die, the earth abides.","I read this book in High School in the 70's in Saratoga Ca. I have a teenage daughter and I can't fathom that she is not required to read these types of books anymore. My mind constantly wandered with Ish. I dreamt of what I would do in that situation, of how I would react. Needless to say I finished the book in one weekend well ahead of my classmates, and decided to just start it all over. I recomended the book to my Mom, and she also fell in love with it. Ever since we are both on the lookout for others like it. I have read most of them (The stand, postman, alas babylon, on the beach, SWAN SONG (the best), plus mony other forgetable tales), and thank Earth Abides for my passion for these books. I wish someone would write another that is as good as this.","I have only read 2 books more than once - &quot;Earth Abides&quot; by George R Stewart, and &quot;The Quest of Aah&quot; by Alexan Farelane. If you read one book a week for 70 years, you would only have read 3,640 books in your lifetime. There are millions of books you will never be able to read - even with the Reader's Digest versions! Life is way too short to read the same book twice - except for books which can change your life. These 2 books are &quot;Life Changing&quot; books. The thing which most appeals to me with &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that our hero is just an ordinary guy and his failures are at least as impressive as his successes. He starts off with the best of intentions, becomes an unwilling leader by default, and is unable to persuade the other survivors of the need to maintain and/or restore the facilities and civilization we have come to take for granted. I KNOW that this is exactly how it would happen for me, if I was in his place! I know what I'd want to have happen, but circumstances would prevent me from being able to make it all happen.&quot;The Quest of Aah&quot; is a fantasy about the seven levels, the seven valleys, higher planes of existence, stages on the journey from Earth to Heaven, some of which any spiritual person can relate to, and anyone on a secular plane can be entertained by. The novel is presented as a memory, and is the way we hope it will be when we reach the end of our lives. It is completely different from &quot;Earth Abides&quot;, but if you like speculative fiction, then it is worth a read (or TWO!)","This is a story of the first years and the ensuing decades in the lives of the very few survivors of a natural plague. At first, there is a detailed overview of one survivor's (the main character and often narrator per se) actions in the first several months after the plague. This account of the &quot;short-term&quot; impact of a plague has been seen in other SF stories and might seem repetitous. But where this story is different, and where this novel is in a class of its own, is where the plot goes when this survivor meets others and small families begin and a community develops. The challenges which are faced by and met with by this group are detailed, yet are those involving environment and illness which are perhaps expected. But more interesting is what new moral values that arise and what &quot;holdover&quot; values (school, religion) which are attempted to be maintained, but are not or can't be embraced by the new generations which follow. The book follows the community though several decades, jumping years and stopping to go into detail about an event or time period -- but giving several pages in between as a summary to provide a good junction between sections...thus keeping the story flowing. The book ends with the natural death of the main character and seeing that the new generations have embraced a &quot;new and different&quot; value, knowledge, and societal system which is suprisingly similar to another culture -- and perhaps quietly challenging the reader to ask whether or not such the result is good or bad; and, whether or not the result was destiny, or the result of proper or improper actions of the original group of survivors. For a book written in the late 1940's, it was very, very far ahead of it's time.","After reading Earth Abides in 1968 as a 10th grader, I have read it six more times, getting a new insight of the book each time. My son (11yrs of age) has now read it twice with the same enjoyment as I have. It is a book that makes the mind think, wonder and dream the &quot; WHAT IF&quot; and &quot;COULD IT REALLY HAPPEN&quot; questions. Read it, sit back and think it. After the hair on the back of your neck sits down. Then read again next year.","I first read this book when I was 14, having borrowed it from the school library. I read it twice more in the following year. It affected me deeply and since then it has quite often crossed my mind to find the book again and re-read it. How surprised and happy I am after idly checking this website to see if that title would come up! I plan on ordering the book so I may savour every word of it all over again!","When my teacher first informed our class that we were going to read a science fiction book, my heart sank; I hated science fiction books! However, when I started to read Earth Abides, I found myself becoming engrossed in this book. The plot and the characters were something new and fresh to me in this age of quick storytelling. This was actually the first book I didn't skip to the end to read the final chapter because I was bored. It held my attention the whole time, and I was disappointed when it ended. This book reminds me of the movie &quot;Deep Impact&quot; because of the armageddon plots. I hope this is turned into a movie because it will probably be just as good as the book!","Of the novels written on this subject, I think I have read them all, this is by far the best. Most interesting is the authors attempt to regenerate civilization. Methodically covers natures reaction to the demise of man, fascinating! &quot;The Stand&quot;, &quot;Alas Babylon&quot;, &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; are all outstanding; &quot;Earth Abides&quot; stands alone!!!","The protagonist is arrogant, lazy and stupid. He likes to sit around smoking cigarettes and thinking about how much smarter he is than all the other survivors while his wife cooks him meals and takes care of his children. He doesn't bother to teach his children to read, and he doesn't bother to learn anything medical or mechanical or any other potentially useful skills in a post-apocalyptic world. At one point he runs across some other survivors who are Black, and he thinks about how he could stay and \"be king\" of them because he is white. The ultimate self-absorbed old white man fantasy.","If almost all the people in the world were dead, and you had to spend your life with an egotistical, chauvanistic, racist white guy with absolutely no redeeming qualities you'll love this. Archie Bunker would have loved this guy. I, did not.Old does not have to be disfunctional.","The idea of an apocalyptic end of our planet and of humankind has always been extremely prevalent in society. From religion to movies, theories of annihilation can be found everywhere. But few books attempt to tackle the subject of life after the end. I think George Stewart wrote this book in the 60's and I wanted to see what his ideas were on that subject. The premise was great, but I was extremely disappointed with Earth Abides because Stewart brings in many themes/ideas but never goes into any of them in any detail whatsoever. There is absolutely no emotional connection with any of the characters,and even less so with Ish, the main character. I felt like I was waiting for something to happen throughout the book, and it never came. The author attempts to tackle way too many &quot;big&quot; subjects at the same time, and in the end,he fails. The only reason I gave this book even one star is because the reader can learn about how the world may deteriorate in the future when man is no longer here.One could say that that is a positive thing.","Some good ideas. Some interesting speculations on the nature of man and society. Some interesting predictions of how the earth would respond to a die-off of humans. Ruined by needless wordiness, 2 dimensional characters and very little to say of a philosophical nature. A bore and a disappointment. Skimmed the last 100 pages.","Glowing reviews, word of mouth praise and the subject matter all left me eager to read Earth Abides. Unfortunately this book fell far short of my expectations. The premise of a global plague is truly fascinating (and frightening), especially in light of recent world events, but the story drags on in such a depressing and mundane fashion that reading the book became a chore rather than an adventure. The lead character's over inflated opinion of himself is so prevalent through out the book that it prevents any character development on the part of any other survivors. Over 300 pages and you barely get to know any of them. That would not have mattered so much if the author had done a better job of portraying the aftermath of the plague. Too little attention was paid to what would happen to the local environment. Impacts are generally glossed over in short, simplistic passages. Survival was no more difficult than raiding the local grocery store and opening a can of beans, even after 20 years. I never felt the horror and struggle for survival that one would expect with such a global catstrophe. The technology in the book is certainly dated but I didn't find that a distraction. This is not an enjoyable read. Better classics on man wiping himself out include \"On the Beach\" and \"Alas, Babylon\". For a more up to date adventure try \"Ill Wind\" by Anderson & Beason.","I love to read, so there are very few books I don't finish. I usually slog through even the bad ones. Here's my take on this book. I was looking for a novel about how people came up with creative ideas about how to survive in a world after civilization is wiped out. This book dealt with that facet somewhat in the first hundred pages. After that most of the book deals with moral issues. \"What are the moral or ethical responsibilities of survivors\" is the main theme of the rest of the book. After an ok start, the whole rest of the book seemed preachy and a little like the author was trying to coerce me into agreeing with his point of view. Three-quarters of the way through the book I quit reading, because there were no characters I was interested in enough to care what happened to them.","Written by a self-righteous professor of English Lit from Berkeley. The authors preconceived notions about the ignorance of rest of us comes across pretty clearly, as his protagonist constantly judges everyone based on his perception of their intelligence. Book was very poorly researched....the protagonist and his children live mostly off of 20-30 year old canned food for most of the book (something that would probably kill you). He fixes up a jeep and then fills it with 20 year old gasoline (which is unusable a year or two after its refined). He raises his offspring in total ignorance...his greatest achievement being to teach them how to make a bow and start a fire (teaching them to read was apparently not important). Worse end of the world book I've ever read.","The plot in Earth Abides is very simple. It is basically the ongoing struggle one would face in creating a perfect society. The setting is in San Francisco, California after a great disease has struck and wiped out 99% of the human population. The main character is a survivor named Ish. He survived the disease an interesting way, and then sets out to build a new society. Through his trials and errors you find out the complexity to people and modern society. You understand the restraints that society has on a person, even if it is not present. For example alcohol is a big part in the novel. Without anyone to stop them, people begin to drink themselves to death.Earth Abides' plot is thin, and dragged to eternity and back. The author spends the majority of the second half of the book reasoning about worthless issues. They were worthless because they do not apply to the main theme of survival. This makes you very confused, as the book is already hard to follow. He also spends a good deal of pages with Ish's inner thoughts, which are basically a bunch of complex nonsense. It is very hard to put your self in his place, and understand his thoughts. He becomes so paranoid with every decision he makes, that he becomes overly analytical.This book could possibly be amusing to very patient adults. It has close to zero action, and does not keep you turning pages. In reality it is the exact opposite, it puts you to sleep. Anyone who likes a book that keeps you interested, Earth Abides is not for you. The only person I would recommend this book to, would be an insomniac who needs to find a way to get to sleep.","Not really SiFi. Fiction and Apocalyptic yes, but after a very few chapters to grab your interest, author drifts off into non-related daydreaming, repetition and his personal philosophy on various character's lives. I'm betting that he was a self proclaimed authority and certainly a pipe smoker.No science, little innovation, but it goes on and on. You keep hoping it will get better, but unfortunately, it doesn't. How it won any award remains a mystery to me. If you are looking for an exciting science fiction work, sorry, but this isn't it.","Having loved this story 20 years ago as a teenager, it pains me now to find that it is surely the worst novel on my bookshelves. All the characters are two-dimensional. The dialogue is uniformly stiff and amateurish. The story's hero is arrogant, aloof and dismissive of anyone he perceives as inferior. Since he actually perceives *everyone* as inferior, the book quickly becomes very tiresome. Perhaps the saddest aspect of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that the story is clearly and shockingly the fantasy of someone who dreamed of existing in a world without people, or at most with just a thin sprinkling of simple folks over whom he could rule as their intellectual master. &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is a truly awful book.","I love a good post-apoc book, but this one just wasn't that great. Other than the narrator, the male characters aren't very well developed and the female characters were even worse. The jumps in time threw me off and the overall plot just didn't grab me.","I'm surprised so many people rated this book so highly. It's hideously dated, both in language, and in writing style. Not even in the same ballpark as something like The Stand. It was interesting to think about what path civilization would take without a unifying threat after an apocalypse, but the writing just ruined it for me. No great character development at any point, a lot of cliches and brushed over details. It kept me reading, barely, mostly to see if it went anywhere. Pretty disappointing though."],

      "reviews.text":["I have read all of Stephenn King's books, so when he wrote that this book was his inspiration for writing The Stand, I knew it would be good. I purchased Earth Abides in a London bookstore a few years ago, but somehow it has gone missing. So I was very surprised and exited when I saw that it was being offered as a kindle book. I have now re-read Earth Abides and it is truly a great work of fiction. It really gets my imagination working, and makes real just how fragile the human race is.","I first read this book when I was in high school. That would be early '60s. It was one of those stories that was foundational in my own thinking. It was a pleasure to read it again after all these years. It is one of the earliest of the apocalyptic genre and its themes are timeless and the characters unforgettable, as you yourself Ish well know. It is still fresh and engrossing to read.","After having read many apocalyptic scifi novels; this is defenitely utopian. SPOILER: The disappearance of all the victim of the plague is suspiciously clean. Also, the simplification of the breakdown of infrastructure seem a bit too clean. However, having dealt with these questions, Stewart frees the book to deal with the most preponderous question: How do the Survivors of a great diaster rebuild civilization?","After reading this book I can no longer get myself to read anything else. There is just no other fiction novel, I believe, that can possible be as good as this book.It's so incredibly thought provoking and engrossing I can't stop reflecting on it.","This is a classic sci-fi drama with interesting survival and sociological study. Long but entertaining and I can recommend it.","This is an enduring futuristic fantasy novel that is hard to put down. The characters are well developed and sympathetic without being heroic. It is easy to image yourself in the protagonist's position, and contemplate how you would react. It really makes you think about what is important in your personal life and in society. An excellent novel for anyone with an active imagination.","This book is so old I was leary about reading it...I have to tell you..even though this book was written so long ago..this book will stick with me forever...the characters are memorable and you are right there with them..you laugh and cry with them!!! i will always remember this book..i am so glad i read it!!!","this is a very well written sci-fi/apocalyptic thriller. it isn't so much as a thriller but an exploration of the human race (in the POV of Ish, one of the most memorable fictional characters IMHO). I love the line \"between the plan and the fulfillment lies the frailty of human life\". so many quotable and thoughtful quotes. this is not for sci-fi readers who like action-packed plots - this book has depth, it satisfied me as a realistic portrait of life after an apocalypse. in fact, if there really is an apocalypse, i believe those who had read Earth Abides will be more than prepared to deal with it.","Excellent book. Still current though written in late 1940's. It is a novel that sticks with you. I have read many disaster books, end of world stories, but I have to say this one is my very favorite.","George Steward did a great job writing a novel that is timeless in nature. I thought the book was well written and the characters in the book were believable and down to earth. I could not put the book down. The pace of the book was fast and exciting. Each page of the held a new twist or further clarity in the development of each character. I especially enjoyed the development of the relationship between Ish and Em as it spanned over time and life events. George Steward did a great job writing a novel that is timeless in nature George Steward did a great job writing a novel that is timeless in nature.","I had been really looking forward to this book. Sadly, it really didn't deliver. I found the story telling very linear, the main character Ish, lacking in any real depth and the logic of how he and his small band of people survived, very questionable.I found the first 1/3 of the book interesting. The main character Ish, travels the US in search of other survivers of the deadly plague that ravenged the world. It read more as a travel logue than an sci-fi book, but never the less, was still interesting. However, one would be better served reasing the book, \"A world without us\".Ish, seems nonplused by the vanishing of humanity. The character uses \"logic\" to deal with the situation, but calls those who are enotional or \"crazy\" as being in shock. Frankly, it appeared to me that Ish was in shock, due to his lack of emotion over the loss of basically everyone. It was as if he rationalized it this way, \"wow, everyones gone, oh well, I'm lonely, but that's the breaks\".Finally, gathering enough other stragglers together to form \"the tribe\", they seem to live solely on old can goods from local markers for...22 years!!. I don't know about you, but the last thing I would eat was a can of food that was 22 years old.It appears as if everyone in the \"tribe\" was hit with the stupid stick. Any normal parent would teach their kids the basics of reading and writing, not these folks, it's as if they all just gave up. Plus there is a point in the story where it's highlighted that none of the children even know numbers! WTF? Any normal parent teaches their kids how to count their freaking fingers and toes!Also, the book was written in 1947, yet no one in the book knows a thing about gardening! No one had victory gardens during the war? No one lived on ration cards?It's like all these people dropped out of the sky.There are some many other things wrong with this book, I could go on for pages.Why did I give it 3 stars? 1 for it was a post apocolypic story, the second for the first 1/3 was okay, and lastly, the 3rd star because there were some mildly interesting moments.Beyond that, it's like a group of morons running around in a dark room trying to find the switch.","If you're manic depressive you definitely don't want to read this book. Normally, I love exploring the delicious idea of an end of the world scenario, then having the opportunity to start over. But, I was amazed at how much I hated this book. The characters simply showed little redeeming value and did little but live off the works of the last surviving generation. God, how I slogged through the entire book, hoping that it would get better, that I was going to learn some valuable life lesson or something. It never came. When I finished the book this morning, after reading it in spurts over a period of a month, I really was depressed!The writing is workman like, which is sad, because there's not a poetic line in the whole book, with the exception of the title itself. Oh well.","Having just finished reading Earth Abides, by George R. Stewart, my mind cannot put it down. When I began the book, I expected an apocalypse type novel, and it is that, but it is very much more. I was drawn into the existence of the main character, Isherwood Williams, in such a profound way that I am quite at a loss without him. He is not a formula hero, in that he has human frailties. He is a ponderer and a worrier, much like me. Perhaps that is why I was able to relate to him so easily. He takes nothing at face value, instead he is always fretting, contemplating, and evaluating. His successes are mitigated and his blessings are mixed, as is often the case in real life. There is nothing about the book that is formula, which is a rarity in this genre. On the contrary, it is a truly original work, replete with both adventure and philosophy. The writing style flows beautifully, without an unnecessary phrase or a word out of place. It is a true work of literature, one of the best books I ever read. I am sure that its effect on me will endure, and I will remember this book and its vivid characters for the rest of my life.","I first read this probably 40 years ago and I've re read it over the years, most recently last week.This is a book that stays with you and I was surprised how much I remembered. But I had forgotten just how emotional it was. Stewart's prose seems simple and utilitarian but has real depth of feeling.It's a terrific book.","Very well written and interesting plot. Kept reader wondering what was next. Could not put the book down. I have it on my e-reader and will read again","A friend let me borrow this book to read and I could not put the book down. I do reccommend anyone reading this book, even to this day I still am thinking about the story. It does make you think of how you would be able to work things out when everything you know has disappeared. Great read, I loved this book so much that I had to get a copy for myself!!","I've read a lot of Science Fiction in the past 35 years and found this just ok. I guess I didn't get the underlying message. There was little action, little adventure and basically a bunch of slackers degenerating back into the middle ages. The main character Ish was an odd duck that I could not relate to. I guess I just don't get it.","I felt that this book is very monotonous in how the main character of the book travels around the country looking for people and answers to what happen to the world. he will go in to extreme detail in minor occurrences like seeing something like a body or a hammer. i think this book is very good and has a good plot and deep thesis but i wouldnt recommend this book because it is a slow pace dragging book.","I first read this novel, borrowed from the library, in 1963 and was intrigued by the by the author's detailed descriptions and unique story line. I purchased it in 1987 and re-read it, then loaned the book to a friend and lost track of it - but it was every bit as enjoyable again. Now, I'm 68 and purchased it thru Amazon and re-re-read every word in detail. It is still a tremendously powerful novel and challenges the readers to place themselves in the past and future. What would you do to rebirth a civilization? How could you cope in those first, empty days. What regrets might you have as you witnessed the demise of literature and art? What, then, the consequences as the \"Earth Abides?\"","I realize this is a 'classic' of science fiction, but I couldn't find it in me to really love it. It''s good, but sooo dated in many respects. And frankly, I never really connected with Ish, the main character. Still I am glad I read it, because of its enduring status.","Even at 60 years old this book still resonates as to the plight of man and his insignificance in the universe. Told as a simple story of survival of the species it gives the reader pause for thought about many issues. Well written without much superflous wording. Great detail on the impact of man and what his loss would mean to the planet.","I love the apocalyptic genre. I had high hopes for this book and it started off good as the main character travels across the country during the aftermath of the disease (which he did not witness first hand while it was happening). After he meets up with a group of fellow survivors, they form a small community and from then on the whole book just seems to be pointless and boring. I got excited when the main character's two sons decided to take a trip across country, but the story line did not follow them on their trip and we found out little of what they saw and experienced when they returned. That infuriated me. Overall, this book was disappointing.","I have been a huge fan of the TEotWaWKI (The End of the World as We Know It) genre for quite some time. In a conversation with a fellow fan, I revealed that I have not heard of this book. After the shouts of shock and consternation died down, I was strongly urged to read it.Boring!Most of the book is taken up by the main character (Isherwood Williams) going on and on about what he or others should do. Then he does nothing! It got to the point that, after an actual interaction with another character (rare though they were), I dread the blah-blah-blah that was about to come.The only reason why I finished this book (and kept this from being a single star review) was the insight it provided on the age in which it was written. These are the things that stand out for me:* Being apologetic for not killing or running off the supposed mentally dificient member of the group.* It seeming to be OK for younger folk to painfully pinch very old people when they don't respond as expected (so much for respecting your elders).* The shame in having to bypass a mountain lion rather than killing it.* Killing a calf only for its liver, and killing its mother just because it was in the way.* Fear that a kid may be too smart and the need to keep it from reading too much.* Purposely not using reference material when trying to do something for which they have no experience.* Seeming lack of desire for good food. Whatever is around is good enough. No need to go out of your way to make something good.* The only time sex is implied is for making babies or cast aspersions upon someone's character.This was an exercise in anti-intellectualism and anti-sensualism. I'd rather be killed in the plague than to have to live with this bunch.","I've read many of the \"apocalyptic\" books. This was a quiet one. Since it was written in 1949, that might explain that. It was a pleasure not to see the F-word at all, and so many of the other obligatory modern slang phrases. It did avoid any positive reference to religion, so it is \"modern\" in that respect. Not exciting at all, and somewhat sad. Probably would appeal to women and those who consider themselves as intellectual or literary critics. Me, I just wanted some action from this book--not.","Why is this kindle book \"not available to kindle customers in Australia\"? SHAME on you Amazon. This was the best book I ever read as a teenager and I so wish to read it again","I read this book years ago (in the early 80's I think). It was my first post-apocalyptic novel and there are pieces of it I still remember. When something kills most of the people in the world, Stewart takes us into middle America. A dog named Bridget (I think), an Irish Setter, sits and waits for her people to come home. Bridget's bewilderment and her mourning is what I remember. The protagonist is a teen-aged boy who struggles to survive. Along the way he meets a housewife in her 30's, and she eventually becomes his wife. She's lost her husband and children and there's something she's hiding--a secret that illustrates how the world has changed since 1949 when Stewart wrote \"Earth Abides.\" Earth Abides ends on a positive note with humanity not quite back to square one. If you like \"everyone dies-but-us\" books and you're sick of flesh-eating zombies and vampires, I recommend it.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005F6569Y/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title","I read this book as a teenager. I've shared it with everyone from siblings to grandchildren and they all agree. It's a thought provoking look at a possible future for the earth. A must read for everyone!","This is a remarkable science fiction novel that has stood the test of time. I read it in the early sixties and recently bought it for my daughter.","What an excellent book! I read this on Vacation in Cancun, and couldn't put it down. I may have missed a couple good vacation days totally engaged with this story. Well worth it.","Earth Abides is a great book in general but among its genre its easily one of the best. If you enjoy post apocalypse fiction then this is a must read. No hesitation at a five star review.","Isherwood Williams is away in the mountains pursuing his graduate field studies in geology. In our iPhone, instant connectivity world it is hard to imagine the isolation this kind of trip entailed in the 1950's when George Stewart wrote his book. Recovering from a snake bite, Ish stumbles back from the hills to find most of humanity wiped out by disease. We follow Ish through the remainder of his life as he comes to terms with a changing Earth--an Earth on which humanity is a barely noticeable presence.The absence of humanity is not only a stark fact, but is emphasized by the author's writing style. Ish is a clear introvert and we experience much of the Earth's change through his internal monologue. Even when he encounters, interacts with, and teams up with other people, this produces very little dialogue. This style underscores the aloneness of the book's characters. It's not loneliness, in the emotional sense, but a continuing reminder that other people no longer play a significant role in the world.The Earth itself becomes an evolving character in the book. We experience the successive rise and fall in populations of insects, rats, dogs and other species as seasons in the Earth's changing life. The diminishing resources scavenged by human beings from cities and storehouses are important to their survival, but also serve as markers of change as the Earth sheds the thin layers of Man's influence. This change is not progress, nor is it overly mourned as decline. It is thoroughly described and documented as inevitable change. Ish observes it and reacts to it. But neither he nor the other characters influence its path or pace.Read and compare this book with two other classics of post-Apocalyptic fiction:Alas, BabylonandThe Day of the Triffids. These works also follow their characters through crises, scavenging, and attempts to preserve the technology and civilization of the past. They are both more optimistic and more social in narrative style and in the strategies followed by their characters. After reading them, return to Earth Abides and appreciate it for the melancholy and aloneness felt by both its characters and its readers. It is a good story, a moving experience, and a skillful integration of message and writing style.","The premise of this story is the elimination of 99% plus of the human race as a result of a world-wide plague. The plague only effects humans. All other species of life continues to live and in some cases, thrive. Does that sound like something you've read before? I don't think so. In this story the plague kills slow enough to allow the living to bury the dead, thus the streets are not full of dead bodies and the freeways are empty. The remaining few gather themselves into small \"tribes\". The leader of the tribe in our story was a history professor at a major university which is very close to the location of the University of California, Berkley. As a professor he observes the progress, or regress, of his tribe as a student might and creates a tale that would be appropriate for an Anthropology class.Equally interesting to the \"student\" is the impact on the ecology as a result of the loss of mankind. It is truly amazing how much control man has and the impact of his sudden removal. To give even examples would be to deprive the reader of experiencing it themselves. Although not a long book it covers a period of around 70 years or more. It does so by summarizing periods of 10-20 years into short chapters. The author does an excellent job of maintaining continuity in this manner.I would recommend this book hold-heartedly to the serious reader, not because it is a difficult read, for it is actually quite an easy read, but because it is not an action adventure story but a serious look at the possible destiny of mankind. A destiny which I for one would hope we would be better than. The story was written in 1949 but would vary little if written today. An \"end of earth story\" with a very modern premise would be \"One Second After\" written in 2009 which was fascinating to read back-to- back with Earth Abides and which I will be reviewing separately.","Earth Abides is well worth the read. It is difficult for me to suggest precisely why that is so, thus very little actually happens through the course of the book.I suppose there may lay its charm. It's simplicity seems to add plausibility. My impression is that there was much more hype than the title deserved, nevertheless, it certainly deserves some.","With nearly 300 reviews of this book at Amazon, I hardly have to give a summation of the story. I was swept along by the narrative, and I identified greatly with Ish, the protagonist of this post-collapse novel, perhaps because of affinity with his personality. However, I do not give it 5 stars because I happen to differ with the kind of fall-back-into-pre-literate-history climax. Ish should have done a lot more than he did to preserve literacy and a connection with tradition. True, the memory of the Iliad and the Odyssey and the real horrors of the Holocaust is not something we could describe as essential for the survival of mankind, but I could not blithely accept the disappearance of the history and the literature of our human species. There is much that is terrible in our history, but much also that is heroic and even sublime.However, I must say this book is one that will stick in my mind for a long time, and it is rare today to find a book that will have that effect. Most of the books today that are lauded as \"good reads\" are just entertainment for a few hours but are quickly forgotten. Not so with \"Earth Abides.\" You may argue with certain aspects of the novel, and/or certain philosophical conclusions of its author, but once you've read it, I doubt that you will be able to dismiss it or pretend you didn't spend a few hours with the survivors of \"the plague.\"","I read this book when I was a freshman in High School, after it was assigned by a cool female sci-fi teacher. At the time I didn't care much for reading, but I read Earth Abides cover to cover. The book changed me, turned me into a reader and then a writer. That was over 30 years ago, and still I so often think about various sections in the book. Now, here I am, ready to purchase another copy and reread the incredible novel, just to see again how it still so deeply affects me. Earth Abides is powerful, memorable, and deeply moving--it is everything a book should be.","This is, if not the best, at least one of the best books of its type ever.The story is told with a grittiness that makes every page crackle with life. I read it first in high school, and have read it several times since. I was so happy to see that Del Rey Books re-issued this timeless classic in 2006.A whole new generation of readers will be able to enjoy Stewart's amazing novel.A. C. Ellisauthor ofIn Pursuit of the Enemy,Worldmaker,Soldier of 'Tween, andSHADOW RUN: Book I of The Ancients' War","Isherwood (Ish) Williams has recently finished grad school and is camping in California when he is bitten by a rattlesnake. At first the injury seems minor, but he rapidly descends into a delirium-filled illness. After several weeks, he gradually regains his senses wondering how a simple snake bite could have affected him so strongly. He heads back into town and find everyone gone. It seems a bit odd at first, but Ish thinks to himself that perhaps it is Sunday (he has lost track of time). He eventually comes across a newspaper that describes a devastating plague that has swept across the country, and he becomes aware of the full magnitude of the catastrophe that has struck the United States and the World. What follows is one of the best stories about post-apocalyptic survival ever written.This book is divided into three sections, the first two taking the lion's share of the space. In the first section, Ish discovers the plague, realizes he is one of the few survivors, and decides to take a cross country trek to see who and what else has survived. In the second section, set 22 years after the first, Ish has settled down with a small number of other survivors who start families in the SF bay area. We see the first and second generations of children born after the plague who have no concept or awareness of what we would term modern civilization (and all that implies for better or worse). We follow the slow decay of the remnants of the earlier civilization, and the construction of a new way of life. In the final section, Ish is an old, dying man reflecting on his life and all that has happened. In between each of the three major sections are brief vignettes that cover the major events of the the chapters that are set decades apart.This is largely an introspective tale about Ish's thoughts and emotions as his world crumbles around him and is rebuilt and transformed. If you're looking for a story about a lone survivor battling mutant zombies or some such thing, you'll be disappointed. In the first section, Ish is just trying to make sense of what happened and figure out what he wants to do. In the second, he tries to teach the children of his small community something about what life was like prior to the plague and maintain some continuity with the past. One of the children ask him what an American was, and Ish finds that it isn't so easy to explain. In the third section, Ish is the only pre-plague survivor left in the community, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren now unrecognizeably changed to cope with their new environment. There is some action in this story, but not much. One of the best aspects of this story (and this genre in general) is that the author explores what would happen to all the trappings of modern life if the machinery just stopped. In some ways, the changes would be immediate and profound, in others, changes would take more time.The bottom line is that this sad, introspective tale woven around some Biblical themes is an all-time classic in my view and definitely recommended. There are some outdated (or just plain different) ideas and ways of thinking in this book (Stewart wrote it in the late '40s I believe), but don't let that stop you from reading the book. Stewart conveys a message and asks some questions that are relevant to people and human nature whatever epoch they happened to be born in. People will be reading this 100 years from now. I read this book (along with Alas Babylon) many years ago as a teen and decided to re-read the pair again. There are many powerful images from this book that I still remember now decades later. My view now has changed a bit as I can understand Stewart's central message better, but no matter what you think about this genre in general, this is a timeless story that you'll never forget.","What happens if mankind is almost wiped out yet the infrastruce remains relatively untarnished? What skills are most valuable in such a situation? Once Maslow's hierarchy of needs has been fulfilled, what comes next? Can a society regress but improve simultaneously? Can extreme preventive measures be moral? I love a Mad Max post apocalyptic tale, but the seemingly pedestrian situations and questions posed in this book continue to haunt me long after reading it.","I read this book 35 years ago while in junior high. It captivated me. I pondered (as only an adolescent can) what I would do if I were Ish. What would I do if I came home from a trip into the mountains and found the world dead of a plague. How would I respond? What would I do? How would I survive? How would I cope?I read it again when I was in high school and the same musing returned. I found it in my box of \"things\" several years later when I was 23, after I was married. I sat down that afternoon and read the entire book. Again it affected me - but in a different, more mature way. After I had children, I gave it to my daughter to read when she was 16. She found it to be a very fascinating read on the sociological impact on man of a devastating plague which leaves only a few scattered survivors. I have lent my copy to several people over the years and everyone who reads it finds the book to create emotion and ponder what they would do in such a situation.The mystery and appeal of the book lies in the writer placing the reader into the conscience of the main character named Isherwood \"Ish\" Williams. There are several undertones within the book - one of which is the role of the reluctant leader, the second the \"sacramental\" image of the hammer. It also shows the tendancy of man to desire religion.This book review, I hope, motivates someone to read a book that they may not have read by simply looking at the cover. You will be mesmerized by this well written classic... I guarantee! (I have been mesmerized by it 5 times now in the past 35 years)","I remember first reading this book in High School almost 30 years ago - the story of Isherwood Williams and his struggle to survive in a world where 99% of the people have perished in a biological holocaust. Well written, it keeps the readers attention pretty much throughout. While the book suffers a tiny bit of \"out-dated-ness\" (no mention of cell phones, or the internet) it is still an excellent and well-thought-out read about the demise of our techno-centric civilization. I especially like the way the book takes you through the passing of years, and eventually decades - to a future that makes you step back and say \"Yeah, I can see that happening...\" Enjoy the book, it's a great read!","I just read this book again. I don't know how many times I've read it and I enjoy it each time. I bought it at a used book store in Las Vegas years ago and I'm so glad that I did.","Disappointed. I'm slowly learning to pay more attention to Amazon's negative reviews to get a more calculating grasp of a book's contents.Apparently civilization goes out with a very orderly, civilized whimper. As the police and military forces crumble along with everything else in a matter of months, civil order magically maintains itself with little looting. Perhaps a feasible conclusion to reach, but much more fleshing out was needed to explain the psychosocial motives for such an end to 99%+ of the human race.The author makes no effort to create a story arc--this is a poorly written fictional ethnography, not a novel. The plot mirrors the personality of the plodding, coldly methodical protagonist.Most of the other characters are two-dimensional and cliched, following personality and behavioral stereotypes you'd expect from a 1949 bog standard. While this is feasible /to a certain extent/, the author proceeds with no introspection about it, as though the Leave It to Beaver cast was instantaneously transplanted into a world without people.On the positive side, the author makes distinct efforts to present the ecological side effects of humanity's disappearance. But this saving grace grows old, too, as the novel plods through the decades following the apocalypse.Now that I think of it, I believe that's exactly what the author intended, realism be damned. He imagined a band of primitive hunter-gatherers in the withered skeleton of an American city, and worked backward to see how it would fall into place. Too bad verisimilitude was the first casualty, normally a hallmark of the genre.","I wanted to like this book. I really did...but after getting into it, I had to stop and put it down. The plot is just too unrealistic, and the main character Ish is robotic and boring. As some other reviewers have stated, Ish shows almost no emotion after literally 99.9% of the human race is wiped out. He reacts clinically, robotically, and without apparent emotion after he returns to his parent's house to find everyone dead or missing. \"Hmm, that's interesting. Everyone's dead.\" He takes a freakin' road trip to \"look for survivors\" --yet leaves them all behind--deeming them unsatisfactory companions. This is justified by stating that Ish enjoys solitude. Umm...sorry, I enjoy the outdoors and solitude as much as anyone, and no normal person would react in such a way. Ever hear of the \"mad trapper\" or \"cabin fever\"? That's what really happens to people denied human interaction. Madness. Depression. Paranoia. Suicide. A longing to see another human face.The author, an English professor, must have fancied himself in the role of Ish--a purely logical, Spock-like Vulcan wandering around an empty world. This was a mistake--don't make the protagonist (and hero) of the novel to be a clone of yourself--the savior of the new society, a professor. Gag. I just couldn't buy into that. I also didn't like the author's prose--dry and dull. I can see why some people liked the book, but it just didn't do it for me. I'm thinking things would be a lot more like \"Lord of the Flies\" than \"Earth Abides\"!","The reviews I noticed are fine reports on this fine book. However, one point may have been overlooked. This is the first book I'd read (my first read was back in the 1960s) that used the term ecology. Mentioning this point will deepen the other reviews.","Stewart's books was perfectly creepy and emotional. I identified with the protagonist greatly, and do not feel he was too passive or overly-cerebral. Truth be known, in the few crises I have known, I've often reacted much like him. Okay, I'm a little more attached to things than he is, but I feel this is a plot contrivance to allow the story to go forward.Having read and re-read &quot;The Stand&quot; quite a few times now, I was struck by Stewart's decision (1) not to gather large groups together, (2) not to restart civilization (e.g., electricity, running water, et al), and (3) to cover such a large span of time. &quot;The Stand&quot; covers perhaps up to a year after a plague wipes out 99% of the human race. This book covers over a half-dozen decades. I feel that all three of these decisions demonstrated a far more likely result than King's use of dreams as a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; to gather persons into two camps for the &quot;final conflict&quot; between good and evil.Born in 1976, I am only now becoming aware of these post-apocalyptic classics. I have now finished &quot;On the Beach&quot; by Nevil Shute, &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot; by Pat Frank, and of course this one. The first two dealt with the all-too-real Nuclear Nightmare that even I experienced (though all those younger than me can't even remember there being a USSR). Shute's book was &quot;a stern warning of things to come&quot; and &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot; was more of a man vs. nature story.But this one, it dealt with the nightmare that first captivated me in &quot;The Stand&quot; - a world decimated by plague, leaving the infrastructure intact. While Stewart did not pick up the thread the way I wish he had - that is, some form of civilization being preserved, rather than yet another &quot;Time Machine&quot;-style primitive culture that barely recalls our culture. However, Stewart does spend a great amount of time talking about the decay of this world, and that fascinated me. Storm drains clogging, water seeping into houses and rotting the carpets, termites collapsing houses over the work of decades, dust settling into the corners of the Golden Gate Bridge and grass growing there, and the work of rain and frost on the Northeast roads. All of this riveted me.My biggest complaints are mostly minor, such as (1) how could running water go on for 20 years? (2) why did it take so long for the electricity to run out, and the biggest one (3) why were there no signs of panic (e.g., looting, riots, massive traffic jams as swarms of panicked people ran about in civilization's death throes, et al).My biggest gripe, however, is spiritual. Nobody in this book, even former churchgoers and clergy, feel any need to reach out to God. Admittedly, I'm biased, being a Christian, Biblical scholar, and future University prof. But I am a rational being, and I feel a rational argument can be made for the spiritual side of man, a characteristic that even the protagonist recognizes, even if he can't properly articulate, let alone address, this &quot;God-shaped hole&quot; in each of us.Now, I realize that science fiction, even more than other genres, allow us to paint on a blanked canvas (the devastated world) our worldviews on such things as man's innate goodness or evil, the necessity or redundancy of God (e.g., church, Scriptures, etc.), the expression of our social nature, the necessity (or redundancy) of modern technologically-dependent society, and so forth. I understand that we're not all going to agree; I don't feel it's my job to insist on homogeneity amongs everyone. However, if I wrote a book along these lines, I would make sure to include atheists, skeptics and agnostics, along with members of other religions (at varying degrees of dedication) along with those persons I feel &quot;make sense&quot; from my perspective. While by no means do I feel &quot;all religions lead to God&quot; or that &quot;you just need to be sincere,&quot; I do agree that any description of a post-apocalyptic (or any other) reality, in order to be fair to the multiplicity of human thought and experience, must recognize that &quot;it takes all kinds.&quot;That said, I did find myself chilled by the spiritual apathy evidenced, among other things, by the community's perception of &quot;Evie,&quot; the mentally-challenged pariah. &quot;We don't want no idiot children ruining the gene pool&quot; the protagonist declared in some fashion on numerous occasions. While I may see, in a survival-based world, the necessity of taking precautions, I did feel that the cold and unfeeling attitude (&quot;should we have even let her live?&quot; Ish asks himself repeatedly) was frightfully inhumane. There is no &quot;all are created equal&quot; here, no &quot;all are God's children&quot; here. While I understand expediency, I do not feel it must be carried out heartlessly.However, apart from this one real gripe, I truly do recommend this book to anyone interested by such things, like me. After borrowing this book from a library (copies are hard to find!) I've decided to buy it. I suppose that's the best recommendation I can give...","This novel, Earth Abides, written by George Stewart takes place in San Francisco during present times. A worldwide virus overtakes and wipes out the entire human race, leaving only a select few alive. Of these few is a man named Isherwood who goes in search of other survivors to band with. He meets a woman named Emma and a few other people who start a new civilization. It is not easy, however, and they are constantly hitting head-to-head with nature, fighting for survival. As in any other society, there are some people who challenge the law that was laid down in the beginning. As a result, certain members of the tribe are divided. Unity is essential for survival...will they make it? Only time will tell.The author of this book was probably raised in a Christian environment because there are many Biblical references in this book. For example, one of the characters in this novel is named Ezra, as is an Old Testament prophet. Stewart&#65533;s Christian roots are evident in the way he unravels his novel and the double meanings behind some of his story. For example, a child named Joey is born to Ish and Em that is far more intelligent than any other of the many children. Ish finds hope in this young boy because he knows that Joey&#65533;s outstanding brightness will one day be of great use to future peoples, just as God had much pride in His son Jesus.This novel is a wake up call to the reader in that it brings attention to how weak and vulnerable humans really are. What if mankind were to die today? Would people have their affairs set in order?This novel is a fictional story but has real-life applications. For example, there are real people facing real starvation and shelter needs. Stewart portrays very well the thoughts and feelings of each of the characters, which enhances the story line.Earth Abides is an excellent novel. It is extremely well written and it flows nicely. Anybody thirteen years of age and older should definitely read this book because it captures the reader&#65533;s attention and has the ability to transport the reader to a world no longer inhabited by humans. Younger children may not be able to understand some of the vocabulary in this book and may be easily confused due to the complex plot line. However, I give this book a two thumbs up.","Despite the quality of Stewart's writing, which is elegaic at its best and readable at its worst, this is a very creaky and dated work. Certainly, you have to make some allowances for the culture and time in which books are written, but like John Wyndham, Stewart seems handicapped by an assumption of the rightness of bourgeois values, especially when it comes to women. The book does address this, and in some ways is all about the struggle to maintain these values in a world where they are making less and less sense. But, you get the feeling that, in terms of sociopolitical change (as opposed to the obvious physical change - the old infrastructure has been destroyed), it's a case of 'apocalypse? what apocalypse?'. Stewart's characters are like Hollywood western stereotypes - the men are either upright patriachs or shifty loners; the women are wives and daughters who appear strong but are really just there for breeding and cooking. There are works which do tackle the obvious questions of the use of social roles in a society totally different from that which created them, most notably the vastly under-rated New Zealand film, The Quiet Earth (if I've remembered the name right). Read Stewart by all means: it isn't a bad book, but it isn't the classic it's built up to be.","Many readers will find this book very frustrating. It describes in one lifetime the dissolution of civilization on the planet. We know that if even a handful of humans survive a major disaster they will probably cling to the fundamentals of civilization a bit longer than one generation.In particular we will cling to reading and writing. These are the foundation skills of civilization. Writing systems are one of the foundation stones upon which civilization is built. The notion that we would allow a generation of kids to grow up without teaching them to read and write is tantamount to criminality.But if you stop seeing this as a single generation book, and think of it more as though Ish, the lead character, is able to see through many generations, then the story becomes much more believable.With all the talk of avian flu and the potential for a super virus this book seems eerily relevant to society today. Much more so than when it was written. Throughout the book we have metaphors for the natural balance of nature as we see one rampant population of animals after another expand and then die back to sustainable levels. And the question must always be, is the human population on earth sustainable?The answer is clearly no! And if we don't do something about our population levels and our resource consumption, this book may well represent our future on this planet.","First, I would like to say that just about everything to say about this book has been said. Most reviews are accurate, there are some great characters in this book and Ish does have some intense experiences, however I have mixed emotions as far as this book goes.Ish's long time companion Em, is a reliable and loving character, Ish & The Tribe look to her for strength and wisdom, time & again she delivers. She is loved and respected by all, but when she passes away, her death is all but over in one paragraph. It is similar with old George, he is a lovely character, like a grandfather or old uncle, I would have liked to see a few pages devoted to his passing. This is not the case. This leaves me a little flat.Some parts of the story are deeply moving ie when the boys return after their adventure and a stranger is with them. He is the carrier of desease and when he will not leave when asked, a solution must be found. The elders have to make a decision that chills them all to the bone. Great reading, but when Em & old George die it is almost glossed over.I enjoyed this book, but I would not recommend it as a light read. If you are into PA stories and you like deep intense stories, then I guess this is for you.If you are after action and adventure, stay away.","I know this book was first published in 1949. I can overlook the unlimited shelf life of canned goods and gasoline. It's the main character \"Ish\" who ruined this story for me. He is your typical elitist douche bag who confuses a large vocabulary with intelligence. With a university library at his fingertips, this mental giant could not learn the basics of survival (agriculture, animal husbandry, auto repair, food storage etc...)in his lifetime! I muscled through the book hoping it would redeem it's self in the end, but I ended up losing eight bucks on my kindle and three days of my life. If you want to read this \"classic\" be prepared for constant complaining about the stupidity of others while doing absolutely nothing to better the situation. Hubris abounds with his superior attitude and god complex. He's also a bit of a racist (Not for his use of the word \"Negro\", but for his temptation to use the black people he encounters to make himself king!) and a sexist.","My hobby is reading . I enjoy reading stories. all kinds of stories by bestselling authors or never heard of authors. always looking for a good story. In my search I have read some great stories, some not so great and just plain awful. but only three times have I ever disliked a story where I could not finish it. This story was so bad not only could I not finish it I would like a refund. the story line could of been interesting. The writing was horrible. I hope it is a long time before I come across a book this bad again.","I liked the book but all the characters were technologically ignorant. Even in the forties they had small portable generators but this was ignored in the book. One part of the book basically said they let all the lights go out. People knew about generators then and if not you would've have soon found out.","I'm not talking about the pandemic itself; I'm talking about the aftermath. I found the lack of progress of the human race, as detailed in this book, to be very unlikely. Even assuming that out of initial group of adults in Ish's group, Ish is the only highly intelligent one, I found it really hard to believe that the adults wouldn't bother to teach the kids how to read and do math, so that they'd be able to use the libraries to learn the skills they'd need to survive. It didn't make sense that there would only be two main characters with any sort of curiosity about *anything*. Why was knowledge of carpentry lost when The Tribe's carpenter died? Didn't he train anyone in his craft? Didn't anyone want to learn?I expected this book to outline some sort of return to the land, which would be much more realistic than having The Tribe live off canned food for forty years. This book spends way too much time expounding on how intelligent Ish is without showing him actually doing anything to help the human race.","I had heard excellent things about Earth Abides. I have always liked post apocolyptic books, and this is often the first recommendation by people. I tried reading it once, but thought the writing was detached and boring after a few pages, so put it down, and gave it away. Then, i saw the audio version on sale on audible.com, and downloaded it.I know this book was written in 1949 or something, and those I've talked to, comment on that as if its an excuse for blatant and rampant sexism and racism. But, I'm sorry, there is not accepatance in me for any of this no matter when it was written.The women are portrayed as either blood sucking, parasitic whores or blank and faceless wombs. Even his dog, a female dog, is described as ungrateful, needy and parasitic, expecting to be taken care of without giving anything in return, and provides in no way useful in the way of dogs, that I can remember. She is named Princess.The first non-whites that are encountered are identified as \"Negros\" and are described as unattractive, nervous, hesitant and lice ridden, living in a cabin with cheap and rickety furniture although there are far nicer houses empty for the taking. Our main character trades a dollar bill for eggs, and the \"negros\" are well pleased. So, they are poor, dirty, and stupid.Then, there is our main character, he is an unappologetic arrogant elitist who deems 99% of those he meets as unworthy of living. He decides that they will all die \"secondary\" die off because they are stupid, crazy without will to live. He drives around in his car, looking for people, but yet finding none, eventhough he infact comes across people. None of them are \"worthy\". He even makes a list of why he will survive were the others will die, and the list includes that he is solitary, and never cared much for people anyway. Which seemed strange to me, since he had found 4 or 5 people in one day's search. Its not like the world is entirely empty.I gave it two stars, because initially, I was interested in the observations of the earth and the cities and how nature is taking over and civilization is breaking down, but with no engaging characters or furthering of a worthwhile plot, I quickly lost interest and had to force myself to go on, looking for even a glimmer of the amazement and awe others seem to view this book. I found nothing of the like.","One-and-a-half stars really. Not much happens in this book.The main character spends most of his time musing over the fate of the earth and observing the effects of erosion on human artifacts, now that most of the world's population has been wiped out. One of the racier sections I recall was his observation of a storm water drain overflowing.It took two or three pages.However, the book is readable enough to fill in a bit of time while trapped in a hospital bed for a few days, and might even have earned as many as three stars from me, were it not for the &quot;hero's&quot; much over-inflated sense of self worth which manifests itself on nearly every page, most often by refering in his thoughts to all of his friends as simple, stolid, dull, or just plain stupid.Not to mention what he thinks of those whom he doesn't count among his friends!Maybe we are not meant to like the &quot;hero&quot;, but I think we are, and I can't help thinking that this story could be written by one of those aneamic, spotty, embittered social outcasts that one often finds lurking in the shadows at science fiction conventions, more at home with his onanistic fantasies than with any human being. I quote:&quot;...he realized that in some ways...he felt a new security and even satisfaction at the contemplation of a solitary life. His worries in the old days had been chiefly about people. The prospect of going to a dance had more than once sent him into a sweat; he had never been a good mixer; no one had asked him to join a fraternity. In the old days, such things were a handicap to a man. Now, he realized, they were actually a great advantage. Because he had sat on the edge of so many social gatherings, not quite able to mingle in the conversation, listening, watching objectively, now he could endure not being able to talk, and again could sit and watch, noting what happened. His weakness had become strength. It was as if there had been a blind man in a world suddenly bereft of light. In that world, those with seeing eyes could only blunder about, but the blind man would be at home, and now, instead of being the one who was guided by others, he might be the one to whom others clung for guidence.&quot;His intellectual snobbery becomes glaringly obvious as he begins to meet other survivors, and is at it's most repellant when he discusses &quot;half-witted&quot; Evie, whom one of the other survivors found &quot;dirty, grovelling, and unkempt, living in filth with merely enough intelligence to open cans to feed herself on whatever they contained, without cooking or preperation.&quot; This doesn't seem too much of a crime, and neither does the only other thing that seems to be &quot;wrong&quot; with her, that she can't hold a conversation. Nevertheless, the &quot;hero&quot; goes on to say:&quot;It would have been better, he had often thought, if they had merely put a can of sweet ant-poison within her reach somewhere.&quot; Of course, we must remember that when this book was published, in in 1949, social policy in the US was still under the sway of brianiac and boffin advocates of eugenics, and many &quot;subnormals&quot; and &quot;moral degenerates&quot; were still being sterilized by court order, despite the widespread revulsion over the results of Nazi social engineering procedures based on the same premises. A good antidote to the attitutudes expressed by this book is to be found in Jonathan Kellerman's excellent thriller &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot;, wherein eugenicists lurk behind a spree of cowardly murders. Kellerman's book is also recommended as a healthy locus for introspection by any readers of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; who find themselves agreeing with the &quot;hero's&quot; attitudes and solutions.","Overall this book didn't impress me enough to ever recommend it to anyone else but it also wasn't horrible. The beginning explanation of the plague and the prehistory of the character are so vague that the rest of the book is ruined. Doesn't stand anywhere near books like The Stand or Swan Song.","I would not recommend this book. UNLESS you are having a hard tiime falling asleep!! The main character, Ish is supposed to be an educated man who survives a deadly world wide virus. He uses his aledged power of observation to observe how the people around him, who are incapable of doing anything without his help survive. Unfortunately for the people around him, Ish seams to be unable to do anything but watch and complain.","Earth Abides is a disaster story where aplague almost wipes out humans. Becausewe grew too prosperous we had to die, according to the author, that is just the way things work. So the few survivors get by never trying to improvetheir lives, having no ambition the human race lapses into hunter gatherers with only superstition as a guide. Thisbook is a waste of a good oportunity. Insted of saying &quot;Hey, we can occomplishthings if we work hard and perservier.&quot; The author tells us &quot;Hey, we're almost as good as cockroaches and if we drop our standards, we too can can eek out ameager existence.&quot;I don't have to pay people to depress me, I can do that all by myself. What awaste of time and money.","I read this book a number of years ago, and forgot about it. Recently, I saw it on the shelf, and decided to re-read it. After forcing myself to read it, I understand why it was easy to forget.The main character, Ish, is highly arrogant and self-righteous. Ish, only Ish, has the power to drive civilization back from a total collapse. Ish has a son, Joey, who worships Ish, and Ish drinks it up. Joey is The Saviour, The One, a child who must be taught the abstract ideas which created Civilization. Nothing else matters.The side-characters are all inferior. These are the people with skills to survive. This includes artistic skills which doesn't include the formal education which _must_ be part of any \"real\" artists training.The most interesting part of it all is the background story of how the Earth really abides without Man trying to impose his will. Structures decay due to natural events; forests and wild-life reclaim the land.It may be a classic book, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a good book!","I have been a fan of PA fiction for over 30 years. My first PA novel was the children's novel \"Beyond the Dark River\" by Monica Hughes - a novel which I read when I was eleven. It hooked me on PA fiction and ever since then I have been trying to find as many novels or movies that I could get my hands on.I had read good things about Earth Abides online and was looking forward to reading it. Can I say how disappointed I was? Perhaps it was the era in which it was written, but all I could think of throughout the book is that the new civilization would have been much better off without the pompous a$$ of the main character Ish. \"They thought of me as a God.\" Good grief!If I could have rated this movie a zero I would have. Take this one out of the library if you must, you'll be glad that you didn't waste your money on it.","I've gotta confess I was not very excited to read this book, having obtained on a bargain and postposed its reading for about a year, when I eventually got to it, I was absolutely blown awaythe writting, althought not brilliant, is very polished and takes you throught the wonderful adventure of the end of mankind as we know it, throught the vast territory of a deserted united states, and tells us how it would slowly and rapidly decay in its various facets, until it would stand almost naked, a fertile ground for life anewcoming throught the plagues caused by the broken ecosystems and among the difficulties tapped by the human intervention we give for granted, it sets up a perfect place for the second half of the book, in which civilization begins again, necessarily different of how it came about in the first place, offering us exciting reflections on how we are and how we'd be, on values and life and growth, we age with the original characters, and by the time Ish is an old man we can see this new world throught the eyes af an old man, we understand and are subjected to the same hoplesness as him in the development of the new world, yet the hope of life, free of our cultural bagages and preconceptions, grows and leaves you a great aftertastean incredible novel, terribly underrated, which should be cherished and shared","Several reviews have noted what they call the essential pessimism of the book: Man Has Fallen, Civilization Is No More, etc. Well, yes, that is all there. But what is also there is a profound triumph of the human spirit: Civilization is Dead - Long Live Civilization. I will NOT spoil the ending, but book ends with a rebirth - an obvious societal pregnancy if you will - of a new civilization, one profoundly in keeping with the new conditions of their brave renewed world.One can imagine a sequel, and I wish Stewart ahd written one!I first read this book almost 50 years ago, and have re-read it multiple times. It is one of the best \"transition\" books ever written. I recommend it on several levels.","An astonishing science fiction novel in the apocalyptic vein, written in 1949, and despite a surprisingly few dated references, a story that remains both entertaining and relevant. In the beginning, protagonist Isherwood Williams (with the unfortunate nickname of \"Ish\") is one of the few survivors of a virus that wipes out a majority of the human population. Ish is in his twenties, an over-educated outsider, who stands on the margins of society analyzing and contemplating what he sees. After a solo excursion across the county and returning to the Bay Area, California, he slowly joins up with an assortment of characters, and becomes the de facto leader of \"The Tribe\". The struggles that confront them are meticulously well thought out and explicated by the author while rarely dragging down the narrative. The slow decay of an industrial society with no one left to manage it and the natural environment no longer held at bay serve as the antagonists. There are no sci-fi pulp orientated elements such as giant mutant killer ants (for better or worse). Threatening the Tribe are scourges of rats, wild dogs, and other animals, as various species overpopulate until starvation brings their numbers down again. There are outbreaks of disease to be dealt with and wild brush fires caused by dead trees no longer cleared away. The novel deftly provides details such as what happens to the plumbing when city reservoirs dry up and fall into disrepair. The real strength of the book, however, is how Ish is forced to confront what knowledge and wisdom needs to be passed on to the future generations in order to rebuild society. Hence with his intelligent introspective nature, interwoven into this entertaining story are thoughtful reflections on what purposes societies serve, what they protect us from, and even what they blind us to and cause us to take for granted. This is a timeless classic our own civilization would be mistaken to let slip into the \"out-of-print\" abyss.","Well almost everything has been already written about this book but I have one new curiosity not yet mentioned by anybody. In fact it's this curiosity that caused me to only give it a three star rating. To enjoy this book I had to believe that the handful of survivors world wide all loss basic curiosity. I can understand the total grief, the total denial and complete loss of the few who survive. I cannot understand the total and complete loss of curiosity. All around the survivors they have the tools, the machines and all the books but nobody has any interest in them. The leader of the survivors gives only lip service to the books but does nothing to really grow from them. Nor does he use them to learn the psychology of how to motivate his tribe. He only once attempts to do anything and at that it's only an after thought. He comes up with an idea that sparks the survivors into thinking about rebuilding a jeep but that's all. Aside from this his tribe cares about nothing. His tribe lives only day to day but seem forever lost in the now and blind, uncaring and unwilling to look to the past and what it can offer to help then survive in the future. The author never mentions curiosity or its loss in any of the timeline that the book traverses. It's as if curiosity never was part of humankind. All in all, I could enjoy the book without curiosity but it left me wondering what if it had included it in the story.","This is the 'end of the world as we know it' novel that all others are compared to. Even though it was written in the 1940's (copyright 1949) it is timeless, not aged at all, a great literary work.It all starts when the main character, Ish, is bitten by a rattlesnake and laid up in a remote cabin, unconscious for an extended period of time, while, unknown to him, a plague destroys over 99% of the population. There begins a superb story of the trials and adventures of one man, and eventually a small group of people, as they battle nature and themselves, and attempt to re-establish civilization. This is one of those rare novels where characterization and plot and setting all mesh together into one beautifully written yarn, that after reading it, you will never forget it, it is that powerful. If there ever existed the proverbial page turner, this is it. Of course, being written in the 1940's no mention is made of personal computers, CD players, and the like, but if civilization was gone these most likely would be of little use anyway.The philosophy and human interest angles contained in this book are well done. The scenes and descriptions of the demise of civilization and peoples' reactions to it, depicted by Stewart, seem very realistic. Your heart will be with the characters of this book when you read it.","Earth Abides is a thought provoking look at how the world would go if almost all people were eliminated from the picture. Some very interesting looks at the eco-structure, reformation of small societies and how they would interact from the short term to the long term. The book has some very sad and touching aspects that help you relate to the characters. The technology is a little outdated because of when the book was written but you can get past that. Overall, a very good book. One I would think in a few years I might like to read again.If you liked &quot;The Stand&quot;, and have wondered what would might happen 50 years afterwards. This is the book for you.","I have been looking for this book for a long time. I read this book for an Environmental Science class at Long Beach State about 20 years ago and it made such an impact on my thinking about the environment. Every time I see grass growing up through the cracks in the street or the roots wrapping around pipes I think of the book. While the environment seems quite fragile, it appears that it is not a fragile as we think and we are the fragile ones.","Let's start with the book's obvious problems. First, the author is a creature of his times -- the 1940's, and his views relect those times. He is paternalistic towards African Americans and women, and he feels that people without much formal education are not very smart or capable. Second, his main character, Ish, is not likeable; he is lazy, selfish, unloving (for the most part), rather anti-social, inflexible, and egotistical. (I am not sure that the author intended Ish to be unlikeable, as Ish is also a creature of his times.) Third, the author's view of the post-apocalytic world does not ring true; even given the dolts that the author has chosen to survive this catastrophe, surely more of the modern world would have survived -- at least for a few generations. (Example [MILD SPOILER]: would middle-class Americans ever decide not to teach their children to read? If there ever were a group of people who needed to know how to read, it would be this new generation!) Fourth, I do not find the biology/physics of this new world to be believable. (Example: where did all of the bodies go?) Fifth, the \"mother earth\" motif that runs throughout the book is hackneyed -- though, in fairness, it might have been fresh in the 1940's.Still, I liked the book. It is a book of ideas dressed up as a post-apocalyptic tale. What does it mean to be human? How does one balance the needs of the group against the needs of the individual? What is culture? What aspects of life/culture have value? What is love? What role should religion play in society? What role should education play? How does one go on after a devastating loss? How can people relate across generational lines? Can one generation truly lead another? What is happiness? What skills in life are most important? When is violence justified? What does death mean? How does one motivate and lead others? What does \"fun\" mean? How do small group dynamics play out? What function do rituals and symbols play in life? How do cultures adjust to rapid change?I did not usually agree with the author's answers to these questions (when he provided them), but they did challenge me. I have thought a lot about the book since completing it.","I agree with another reviewer who said it is a measure of this book's greatness that I still think of it now, fifty years after I read it.Fire, by the same author, is also unforgettable.This from a guy who can re-read a mystery he read three years earlier and not remember who done it.","A horrible disease sweeps the planet in days, killing just about everyone. Isherwood Williams is for some reason spared from this plague, and finds himself a survivor in a barren society. The book follows the course of his life, and that of other survivors, as they live out their days in a new world.My opinions ran wild with this book. For reason I will explain further along in the review, I started out very much enjoying the book, then my interest waned, and finally something clicked into place in my pea-sized brain, allowing me to finish the book on a strong note.I found it very easy to step into the mind of Ish. He reacted in a way to his situation that I felt was very natural, while learning how to cope with life alone. I don't want to give much of the plot away, but roughly the first third of the book deals with Ish's life alone. Ish starts out as something of a loner and a worrier, and seems to adjust to the world...for a while. Soon, he becomes desperate for a purpose, and with that notion, sets out to find out \"what happened\".Later, Ish struggles with his own weaknesses while trying to decide how to save the future. Through it all, Stewart keeps the characters consistant. I found it refreshing that he didn't try to thrust someone into the heroic role. For whatever reason, this earned him a good amount of credibility with me.A note on the writing style; I believe this book was written in 1949, so the flow of the book seemed a little odd to me. Some of the conversations just didn't flow well, and I chalked that up to the age of the book. On the other hand, Stewart's timeline fit right in with the world we live in today, and did not really date the book. Except maybe for spraying DDT around like it was air freshener.Around the middle of the book, I started to lose interest. I guess for me the story sort of bogged down with Ish trying, and consistantly failing, to get his people to try to focus on the finer things in life. As I said earlier, when things finally \"clicked\" for me, I found myself appreciating this part of the book more, as it fit in very well with who Ish was and what his purpose was.The ending was just magnificant. I very much felt what Ish was feeling, and clearly saw that he had finally accepted that things were going to work out for his decendants, even if things didn't turn out exactly as he had planned. I can't stress enough how good of a job Stewart did with the ending.This is not an action novel, and at points did become a bit too philosophical for it's own good. For me, it all came together at the end, but it might turn some people off. Also, as mentioned above, the writing style can seem a little strange, but overall this book shot far up my favorites list. This book easily get's five stars from me.","EARTH ABIDES is such an amazing book. In fact, I happened to keep my high school copy rather than returning it before graduation. Deep down, I think my teacher knew and was happy to take the loss.I have three books that I will not part with - EARTH ABIDES, THE STAND, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. EARTH ABIDES and THE STAND have a lot in common. I am surprised, as were others, by all of those who gave this book such a low rating.The story tells the tale of a college student, Ish, who is working on his thesis up in the mountains. He gets bitten by a rattlesnake and heads to lower ground for help only to discover the human population has been wiped out thanks to some weird plague. The story becomes Ish's quest to live as supposedly the last human on earth.First, I want to clarify that this book was written in the 1940s. Those who complained about the writing being poor, one guy even said the book was written in the 60s and he is wrong, need to look at the times. The world in the 1940s was far different to today. If you cannot adapt to the language differences, skip this book. While I find it rather narrowminded, I also understand the world is full of people who just can't stand something that is different to the norm.In the 1940s, they didn't have the computers, men were working away from their family farms, they'd become used to modern technology, so it isn't surprising that Ish would have allowed so many things to slip by for decades. If the world ended tomorrow how many can honestly say they would know how to irrigate their crops? How many even know how to garden?At heart, EARTH ABIDES needs to be viewed with the consideration of the differences in time. It is and always will be my favorite book.","I am a 62 year old grandmother who has read hundreds of books, but no book ever moved me like this one. It is the story of one thoughtful, intelligent young man spared during a world wide epidemic that wiped out most of the population. While we always expect that the end will come with a bomb that distroys everything, this time, all the infrastructure was left intact. The plants and animals that had evolved to be dependent on humans also succumbed and Mr. Stewart deals with this in a remarkable and sensitive way. Today human beings have brought civilization to the brink, but this book reminds us that no matter what, the Earth Will Abide.","However, if you want Mad Max or his clones go elsewhere. Since I read this book back in grade school it has always been on my shelf, in fact I usually have 2, one personal copy and one copy to give to friends. I read many of the reviews of this book and wonder if some of these people read the same book. To me Earth Abides is one of the most uplifting books ever written. This book shows that no matter what comes, life and happiness will happen. No matter all Ish's failings to teach his people, his Greatgrandchildern are happy, they do not miss what they never knew. He teaches them to survive and they will teach themselves the rest. Again I say if you are looking for an actionpacked end of the world book I would recommend Daybreak-2250 A.D. by Andre Norton. However if you want one of the best books written that will make you think about humanity and all its failings and gifts, READ THIS BOOK! I just wish I could have given it 15 stars instead of just 5.","Ish, a college student, survives a rattlesnake bite and mysterious illness alone on a mountain camping trip. When he recovers, he can't find anyone and slowly realizes a plague has wiped out the human race. He wanders across the country, finding only a few stunned survivors and makes an intelligent and courageous decision to not join the first people he finds. After a period of terrible isolation, he finds Em, a true survivor like himself. They are happy together and attract five other survivors. A tiny little tribe grows around them. Ish devotes his life to trying to bring back civilization as he knew it. He fails at his superficial efforts at farming and at educating the children. He succeeds beyond his deepest dreams at giving his descendants the tools they need to create a healthy, happy way of life. The novel works as a thought-provoking study of what do you do when the world collapses around you. It has some weaknesses. Here and there, the fact it was written in 1949 shows. One can argue that Ish would have been able to get the children to read if only he hadn't been such a boring pedant and he could have been a better farmer if he'd been willing to explore alternate ways and crops. The book's strengths greatly outweigh its weaknesses. For one thing, with not much action, it's a true page turner. This is a fantastic novel to discuss and to argue about and to ponder the fundamental question it raises. What would you do for the rest of your life if you survived the end of the world?","First off, I should state that this novel was written in the late forties, and thus reflects many of the prevailing attitudes of the time. It is rather sexist, and even vaguely racist (although neither element is malicious, just ignorant) so if you think that may ruin the novel for you, then you probably want to skip it. That said, if you can look at \"Earth Abides\" in the context in which it was written, you will find a thoughtful, entertaining novel.\"Earth Abides\" is predicated on a super-virus wiping out the overwhelming majority of the Earth's human population, while leaving the rest of the animal kingdom unaffected (at least directly). The story follows \"Ish\" as he struggles both to survive, and come to grips with the loss of civilization. Over time, a community of survivors gels around him, and they work to scratch an existence out of the ruins of San Francisco.Stewart takes a rather bleak view of the survivors of the holocaust, not to mention their children. Rather than trying to reestablish \"civilization\" they slip into a more or less Stone Age existence, supplemented by the leavings of a culture they are completely alienated from, and that is not understood by the children at all. While I understand that Stewart was seeking to comment on what makes up a \"civilization\", and what the natural human condition is, or should be, I think he introduced an element of wishful thinking into his narrative (strange as that may sound). It is extremely unlikely that things as fundamental as literacy would completely disappear within two generations, and while they might very well fail, I suspect that survivors would at least attempt to maintain electricity, water supplies, etc.Where this novel really shines, and what I found most interesting to read, was Stewart's descriptions of the ecology of a North America largely depopulated of humans. He does a superb job of predicting the fluctuations in various animal populations, and I believe that the long-term balance that he predicts is probably not far from what would actually happen.Ultimately, \"Earth Abides\" is an entertaining novel that leaves one thinking about how they would react in similar situation. While I don't necessarily agree with the way the novel plays out, I was constantly challenged to come up with an explanation as to why I thought things might be different. In the process, I gained a deeper appreciation for the depth of Stewart's characters, and the challenges he pitted them with. If you enjoy \"apocalyptic fiction\" this is definitely a book for you, but even if you have not strong feelings for the genre, I suspect you will enjoy the excellent characterizations, thoughtful story and wonderfully realized world.","This book attempts to answer the age old question, \"what will earth be like without humans?\". In a word, BORING, just like this novel. Don't get me wrong, there are some great parts to this novel with real drama and action and intrigue and heart-wrenching feeling. Unfortunately, those parts are few and far between, and they are between mountains of tedium and monotony. I will give George R. Stewart credit for doing his homework scientifically, historically, culturally, etc, and I have no doubt that if a horrible plague ever wiped out nearly all of the human race, this is probably a really accurate depiction of what would occur. However, and this is why i give this book such a low rating, there is a vast difference between writing an accurate book and an entertaining one. In many ways this book is very similar to other post apocalyptic novels like The Stand, The Road, The Book of Eli, On the Beach, etc etc etc, however, where those novels shine and where this novel falls flat is in the art of story-telling. Basically, this novel has no story other than the mere survival of the last remaining humans. There is no plot, no antagonist (unless you count harsh nature herself), no great task to complete, no long journey to take, and no lesson to be learned. When gone is the human race, the earth and everything on it will still be here, and in the closing words of the author, \"Humans come and go, but the Earth Abides.\"","I really enjoyed this novel from the apocalyptic genre very much. It was not a fantasy good versus evil type of story but rather a speculative look at how civilization might fare if there was a sudden die-off of 99% of the population. In this story there is a sudden plague of such devastating severity that nearly everyone is dead within a couple of weeks of its outset. This book does not focus on the plague or the sufferings of the infected and dying people. No grisly oozing bodies are found in these pages and very little trauma or grief. We enter the picture shortly after the dust has settled, so to speak. The story is not about the plague but about its aftermath. It is told from the perspective of one man who survives and traces his experiences as he goes in search of other survivors and finally settles back in his native California and makes the foundation of a new \"tribe\" of civilized human beings. This book was written in 1949 so it is doubly interesting because it not only gives us a look at the author's speculation about the factors that make up civilization and the interesting trials and successes that might arise, but it also gives us an amazing look at the huge changes that have taken place in our consciousness just in the short period of years since it was written. It has the unexpected bonus of actually confirming some of the points the story originally was designed to suggest. Even though the author seems as though he was an open-minded, perhaps even liberal thinker, the book contains ridiculous racial stereo-types, as well as skewed ideas about the personhood of mentally disabled people and also of women. Women are shown as being entirely domestic and dependent. Cigarette smoking is still very much a happy pastime in this brave new world and is enjoyed by men and their pregnant wives without a care in the world. When a plague of ants becomes a problem the main character, Ish, sprays himself and his pregnant wife down thoroughly with DDT, a substance that is used several times in the surviving world to overcome pests. I found these old-fashioned ideas very interesting when coming from a \"reasonable\" man that no one of his time would have considered to be prejudiced. The book is a thought-provoking page-tuner. I kept imagining that I would have done things in a much different way from the main character but I found the ideas and reasoning to be essentially sound and worth contemplating. This is an interesting look at how the Earth might rid herself of the virus called mankind and is certainly a good look at the power of her self-healing capabilities. I definitely recommend this book.","I first read this book when I was 8 years old. My dad had left it out and I grabbed it up and read it. Even at 8 years old I found this book gripping and thought provoking. As I grew older I would find a copy and read it, and each time I would gain something new from reading this book. I am 45 years old now and I am feeling the urge to read it again. I think the reason why the survivors did not \"rebuild civilization\" was because they were all in shock--their whole world (friends, lovers, children) had been wiped off the face of the earth almost overnight. If you add to this the author's stated premis that the survivors were mostly average to dull, then the story makes more sense. I recommend this book to anyone, it's a sci-fi classic. I also think the movie \"The Omega Man\" might have been inspired by this book.","Many reviewers here expected something different, I think. They are dismayed.They have all the elements properly arranged but do not see how they add up. Ishi characterizes himself as intelligent and the others as inferior to him in cognitive ability, yet he fails in almost all his undertakings.At the first sign of trouble he goes home and sleeps in his boyhood bedroom, then returns there and takes up a permanent residence in the old home place -- this infantile reversion is culture-shock but he can't see it. He is supposedly trained in ecology but is taken by surprise every time the local ecology adjusts itself to mankind's absence -- this emphasizes the futility of a college education in a survival situation. He carries a prejudice against negroes yet marries a mulatto and doesn't even realize it at first -- his blindness extends deeply within him. He tries to educate the youngsters but cannot hold their interest -- he is too disconnected from their reality. He has in front of him all the ingredients for success -- yet fails on his own terms, which are unreal.And yet, he does succeed, doesn't he? In spite of himself he does manage to attract a group which survives and stays together. Gradually over the course of his life he becomes ever-farther removed from reality, while the children take over the lead. They develop the skills they need to live in the new world almost while Ishi is not looking -- they become \"wild Indians\" wearing skins and shooting arrows.Ishi was the name given to the last member of a tribe of California Indians, the Yahi. In 1911 he was brought in by white society and nursed back to health by the Kroebers, with whom he lived. The Kroebers were a university couple, anthropologists. Their daughter Ursula was born in 1929 and grew up with Ishi in the house. Ursula's married name is LeGuin; she has won many awards for her science fiction. (Google 'Ishi' and see.)Ishi also is the short form of Ishmael, a name for the Wandering Jew of legend; Melville's \"Moby Dick\" begins with the sentence, \"Call me Ishmael.\"In short, Ishi is sort of the Dagwood of survivalists. Arnold Schwartzenegger would not star in the film version. Despite his shortcomings and failures, life actually does go on. In fact he is a lot like you and me. How well do we know ourselves? How well do our everyday decisions turn out? Once Ishi says to heck with it and lets things slide, things get better just like in real life.Stewart's genius was to place these things before us and then get out of the way. He has placed hints in the text, the italicized passages which give us objective truth, sandwiched between Ishi's misadventures. What he is saying is, in despite of ourselves, Earth Abides.If you enjoy the subject, try Walter Miller's \"Canticle for Leibowitz\", or Clifford Simak's \"City\" or David Brin's \"The Postman.\"Dave","I enjoyed this one. It is a very good read and certainly gives us some food for thought. We do need to remember when this one was written as to social attitudes, etc., but if we keep this in mind, it is good. I suppose you could read the book for it's social commentary, relate it to unspellable philosophical stances, blah, blah, blah, as one reviewer did, or you can read it for a very nice story to read on a rainy weekend. I enjoyed it, will probably read it again and highly recommend it.","I read this book about half way in sophmore year, and quit reading it. Now I'm 20 and I decided I'd give it another try. I have about 60 pages left, and I gotta say, this book is one of the slowest I have read, up there with the lord of the rings fellowship. I know it's a classic, but man, I can't even read this book for more than 30 min. at a time. Usually I blaze through books within a few days, but I'm probably on a month and a half with this book. I work a lot, so I dont usually have much time for reading except while I'm going to the bathroom and before bed, but wow. I mean the book is ok, it's not bad, it's just not a pageturner, which is what I usually go for. The main character Ish is very paranoid, thinks to far into detail over everything, and is in my opinion is a coward. I also feel like there is too much side tracking in this book. It's also very repetuous. I feel like there is too much thinking and too little action about anything. In some ways I relate to the main character, because I overthink a lot of things, I'm not the biggest strongest guy, nor the most handy, but that doesn't make it any more interesting of a read. It kind of defeats the purpose of me reading a book. I read to meet interesting characters, be engrossed in a story that is not mine, and to entertain my mind. I don't want to read about a character thinking. If i did want to read about that, I would read a philosophy book and do the thinking myself, or better yet, I'd read nothing and just think. When I think of books taking place in a post apocalyptic world, I think of a little bit more than this gives you. There could have been a lot more interesting scenarios in the depicted world than the one focused on in this book.I will say though that this book does use an interesting vocabulary, and I've learned a few new words. And the part's in Itallics are by far the best parts of the book. These parts do truly make an impression in your mind, and I would rate these as 5 star. Some of the itallicized parts are very deep and meaningful. I love this quote out of one of those parts \"Between the plan and fulfillment stands always the frail barrier of a human life\"Overall: Id say it's worth reading, but it's by far not the best book ever like some of the other reviewers are saying. I liked Cormick Mcarthy's \"The Road\" as a post apocalyptic story better, it seemed more real, and it moved at a quicker pace.","I read this book when I was in middle school, probably 1982, and it's impressive that it seemed futuristic even at that time when it had been written decades earlier. With the imminent release of \"I Am Legend\" I was reminded of this book again as a different take on post-apocalyptic literature.I said it was memorable but flawed because it gave an interesting early look at the idea of a pandemic, and the aftermath of such, but didn't seem to give a realistic take on the survivors' civilization. Why would people suddenly give up their institutes of religion, for example? Historically, when has this happened? He has black people in the south growing cotton \"just because\" and worshipping crocodiles (I don't know if this was a racist component or not.)In the end, his view was rather too cynical and unrealistic about the way people react to the loss of technology. Technology isn't what makes people great, it is their values. I think he didn't realize that.","I first read this book in high school -- 1964! And, loved it soo much I &quot;forgot&quot; to return it to the library &lt;blush&gt;. I've re-read it numerous times over the years and enjoyed it every time. I hope you enjoy it, too. It's a tremendous read.","If you like post-apocalyptic sci-fi, as I do, you'll probably enjoy this book. The book starts out strongly but peters out toward the middle after the narrator settles down and becomes embarrassingly introspective about how himself and what it takes to build a civilization. Parts of the book are clumsily written and pretentious. If you want better apocalyptic fiction, try John Wyndham or John Christopher.","I love end-of-the-world fiction. Call me a gourmand of it, if you will. Well, one story I had missed was, &quot;Earth Abides&quot;. So, I read a lot of reviews here at Amazon and I decided to buy it.I gave it three stars because I did not finish it. Usually, I can read anything. Even bad fiction becomes a challenge to conclude; disappointing fiction is a different story. It's just isn't my type. Though, I can appreciate what others see in it.Summary: A fellow goes off hiking and is bit by a rattlesnake. After his near-death experience and recovery (lasting about 2 weeks), he comes back to society to find no one home. The book follows his life as he: travels, struggles, meets other survivors, starts a fledgling society.The strengths of this book encompass one man's struggle to survive an unthinkable situation. It is wonderful at explaining some the effects of a global disaster in which only the people are gone. Our ordinance remains. But all eventually decays. The next generation of human society loses it cerebralness, but gains an innate link to the earth. Man exterminated by a virus with extreme prejuidice has now become just a creature not a ruler of the earth.In fact, just as I am typing this out; I am getting excited to read it. But, here come the negatives.The weaknesses are few, but very important. Characterization. Stereotypes abound, while the earth abides. Women are merely wombs needed for their matronly duties. Which would be true in this case. But there is no other extrapolation of feelings and thoughts for the women other than a prehistoric regression of their being and worth. All other characterizations are weak. The protagonist grows on in years but not in emotional or intellectual depth.There are other things that I did not like in the book. When things start to break down, our hero does nothing to stop it; even when he has others to help him. On grand scale, when the infrastructure fails, nothing is done. Not even attempted. One man may not be able to save a power plant or water system. But a group could. Well, possibly. After all, they have all the time in the world. Even if the those infrastructure repairs are ignored, what about personal systems? Our hero is a graduate student in Geology, and this book was only written 50 years ago. The Cold war is in it's infancy. Bomb shelters, survival gear are not unheard of. Oh well. That's what I don't like.Conclusion: I think if I was a teenager I might have read this book differently. But being in my early 30s and a scientist skews my notion of this type of fiction. Please read this book. You may be able overlook, or not even think what I pointed out were points against it. Personally, I'd suggest reading, &quot;The Stand&quot;, &quot;Warday&quot; or &quot;I am Legend&quot;.","I hate this book. I truly hate it, more than any other novel I've ever read outside of fundamentalist hate-drivel. That's saying a lot for me, given that I love reading and I particularly enjoy sci-fi books and those with apocalyptic themes (morbid, yes, but what can you do).The reason I loathe this book with the burning fire of ten thousand suns is the blobs of useless goo that pass for the main characters. They don't DO anything. Sure, they do the usual things like eating and sleeping and scratching their nether regions, but that's about it. As I read through this train-wreck I wanted to grab a bullhorn and scream into the book for them to do something, ANYTHING, to better their situation or try to learn something new or to show an emotion of any kind. The author has the main characters sitting around and eating out of tin cans and twiddling their thumbs for-get this-forty-two YEARS. Not a few months while they get the hand of harvesting fresh food, not a year or two while they learn new trades or research better ways to go about things, but forty-two freaking years.They don't even bother to teach their kids to read. There's one kid named Joey, whom the main character Ish keeps thinking, \"Garsh, he's the one!\" (repeated often), and ponders the possibility of teaching this precocious seven-year-old how to read, but Joey suddenly dies of illness. Presumably, so does civilization, because the passel of thirty-odd other kids running around at this point are deemed by Ish to be either too stupid or too disinterested for him to bother getting out of his Lay-Z-Boy and teaching them the ABC's. Obviously the author has never been around children. The ONE thing he does teach them, and he refers to this as his \"legacy,\" is to show them how to make a bow and arrows.The basic message of the book is \"Yup. We're screwed, folks, so give up early.\" Frankly, if I had been in the situation that these main characters were in, I'd do my damnedest to rebuild and make use of the remaining human world around me. I'd teach my kids how to read and how to use all the technology around them, and if I didn't know how to use something I'd find out how. I'd learn to farm and how to turn the electricity back on and basic medical care. I sure as hell wouldn't be sitting around for forty-two years staring at the wall.The only thing that kept the first half of the book from being used as toilet paper (don't ask about the other half) is that Stewart drops in the occasional interesting factoid about what would happen in nature if there suddenly were no longer any human beings. These facts are nicely offset from the story, set in their own paragraphs and in italics, so if you're interested in this sort of stuff you can skim through and read them fairly quick.","I was looking for a good \"end of the world\" type novel, and after the amazing reviews, chose this one. Disappointed hardly describes it. This is one that as a quick reader (usually finishing a novel in less than two days) it took me over a week of forcing myself to keep picking this back up. This was so anti-climatic it was boring.The most interesting thing about the story wasn't even told! One day, Ish wakes up to the aftermath of a world stripped of most humanity. Personally, I would have liked to read about the actual acts of the end of days, not the leftover start over.So Ish decides to drive all over the U.S. just observing, meeting some people along the way. Again, pretty dull. It is described well, and the writer is a good writer, but he doesn't seem to have anything to tell. He could have had more conflict, more interesting character, but it lacked this. In fact, until the end of the book, I didn't even know how old Ish was in the beginning. For a book that focuses on this main character, and pretty much the first quarter of the book is all about Ish, there is very little backstory and knowledge of him. Unacceptable.Instead the focus is on everything going on, well not going on, around Ish. The lack of people. The mess. The fires and fallen trees. Where has electricity and where doesn't. The looting.The most interesting thing he actually wrote about was the rise and fall of other species. I would have LOVED to read more about THAT! However, his telling of the ants, which was brilliant, was summed up in a few paragraphs while he took ages to tell the most boring parts.It also was unbelievable to me. Granted, this was written in the forties. But I hardly think for as long as time passed, even in simpler times, that people would live as they did without making more adjustments until they absolutley had to. I suppose some people might be that way, and I guess we'll never know until it happens.Honestly, I would have been more interested in reading about the other survivors than Ish, who was a procrastinator and thought very little of those closest to him.I would not recommend this book. Yes, it does stick with you. But not in a good way.","This book sucks. Cars don't run on 20 year old gas, canned goods go bad after time, You should probably learn how to grow your own food and get your own water before 20 years has passed... This book is not only dated, but just plain stupid in it's aspects of survivalism.","First, let me start off stating that I know this is suppose to be a classic; however, I found little to like in this book. It is a very, very long story where nothing happens...really. After a couple hundred pages I started to skip forward, looking for something to peak my interest. Nothing ever happens in this book...let me sum it up for you. 1) Plague, 2) a few people find one another, 3) they plant plants, 4) they plant more plants, 5) they watch the ants and rats die out, 6) they have kids and scribble on a rock for 20 years, the end.If you want to read a great post-apocalypse book, get One Second After or The Road. Either of these books blows this dull piece out of the water.","Great book. I really enjoy apocalyptic fiction. I have read a lot of it and this one has got to be towards the top of my list.This book takes on more of an human approach to the end of the world. There is not a great deal of action but the pace does not get sluggish. Unlike most end of the world fiction this one has a much broader scope and looks at the future of a \"Tribe\" of survivors instead of just the main character. Plus in most of these type of stories there is one main challenge and once that is defeated the story ends and that is all. Not at all the case with Earth Abides.The best part of the book for me was the 2nd half. There is a heart touching story of the main character and his son. Since I can't give away any spoilers it is hard to say what I like about the end other than the way the book hints at what life has become but only through glimpses of the main character.The reason I didn't give it five stars was the length. While it never drags it could have had some parts cut out and not effected the book at all. In fact, more than once I read something went to the next page and read such a similar page that I went back to make sure I had really turned the page. It only happened three times tops but still you start noticing that there could have been some trimming done.Great book, cheap book, fun read.","I wandered in here and was suprised to see that the book was still in print, and how many people had read and loved the book. This was recommended to me about ten years ago by the author's grandson, and I agree with many other readers. It is a timeless and thought-provoking end-of-world scenario. It is a strong argument for compulsory education as well. Very enjoyable.","A half-century ago, Stewart saw too clearly a future which could, indeed may yet, come to pass. He, and only a few others, survive a world-wide plague. How he attempts to preserve his society - how he prioritizes, what agonizing choices he and his 'flock' make, the compromises they have to accept - makes for among the finest end-of-the-world books ever written. Ish, the main character, is no less uncertain, no less fascinating, than Macbeth. Ish is clearly the everyman each of us could see in him/herself after a catastrophe impossible to imagine. A long book - it could be no less - by its end, one hopes for a sequel. It is not clear whether Stewart is optimistic about this future - and that too is appropriate. For every reader will probably come to a different conclusion as to where the 'tribe' is headed based on his/her own perceptions of what Ish did correctly or otherwise and what the reader might have done differently. No modern home library is complete without Earth Abides.","George Stewart provides a compelling &quot;thumbnail&quot; picture of mankind and how adversity can bring out the best and worst in people. This mini-saga is so well written and loaded with such a rich mix of characters and situations that the reader cannot help but wonder what tomorrow might bring. If you enjoyed Sarum you will love this","I was introduced to this book at a time when the world was beginning to fully envelope the &quot;benefits of technology.&quot; As part of the computer generation, for whom the desires of the world could be acquired at the click of a mouse, Earth Abides awoke in me a deep appreciation for the distance we have come and the importance of the most basic lessons in life. For more than 15 years I have been looking to recapture the insights I discovered in reading the book as an impresionable teenager. How ironic that is technology that now presents me with the opportunity to read it again","I have spent twenty years &quot;selling&quot; this book to friends and acquaintances as a must read. Some &quot;got it&quot;. Others didn't. Read it. If you &quot;get it&quot;, you will re-read it many times again! If you &quot;don't&quot;, hey, it takes all kinds","This magnificent book tells the story of one man's struggleto recreate and rebuild society in a world where societyhas abruptly ceased to exist. Set in the Bay Area and rifewith haunting moral and ethical questions. Every student -heck, every HUMAN - should read this one at least once. I'vebeen through it more than ten times since I read it incollege. TIMELESS.","As the lead character copes with the demise of civilization, we find an elegant creativity that challenges the mind and helps us see the world in new ways. This is one of the greatest books I've ever read and certainly one of the most haunting. I strongly recommend it to anyone. Another along the same lines is Malevil","This in one of the finest &quot;Last Plague&quot; genre I have ever read. Fascinating from beginning to end. It is the ACKNOWLEDGED inspiration for THE STAND by Stephen King !!","Facinating concept. It's far ahead of it's time. Written in 1949 it could easily be updated to any time. It must have caused quite the controversy when originally published. Each time I've read it, I've found something new. A perfect book for discussion groups","Lost Books -- Review Number 1 Earth Abides by George R. Stewart D. D. Shade 6/11/98Had Isherwood Williams lived to see our day, with it's social and political decay, he might not have worried so much about &quot;preserving&quot; our culture. As it happens in George R. Stewart's book, the devastating viral plague that cleanses the earth of nearly all human life occurred approximately 50 years ago. Long before the assination of John or Robert Kennedy or Martin Luther King, Jr. Long before the war with Vietnam. Before we put a man on the moon and then cut the space program. Before the pervasion of television and the computer revolution. Before the escalation of the cold war, AIDS, or most of the great serial killers. In other words, Earth Abides takes place in a time that many Americans with gray hair look back upon with nostalgia. The post World War Two years, when those of us between forty and fifty were born. The boomer years. A time of great prosperity. A decade that saw the birth of rock-n-roll, hamburgers, and Oreo cookies. Yet it was a time of great poverty for some. When restrooms, restaurants, and the seats in public transportation were separated by the color of ones skin. When equal pay for equal work was unheard of and a woman's place was in the home. A time when the word 'communist' was the dirtiest and deadliest thing one could call another. An altogether strange time, know as the fifties. It is into this world that Isherwood suddenly finds himself alone. Victim of a freak snakebite while out in the wilderness working on his graduate thesis and survivor of an even more freak accident, the development of a viral plague that wipes out humankind in a matter of weeks. It is altogether fitting that someone named Ish, this is how he signed his name to a hand scrawled will while delirious from the snake bite, should find himself alone in the world. Ish, David Pringle tells us , is a direct reference to the historic Ishi, a California Indian who became famous as the last living representativ! e of his tribe. Ish spends at least a quarter of the book searching for others. He finds a few, lucky people with great immune systems, and in the process stumbles upon the woman with whom he shares the remainder of his years. Together they try to build a community and at the same time rebuild civilization as they had know it. You will have to read the book to learn of Ish's heroic triumphs and failures as he tries to make sure the future has a heritage. Although following the traditional post-apocalyptic formula, that of the earth being cleansed by some means and leaving a few to rebuild civilization, Earth Abides offers some interesting commentary on some central moral questions of our/that time. One of those is racial unrest. Given the nature of European and African American relations in this nation in 1949, Stewart was taking a quite a risk when he developed one particular central character, Em. Ish chooses a strong willed, able, out-spoken, African American woman to be his mate. She was not the first female Ish found, nor was she the best looking, but she had within her the strength to become the mother of a new civilization. Ish recognized this and fell in love with her quickly. And Ish was right-Em alone had the strength and courage to bear the first child in the small community that had grown around them. There was no one who knew how to deliver a baby, and that was frightful enough, but the greatest fear was not knowing if children born into the world would inherit their parents immunity to the plague. Earth Abides is considered a classic by several sources but to my way of thinking, it deserves that exalted position in speculative fiction for having been a forerunner is demonstrating that black and white can live together. Stewart further shows us how important is the relationship between past and future. He does this symbolically through the vehicle of a 4-pound, single-jack hammer. At the beginning of the book, just before the snake bite, Ish is exploring a cave and finds this hammer. It is the! kind miners used in the old days when rock-drills were placed by hand. It is called a single-jack because it can be used with one hand. Ish notes the pleasure he feels when he finds the hammer because of its tie to the past. Even delierous from snake bit, he remembers to take the hammer with him. He keeps it with him throughout the book. As the community grows around Ish and Em, the hammer is used each year to chisel the numbers of the year on a big rock in the hills above where they live. It is always present on the mantel in Ish's living room. And at the end of the book, when Ish has grown old and the younger men, his and other's children, sense that he is ready to pick a new leader for the community, they wait in a circle at his feet for Ish to pick the next leader by giving them the hammer. The importance of tradition to the family and the community is symbolized in the single-jack. John Clute and Peter Nicholls feel that post-apocalyptic or disaster stories are so popular because they appeal to secret desires we all share: a depopulated world, escape from the constraints of a highly organized industrial society, and the opportunity to prove one's ability to survive. I choose the latter of the three. Post-apocalyptic speculative fiction provides a window from which to view the &quot;stuff&quot; of which humankind is made. The writer of a disaster or holocaust story can pit humans against the worst possible odds. The post-holocaust novel gives us the ability to perform an experiment that in reality would be unethical-to put a group of people in hell and record their progress getting out. Earth Abides is a moving, triumpal story of just such a group. No single character in Earth Abides has the stereotypic appeal of Bruce Willis or Nicolas Cage, and yet I came to love them all and worry about their conditions because they were real people. People with many of the same problems and weaknesses I have. People whose actions made me stop and wonder what I would do in the same situation.","If seen only as an example of early writing in this genre - mankind after the apocalypse - this should be taken as an acceptable novel as compared to later attempts in the same vein. The characters don't really develop and just seem to stumble along without learning how to cope beyond what they knew &#34;before&#34;, which makes for a somewhat plodding read.","There are plenty of other reviews that go more in-depth as to why this book is amazing at the top of the list, but i just wanted to contribute to its stats, and give you my .02$Its memorable to the core, i read it almost a year ago now, and have read a decent handful of post-apocalyptic fiction between now and then, and this one really stands out in my mind.From the very beginning it was gripping, and only got better. It didn't focus on the die-off, but on the aftermath, and how it affected the environment, wildlife, and the anthropological ramifications.Once he does meet up with fellow survivors, there's no great battles with cannibals, not even starvation, but just life. The book really gets down to the core of what it is to be human, and what is important, and how different types of people have different priorities, and how these different ways of thinking would affect the rebuilding of human society in a near extinction level event.It both gives you hope, then rips it away, and makes you question what is really important in life. It makes you wonder if the way of life we are living in our modern world is natural, or a freak coinsurance. perhaps it would happen again if somebody hit the &#34;reset&#34; switch.","A bit dated, but a good read nontheless. Some parts are very wrong (such as gasoline, tires, and batteries for a jeep keeping so long, or that all of the stores of weapons and ammunition back when it was written (M1 garands, M1 carbines, 1911s, and all of the civilian models) not being available after the military and most people are gone. But still very imaginative and well written.","This was a real change for me, which I was looking for in a book at the moment. Not an &#34;action&#34; book, but still holds you spellbound at times, and often I couldn't put it down. It had it's slow areas, but not enough to distract from the total experience. A thought provoking story from the 40's I believe - but you will find yourself thinking about things in every day life a little differently. Definitely a good read!","I found this book to be amazing. It is a very detailed -- at times almost too realistic -- depiction of life after an apocalypse. I found Stewart's handling of societal changes quite believable, and more sophisticated than many more modern works. He also does a great job drawing characters that we can believe.I read somewhere that the author was shocked that this is still on the top of many \"The Best of Science Fiction\" lists. Since he set out to write a literary adventure story, and not science fiction. So be it.Whatever you call it, though, it is riveting.","It led the way for so many great apocalyptic yarns, and was influential in literature and in creating an awareness if the fragility of society. Isherwood was a paradigm for most civilized men. He was content to observe life, and was only dragged into life by his wife. When society fell, he calmly observed the fall of civilization, along with it. He dreamt of rescuing civilization...but settled for surviving on it's leftovers.I wonder how many preppers read this in their formative years.","I have read this book several times and it is a timeless classic. It leaves you feeling what the main character would feel under the scenario that this book was created.The World Without Us","The latest post-apocalyptic fiction seems to focus on dealing with deadly infected persons. What if they just all died and a small group had to start over. This book focuses on a main character who is more human than the supermen of modern apocalypse, he's not an ex-special forces operative with pre-med and a welders certificate who grew up on a farm. He's a little lazy, has some relationship issues, a mediocre teacher and in the end is just a normal guy dealing with population events.","A very original and unique plot, particularly given that it was written in 1949, makes this book a great read and not to be missed for fans of the post-apocalyptic sci-fi genre. Most every book since written in this genre borrows elements from this book. The pace of the story moves well and there are many sub-plots which are interesting (in particular, the main character makes frequent introspective observations that are thought-provoking about humankind). Of particular note is how relevant the book is today, over 60 years after it was written.My main negative critique is the general prose and writing style. It is impossible to believe that the author was an English professor... very basic sentence structures, little in the way of character development, and a ridiculous over-usage of exclamatory statements from the novel's characters (literally hundreds of exclamation marks throughout the book). The Kindle version had a number of typos as well.Still a worthy four-star book given its deep and compelling observations on humankind and a very clever and original plot.","I had great expectations when I started this book and got out of it slightly unsatisfied. The book shows pretty well what civilisation is about and how much it is fragile. Also how much civilisation relies on a few individuals only. All the lost knowledge in the library no one can understand remains as a vivid image in my mind.In spite of some theories underlaying the story being already out of date, that book poses essential issues and the empathy we develop for Ish in his efforts and trials to answer them and maintain some civilisation makes the story moving.","This was one of the early end of the world novels where the survivors try to restart society. Though there is a lot of scientific inaccuracies, what makes this book great are the characters. If you liked Stephen King's The Stand which also had great characters, then you should like this one.The main character is Ish. Ish seems to be someone that we all strive to be. Caring and smart. Ish also, has the son that we all wish our children would be like. Ish's son is the smartest of all the children and he simply idolizes Ish.Ish uses a hammer (a basic, I guess Stanely model) as his symbol of power (or his sceptre) over the survivors. Undoubtedly, the hammer is to pass to Ish's son when Ish dies.The big project for the survivors is to get an old automobilie repaired enough to explore other lands and try to find other bands of survivors and get civilization back on its feet. I don't want to give the rest of the plot away only to say that this project turns out to be a big mistake.","A brilliatnly written socio-sic-fi. Though the book is a bit austere for the scope fo the catastrophe, it is truly a wonderful tome! Like the later work of Stpehn King's The Stand, Earth Abides explores the questions and illustrates the harrowing reality that might be if a \"super\" disease were to kill most of man-kind.Thought provking and beautifully crafted.","Earth Abides, a novel by George R. Stewart, is an excellent novel that depicts a possible scenario for a post-apocalyptic world. It provides people with a fantasy realm with questions of what could happen and what will happen all through the eyes of the novel's main character, Ish. He joins up with a couple of survivors in what he sees fit for the new world and they create a society that tries to cope with it. George Stewart further enriches the story with character chemistry and strong elements of theme.Themes of survival and love are strongly present throughout the novel. Ish's strong will to contain the community he had once known pushes him to survive so he can teach the next generation of what good can become of it. His relation to Em also draws out the love and caring in Ish.George Stewart uses chemical equations between characters to draw an exact importance of each person in their society. He chooses a man named George who is a carpenter to build and repair homes. He has a friend named Ezra, who acts as an advisor to Ish. They all piece together to form Ish's envision of a good society.The topic that concerns Ish the most is the community he had once known. Ish, who is trying to inflict positive change in society, is cursed with the inability to change himself.Throughout the book, he learns to trust his society and the future, which is dependent on him to lead them. He learns of the differences between the two generations and tries to blend in. He goes through many experiments, which has led in to some disaster and many good.Earth Abides is a great novel about the fantasy and high possibility of a post apocalyptic world. The characters and themes in the novel are beautifully inscribed drawing an essence of drama and suspense into an already stone set feeling of both feelings. Reprising themes of love, survival and many other themes are present to enrich the story. Earth Abides, a novel by George R. Stewart, is a novel I'd recommend to anyone who is interested in character chemistry and the post-apocalyptic ideology of George R. Stewart.","Societies Rise and Decline but the Earth Abides In the classic apocalyptic novel Earth Abides George R. Stewart creates a nightmare on earth that could occur tomorrow when a massive unknown epidemic obliterates almost all of society. A young man named Ish is forced to search for companions on this barren, naked earth void of human life. He searches for sensible people to aid him in his quest for survival and mental sanity. Em is the person who keeps Ish sane and through her love and courage helps him to face the future. Together they find a group of companions, and together they establish a tribe in the Berkeley Hills in the Bay Area. George Stewart1s powerful and realistic writing captivates the reader and makes one imagine how each of us would react in Ish1s situation. Even though his novel gets rather slow in the middle with few dramatic events adding to the plot, Stewart demonstrates the harsh situations and triumphs of life this small nucleus of mankind must face without modern society. Stewart1s writing fascinates the reader by exploring the actions of the offspring of the original seven tribe members and shows how people develops without modern society and all its conveniences. Stewart shows how all-human societies have come about, by tracing the development of this small tribe that survives a cataclysmic disaster. In the novel Stewart puts Ish and the tribe through many difficult trials as they struggle to survive. He is able to create an almost unimaginable situation and turn it into a reality. Each character is developed so well that the reader is able to experience the events. Ish1s leadership is strengthened by Em1s courage and Ezra1s loyal friendship. Because the reader can relate to these believable characters in this unbelievable situation, it is easier for the author to relate his point. Stewart fascinates the reader by showing how man develops with all his customs and superstitions and without a modern society. While reading about the tribe1s triumphs and failures we are able to step back from the modern world and see how civilization perhaps developed. The author examines the growth and characteristics of individual characters. What each of them bring to enable this tribe to survive, show how a society begins and flourishes. Em brings her courage, Ish brings his knowledge and his leadership, George is the carpenter and so on. Each member of the tribe contributed to the betterment of the whole society. Then at that point we are able to see the growth of society again, as if it was cut out from man1s actual past history, when ancient tribes started to develop. . At first the challenges are just simple, to fulfil the basic necessities of survival like shelter, water and food. Once these needs have been fulfilled, the tribe progresses to larger concerns such as education of the younger generations, keeping records and calendars, rules and exploration. Eventually the tribe integrates with outside members sometimes successfully, sometimes not. For instance when Charley comes back with the Robert and Richard he brings disease and chaos to the tribe. The tribe had the difficult decision of banishing him or killing him to protect their way of life. Many of them, including Joey who was the hope for the future as a leader because of his intelligence, die because of this outside influence. Later however the tribe successfully mingles with another tribe, which helps their society grow because there are more possibilities for men and women to find mates in a larger society.All through the novel Stewart accurately demonstrates the development of a simplistic society with all its triumphs and failures, to symbolize the history of human development. He is able to show that future societies would develop as past societies have as long as basic human needs are met. When people have food, shelter and more importantly significant human relationships then a society can begin. The society that Stewart creates starts with two people who found each other in the midst of chaos. They unite with others with whom they are compatible and from this small group a multi generation society formed. In his lifetime Ish saw a society develop. He saw his children and grand children and great grand children living happily. Through Ish1s eyes, the author masterfully shows all of us how societies rise and decline but how through it all the earth itself abides. Stewart in this famous apocalyptic novel captures the reader and artfully demonstrates the nature of human societies.","This book is one of the most moving and realistic surival novels that I have ever read, the suceive plauges of Domsicated animals and pests for one, and the point that the most brilliant minds of of western, and Gobal Civilization would break under the strain of the end of civilization seems all to true. Though the very end of the book was depressing(as San Fransico burns, and the Part about the new Human tribes) but even though civilization is pushed under, it is suggested that it will rise again in the far future though as we watch civilization unravil as Isherwood tries to pick up the peices is heart breaking, his attempt at a school is sad and the way that he finally breaks under the strain of being remembered as a god. This is a great classic of Sf Read this book!!","It really made me think about the sensativity of the planet and society of every day life.","Earth Abides is a great book for the reader new to the science fiction genre. Isherwood and Em are strong characters. The building of a new society is intriguing. I read this book over 25 years ago and I still remember it fondly as my introduction into science fiction books.","I have read and re-read this book over the years. It is riveting, entertaining and more than likely prophetic. The bomb that may destroy us all is the one we can not defend against, the incurable, quick-acting and all powerful virus. A nuclear Dooms-Day could not be more horrifying.","The well conceived story captures the imagination from the start. That's why we buy books like this...right? The intellectual and forward looking main character reminded me of the captain in &quot;The Last Ship&quot;. Read it!","George R. Stewart weaves at once a beautiful and hauntingly believable tale with this novel, one that I've never been able to forget...or wanted to. Once considered dated, with the lessening of global nuclear tensions, the scenario Mr. Stewart envisions for a possible worldwide catastrophe, one brought about not by bombs but disease, has once again come to the forefront and become the most plausible ingredient in mankind's demise. More even than the fact that this is a truly enjoyable read is the deeper message Earth Abides shares with the reader as it reaches down and touches our very hearts, defining what it means to be human in an inhuman environment. The symbolism involved in Isherwood Williams' desire to keep a hammer with him for the future as a tie to the past is obviously an unconscious comment on his personal hope of rebuilding a fallen civilization. A hope that goes unfulfilled in his life time and maybe many lifetimes to follow. The insight into the human psyche that Mr. Stewart demonstates as he carries Isherwood from his youth at the beginning of the book to old age and finally death at the end and Isherwood's subtle change of attitude during that process, rings exceedingly true and speaks volumes about Mr. Stewart's keen and perhaps unique ability to put into words what it really means, or at least should mean, to be human. I've rarely read a book more than once because I just don't have the time, but I've read Earth Abides several times since I was a teen and I know I'll read it several more times before I too reach that stage in my life that Isherwood assures us won't be the calamity our youth oriented culture would have us to believe.","Even if Stephen King did base THE STAND on this book, he takes the idea of a world-wide plague and develops it much better than Stewart. I understand that EARTH ABIDES was written in the forties, but the stilted style of writing used and the attitudes and world view of Stewart's main characters are so jarringly anchronistic that I could never forget I was reading a book --- it never transported me into the world that the writer was trying to create. The italized asides within the chapter explaining what was happening elsewhere (i.e., lice, cats, ants, etc.) were interesting but not enough to save the book as a whole. LUCIFER'S HAMMER, WAR DAY, or THE STAND are all much better &quot;end of the world&quot; type books","It's been awhile since I read this book, but what I remember about this book is that it insults you and basically says that if you haven't gone to college and grad school that you cannot be intelligent or sire intelligent children. The author writes this book about the one truly intellegent person left alive. He portrays the rest of the survivors, who are average non-college educated, blue collar types, as little more than simpletons. The main character and the author doesn't even try to have the survivors learn to use the left over technology to help better their situation because they are too dumb. When they reproduce only Ish sires an intellegent child. The rest of the chilren are all dumb like their parents. Bah, that's it. My hatred for this book is off my chest. I don't reccommend it.","Having loved this story 20 years ago as a teenager, it pains me now to find that it is surely the most badly written book on my bookshelves. All the characters are two-dimensional. The dialogue is uniformly stiff and amateurish. Worse, there's a faintly fascist tone running throughout the entire story that I failed to notice as a callow youth, but that now reveals itself on almost every page. Perhaps the saddest aspect of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that the story is clearly and shockingly the fantasy of an author who was very probably an insecure misfit who dreamed of existing in a world without people, or at least with just a handful of simple folks over whom he could rule as their intellectual master. If Stewart had spent some time in analysis, &quot;Earth Abides&quot; might never have been written. It is a truly awful book.","Plot Kernel - A deadly virus has nearly annihilated the human race, leaving all other life untouched. Civilization has ended. A survivor searches for others and eventually joins with a woman who lost her family in the epidemic. In time, he becomes the leader of a few families who have intermarried and who together live off the abundant supply source of the otherwise uninhabited city.","I love post-apocalypse fiction, but I can't figure out why everyone likes this one. The first 1/3rd of the book is great, as the main character experiences what becomes of his world after everyone else dies. Then it's as if the last half of the book was written by a female. It's mostly introspective, about how the character feels, and nothing really happens. If you want a page turner from front to back, read 'Alas Babylon','One Second After', or 'Without Warning'. I would donate this book to my local library, but I would feel guilty knowing some poor guy might pick this up and waste as much time on it as I did.","Great story of what would happen if a lazy / self proclaimed intellect survived the human apocalypse. Ish may have let thousands of years of basic knowledge disappear without getting off his highchair for a second. But, in the end at least \"Jingle Bells \" survived his incompetence and carried on.","I was very excited when I received this book, because I had read great reviews about it. However, it did not hold up to my expectations. The first two thirds of the story consist of the main character driving back and forth across the country looking for survivors (that is as far as I made it- leisure reading should not have to be a chore). When he does encounter survivors, he only stays for a brief time to visit with them and moves on. That is it. There are no conflicts. There is no tension or threat from others or nature. No plot. He simply drives back and forth looking for people, discovers them, and then moves on. I have never read anything more boring, not even required readings for courses I have taken. Perhaps this book was the first of its kind when it came out, and that may be why it has such acclaim, but the storyline is nonexistent. On the up side it does have some very well written descriptions of the land and animals (that is the only good thing I can say about this book).","Wordy, verbose, unrealistic. Meeting around a table with the woman who eventually gives him children, written like a bad female romance novel.Emotionally mature hunter-gatherers evolve from his haphazardly raised progeny. Unrealistic ending, which was a slog to get to.","If you are easily depressed or get melancholy, do not read this book. If the thought of the human race dying out and mother earth thriving gives you the warm fuzzies, then this book is for you. After the major opening disease-kill tragedy there's *some* hope for man... then less hope for man... then a little more hope for man... then a *lot* less hope, and on, and on. It's an emotional roller coaster that, on average, only looses altitude. In the end, earth wins, man looses. I had 100 pages remaining to read and finally had to flip to the last page so. I. could. just. &quot;end it&quot;. Yuk. Two weeks later I still have a bitter taste in my mind. If you like sci-fi's such as &quot;ender's game&quot; I predict you'll hate this book too. My hope here is that I've saved somebody else the pain.","I started becoming interested in the post-apocalyptic genre after watching a few episodes of the TV show \"Jericho\" (which is quite interesting in Season 1). While searching this category on Amazon, \"Earth Abides\" popped up a few times along with several other titles. I picked up a copy and read it last weekend. The plot and the characters are mildly interesting and I guess I should cut it some slack having been printed back in 1949. However, I have to say as you get more than halfway through the book, the story line just seems to drag on and on and is generally pretty boring. As I neared the end I found myself skimming from page to page and just praying it would finally end. The copy I bought was used and I threw it away when I was done to prevent someone else from wasting their time with it.By comparison, I also bought a used copy of \"Alas Babylon\" (also printed in the 1950s time frame) and I can safely say it is a far more interesting read after only being about 100 pages into it.","I first read this book back in 1967. At that time I was a kid and the whole story seemed to be nothing but \"science fiction.\" I read about the way Ish went through his life, with a disbelief that it could ever happen here and now.However, today I look at the possibility that civilization could be shattered by the loss of what we have come to consider the essential necessities of life - electricity, water, gas, gasoline, telephone, computers, drug stores and grocery stores. Now when I read Earth Abides, I realize that this story could actually happen to us. The problems that Ish had to deal with are now possible. As I read this story, I found myself wondering how I would handle dwindling supplies, the threats of animals and disease, the decreasing availability of items that spoil or evaporate, the social interaction with people, both good and bad. I wondered how I would deal with the lack of food, water, and medicine? Would I be able to survive in a deserted city with no electricity? With terrorists threatening to destroy our way of life, this book could be a survival guide for the modern man.I especially found the greatest distress in this book was the way knowledge was lost. First Ish wanted to read and then it became less important and then the books fell apart. Ish became an antique with knowledge of things that meant nothing to the younger generation that was growing up around him. This book should be used to teach us all a lesson - that we must keep the flame of knowledge burning all the time or we could lose it so very fast.","This 1949 novel is one of the earliest explorations of the theme of a doomsday plague. Our hero, named Ish, is a young college student who returns from the mountains to find out that an airborne virus has wiped out over 99.99 percent of the population in remarkably tidy fashion, leaving behind only a handful of survivors.It is hard to rate a book like this. On the one hand, it is well written, and, despite a few implausible suppositions, manages to explores a number of interesting ideas and insights.But there is a big problem: Our hero, Ish, is completely wicked -- an amoral, self-worshiping, arrogant, elitist monster; and the author seems to be on his side. I understand that books of this type tend to be misanthropic fantasies, and even understand the appeal. But I cannot stomach Ish.Ish is not particularly upset by the tragedy, since he never had much use for his fellow man. Still, his first reaction is to contemplate suicide. He can think of no reason to live. How this differs from his outlook before the tragedy is unclear, but he apparently bemoans the loss of superior human specimens who are mirror images of himself -- detached, scientific, rational, and essentially amoral. He ultimately rejects suicide, only because he decides it might be scientifically interesting to observe the continuing downfall of humanity. That he might try HELPING his fellow survivors never occurs to him.It immediately occurs to him that there must be other survivors, but just as quickly concludes that the shock of the tragedy will soon destroy most of them as well, because of their difficulty adapting. He calls this theory \"secondary kill\". On his first day of searching, he finds no less than 5 survivors, but immediately writes them off as not worth saving, according to his quasi-darwinian \"secondary kill\" theory. He then drives entirely from the west coast to the east coast and back, without ever finding a single human being who he thinks deserves life. No matter how many survivors he finds, he persists in regarding himself as the last surviving human. Only Ish counts. (Again, how this differs from his outlook before the tragedy is unclear).He then returns to his California home and sits around eating out of cans and reading books. While reading the New Testament, he ponders the fact that Judeo-Christian morals are obsolete, since he has no neighbors to love. My jaw dropped. What about all those traumatized survivors he abandoned to die according to his detached and rational \"secondary kill\" theory?But then he starts reading the Song of Solomon, and realizes he wants a woman. Almost immediately, a beautiful woman, a fellow elitist, drops out of the blue and into his bed. Soon a handful of survivors, who Ish persists on regarding as inferior beings, gather around them and form a sort of a tribe. This is one of the more implausible aspects of the novel. Ish a leader? He may have all of Hitler's faults, but he has none of his virtues.Happily for Ish, all of the other characters (except for one man whom Ish murders) have personalities even less forceful than his own. He arranges to marry off all the tribe's children, including his own daughters, at the far-too-young and not-entirely-willing age of 13, without a peep of protest from his own wife or anyone else. (Incidentally, this is a terrible scheme if you want to preserve a high level of culture, which Ish claims is his goal). Nor does anyone protest his scheme to murder a newcomer for the crime of having a venereal disease. The only person he has any regard for is one of his many sons, who he thinks of as a mirror image of himself. But then tragedy strikes, dashing Ish's hopes for the preservation of Ish-manity.Very early on, Ish remarks, almost out of the blue, that he does not want to become a god. This is such a strange thought that I think he doth protest too much. In any event, it is virtually all he achieves. For instance, his efforts as schoolmaster, though failing to teach, succeed in instilling superstitious reverence for himself in his pupils.","Unlike all contagious diseases before this one that traveled over time, this contagion sprung up globally at about the same time. For practical purposes the human race is extinct. Isherwood \"Ish\" Williams survives the pandemic, but wonders if he is the last man on earth.In what was once called California, Ish eventually meets up with a small rag tag band of shocked survivors. As his cohorts just try to live, they turn to Ish, more an introspective loner, as the leader. Reluctantly he takes charge not knowing what the future will bring or even if there is even going to be a future.This is a reprint of a highly regarded post apocalypse tale first released in 1949. The story is actually told over a period of years broken into five major parts of which the above only briefly touches on the first two sections. Ish is a terrific protagonist whose belief in survival changes over time as he observes his little colony mature. Thriller fans will enjoy this strong after the doomsday tale that in some ways shows its pre-information age initial publication, but remains a strong cautionary story.Harriet Klausner","This review will be short and simple as there are tons of detailed reviews already available.Earth Abides is great. It turns over and over in your head for days, weeks, months, & years.. just as a great book should. Not only does it provide a glimpse into the possible future, it also shows what it was like back in mid-1900s America. Definitely a thinker's book. I'd recommend it to anyone, ESPECIALLY if you like post-apocalyptic/last man on earth type tales.","Many of the previous reviewers state that they originally read this book a long time ago, and how it stuck with them over the years. For me, the pleasure of reading Earth Abides is a very recent event, but I do know that like those other reviewers, this will be a book that will stay with me for a long time.Originally published in 1949, Earth Abides still reads fresh. It describes the life journey of the graduate student \"Ish,\" a more intelligent that average, bookish, slightly passive young man who is one of the few human survivors of a catastrophic virus outbreak. Early on, he travels from one side of the former United States of America to the other, and back again. Living in the home of his parents, he slowly meets other survivors: some are compatible and eventually group together to become members of The Tribe, others who are not, and do not. Earth Abides is a tale of the survival of a man, of a group, and of a planet without the continuing influence and domination of human civilization.This is fundamentally a book of journeys: a travel across post-apocalyptic America, within the remnants of the surviving San Francisco Bay area, of some of the Tribe's offspring attempting another cross-country journey, but most powerfully, it is the journey of Ish, as a survivor and young man, as a reluctant leader, as a torch-bearer of the hope of the re-establishment of the former Civilization, as a semi-god and The Last American, and finally as an old man who accepts that man will survive in new ways, not in the old ways, and that no matter what, that the Earth itself will abide.","A few days ago I listened to a lecture by renown geneticist Francisco Ayala. He discussed a simple experiment demonstrating Darwin's concept of natural selection. If you take a test tube holding 10 cc of the bacterium E. coli, it will hold approximately 20 billion organisms. Adding a drop of a modern antibiotic like gentamicin into the tube will result in the survival of some 200 cells (out of the original 20,000,000,000). However, since those cells are now gentamicin resistant, in only a few days the tube will again hold 20 billion (now gentamicin resistant) E. coli cells. The only E. coli cells that made additional copies of themselves were the ones with the mutation for gentamicin resistance. Evolution has occurred.What happens when the human race is hit with a viral \"antibiotic\"? What happens when a population of 6 billion humans is suddenly, within a week, turned into a population of 600, scattered across the planet?One thing is for sure... the population won't rebound in a few days.College student Ish Williams is one of the survivors. Although he thinks it is because he suffered a rattlesnake bite during the plague, unless all the other survivors also had a similar snakebite (even in places rattlesnakes don't exist), he probably already possessed whatever mutation that made him plague resistant.From his home in the San Francisco Bay region, he drives across country, looking for survivors while seeing first hand the beginnings of civilization's decay. As for survivors, they are rare indeed. But some people, like Ish, did survive.Back in the San Francisco Bay area, Ish and a few companions begin to rebuild civilization. But when the survivors don't include an engineer, a physician, a teacher, a scientist, or even a farmer, our \"survival knowledge\" is limited indeed.Author George Stewart wrote this book in 1949, so a number of the technological issues are quite dated. Nevertheless, survival isn't easy. Ish and others have to deal with exploding populations of wild cattle, and rats, and dogs. They have to find something besides canned food. They have to ensure water is still available. And they have to teach the children, so they don't forget.\"Yes, [Ish] reluctantly concluded, this matter of the children's beliefs was extremely serious. In the Old Times [pre-plague] the beliefs held by the children of any family or small group of families might be momentous enough, but still those children on growing up would come into contact with other beliefs and make adjustments. Besides, there had been a great, even overwhelming, mass of tradition - the tradition of Christianity, or of Western civilization, or of Indo-European folkways, or of Anglo-American culture. Call it what you wished, it was still so tremendous that you might say it was omnipotent, for good or bad absorbing the individual.But now their little community had lost much of the tradition. Part of it had been lost because no seven survivors... could preserve and transmit all of it. Part had been lost because for so long a time there had been no big children to pass on the tradition to the small ones. The oldest of the younger generation had been taught games by their parents, not by older comrades. The community should therefore be plastic to an unprecedented degree. This was an opportunity, but also a responsibility - and a danger....Now, more certainly even than before, he knew that he had the opportunity to be the founder of a religion for a whole people. What he told the children in school, they would probably believe. He could insure their memory of it by mere insistence and iteration. He could tell them that the Lord God created the earth in six days, and found it good. They would believe. He could tell them a local Indian legend that the world was the work of Old Man Coyote. They would believe\" (p. 222-223).Sobering, and interesting. Stewart ends by writing, \"Men go and come, but earth abides\" (p. 345).","I first read this novel over 20 years ago in a college history course. It's a story that has stayed with me, and I recently wanted to discover if the book was a good as I remembered it to be. Well, in one sense, it was: Stewart's style is still powerful, the plot timely, and the characters all too human in how they react to the end of the world as they've known it. What I also discovered was how dated this novel is, for some of the same reasons it's still a good story: 'Ish', the main character, is right out of the Cold War era, as he's chauvinistic, detatched, and more than a little pompous at times. The plot is all too familiar to our post-modern world (and King's 'The Stand' has some similarities): some kind of plague wipes out most of the world's population; Ish, bitten by a rattlesnake right before this happens, survives. The first part of the book really puts the reader into a world where Ish fears he is the last survivor. Even when he encounters others, he feels no connection to them. On his cross country trip, he sees no reason to stay with even the kind people he meets; instead, he returns to his parents' house, where he begins to plan for some kind of rebuilding of the former society. Eventually, he meets 'Em', a mixed race older woman, and they collect a small group of survivors who try to continue life as they knew it, children are born, and 'The Tribe' grows. Inserted in the narrative is Stewart's description of the title: as mankind and his works diminish, animals, native plants, nature itself transform and overtake 'civilization'...\"Men come and go, but earth abides\" (345). At times, Stewart and Ish overdo it with the dramtic language. Ish is not always the most sympathetic character, pompous and seeing himself superior to most of The Tribe. The Tribe doesn't seem to really have the energy to truly rebuild -- or even build anew -- another existence; the incident when the water system breaks down is the best example: even Ish realizes that the survivors and their children don't have either the desire or the knowledge to fix the problem and continue to enjoy indoor plumbing. Even the digging of latrines is never really finished, as no one seems to care when the work gets too hard. One does feel for Ish when he finally realizes that no one cares about the old education; The Tribe essentially regresses to hunting and small farming, but also seems happier than the 'modern' man ever was. Stewart had a good idea of modern man's virtues and foibles, and also provides a thought-provoking study which makes the reader ask \"what would I do in this same situation?\" You can also see, historically, where this novel fits into the US Cold War fears of complete annihilation of our 'great' way of life, and the land of plenty that the US was in this era: how do the survivors eat? They plunder the cans in the supermarkets for decades. The Tribe simply forages off of what's left behind, and at no time does it seem that the leftovers will ever end. It's an interesting comment on the world Stewart knew, and a compliment to the abundance in the US in the late 1940s, when the novel was first written.","George R. Stewart's main character isn't as helpless as a quick glance at the first page reviews may imply. He is a character that is able to do significant hands-on tasks such as auto mechanics, hunting, lead a small surviving group of humanity, and teach and school children. He is just not an expert in these fields, which isn't too surprising for a random person, but in many cases his knowledge and aptitude turned out quite useful. It's just that when one is dealing with what could be the last of humanity, a lot is needed for the human race to go on. Written in 1949, Stewart's Earth Abides makes one reminiscent of that time and of what was available then. Stewart takes some time to describe what happens to the other mammals, although I'm not sure if the prey vs. predator equilibrium was a new idea at that time since he does elaborate on it quite a bit. His visions of primitive and/or overly religious societies in humanity's backslide in certain areas will be quite well known to those that follow more modern writings and films of `the end of the world' genre.The setting takes place in three time eras, one right after the disease that wipes out most of humanity, one 22 years later, and the last at over 42 years later-probably 50+ years. The first takes place more or less in the time the book was published, 1949. The other one has to realize would then be taking place in what would then be 1971. Now Stewart makes the 22 years go by fairly quickly, but thinking about what happened in the real world between 1949 and 1971, the James Dean era, the hippy movement, Vietnam War, the start of the oil crunch, makes one realize a lot can happen in 22 years as opposed to what Stewart writes. What Stewart seems more to be writing about, isn't the end of the world, but the laziness of man, which eventually becomes a downfall for some and something that needs to be overcome. Now I don't know if he was writing about something he saw in his workplace or in the armed forces if he was in WWII, but he does take it to an extreme. Sure some people may just be tired of an 8 hour workday, when there's so many aspects of life out there, but it's hard to believe one would maintain an utterly lazy lifestyle for 22 years, when there wasn't any need to worry about food for the short term, or how one's retirement plans were going, and instead, without these shackles on one's mind in terms of worrying about the future, not feel free or have interest about how to rebuild society. There are some groups of people in the real world that if you get two of them together, they'll come up with three visions for the future as opposed to almost no visions by the characters of the novel.The book is also a bit too ideal. Maybe it really was like this in 1949, but the world as I've seen it would have the character's in marital disputes, the usual utterances of \"you suck,\" some saying to get rid of old man Ish, let's move our group, this in no good, that is no good, and so on. However, what makes this novel different from, say the usual post-nuclear-war book, isn't just healthy young men surviving, but a random group of people surviving that somehow have immunity to the disease (although one could say those that have built an immunity by being bitten by a snake represents a certain group of people and that would skew the randomness that Stewart tried to set up in the survivors), so his vision of the type of characters that survive may have some credibility.Overall it was a fun book to read. Stewart has a flowing, easygoing style that makes you want to keep reading to see how things turn out. It does get a little slow around the 200 page mark, so, as in other books, you just have to plow through it to get to the end. I'd recommend this book. It's one of the better post-apocalyptic novels that came out in the 40's and 50's, and is a compelling read.","I read this book in the 60s, just over a decade after it came out. When I read some of the reviews here, I decided to skim through it again. What had surprised me were the negative reviews. I remembered the story as a very interesting one, with characters I could appreciate, if not like.What I found different was the fiction that has come along in the past 40 years. In \"the old days\" fiction often was more thoughtful with less action and more introspection. Characters did not always solve the problems with which they were confronted (although I must admit that this was not the case as often in science fiction). Stewart in Earth Abides gives us a world in which nearly the entire population of the earth has died from a pandemic. Ish, the main character, spends much time alone in the beginning. As the few survivors begin to gather together, they look to him for leadership, something he's not certain he is qualified to do. The exception is that he is well read, and his greatest passion is to preserve the library in the area in which he lives.(spoiler lieth here) Some of the reviewers here seem surprised at the deterioration of civilization amongst the group. Were they as surprised if they read Lord of the Flies? True, those characters were all children, but many of Stewart's characters are uneducated or unsophisticated, who never understand Ish's preoccupation with the knowledge housed in that library. They are too busy learning to survive with none of the trappings of modern life, and without the tools to re-create that life. The story is depressing as one reads the slide into savagery. But what is represented is one possible outcome should such a holocaust occur in the world.For different outcomes, try reading Day of the Triffids (there be monsters), or Malevil. Or see the old b&w; film Things to Come. This was once a very popular sub-genre of science fiction and many possible outcomes have been depicted.","Wow, just wow. I can see that a lot of better reviewers have already had their say, but I've never been this moved and impressed.I was concerned about getting a book that was so old, but there really weren't many references that took me out of Ish's shoes: The lack of TVs, the attitude of and towards the African Americans (to avoid using his words), and to entertainers of whom I only recognized Bob Hope. Other than that it could have easily happened today.I'm pleased by how the book was ordered, with most of the chapters covering only a year in detail with a chapter about the intervening years between sections. It probably would've been easy to pad out those years rather than summarizing them, but it would've been too much.Most of all I like the short sections in the middle of chapters, largely in the first section, that help to break it up and provide a omniscient viewpoint and a break from Ish's lesser understanding and awareness. The portions relating to how the different plants and animals were affected interested me greatly.I'm very happy with the ending as well. Overall the book has several good thinking points. Definitely one I would suggest to others.","I read this book when I was in my early teens during a time when I read many sci-fi books. This one stuck with me. I won't repeat what others have said, but this book struck me as a beautifully told story about a horrible, if remote, possibility. I'm happy to stumble over it here and see that it's still in print and people are still reading it. I guess it's become somewhat of a classic, and it deserves to be.","This story is as contemporary as it was when it was first published in 1949. Except for a few references to the availability of hand cranked phonographs, there is no indication that this disaster and it's aftermath didn't take place in the present. The story is told entirely in the third person. This would generally seem to be tedious, however is simply does not loose its hold on you. The writing is careful, the author is economical in the use of words that describe concepts. The premise of the story is simple: a deadly virus sweeps the earth and within a few weeks all of mankind is gone. There remains only isolated individuals who eventually find each other and begin life again in the altered world.I first read this book in my early thirties. It impacted my life to the point that I always referred to the reading of this book as one of the turning points in my life. I have now reread it with the perspective of 20 additional years and it has the same impact. I was so struck with the understanding Stewart conveys of the emptiness of contemporary life. This emptiness is not to be construed as useless. The grand civilization we have constructed is great, is a monumental, exciting and dynamic achievement. But if you put all these achievements against the needs of a group of people that will eventually have no access to prepared foods, electricity on demand, water and heat or cooling, instant access to far away members of their family, by telephone, car, plane, fax, etc., you soon see what the hero saw: What the emerging generations needed was a basic knowledge of hunting and gathering. Laws become obsolete, customs change to suit the need of the group, language changes and a thought that resonates within me, is the idea of the God of the Bible. Because the Bible refers specifically to groups of people and their interaction, what is there to refer to, when the groups and the interaction are gone? For me, the consummate fundamental Christian, this is very thought provoking and brings me into another dimension: to examine my faith and trust and what it is I have faith and trust in and for. This book should be required reading for Sociology, Anthropology and Psychology students. Absolutely wonderful!!","This was one of the first books I read as a kid. I was enthralled back then with the idea of a plague wiping out the vast majority of people so my father suggested \"Earth Abides\" as a suitable read. I enjoyed rereading the book as an adult recalling the same fascination with the storyline as I did over 25 years ago. The author tells the survival story of Isherwood Williams, a man who evades a plague due to a counteraction to a snake bite.The author peppers the pages with intricate details such as Isherwood's realization that he is a good candidate to survive the aftermath since he was young and fit and had his appendix removed. Even so, he took care while descending a flight of stairs, concerned that even the slightest injury could be fatal in a post-pandemic world. At one point, Isherwood sees a Coke-a-Cola sign in the distance flashing on and off (like they used to do in the 70's) and wonders how long the power will stay on without people maintaining the infrastructure. Later as children are born to the survivors, he feels no need to correct their improper English since there was no longer a basis for proper spoken word.An interesting point about this storyline is that presumably those that did survive the epidemic would have had a natural immunity to the disease, but those like Isherwood, surviving by a counter reaction, could pass on the susceptibility to the disease to future generations.Throughout the book Isherwood possesses a hammer that first is a mere tool, but later comes to symbolize his authority and a new justice. Along the way, many difficult decisions are faced by the people of the new society. The author assembles an extensive expanse of possibilities all logically facing the survivors of a new world. I highly recommend this book as I have for many years.","I recently re-read this book after twenty five years. The story drives with a unique force as the naturally detached observer-protagonist Isherwood witnesses the Earth and Mankind's remnants slowly re-establish a new balance. This reacquaintence also served as a reflection on myself.As a teenager, I was drawn to Ish's character, much like my own at the time: quiet, reflective, socially uncomfortable. I took great delight in identifying that the book took place in my own neighborhood: The rock where they carved the years is a perfect description of Indian Rock in Berkeley, where I climbed countless times as a kid. For years after, wherever I went I liked to see how unkept gardens took over their yards, how abandoned houses returned slowly to Nature's way, how unused roads returned to the soil at a relentless if geologic pace.As a man in my 40s I find the tale retains its fascinating hold. I still like to see how Man's works change in their own way when left alone, just as any other object in nature. Much of Stewart's description of that change rings true and is well visualized. But most striking to me was that the nature of the characters had changed in my mind. No longer were they just people like myself, making the best out of this extraordinary circumstance. The second time around, the characters were very unsatisfying. Ish is the only one with any ambition at all, and he is unable to make anything of it. This is due entirely to his personal failings: the social stiffness he never outgrew, his lack of focus, his increasingly insular view of his place in the surrounding world. I was particularly offended by a scene of &quot;crime&quot; and punishment. Yet these are not failings of the author nor of the book. Stewart was simply taking the opportunity to show that, barring the survival of some remarkably talented and organized people, civilization is not by any means guaranteed to carry on. Though &quot;The Stand&quot; is more entertaining, &quot;Earth Abides&quot; remains much more satisfying.","I first came across this book while stationed in Vietnam in 1971. The story is about the life and times of a young geologist who escapes a catastrophe that causes the deaths of almost all of the population of the world. As you read, you see how this young man copes with loneliness and then love after finding another survivor.These two begin a life together and eventually establish friendship with other survivors and then form a \"tribe\". As chapters pass by, they are named for significant events in the tribe's lives during the year.I have read and re-read this book to the point that I will need to purchase another copy in the near future.","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it. This maturity is perceptible all along this work.The story is situated in a world devastated by a sudden pestilence that annihilates most of humankind. Taking into account the last SARS epidemic that jumped abruptly from China to Canada it doesn't look an impossible scenario.This is the story.Isherwood Williams comes down from an isolate spot in the mountains to discover an empty world. He starts searching for survivors all across USA, from California to New York and back again. He finds only isolate human cells, couples or trios, overwhelmed by catastrophe and in a near catatonic state.Returns to his native town and contemplate with a certain scientific detachment the fading world around him.Mr. Stewart intercalate brief vignettes describing what happens to dogs, cats, cattle, plants, roads, dams and bridges, contrasting them with Ish's daily experiences.Little by little the story grip reader's attention and even if action is somehow slow, the book can't be put down.Human cells began to draw near each other and a rather feeble structure starts growing up.The author approaches universal questions about survival and extinction; civilization and savagery; social structure and anomie. He also examines religious values, ethics and life's ultimate sense.This book gives the reader a lot of stuff to think about. A very enticing read!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","Reading Earth Abides what struck me most was not the story, though this was certainly well told and presented, but how bravely the book took an unusual tack on its chosen topic: the survival factor of our civilisation and man himself when measured against geologic or cosmic time as represented by the planet Earth. Normally we are reasured that the embers of civilisation and man will never go out, and that we will always triumph as a species. Almost every film, book or play impresses this perception upon it's audience. And at first, as Isherwood works to rebuild, it seems Earth Abides will follow the same route. Then things start to change, and the reader begins to feel an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of their stomach; Isherwood's attempts start to fail, and the flickering ember of 20th century civilisation begins to dim. At the last, time takes its own course, and our ability to outlast even our own planet, never mind spread to the Universe as many SF books believe, is brought into question. And it is with this that the book triumphs. We are asked to question our entire society, and its true prospects for survival. One of the few books I've read that made me question the daily trip to the office, not from the point of view of myself, but my entire species, and to wonder what on Earth we are doing to ensure the real future of our species.","I did not notice the year until the second reading. The story plays out today as well as it did in the forties.Profound and thought inspiring. My wife is a lit major and had little experience with SF. This book opened a new world for her. It is unfortunate more of Stewart's work is not available.I was originally intrigued by the location. San Lupo Drive is San Luis Drive in the hills of Berkeley, CA. The rocks are Indian Rock Park. Everthing fits. Stewart talks of walking down to to a shopping district, Solano Avenue.The cleanliness of society's destruction was an interseting twist. No mess and madness. Imagine suddenly being a surviver on the planet.A good series to read is Earth Abides, Lucifer's Hammer, and Into the Woods. Throw in The Children of Men.","Earth Abides will no doubt remain one of the classic post-apocalyptic books of our era. The characters are well-developed and easy to like and the setting is as familiar as the Golden Gate bridge and the Oakland hills (where most of the story takes place). When I first read Earth Abides at the age of twelve, I thought it a fascinating and engaging tale that kept me turning pages well into the night. Now, at forty-five, I find it somewhat quirky, ethically questionable, and rather unrealistic in it's study of human nature. Despite the great effort George R. Stewart puts into developing well-rounded characters, most of their attitudes and beliefs would be more suited to the 19th century than the 21st. Racism and sexism are both a noticeable undercurrent and the academic elitism of the main character starts out annoying then rapidly becomes nauseating.Although a powerfully thought-provoking read at the age of 12, at the age of 45 I find it strongly dated and woefully inadequate. Still, it is a classic and is well worth reading for anyone with an interest in post-apocalyptic fiction, anthropology, or the foundations of social order.","This was a great book, but not an action-filled book. It is a book to generate ideas, not to get the adrenaline flowing. If it ever comes to a survival situation as posited in the book, life won't be glamorous. It will be mundane, a matter of getting food and having a dry place to sleep. Stewart gives us good reasons for why this is so.I wrote the following this morning, trying to sort out why Ish is the leader for the group:In reading the complaints of those who don't like Earth Abides, it seemed to me that many were disappointed that George R. Stewart did not create a group of super-humans to rebuild society. Why didn't they plan better? Why didn't they show more interest, more creativity? The author chose a group of ordinary people, who were used to living in a civilization doing everything for them, from providing their food, to thinking and planning.One of the points that is frequently missed for those reading \"Earth Abides\" is the way humans behave. As long as their needs are taken care of, many people tend to let the rest of life come as it will. Making plans takes mental effort, and that is where only Ish has any experience. The energy to think ahead, and to make others see what is coming, that is what makes a leader great.Ish is a scholar--he's well on the way to becoming a professor. That path makes him a professional thinker and ponderer and not a man of action. His career makes him one who watches from the sidelines without getting involved, and even if that were not the case, his personality pushes him in that direction. He is not a people person--he's a loner, uncomfortable in the company of others. He's a geek, more interested in privacy and private pursuits than in being a leader. Ish has half of the great leader equation; he has the energy to think ahead. What he lacks is the ability to convey what he sees to others.When he thinks of himself as a leader by default, he is being realistic; of his band of seven adults, no other shows any sign of talent for leading. The one person in the group with strong social abilities, Ezra, defers to Ish. George is \"dull,\" a man of craft who's job as plumber involves rushing to fix broken things; he is accustomed to reacting, not to making plans. George's wife's main concern is domestic tasks, and in this, she is a product of her age. Of Ezra's two wives, neither shows any signs of interest in planning for the group. Of all of the group, only Em leads when Ish cannot. Where he is the geek, timid and unable to marshal people, she is the one with backbone, who gets people moving when she sees a need. She lets Ish plan, perhaps, because she lives in the here and now, and only leads when she sees a clear cut need or threat in the immediate future. She doesn't worry about the future, because for the present, all the needs are taken care of.This is the group that survived the Great Disaster in Berkeley; seven ordinary people, products of a country that has professional leaders, so that the people don't have to think.There are also a number of complaints about the main character, Ish. People who disliked the book tended to write negative comments about him. In fairness, Ish is not a leader; he is a geek, one interested in private pursuits. He is introverted. Unfortunately for his social tastes, he is the sole person left in the Berkeley area who was accustomed to thinking and judging on a daily basis. This makes him the one who others turn to for ideas, the leader. As the leader, his decisions come out of his non-charismatic, introverted self. He is not a natural teacher (and in spite of this he is the only one to attempt to teach). These social weaknesses, however, are tied to his intellectual strengths. A different main character could have had different strengths, but then the reader would not have been treated to Ish's unique views as to what happened to the world after the fall of civilization.About Ish's attitude: Reviewers have accused him of acting as if others are too emotional, too black)--I think these opinions about how Ish interacts with his world ignore Ish's nature. He isn't judgmental, he is professionally distanced. In a state resembling shock, he turns a scientific eye upon the world, as if the world means nothing to him. He's lost his country and family and everything but his life's work (which was ecologist, one studying the interactions of living things and environment). If he hides behind his life's work in a time of crisis and shock, he isn't the first. Journalists do this all the time. Work now, think about yourself later.About the racist elements: Ish never really shows signs of being racist (but he was living in a racist society--segregation was the law of the land in 1949. And mixed marriages were illegal in many states). He is a product of that society. But in looking at the rural black people, his tone is almost admiration--THEY will survive when all the rest can't.","One of the origional Apotholyptic tales. Since this is probably how it will all end, it is internesting to see the authors views on environmental \"take back\" from humans. Good read, young or old.","I read some of the rave reviews by others which made me decide to order this book. Of the end of the world genre, I would say this rates near the bottom.I guess what annoyed me the most was how far off the author was to guessing how the world would decay... I'll list a few examples and let you decide for yourselves.1. The rate of decay of everything was grossly exagerated. Rail lines reduced to nothing but a pile of rusty chips in only 30-40 years? Entire houses rotting away and completely gone in just 10-15 years? Huge dams rotting and breaking after only 5 years? Very silly scientific assumptions.2. The lack of doing anything worthwhile for a so called smart man. He can only teach just one child to read? Doing basically nothing to improve his life over the course of 40 years?3. He comletely underestimated human will. The children in the tribe lacked any kind of basic intelligence. The author probably never had kids and assumed they are stupid without a formal education.You know what, this isn't even worth my time to continue listing all the flaws. Trust me, spend your time watching one of the recent Discovery Channel episodes on the end of the world without man, it would be much more compelling then this book.","I just finished this book, and I have to say it was interesting but nothing really special. I read The Stand many years ago, and loved it, although it was extremely unrealistic. Earth Abides has the realism, but it overdoes realism, without too much excitement. Basically if you have some time and want a quick read, pick this novel up, but if you are looking for a spectacular sci-fi or post apocolyptic book you are better off picking up another novel.","This tale of the apocalyse is very thorough in its examination of all of the changes in the ecosystem if man were to disappear from the earth. The first half of this book is a real page turner as the main character travels the countryside to discover what has become of the great cities of the U.S. after most of the human race has been wiped out by a deadly disease. Unfortunately, the second half of the book sinks into mediocrity as Ish's small band of survivors shun the \"old ways\" in favor of a return to illiteracy and primative life, which makes the second half kind of not belieavable. Christians [should] be offended that the author has absolutely no respect for and even argues against the existence of God in this book. Nevertheless this is a great book and worth the time and money.","The Greatest Book I've Ever ReadIn the book Earth Abide, By George R. Stewart thesubject at hand throughout the book is the survival of man. Thisbook takes place in San Francisco California where a vast plaguehas almost wiped out all of the Homo-Sapiens. This book followsthe life and times of one man (Isherwood)and his struggles to rrebuild his past American life. This is very heart warming thatour culture would last to the breaking point of our species. Ihope you all feel the same.Isherwood starts out in the mountains on a school studytrip. This is when he became sick from a rattle snake bite. Hereeven before the plague he had to struggle for his life. \"I justhave to cut the bite holes and extract the poison,(Stewart 12).This characteristic shows that he is a survivor and foreshadowshis success aaginst the plague.He also in many other ways begins to stabilize hissurvival iin this book. He ensures safety by meeting othersurvivors and creating a tribe. He tries to edjucate their youthwith their past culture, but loses the young ones to moreexciting activities. He even tries to better the adults, but hefaces complete anguish because not a single person cares. \"Nothanks, were going to play with the bulls, and go dodgin,(Stewart 44).Isherwood thorugh much heart ache and disappointment,goes for one last hurrah to save his people. He teaches his twomiddle aged boys to drive, and sends them in a cross countrysearch of survivors. When they return, it was to no avail. Theygave up and found no one worth finding. Ish is lost agian tothis new world.This is a reamarkable book that is one so captivating iscauses internal turmoil in yourself. By reading of a quitepossible tradgedy, it makes life much sweeter. Also by seeinganother man struggle so hard for all that we stand for isinspiring. Even though Ish couldn't accomplish what he wantedit's good to see he had a moment of clarity at the end of hislife. For then he realized how the only constant is change, andthat Earth Abides.","This book Earth Abides by George R. Stewart is about a man who passes by a massive disease which basically obliterates the US. This man, Ish, has to come to realization of this huge crisis and try to find survivors. It goes on and on about his thoughts and shows the struggles that he faces it the horrid situation. He goes around america finding survivors and ends up making a huge family in the end.This book was basically boring and depressing because it was just lagging on and on about how he thought of everything. It made you want to fall fast asleep at times too. (something that i obviously did) I am one of those kind of people who likes adventure and this book had none. It just was one of those books that wanted to show how horrible things could happen to us if we don't watch it. It sort of chilling and makes you depressed to think that it could happen. George R. Stewart was probably giving a good message out when he wrote this, but in the sense that people want to live there lives without this catastrophe, it is not very good.I would not recommend this book to kids under the age of 12 because it probably is too advanced for them. Also because kids do not have to worry about this sort of horror happening to them at that young of an age. People who need to sleep at night and want to fall asleep fast, please read. If you like adventure and mystery in a book, please go find a different book.","The book held great promise in the first few dozen pages... a believable plague and a believable reason for the protagonist to have survived. It goes rapidly downhill from there. The lead character, Ish, is pompous, self-absorbed, grating, and oh so very tedious. Even giving credit to the fact that the book was written in 1949, there are some very basic errors. Canned goods don't remain safe after 20 years, nor does gasoline remain usable. I kept reading hoping that the book would go somewhere, but it really never did. If you must download this book to your Kindle, do yourself a favor and pull down the sample. Read it, enjoy it, and move on. There's NOTHING more there. If you persist, don't say that I didn't warn you.","2 stars for the \"human\" emotional experience but the book lacked excitement and was mostly dull and depressing. The year of the rats, grasshoppers, etc. How original - not. The only thing the people did was marry more than one wife and breed. No one learned from \"George\" on how to keep the plumbing and houses in good order. No formal schools were set up so everyone learned to read so civilization could rebuild itself. They talked and made plans but never followed though.Ironic their small group refused to breed with a pretty but dim witted female because they didn't want dim witted children yet in terms of learning, each successive generation became dumber anyway. The author must like caveman because his little \"tribe\" is rapidly devolving into that era.","Many of the rave reviews for Stewart's post-apocalyptic novel are by readers who first read it many years ago. After prodding from a trusted reader-friend, I read it last month for the first time. Our hero, Ish, is uninspiring, and the other characters are wooden. Although the premise is a clever one, and many of the events that occur are unexpected and therefore interesting, it's difficult to get caught up in this story of mankind's fate after a disease wipes out most of humanity.Everything in the novel occurs within one man's lifespan, and it is therefore not surprising that Stewart exaggerates character traits so that mankind will swiftly evolve. But the characters are so unenlightened - Ish is the only one interested in teaching children to read, and he gives up after a while - that it's hard to take seriously Ish's assurance (to himself?) that these are average Americans.In short, an interesting concept but flawed in the execution.","If you like this kind of book, you must read this one. Written in the late 40's, this is the grandaddy of all apocalypse stories.","Despite its age and archaic language, Stewart's practical knowledge of nature makes this one of the best epoch-ending books ever written. Other stories reveal this knowledge but unfortunately, are out of print (Storm and Fire). You've probably read enough reviews to know what the story is about, but be prepared for some radical thinking compared to today's social standards. This was written when many words were compounded by hyphens. When you read of the tail-gate on the station-wagon, don't be shocked. We really wrote that way back in the late forties and fifties. His story reflects the way things were then, not now, so you'll likely find this story as alien as many future fiction stories. We really have evolved that much. Enjoy one of the great SF stories of all time. It certainly is my favorite.","This book is a &quot;must read&quot; for those of us living in Northern and Central California. His descripitons bring the story home. I have assigned this book to students for extra reading. I believe it should be assigned reading in our local high schools.","This review is only of the Kindle edition not the book. There are too many typos and editing problems in the Kindle version. Stick with a hard copy.","After I picked this up I realized I read this book a long time ago. Because the time setting is over 60 years ago some of the language and terminology has passed into disuse but, what would you expect? Entertaining and thought provoking.","I read this book about 35 years ago as a paperback and just decided to read it again as a Kindle edition. I liked it much more when I read it as a teen, now in my 50's it seemed kind of slow. It's not one of those books you read over and over again.","I first read this book as a senior in high school, and it's stayed with me all this time. Some typos and poor editing in this edition, but the story is worth reading and sharing with friends.","From start to finish, the book was entertaining if not thought provoking. I enjoyed the the perspective of the main character throughout the book and each encounter. He was much more relatable than most protagonists in the genre. I recommend this book to anyone looking in the survival / post-apocalyptic genre.","For the year written, it seemed ahead of it's time. It does not compare to &#34;Alas, Babylon&#34;. At one point I put it aside and read another book. Though, as the principal aged, his thought's and actions, were first class.","Warning before you read, no cannibals or massacres are devices used in this novel. It is a thinking man's teotwawki! I totally enjoyed sharing the thoughts of this quiet man who watched his world rebuild. Great balance for all the survivalist info I glean from all my other beloved shtf reads!","This classic book reminds us how greatly our civilization affects our surroundings yet how temporary and insignificant we are in this world.Mr. Stewart has written a book that keeps pressure on the reader to think introspectively. The style is easy to read and allows such personal thoughts to mingle with the words being read.","A thoughtful examination of the slow collapse of civilization in the lives of a small band of survivors brought together by one man who remains their leader until old age. In general, four stars, in science fiction genre alone, five stars.","George Stewart has crafted a science fiction tale that stands up fairly well to the test of time. Although it was first published in 1949, the language and ideas are still immediately relevant today. What would happen to you if civilization fell apart? How would you survive? How would people treat each other?The tale unfolds gradually, without suspense. For me, this was not quite the memorable novel that the highlighted reviewers described. I read the whole thing, but I could have easily put it down halfway through, since I did not develop a deep emotional attachment to the story or its characters. The novel is told in the third person, but through the eyes of Ish, the main character. This unusual point of view puts the reader at a distance. I didn't feel that I really knew any of the characters in the book, except for Ish.Ish has a bland personality. He is one who accepts his lot in life, even his lot in death. As the workings of civilization fail, he notes their passing. In the end, he does little to oppose his tribe's drift back into the stone age. This engendered my main disappointment with the novel. Why did the author make the protagonist so weak? There have been great novels fashioned out of weak characters, but ultimately I did not find greatness in this book. It is well written, but it did not fulfill my expectations.","This isn't badly written but, it didn't hold my interest like a really good Sci-fi book will do. It has a good story line but, the characters lack personality. It is interesting to read a book that was written as Science Fiction years ago.Earth Abides","Given a copy of \"Earth Abides\" in 1976 while stationed in Atsugi JA. This novel takes a single premise and projects the \"what if\" to a very logical and believable conclusion. I have read this novel three times since, each time obtaining a different prespective on the way human nature molds our life's decisions. Ranks with 20,000 leagues u/sea, The Time Machine and other SF stories that will stay within your mind years after the final page has been turned. One of the very few works of fiction that I recommend to friends - if you're searching for a believable work of science fiction \"Earth Abides\" will exceed your expectations.","I liked this book, its a very good view on what things could be like for the few survivors of a near species-ending pandemic. Written some time ago it does tend to be dated, but not annoyingly so. I knocked off a star due to the fact that it is somewhat navel-gazing in its execution. There's alot of deep thinking going on by the main character. Given all of this, its still worth a read and will IMO promote some thinking of your own.","The story of a world decimated by a fast-moving plague, Earth Abides follows the life of Isherwood, a 29-year-old loner who, while camping, suffers a rattlesnake bite that saves his life. After recovering from the snakebite (and other symptoms), he makes his way back to the San Francisco Bay area, where he finds his parents gone and the city deserted. Indeed, only a few people remain after the scourge that killed millions.Written in 1949, Earth Abides is a philosophical sci fi classic--it takes place before rock and roll, before microwaves, and way before computers. As Ish bands together with a few survivors to found a new civilization, he must decide what is important to keep from the Old Times, and what can be abandoned. The charm of Earth Abides is that it is as much a portrait of the mid-20th century as it is a futuristic fiction. It is the story of the last Americans.","The first scifi i ever read. Published , i believe, in 1949,the language is still current and still moving. Love a book that makes me think about the end of the world...","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it.

A rather feeble structure starts growing up.The author approaches universal questions about survival and extinction; civilization and savagery; social structure and anomie. He also examines religious values, ethics and life's ultimate sense.This book gives the reader a lot of stuff to think about. A very enticing read!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","In this profound ecological fable, a mysterious plague has destroyed the vast majority of the human race. Isherwood Williams, one of the few survivors, returns from a wilderness field trip to discover that civilization has vanished during his absence. Eventually he returns to San Francisco and encounters a female survivor who becomes his wife. Around them and their children a small community develops, living like their pioneer ancestors and gradually returning to a simpler way of life. It may seem odd to say that a book in which the majority of the world's inhabitants die is life-affirming and spiritual, but I'm going to say it anyway. I have read this book again and again over the years, and each time I come away from it with a deep feeling of peacefulness and confidence in the power of Mother Earth.","I read this book about 15 years ago and had completely forgotten its name, but this book kept coming back to my mind over the years and I had to search and rediscover this book. What made this book to stay alive in my mind were my own thoughts and ideas that I have developed during the years about how civilizations grow and develop trends like religions, life styles etc.The central character of this story, Ish was an ordinary man before the plague that wiped out the whole world. In the new civilization, he, oblivious to himself, started assuming the role of a leader. The civilization, against his own wishes, started looking up at him as their spiritual leader.Most of the story is made up of his reflections and ambitions for the new civilization. He intended the new civilization to be based on the old one, taking advantage of the technological developments already in place. But, the civilization chooses to follow its natural progression and he found everyone around him to be very comfortable with the barbarian way of life.It is a thought provoking book. Must read for anyone who is a thinker !","It seems like this book was super-great when I first read it about 40 years ago. I haven't been able to forget it. I am excited to see it is in print again---but why was it ever out of print? It is timely, provocative and just plain great reading for any age.","I read the Earth Abides, after listening to a friend describe this story as one of the most impactful he had ever known. Several years later in the early 1980's, I stumbled across a slightly used copy in a bookstore. George Stewart tells a fascinating tale of a post apocolyptic vision staged in the East Bay section of the San Francisco Bay area. This story has stayed with me and endures as a valued set of images. The struggle to make sense of the horrific and nonsensical was intuitively accurate. The story revealed in human terms the everyday efforts of a small group of survivors, suddenly stranded and adrift. The beneficiaries of a hulking but hollow industrial infrastructure that no longer served those who remained and their succeeding generations. The unfolding &quot;descent&quot; of industriatized society as well as the marginalization of technology was at once fascinating and frightening. The ending left me stunned, yet wisened.","My 12 year old daughter is reading Alas, Babylon right now and was discussing the plot with me. I immediately remembered reading Earth Abides over 10 years ago and was wondering if it could still be found. Obviously, there are lots of fans. What a compelling story about the potential future of mankind. Should be required reading in school","I read this book when I was 12 or 13 years old (more than 30 years ago) and it had a lasting impact on me. I have long since forgotten most of the &quot;classics&quot; I have read but this story has stayed with me through the years. Friends think I'm nuts when I say things like &quot; as you yourself, Ish, well know!&quot; right out of the blue. I just stumbled across it at Amazon and immediately ordered it. I can't wait to read it again!","I first read this book about 20 years ago, it caught my eye because the opening date used in the book is my birthdate 12/22/47. Have read it many times since and it never fails to make me re evaluate my current situation and really look at what is important and what is not. This is a must read book for me at least once evey 18 months.","I read this book 10 or 20 years ago, and I still think about it nearly every week. Where would I choose to live? What would I try to save? I have even thought of making my own screenplay adaptation based on the book. If the author needs help or motivation, then please e-mail me!","Read this book when you're really depressed. You will realize that things are not all that bad. Earth Abides provides hope. Even if everything we hold dear, everything we assume to be permanent, everything human disappears, the dream will survive.This is not the metaphysical good v. evil crap of Stephen King, nor the bang-bang rootin' shootin' end of the world of the pulps, but a quiet look at what the world would be like if mankind silently slipped away.","This book was captivating, and exciting. It makes you think abou the fragility of life, and how quick things change. This should be read at least once in your life. Stewart was 40 years ahead of his time when he wrote this and you don't want to miss out on it.","To read this book for the first time, at 10 years of age, is to enter suddenly into the reality of the fragility of the material society into which we are submerged.How could everyone really die off like that? This was MY town! MY Bay Area! MY UC Berkeley campus playground! A major metropolis! Fascinated, I couldn't put the book down. Living in Oakland, Ca. in the late 60's, I avidly looked out the windows when traveling through the East Bay, striving to see that little pony, running and running and running.It was beyond my comprehension that a thing so large as the Bay Bridge, which my grandfather had had a hand in building, could fall apart! I had thought such a thing would take ages and ages to break, not just a generation.All it takes is an earthquake, a dash of sea salt and a virulent bug.","This book is way ahead of it's time in exploring the way mankind can be taken down by virtue of the adaptabiliy of micro-organisms exploiting the large population of world ranging individuals. This book is scary that way, not to mention the writing is incredibly good. George Steward shows a love and understanding of ecosystems and how culture can be shaken and lost by the loss of the majority of constituant members. How Isherwood Williams copes with his deminishing expectations for the next generation is realistic and shows how most of us adapt to the whims and caprice of what life can throw at us. This book could be a world shaker if given a good rewrite updating the 1940s slant. With what we know now that Steward seemed to predict would come about intuitively, this work would be very popular today. Don't let that stop you from reading this great, great book.","Excellent book! I've owned a copy many years ago, and had to have another since my old copy was lost or stolen!!!","I, too, read this book 30-something years ago. What I remember most is the boy. I think he is Ish's son. He is the only one of the new generation to wonder how that dark box (the television) once worked. And he dies! I so wanted him to start figuring things out.","i have read the last ship alas babylon year zero footfall lucifers hammer this book was the best even though it was written long ago that is the most epic story MEN COME AND GO BUT EARTH ABIDES i read it 20 years ago and several times since","One of the most interesting books I've ever read. I wish he'd focused a little more on what happened in the rest of the world than the Tribe, but an amazing book all the same.","EARTH ABIDES by George R. Stewart is one of many books that take as its theme the destruction of mankind, leaving the Last Man on Earth as a narrator. THE PURPLE CLOUD by M.P. Sheil did much the same but Sheil's book was marred by excessive racism. Stewart's book is saved not only by the logical working out of the plot by its narrator-survivor, Isherwood, but also by Stewart's clever though subtle use of using Isherwood's slowly failing senses over many decades of post-apocalyptic adventures as a metaphor for the slow destruction of the American ideal of life.As the novel opens, the reader is told that the United States has been hit by a super-plague that has spread with lightning rapidity with near one hundred percent fatality. Ish, one of the very few survivors, passes by a abandoned car on the San Francisco bridge. This car is registered to a James P Robson of Oregon. This seemingly innocuous narration is later seen as the central metaphor of the book. Years later, Ish has several opportunities to pass the car in and out of San Francisco. Each time he does so, the car becomes somehow less distinct, a fuzziness that resonates first in his mind, then in the reader's mind. As the decades pass, Ish meets isolated pockets of survivors who have forgotten their American heritage. To these barbaric Mad Max types, Ish is the Last of the Americans. They tease him, they pinch him, they see him as a failed god type who could not deliver on the promises of the fabled technology of their legends. By the novel's end, he sees them pinching him, but he cannot feel them doing so. His senses have failed him just as America's technology had earlier failed to protect its population from the plague. Just before his death, Ish remembers the car on the bridge. Was it red? blue? green? Owned by Robson? Robinson? Robertson? He does not remember. But he feels sure that America has died, its technology has long since died, but its people live on, possibly learning from the mistakes of their predecessors, or maybe not. Stewart concludes his otherwise depressing work with a hint of optimism: \"Man may come and go, but earth abides.\"","I would have given this book fewer stars if I had been able to put it down. In spite of the stilted prose, odd inaccuracies, and generally bleak view of human nature, Earth Abides' end of the world scenario is completely gripping. There's none of the pseudo-mysticism of The Stand, just pure mid 20th century sci-fi goodness. Some of the scenarios Stewart presents aren't very subtle, and his views of women and blacks are what you might expect from 1949, but if you're at all interested in the &quot;what happens after a mysterious virus wipes out most of humanity&quot; scenario, Earth Abides is worth a read.","I bought this book and read it with the hope that it would be at least as good as Alas Babylon, one of my all time favorites. It was not. Earth Abides may have been the prototype of the collapse of civilization genre of Science Fiction but it has been outdone by so many other later books I hardly know where to start.To begin with, even the main character is very shallowly drawn and it goes downhill from there. You don't really care what happens to any of these people because the author does such a sketchy job of portraying them as having any of the qualities that we need to see in a literary figure in order to identify with them. This book is a science fiction version of The Grapes of Wrath without the character development. Be prepared for sexism, elitism, stupidity, lemming like fatalism and lack of preparation for any kind of civilized future. Also the author totally fails in most respects to know and understand how long canned food will last and how quickly you might be killed by scurvy living the lifestyle described in this book. Add in unrealistic pretexts for the characters doing what they do and you have a book that drags you into editor mode thinking how you could make it better.If you why I gave this book three stars when I disliked it so much, here is why It gets one of them for concept, the second for being the prototype of the genre and the third for having an interesting beginning. Where is really falls down is the ability to deliver on the initial promise. Books and movies for the most part succeed when they take an initial premise, however, far-fetched and then elaborate on that initial premise in a logical manner. After the initial suspension of disbelief this is how they suck you in. This book doesn't suck you in but actually loses you in contradictions, flimsy pretexts, and poor research with an ending that tails off in a whimper and left me whipping through the last several pages to get to the ending only to find that there was really no \"there\" there. Earth Abides gets credit for illustrating very convincingly the complex web of technical knowledge and individual job skills as well as motivations that keep our industrial society afloat but loses all the previous credit when it fails in a primal manner to explain why rational people who didn't really want to do a lot of work would makes life choices that initially and in the long run would mean a lot more work than the alternative choice that they didn't make. A low-tech lifestyle is a bundle of work compared to learning about and maintaining some of the elements of civilization. This is where I really fault the author as I believe that a lot of things including; the shelf life of canned goods, the back breaking labor of a hunter gatherer existence without even any horses, human craving for fresh food, and basic human emotions are ignored or glossed over in order to reach a contrived conclusion.","This a truly great book that everyone should read. Now to my experience with getting. I was looking for a reasonably priced hard back edition. This one said very good condition, in a price range I could live with. When I got the book I was happy with the condition until I found a bar code on the back cover which tore the cover getting it off. They should have specified that there was this sticker on the back cover. I like to keep my books and that is why I buy hard back. I was disappointed. Not only that but there was a sticker on side that read salvation army, $2.99. I really didn't care about the price difference but it showed me lack of concern by the seller which I do not appreciate. ruscolombo","I was really looking forward to reading this book as I have lately been going through a post-apocalyptic literature jag. After thoroughly enjoying \"On the Beach\", I purchased \"Earth Abides\". While \"On the Beach\" centers on humanity's ability to stay hopeful while facing the inevitable, I was confused by the intended message of \"Earth Abides\". The book's protagonist, Ish, likes to think of himself as the forward-thinking leader of a new civilization, but he comes across as more of an apathetic dreamer. In the twenty-plus years following a devastating plague, Ish and his companions evolve from foraging through supermarkets for food to....foraging through supermarkets for even older food. And I guess that is the really frustrating element of this book- in all that time no one has the foresight or gumption to make more than half-hearted attempts at creating some sort of self-sustaining community. The 'Gilligan's Island' crew did more in two years to create a society than this motley crew does in thirty!Kidding aside, I am sure that the author is making a statement about mankind that others have picked up on and that has apparently gone way over my head. I actually look forward to reading more learned reviews of the book to figure out what I missed.","Can't believe the negative reviews of this extraordinary novel. Read it for yourself. Then, you will appreciate life as we know it today. You will sleep well, adore more your family and friends, and rest assured that Earth abides.","I'm an avid reader. This is one of the most memorable books I've ever read. Earth Abides is a true masterpiece in every sense.","This book was written in 1949. It has withstood the test of Time.If You like a good Post-Apocalypse yarn, Read & Enjoy.","\"the Earth Abides\" is a well written book. It is now somewhat dated, but it still offers a good set of characters that are well developed and a solid story line. Good story telling, realistic characters that are well written, fine dialog, all combine to make \"The Earth Abides\" a pretty good read.","This book should be considered right up there with the classics of the genre. It's a wonderful and complex narrative that pulls you in and slowly pulls you along. It's not action packed but it is a very realistic look at a future where mankind has suffered a terrible tragedy. Highly recommended!","This timeless masterpiece recounts the most likely of the various apocalyptic ends to man's brief reign on Earth. Written from a naturalist's viewpoint, the novel recounts the fall of man following a sweeping measles-like pandemic. The author deftly informs us that the unknown disease is sirborne, that it hits only higher primates, and that the death toll is so all-encompassing that society simply vanishes. Mr Stewart also notes that the bulk of the few survivors are so devastated by the event that they become incapacitated. He also recounts nature's way of restoring an upset ecological balance and how the remaining animals cope with their new-found freedom.Ish Williams, the main character, himself goes through a period of psychological angst, but as with some persons in any crisis, recovers his equilibrium. He sees and meets others who cannot, but eventually meets an equally resolute woman. The book then briefly, but viably, notes how mores change when society disintegrates.In a section entitled \"Quick Years\", the couple meet certain other adjusted persons who have adjusted to the \"Great Disaster\", as they call it, and a rudimentary \"tribe\", so-called, comes into being. A tight, fascinating study leaves the way clear for \"The Year 22\", the next chapter.It is interesting to note how the members retain traditional taboos, remember dates and holidays, and yet slowly return to a hunter-gatherer society. Organized learning is a natural casualty, to be replaced by superstition. Obviously, the ability to conjugate verbs becomes surplusage at such a time.The tribe learns to face disease, criminality, and tragedy. Religious tenets alter in each such society. One is left with the belief that man hasn't really learned very much by all of it. You learn that the most important thing to primitive man was the bow and arrow, and fire-making. Ish preserves these for future generations, along with a less credible democratic tradition. Even the language begins to change, as history marches on.I won't spoil it by giving the ending, but you won't forget it, any more than you will forget any of the details of this incredibly well thought out, impeccably written book.Even if, as with some reviewers, you cannot accept Stewart's approach or result, you will be forced to concede that, in addition to being a great storyteller, he is an incomparable, almost lyrical, wordsmith.I hated to see the book end.","Even Stephen King admits he based THE STAND on this interesting novel. I also recommend Doherty's AREA 51 series.","Considering all the raves, I was disappointed by Earth Abides. Although the premise was interesting, it never really went any place and kind of left me hanging. I thought the discussion of how man's departure from Earth affected other species was thought provoking and well done, but the rather dry writing style and lack of depth in the characters left me underwhelmed.","All i have to say is this book is sooooo gooood!","Allow me to digress for a minute. Has anyone ever seen the Bruce Willis movie The 12 Monkeys? Anyone besides me that is? I didn't think so. Back to the subject hand. The plot of Earth Abides is similar to that movie. A biological plague devastates the United States and the rest of the world. Isherwood, &quot;Ish&quot; Brown, comes across a dying man named Barlow. After Barlow's death, Brown's the last man on Earth. If I may digress again, it's also similar to the 1971 Charlton Heston movie &quot;The Omega Man.&quot; Ish sets out on a cross-country trek to preserve our culture. In Arkansas, he finds roads in disrepair, and forests reclaiming everything. That's all I'm telling you. If you want to find out &quot;the rest of the story,&quot; READ THIS BOOK!!!","I read this for a geography class in college. Boy, what a downer. Think Little House on the Prairie meets Mad Max, it's that skewed and contorted. Moments of trying to rebuild are perpetually dashed. In truth, what we have here is the story of a man trying to recreate the past, and how a world gone wrong prevents him from achieving his dream. He is in essence, powerless to do anything about it for the forces against him are nature itself.I do not recommend this book unless you like to read about characters who have no hope whatsoever. I think the one plus is that it's set in the San Francisco Bay Area, so there's a kind of tangibleness to it from this reader.Beyond that, I should've trashed or donated this thing ages ago.","I read Earth Abides in the sixties as a teenager, and it is one of the few books that stays with me through the years. A beautiful, haunting book.","Every fan of post-apocalyptic stories has his own reason for following the genre. Mine is, that I like to see what the author considers most important to life in this world. When civilization and human society collapse; when food, medicine, and basic comforts become scarce; when friends are few and family is imperiled, what values will prevail? Most of the classic novels of calamity portray survivors determined to carry on, forming communities which are insular and self-reliant; learning and developing the skills and collecting the resources essential to living in a new world. Earth Abides paints a somewhat different picture.Ish is much like the heroes of the other popular disaster stories, in that he is determined to carry on; and to recover, as much as possible, the advances of civilization which are in danger of disappearing with the loss of most of the human race. Ish finds himself the head of a community and extended family; and though he is strong, educated, and resourceful, he finds nothing but frustration in his efforts to pass on his values to the next generation. His children and grandchildren have little desire to produce goods for themselves, having become dependent on the things left behind by those who died from the plague. He is unable to inspire them with his vision for keeping the great accomplishments of humanity alive.Something unique about this story is the occasional vignette describing what happens to the world around Ish, now that the human race has essentially become an endangered species. If you've ever watched the History Channel's \"Life After People\", you'll get a sense of that here - and see how these things directly affect Ish and the other survivors.I'm discovering that those classic novels which I can read many times throughout my life, and which say something new to me each time (see my reviews of \"1984\" and \"Fahrenheit 451\"), are those in which I recognize the signs of true works of genius. This is only my first time reading \"Earth Abides\", but I already wonder what it will say to me in five years, or ten, as I raise my children, or lead kids in my community, and try to impart my own values and experience to them. Will I be able to pass on those things they need to survive, or will I find myself, like Ish, disappointed, or having to realign my expectations?An engaging read, with all the hallmarks of a true classic.","I have read and reread this novel many times over the years, and this was just one of many copies I have bought to share with friends. It is the easiest reading but most thought provoking apocalyptic novel I have ever had the pleasure of reading.","This book is an interesting read about the end of civilization and rebuilding...but honestly nothing really happened in this book. The whole book seems like a huge buildup to some epic conflict/event that is going to happen, but never does.Maybe it's just a sign of the times that today's reader expects action, I always have a hard time with books written in the 50's.","This great book addresses one of the age-old curiousities so many of us have: What would I do if one day suddenly I was all alone in a world wiped clean of almost every other person?Ish, the main character, is a non-descript every-day Joe who finds himself in just this scenario. There are a few other survivors along the way, eventually forming a \"tribe.\" They all have their flaws and eccentricities which makes the story all the more believable. If you plucked a random selection of humanity and put them on a desert island they wouldn't all be super heroes! They would bumble along and learn how to survive as best they could within their limited capabilities.It was the way in which the author wrote the book that made it so great for me. The little interjections within chapters describing the changes in the Earth away from the human plot were great, and they provided context and realism to the human story. The progression through the 60 some-odd years was expertly crafted by singling out the years with momentous turning points for more detail, and speeding through the fascinating \"quick years\" in between. The descent back to a stone-age type existance twists the emotions. Sad for one who is familiar with the conveniences and comforts of modernity, but understandably necessary for the new human condition.A great novel that is considered a classic of post AP for very good reason.","I thought it started a bit slow, but in time I was certainly hooked. The writing style seemed a bit formal but I grew used to it. I found it easy to forget while reading that the setting was decades ago, as I could easily envision it happening in these times.By the middle of the book I was considering it \"required reading\" and thinking of family members I could loan it to. It definitely gains steam as the story evolves. Loved the ending, both powerful and moving.I can see that Stephen King must have been inspired by several different portions of this book to write the Stand. I consider this one better. I would have liked maybe to see it longer, with more character development of the younger generations. I suppose 900 page novels were uncommon in the time it was written, so we are left with what it is. A great, and thought provoking novel.","This book should be considered right up there with the classics of the genre. It's a wonderful and complex narrative that pulls you in and slowly pulls you along. It's not action packed but it is a very realistic look at a future where mankind has suffered a terrible tragedy. Highly recommended!","In 10th grade we read a story that dealt with the end of the world in our English class. I was intrigued. As i spoke again of this story a year later my 11th grade english teacher suggested that i read \"Earth Abides\". I shrugged off the suggestion being as though it was from my teacher (one of the lesser evils in my life) and it wasn't untill later that year when i found it on the library shelf that i finnally picked it up and began to read. I managed to rack up over 30 dollars in library fines because i litterally refused to return the book to its rightfull home. After reading it straight through three times in a row, I began to keep it under my pillow. I would pull it out at night and open it up and read randomly wherever the pages led me. Earth Abides may just be the most inspiring book I have ever read. I am now a Senior in Highschool. I since have bought a copy of Earth abides to replace the library's copy so that i could keep the copy that i had grown so close to. It is not so much the story or the people in it that i have attached myself to. The understanding of human nature and the way we react to crisis, and the way we move through life never ceases to amaze me. As I prepare myself to go into a career in Pyschology Stewart continues to be a constant inspiration in my search towards understanding of human behavior and human emotions. Also I am inspired as a writer. I can only dream that someday i will be able to write as well as Stewart. To be able to convey my thoughts or create and develope a character as well as he does would be beyond my imagination. Earth Abides leaves one person in awe and leaves them dying to read more but afraid to turn over the last page, for fear of ending the story. A wise person once said that finishing a good book is like losing a close friend. This holds true in Earth Abides. Whenever i read that last page my best friend dies with a simple punctuation mark. But as the book continues to remind us, Men go and come, BUT, earth abides.","The characters in George R. Stewart's Earth Abides symbolize many biblical people.Isherwood, the main character, is referred to as Ish throughout the novel. \"Ish,\" however, can also be a shortened form of the name Ishmael. Ishmael was a biblical wanderer who allegedly founded the Islamic religion. In the first half of the book, Ish is a wanderer, venturing all over post-apocalyptic America, eventually settling down and founding a tribe.One of Ish and Em's children, Joseph (who is referred to as Joey), is representative of the biblical Joseph. He is very gifted intellectually, and has the ability to see the deeper meaning in any situation, much like the biblical Joseph's ability to interpret drams; unlike the biblical Joseph, however, his talent is squelched, when he is stricken with typhoid fever, and dies as a result.The mentally-handicapped Evie has a name similar to the Eve, and is nave, much like her biblical predecessor. Eve is targeted by the evil serpent, and is expelled from the Garden of Eden when she partakes of fruit from a forbidden tree. Similarly, Evie is targeted by Charlie, a greasy character who lusts after her and plans to take advantage of her innocence. Before actually seducing Evie, however, he is executed by the others in Ish's Tribe, for Evie's well-being. Likewise, the serpent from the Bible receives his comeuppance in the form of expulsion from Eden and being made to walk on his belly for the rest of eternity.Ish's wife, \"Emma,\" is referred to as Em throughout the novel. This also ties in biblically, for \"Em\" can be short for \"Emet,\" a name meaning \"Truth.\" Emma is characterized throughout the novel as a strong-willed individual who helps hold the Tribe together. After Joey's death from typhoid fever, Ish asks Em if there might be a God taking vengence for Charlie's execution. Em responds, \"If there is a God who made us and we did something wrong before his eyes... at least we did wrong only because we were as god made us, and I do not think that He should set traps.\" (258) She speaks her mind, and she speaks the truth.Ezra was a biblical prophet who chronicled the return of the Jews to Jerusalem after their expulsion by the Babylonians sixty years prior. Likewise, in the novel, Ezra speaks with great foresight-much like a prophet-and lives to observe the Tribe's rebuilding of civilization.These and other biblical parallels make Earth Abides one of the most symbolic modern-day books.","I first read this book nearly 40 years ago, and loved it. I go back and re-read it about once per decade, and I never tire of it. This was the first &quot;post-disaster&quot; novel, and in some ways still the best. Because it was written in 1949 it's a bit dated in some ways, but the human element is so strong that it still holds your interest; you really CARE about the characters! One of my all-time favorites!","I don't think I've never read another book like this, so I'm not sure how to describe it. Very slow paced, not a lot of character development. Not a lot of explanation about where everyone went, I just didn't think enough how and why questions were answered early on. Interesting, but I really found it easy to put down. I also found some of the main character Ish's point of view about non-whites curious, yet somewhat disturbing. As if that was the way people viewed each other in the late 40s, and quite obvious lack of communication/knowledge about each other. There are some very interesting plot twists in here, none of them gory where they could be. Seems as if Stewart withheld gruesome details to focus on Ish's response to a completely changed world (no complaints here). I just find this book hard to recommend, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading this either.","I read this book years ago, lost my copy and when I heard the old time radio adaptation I got another copy. My first reading I was waiting for the clashes with other survivers, the cannabiles trying to eat them, you name it. Now after many years and another reading I understand Ish and the other survivers better. People cling to what they know, what is familiar. So did Ish. He was a bookworm, maybe even a geekish type. He loved the Hills, being solitary, studying. He was even in a profession that may have regarded less educated people as stupid (highly skilled science/engineering types come to mind) He was the last person to be chosen to kickstart humanity, to lead it back to greatness. He had the courage to drive cross country,alone, but not to keep the children in school or to take the books from the library.I liken the little colony to an office load of people who have never had to face a deadline, a change of upper management, or a takeover. They plodded along doing things the way they always did until circumstance forced an issue- the water, the visitor, there own need to bring in new blood. Ish knew what needed to be done but he lacked the wherewithall to motivate the others. He was not the charasmatic leader found in later novels. Those by S.M. Sirling come to mind, or Alas Babylon! Ish held the colony together and prevented their complete loss of civilization. He enforced rule of law when necessary, and made hard decisions.As others have pointed out, this book will continue to be debated as long as there are two people who have read it and thought about it.","I read this book aeons ago when I was in high school - of course back then it was a lot heavier (chisled in stone). It's a great book - though a bit antiquated and an interesting twist on the post-apocalyptic genre. The symbol of the single jack hammer has stuck with me through the years to the point that I never pick up my one handed sledge in the garage without thinking of the story. If you've never read it, you are missing a real treat.","I first read this in college for an English class and it really caught my imagination. Overall, the basic plot line of the book is very interesting and thought provoking, though the writing is not what I would call first rate. I like the fact that the book focuses on the fate of civilization in the wake of an overwhelming catastrophe without resorting to the seemingly inevitable appearance of zombies or other un-dead as is the case in so many other post-apocalyptic stories. I also like that the story balances optimism and pessimism, rather than going totally pessimistic a la 'The Road'.","I won't quibble with the author about such things as the shelf life of gasoline. I found this novel an intriguing insight into the era in which I was born. The author draws conclusions about post-apocalyptic civilization that, while I find them disturbing, are certainly possible. He casts the role of the antagonist not as the greed, lechery, or lust for power among others outside his tribe. Rather, the antagonist is the lethargy of a group of survivors who live by scavenging and whose creative urges never develop as a result.Personally, I find that a depressing scenario...perhaps because I also see it as a possibility. The main character, even though the tribe considers him their leader, is cast as one who stands outside the group. Instead of directing their energy toward creativity, he continues to see himself as an academic...an observer. Inevitably, the \"tribe\" is reduced to being a combination of scavengers and hunter/gatherers. Mr. Stewart does a good job of chronicling this decline. I simply think he (and his protagonist) accept this fate too easily.This is a book review, however. It is not a social commentary. The novel, itself, is well written and very effective in its' message. It's a worthwhile read, even if only undertaken as a study of the Amercan culture during the time period in which it was written.","So good. The good beginning and the good ending more than make up for the sometimes-boring middle. The whole, of course, is poetic. The author intended that and he succeeded. And he succeeded in making a post-apocalyptic story that is not dystopian, as so many of these contemporary stories are, and moreover is actually hopeful and, in the end, optimistic. And Stewart is to be thanked for that, as much as for anything else he has done here. As others have said, the novel certainly is worth reading again and I will do so.","At first, I found it hard to get past what I considered the author's naivete. Afterall, 99% plus of the world's population dies out, but there are few bodies...a plague of rats with the same result...the streets, even within the population centers, are virtually clear of stranded vehicles, etc. But, then I realized, this book was not about personal survival, it was about the survival of knowledge. Armed with the world's knowledge and a fine brain, Ish is only able to bequeath to his survivors a hammer, archery skills and the ability to make fire without modern means...despite his best efforts. This scenario of lost knowledge is even more probable today with Wikipedia taking the place of public libraries for many of our youth. An anthropological masterpiece! A must read for those planning to rebuild civilization after its collapse. (It's hard to believe this was written in 1949)","Earth Abides is a 1949 science fiction novel by George R. Stewart. When a plague all but wipes out the human race, a young introverted intellectual decides to observe the way the world responds to the sudden removal of humans, and, later, works to reconstruct certain aspects of civilization while battling to keep education alive.This is a thoughtful book: one of Stewart's primary themes here is a philosophical take on civilization: its pros and cons, what is gained and lost through starting over, and whether parts or the whole are worth rebuilding. Stewart, with the world's last scholar as his main character, does a wonderful job with this.But while Earth Abides is all about ideas, Stewart mostly punts on the moral and theological ramifications, as his characters move on quickly when these themes present challenges. In a world where people can't help but focus on death, that's a missed opportunity.In addition to the book's philosophical emphasis, Stewart's post-apocalyptic world is generally free of unrest and violence. While this allows Stewart to focus on his themes of rebuilding, his characters are rarely in much peril, and there's never much suspense. Yet as Stewart charts the life of his protagonist through the years and decades, the reader becomes invested in and attached to the character, passive and powerless though he may be, and this is why the novel is compelling, and why the reader will not mind the book's many philosophical detours.On the whole, Earth Abides is an intelligent, poignant and melancholy novel, and one of the finer and more influential works in the genre. Bonus points for an interracial relationship during a hostile era.","\"At the funeral of Homo sapiens there will be few mourners.\"I loved this book. So many end-of-the-world tales center on violence, war, superhuman heroes and unrealistic resolutions. Earth Abides is unique. It follows the story of \"Ish\", a biologist who was busy doing research alone in the mountains of California when a virus swept around the planet wiping out all but a few members of the human species. Immune to the virus, possibly because of a well-timed snakebite, Ish proceeds to explore the empty world. He travels across the United States, returns to the west coast, and helps establish a small community with a handful of survivors.Earth Abides is special because it all seems so real and down-to-earth. Ish is a scientist who makes keen observations and comes up with brilliant solutions to problems. But he is always very human. The character never drifts in a formulaic larger-than-life hero who can save the day. I also like the realistic mix of survivors. No, they aren't all Mohawk-wearing rapists and murderers. No, they aren't all highly intelligent saviors of civilization. They are an assortment of people one might see walking down any sidewalk in any city. Some smart, some dumb; some nice, some not so nice.Earth Abides covers a lot of ground, stretching out many years beyond the disaster. It is fascinating to read the author's description of crumbling cities and vanishing highways. It reminded me of the fine nonfiction book, The Earth Without Us.This book was a pleasure to read and I highly recommend it.\"At least,\" he thought, \"life is quieter.\"\"Yes, a tribe is like a child. You can show it the way by which it should grow up, and perhaps you can direct it a little, but in the end the child will go his own way, and so will the tribe.\"\"Men go and come, but Earth abides.\"","Earth Abides is a great book. It has always been one of my favorites. George Steward makes it easy to put yourself in the situation of being the last man on earth. This is the kind of book that you will read over and over through the years.","After reading this book in a college Sci Fi class at Berkeley almost 20 years ago, it remains one of my all-time favorites of any genre. It is positively amazing that it is almost 50 years old because it reads so thoroughly modern and relevant. The story grabs you right from the outset and doesn't let up. What makes &quot;Earth Abides&quot; so special is that it can be read on many different levels. While reading it for the first time, I often had to peer out the window to make sure there were still people around! Don't miss this sure bet","As a fan of non-alien, post apocalyptic novels, I sometimes struggle to find truly good books to read. Well, Earth Abides is a truly GREAT book, and you will not regret this choice. The book is well-written and unforgettable. It was written in 1949, but wears its age well. I was even able to enjoy its social perspectives toward women and race. George Stewart, like Mark Twain in Huckleberry Finn, really struggles with the social beliefs of his time, and questions both racism and sexism without overpowering his remarkable story of survival.I'm an avid reader. I especially like realistic science fiction, but don't limit myself to the genre. I rank Earth Abides in the top 5 of ALL the books I have ever read.","Earth Abides, written in 1949, tells the story of the fall of civilization from deadly disease and its \"rebirth\". It is actually three books in one: the disintegration of the world, the establishment of a new collective culture, and the moral weights of leadership. I initially read it as a post-apocalyptic novel and was rewarded with a philosophical treatise on the loss of a way of life and the dangers of man oversimplifying himself. The development of the tiny band's subsequent generations is more terrifying than a plague wiping out the planet. It is a story of 'what man wrought' but not in the way one anticipates. Originally classified a \"science fiction\" novel, now, with time, it must be categorized as literature.","\"Between the plan and the fulfillment lies always the hazard. Between the plan and the fulfillment stands always the frail barrier of a human life\" - George R. StewartIsherwood \"Ish\" Williams is one of the last people on Earth! How will he survive, how can he go on?\"Earth Abides\" is a book that I have owned for quite awhile & a book that I have always planned to read next, but never did. Finally I read the book and I was not only thoroughly impressed, I was in awe of George R. Stewart's ideas about how it would all end and how we could possibly go on.I'm amazed at the amount of the poor reviews for this book, I think most people are expecting moreI Am Legendtype material. This book is not that at all, there is some violence, not alot, there are no zombies, only people & animals. Many reviewers state that Ish should have done this, he shouldn't have done that, forgetting that this masterpiece was written in 1949. The book is so far ahead of it's time, it's baffling to me how George R. Stewart came up with some of these things. Would it be much different it this novel was written today, well obviously yes.Stewart's theory of how each animal will thrive before it's numbers level off really made me think. The everyday things that you never give a second thought, Stewart brings them to the front and makes you think, what do we do now, how do we get past this?If you like to read post-apocalyptic novels, if you've readThe Roadand enjoyed it, read \"Earth Abides\"This is the road that no man finishes traveling. Men come and go, but Earth abides!Enjoy~","How anyone could rate this book poorly is beyond comprehension. This is a well written, fascinating study on human thought and action. As much a intellectual simulation as a study of the time and attitudes of that time in which it was written.","George Stewart's \"Earth Abides\" is a tale of the end of the world by way of a plague that handles the subject in a way much different that similar tales. More thoughtful, deliberate and slow than I expected. More than anything it is a look at how man's conquering of mother nature is temporary at best. Take away man, and the Earth's memory of man will be soon forgotten. At the same time, it deals with civilization - what are the fundamentals of civilization, what keeps people together, and what prompted the creation of tribes, religion, superstition, and war.Without question, I enjoyed this a lot. One of the better takes on a post-apocalyptic scenario I have read to date. No Mad Max BS, no metaphysical The Stand mumbo jumbo, no b-grade nonsense ala The Postman, just pure introspection regarding how mankind would move on, and more importantly, how the Earth would move along as if we were never thereMandatory reading.","Some interesting ideas explored in this novel, such as the true worth, or otherwise of what we today term 'education'. Stewart asks the reader to question the validity of many of our modern values upon which today's civilization is based as well as pointing out how swiftly these would erode in the aftermath of some holocast. I am not sure if Ish made the correct decision when he completely abandoned the school for the children. There was only the one chance to pass on the knowledge of reading and the communication value it holds, and once lost it would be gone for ever. Also, the future survival of 'The Tribe' would have benefited enormously if future generations had access to much of the knowledge contained in the library.Another interesting point was how &quot;The Tribe', or rather 4 of its members, so quickly decided on the death penalty for Charlie.There appeared to be a complete lack of any real emotions in any of the characters. This was particularly noticable at the start of the novel when Ish looses not only all his friends, but his family also. There seemed no grieving process, and although he was certainly sad at the loss of Joey and Em, I did not feel his pain.Stewart could have written a far longer novel without loosing my interest and much more could have been included. The 'Quick Years' passed too quickly for me and I could have handled a few more hundred pages without loosing interest.Altogether an excellent read. We are asked to question so much of what we today hold as important. He questions our complacency, which is always a good thing.","Do you know the joyous feeling you get when you just happen upon a book quite by accident, read just a few chapters of it, and realize that it will be of great signifiance to you? Well, that was my experience with this book! I can't believe that I was not introduced to this book before now. It is with some sadness that I just completed reading it.My degree of connection with the main character, Isherwood Williams (Ish), astounded me; therefore, I must admit that my reaction to this book is quite subjective. It as is though the author looked into my mind and wrote a book about me in a post-apocalyptic world, including my greatest virtues and worst vices. The descriptions of the thoughts, triumphs, failings, joys, and frustrations experienced by the main character are poignantly honest and real. Metaphorically, this story seems to describe, with regard to many things, my existence in this, our so-far non-apocalyptic, world. For example, I find that I constantly struggle to define what I think to be the appropriate balance of individuality and community/state in our world. If you are one who consciously ponders such things or pursues a study of philosophy, I believe that you will view this book as a masterpiece. It just made my top 10, that is sure.I feel that I have gained much in my reading of this book. Mostly, I come away from this reading experience with a renewed feeling of peace and a reassurance in myself and the human spirit. I will no longer, I think, become quite so frustrated with regard to certain things or people in this world.&quot;Am I happy? Yes, I am happy. Things are as they are, and I am part of them.&quot; - Jack, great grandson of Isherwood Williams (Ish), the Last American.","This really great fictional accounting, by G.R. Stewart, of what our future might be, remains my favorite of the genre. I've just reread it for perhaps the third or fourth time - with some years in between. And although just a little dated it retains the vitality of adventure, promise and hope within a story of global tragedy. Considering current media hype about a possible Bird Flu pandemic this is an enlightening and enjoyable reading experience.","George R. Stewart's &quot;Earth Abides&quot; was written in 1949, so of course there are some anachronisms that occasionally jolt the reader. The Giants play at the Polo Grounds and the Dodgers at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. There are no interstate highways and radios all have vacuum tubes.These minor historical curiosities aside, what truly amazes is the timeless of Stewart's story. How many science fiction novels from 1949 still rate the glowing reviews of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; you will find here? By comparison so many modern sci-fi stories are formulaic, written with short, choppy sentences, shallow characters, and action sequences ready made for transfer to the screen.Stewart's vision of the future, where education and especially reading, slowly fad away after an apocalypse applies more to today's world than that of his own. His characters have little ability to bring back the technological remnants of the dead world, and truly, if 99% of the people on the planet were to disappear how many of us have the skills to keep the power going, the water flowing, and automobiles running decades after the disaster? His characters adapt to their environment in the most natural way.In the nearly four decades I have been reading books this is one of a handful that has made a memorable impression and which I consistently continue to recommend.","Earth Abides is a fantastic book. When I noticed it was written in 1949 I was a bit concerned, but it was not dated at all. The simple synopsis of the story is that everyone on the planet dies in a plague, except for a few hundred people. The story follows Ish, who was a ecologist or something and is now forced into the role of designing plans for rebuilding civilization. Along with a few others he meets and adds to his community, the book follows Ish's &quot;tribe&quot; for about 60 years. During that time the human build infrastructure deteriorates along with Ish's hopes of quickly restoring an active civilization. I would like to especially credit Stewart for including two long chapters he calls &quot;Quick Years&quot;, where he moves ahead 10 or 20 years. A less confident author would fill that 20 years with the same nonsense over and over making this a much slower and longer book.","It is a mystery how anyone could read this book and feel it is poorly written. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is a heart-breaking, gut wrenching , beautifully written novel. The only fault I had was its' length. I wanted it to go on and on. That is the highest praise I can give any book. Stephen King's Stand is a very good novel, too, but doesnt hit the emotional chords as well as this one does.","&quot;Earth Abides&quot; deals with the collapse of society after a plague has killed nearly everyone in the world. Isherwood (Ish) Williams was in the mountains when this happened, so he was spared the trauma of seeing everyone die around him.&quot;Earth Abides&quot; is probably one of the more realistic apocalypse books. A plague is tidier and more envionmentally friendly than a nuclear holocaust so the world was quite lucky. The survivors who band together are just ordinary people. No military strategists, scientific experts or specialists. No engineers or architects. They have to cope with life in a world without medical services, police, government, or farmers.Over the years, 20th century life is slipping away and Ish's tribe can't bring any of it back. Decades later San Francisco is a jungle and Ish is the last of the old race. The new race are illiterate hunters but they are also a more decent people. They treat the animals as equals, they are happier and have none of the hangups that affected 20th century society before the plague. They'll never know how to split the atom, build missiles, or damage the ozone layer.Because history tends to go round in circles I don't think civilization really died after the plague. It just went to sleep. One day it will come back, maybe in a few centuries. Something new and better. A rejuvinated world, fresh and clean.&quot;Earth Abides&quot; was a good book. It probably wouldn't work as a movie, though. Not after the criticism that &quot;The Postman&quot; got. But I thought Kevin Bacon would be good as Ish. I'm not sure who would play the other characters.","I was really looking forward to this book, and was left feeling really disappointed. I have now read all of what I consider the \"big-4\" of 50's PA literature, I found Alas Babylon and \"Canticle for Leibowicz\" excellent, \"on the beach\" overly depressing and unrealistic (but I was 16 when I read it so my opinion might have changed by now) but Earth Abides left me un-impressed.I thought the central character was so devoid of likeability and compassion it made him entirely unrealistic, in fact he came across as some sort of post-apocalyptic Daily Mail reader who spend a significant proportion of the first part of the book traversing America deciding if anyone was \"good-enough\" to share his planned new civilisation, but found the survivors too emotional, too provincial, too poor, too black, too uneducated etc etc. \"Ish\" would have benefited from a good punch in the face, and the only character who might have offered to give him one was executed for bragging about his carnal adventures whilst drunk.His long suffering and dignified wife Em, also had to make the startling confession that she was of mixed race and was beside herself with gratitude that Ish didn't then and there string her up from a nearby tree (like Charlie).The pace of the story is languid and the descriptions interesting, but for me, the entire book was held back by the attitudes and small mindedness of the central character.I am generally not a fan of the \"marauding biker gangs\" type PA style but in this case, if the Toecutter had rocked up at Ishs' house and decapitated him with some sort of boomerang, then the community and post-plague America would have been done a great service.Sadly, the attitudes of Ish probably just reflected those extant in America in the 50's but that means that the story has dated particularly badly, and although Alas Babylon also suffers from the same malady, the central character in that book is much more human and flawed and this makes that book a more engaging read.I am currently reading \"Summer of the Apocalypse\" which borrows some elements from Earth Abides, but is a much better fit for me in terms of what I like in PA books.","I first read this book when I was twelve and lived very near Berkeley. It was the first time I had seen the word \"ecologist\". The book has stayed with me for the last 59 years. I have reread it many times, and have used it as a basis for many earth sciences classes. While it is in a sense, apocalyptic, it is not preachy, or sensational, but a gentle, detailed reminder that in this day of climate change, it is not earth that is in danger, but our own and related species. That Ish, the protagonist , is an observer rather than a charismatic leader, gives us, as readers, a chance to observe with him the deeply meaningful theme that, \"men come and go, but Earth abides. One of my all time favorite reads.","Man has passed and what remains are the things built to sustain us; our cities, bridges, highways, grocery stores, street signs, power plants and dams, parked cars and canned peaches. These things do not simply disappear. Yet with enough time much will be lost to the weeds, the earth will take it back and intermingle our fallen silver coins with the pebbles of the riverbank.***As one of the founding novels of apocalyptic fiction, \"Earth Abides\" is not only a tale of what comes after global disaster but what is means to be human in the simplest and grandest sense. Although written in 1949, it continues to be praised decades later and for good reason, it is a captivating book that reaches beyond the genre of science fiction and into the heart of humanity. On the surface, \"Earth Abides\" is the tale of Isherwood Williams' survival yet it such an expansive novel that the tale of one man becomes that of all mankind.In our contemporary world we tend to forget (or deny) that individuals are entangled within society for better or worse, but the truth is that we cannot be separate from our culture, our history, and our way of life. I found this novel to be a mindful mediation on what it means to be a part of a community and a sort of Anthropological study of civilization.I was surprised and actually relived to find there were no zombies, no riots, no constant struggle to fight hordes of panic stricken survivors, but a rather calm and quiet end to the human race as it once existed. To be sure it seemed quaint; this notion of a peaceful ending in spite of sudden pandemic and inevitable death, but it was surprisingly optimistic without being wholly nave. Many people would likely continue to follow the rules of society even without the enforcers of law for a while, but with time, these things would matter less and less. And despite many who choose to do no harm to their neighbors, there will always be some men who pose a danger to his peers in malice or self-preservation.","I was surprised how well \"Earth Abides\" held up as a post-apocalyptic novel being read in 2010, even though it was published in 1949 - over 60+ years ago. It was remarkably current, in my opinion. Yes, there were a few politically incorrect/outdated views on women, race and retardation - based on this day and age. But if you read it based on the reality of 1949, some of the ideas put forward by Stewart were actually ahead of his time.This novel is not an action packed, shoot em up, zombies control the earth PA novel. It is a character study on how different people or small groups of people react or shut down in a disaster. And the way they act and react may not be what we would consider to be the best - for the individuals involved or for the salvation of mankind. But I can actually see the events in \"Earth Abides\" happening. Scary to think of but imaginable. This book stands the test of time.","I ordered the audio book based on an article that called it \"one of the best post-apocalyptic novels\". I expected a plot that would detail the heroic efforts of the protagonist to survive and thrive in the world after most of the human population dies. I did not expect the protagonist and his band of survivors to do the obvious - to be scavengers upon the bones of civilization, and to give up or not even try to keep or advance civilization's progress up to that point. The slow realization that the path of least resistance would be the course of action was one of the most depressing and poignant moments I have had in considering the future of humans on this planet. I felt I was personally witnessing the de-evolution of mankind.Of particular interest to me was that the author, George R. Stewart, chose to use a virus as the vehicle that killed most of the inhabitants, not the obvious nuclear holocaust. The fact that atomic bombs were capable of killing off the bulk of mankind was still very fresh in the minds of his readers in the late 1940's. Viruses as agents of destruction seem to be one of the very real swords hanging over our heads today, making us relate to this book even more.","George Stewart's \"Earth Abides\" is regarded as a classic of the overcrowded post-apocalyptic genre, and for good reason. But the book achieved classic status only because its post-apocalyptic setting is a secondary feature of the narrative.Stewart didn't write an adventure story about a loner/survivor who must fend off attacks from marauding mutants. In fact, given the context, there is surprisingly little action at all.Instead, \"Earth Abides\" puts you inside the mind of the main character, Ish, for an extended meditation on the nature, specifically the frailty, of human existence.Stewart ranges far and wide, if not deeply, into an astonishing array of issues, from the personal to the universal. That said, there is a core idea, which the title expresses in part:Earth abides. The dude does not.It is a pagan formulation: Earth 1, Humanity 0. And while I would put it another way, I'm at least grateful that Stewart made me think. Who needs marauding mutants?","This book has been torpedoed by some readers because it isn't \"The Stand.\" While \"the Stand,\" is one of my favorite books, what happens after the world is wiped out by plague becomes highly supernatural. Much as I like that, Stewart shows a much more realistic side of what would happen to whatever few survivors this world might have if a plague took most of us out of circulation. Any possible community would be small, and battle dogs, ants, rats, diseases, and the like. The characters here are never to be forgotten--Ish, Em, Joey and Charlie above all, and the plot stays with you long after the book is finished. I read it in the '80s when I worked on a book assembly line. Imagine my delight that it is now available again. This is up there with \"Alas Babylon,\" and just a bit less depressing than \"On the Beach.\"","If almost all the people in the world were dead, and you had to spend your life with an egotistical, chauvanistic, racist white guy with absolutely no redeeming qualities you'll love this. Archie Bunker would have loved this guy. I, did not.Old does not have to be disfunctional.","Stewart's Earth Abides has long been considered a classic in the sci-fi genre and a classic apocalyptic novel (it even helped to inspire Stephen King's The Stand). And it is no wonder why. Stewart has a highly believable, excellently written story here. Though it does lose something in the the third part of the book, when Ish is an old man. One you should definately pick up.","I think I first read this book when I was about fourteen, and it made a powerful impression on me then, so much so that I could still remember almost the entire story some forty years later. But, given that youthful impressions are sometimes not all that accurate, I decided to re-read this and see if it is really as good as my memory said. It is.The scenario is simple: what would happen if a new virus suddenly wipes out almost everyone? And this is no ordinary disease, as the fatality rate is incredibly high, leaving (at most) perhaps one person in 100,000 alive. With this as a starting point, Stewart looks at his new world though the eyes of Isherwood Williams, who is something of a loner, intellectual in outlook, an observer, rather than a doer. This outlook stands him in good stead in the immediate aftermath of the great die-off, as it gives him a reason to live, to observe just how the Earth will react to the sudden removal of that pesky, environment-changing species called man. And reaction there is: ants, rats, dogs, cattle, cats, wheat, corn - each has its fortunes drastically impacted. Many of these changes are detailed in some interstitial material that is told from an omniscient viewpoint, very reminiscent of the similar technique Steinbeck used in The Grapes of Wrath, and perhaps these sections are just as powerful as Steinbeck's, though they don't have quite the great prose-poetry that Steinbeck had. By detailing these changes in this manner, Stewart makes his scenario both highly believable and very immediate.But Stewart's main focus is what happens to the very few people that are left. Ish eventually finds some other survivors, most especially the lady who will become his wife, Em, and here we find some buried social commentary that probably made this book quite controversial when it was first published in 1949, as Em is not white, a point made very subtly and never directly stated, as one of the clear messages here is that race, looked at from the standpoint of long-term survivability, is of absolutely no consequence.Another point of departure for this work from the standard disaster scenario is that there is no world-saving hero; mankind cannot get back on its feet in short order and re-establish civilization, and that the great majority of survivors would necessarily live off the leavings of the old civilization, for the simple reason that it is far easier to open a can of tomatoes than grow your own. That this same attitude of doing the minimum to survive would carry over into other aspects of post-disaster living, so that there would be little or no effort to teach children how to read or fix some of civilization's infrastructure as it slowly fails, such as electrical power or water supplies, is perhaps a debatable point, but Stewart's depiction makes this very logical and believable. Right alongside of this portrayed attitude is what do people do when there no longer is any `law': what is right and wrong and how do people cope with actions by some that threaten the survivability of the Tribe? The answer Stewart shows to this problem may disturb some people, but it strikes at the heart of the whole concept of `for the good of the many' and what personal moral responsibility is.Some have commented that this book is `dated', and there is some of this, as tube radios and phonograph turntables show just where technology was at the time of publication, but any serious reader will quickly realize that the specifics of the technology are immaterial to the thrust of this work. And perhaps somewhat ironically, there is one item detailed here that is as current as tomorrow's headlines, when Ish pulls down a book from the University shelves which details imminent climate change (keep in mind when this written!) and decides that this, too, is irrelevant to his current needs - the climate will be whatever it is, and mankind will just have to live with it.The last section of this book paints a very powerful picture of just how gods, legends, and social mores become ingrained in a society. Perhaps it's not the prettiest picture of where mankind is headed or how well he'll deal with problems, but it is remarkably plausible and will produce strong feelings of melancholy, despair, and (perhaps) subdued pride.A remarkable work which avoids just about all the pitfalls of typical post-apocalyptic works, and has a great deal to say about just what makes man man and what is truly relevant to the daily business of living.---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)","A virus wipes out 99.9% of the population, leaving the few stragglers left to figure out how to survive, organize (or not), etc. Don't be fooled into thinking that because this book was published in 1949 that it somehow won't be 'with it'. It's pretty well thought out, both in terms of what happens to the people AND everything else (dogs, cats, cattle, crops - things which other authors might leave out entirely), and in a departure (which I won't reveal here) from the usual 'we'll survive and things will eventually return to normalcy' plot so often present in this type of book.","Stewart's novel begins with a science fiction premised used by Stephen King in The Stand -- a virus quickly wipes out most of the world's population -- but from that point on, the two books (and others that have used this idea) are completely dissimilar. Stewart has little interest in the plague itself, and it is covered in a short part of the book. Rather, his interest is in how people react to being deprived of modern civilization. For years, his characters try to keep things going by teaching their children to read, and keeping memories of the old world alive. However, the drastically changed circumstances of their children's lives make this impossible, and the small group of survivors descend to a hunter-gatherer civilization.Stewart also addresses the question of what would ordinary people do who find themselves deprived of the protections of the law, and thus having to make their own difficult choices.Those who read this book expecting a typical science fiction novel will be disappointed. Stewart uses science fiction themes to explore significant issues in much the same way that George Orwell did in 1984. An excellent novel.","Apparently many of the reader-reviewers are science fiction or horror fans and thus compare Stewart's novel with that genre. Those readers are not likely to appreciate the ideas expressed in &quot;Earth Abides&quot;. Stewart was one of the first fiction writers to deal with ecology and human's place in the balance of nature and his extrapolations from anthropological thought of that period (1940's) are exceptional. It seems that many of the readers, without realizing it, got so caught up in the novel that they criticise the protagonist's character flaws as though he were a &quot;real&quot; human wanting him to be &quot;more insightful&quot; and less of a pedantic man. Those flaws appear to make him more authentic.Although classified as science fiction, the term speculative fiction is a better fit. It is interesting that the period of time covered, approximately 1948, to the present day, and although it was written in the late 1940's, it is still fresh today. Looking back, if there had been a catastrophe at that time, we would very likely today be at the point where the novel ends. A hundred years from now the novel is likely to be a classic and hopefully be on a shelf not labeled &quot;Science Fiction.&quot;","I know this is considered a classic, but, in my opinion, it does not pass the test of time. None of the characters, including the narrator, Ish, is engaging, and the passivity of the survivors is hard to accept. I don't need zombies to make PA fiction exciting, but reading about survivors who basically just live as if nothing has changed, happy to eat canned food is dull and depressing.","Well what can I say - if you want a book that will make you think about it not only whilst you are reading it but for a long time afterwards, then this is the book for you. The story is great and I thought Ish's character was great too - I know some people didn't like him (including my husband) - but I think that is just the point. He is a young man with little experience who thinks he knows everything because he has been to university, but really doesn't know that much at all. Sure he's not perfect but who is! He does the best he can and whilst we may not always agree, at least he is a believeable character. It has been a long time since I have read a book and thought \"wow\" when I was reading it and wanted to debate it for hours afterwards. The only other memorable books I can think of are \"Wild Swans\", \"Watership Down\" and \"Day of the Triffids\". This beats all of them! I followed \"Earth Abides\" with \"Timescape\" - which made me appreciate even more just how good \"Earth Abides\" really is.","\"...and the government of the United States of America is herewith suspended, except in the District of Columbia, as of the emergency...\"With those ominous words begins a classic tale of the end of human civilization. \"Ish\" (a graduate student whose given name is Isherwood Williams) is the barely tolerable protagonist who survives a rattlesnake bite (and possibly some strange infection) only to leave the forest and find a world of ghost towns. As Ish discovers, while he was in seclusion, engaged in fieldwork for his thesis, a virulent plague broke out worldwide and eliminated virtually every other human being from the face of the earth. Instead of descending into a drunken madness like one of the few survivors he meets, Ish roadtrips across the country looking for a vestige of the learned civilization he remembers. Alas, his quest comes up empty-handed, for, as he discovers, not many people have survived the plague, and those who did are (understandably) not too interested in higher education or high culture, preferring instead to focus on subsistence and maintaining their sanity. Along the way he picks up a loyal friend in the form of a dog, and finally returns to the Bay Area of California, where he meets a group of survivors and sets out to re-establish some kind of human community. In the second half of the novel, we follow the growth of this community and are faced with Ish's growing apprehension about humanity's future. Much to his chagrin, the aspects of civilization he prizes so much--music and art appreciation, reading and literature, mathematics and philosophy, etc.--seem to have no place in this new world where humans are once again a part of the natural order and not her proud conquerors.While the novel itself is quite a good read, filled with interesting speculative insights into human life after the collapse of modern civilization, Ish provides an aggravating example of the 1940s American white male ivory tower academic (his character's qualities definitely date the novel). When he encounters black survivors in the South, he muses about the possibilities of exploiting them and establishing his own little fiefdom. He continually considers his cohorts in the new community as his intellectual inferiors, even as they manage to carve out a new life in the face of this overwhelming calamity while he reads his books. That he spends more time worrying about the restoration of high civilization than about the very real issues of day-to-day survival that they face was also incredibly infuriating. Ish is at his most distasteful when he contemplates his son Joey, a boy whose sole worth seems to be the fact that he is bright and can read. Somehow, though, in spite of all his character flaws, Isherwood Williams ' arrogance and detachment are finally overcome by his circumstances, and he has, if not a complete change of heart, then at least an acceptance of the reality that \"men go and come, but earth abides.\"","This post apocalyptic book starts off strong with somewhat of a new twist on the traditional post-collapse civilization, as told by one graduate student and his struggle with a life after modern conveniences are gone. He is an observer kept alive as the second wave of deaths wash over the world by a mere need to observe and discover. I'll never forget reading as if with him while he waited for electric power to finally fail. The lights dim slightly and with this realization he waits up as a long time friend passes into oblivion. Several of the concepts are quite dated (the copy I read was re-released in the 70s but still referred to household items long since out of date and probably belonged in the original publication from '49).The main character is faced as being the only intellectual left in a small band of survivors he later deems \"The Tribe.\" This is the placement of the majority of the book and faces the questions of what humans would do with so much time on their hands? How they would adapt to a life with everything they need laying about them, but no deadlines to push them to reestablish a civilized world? It also conicals several things other books leave out, such as the adoption of odd superstitions about \"Americans\" by children who have never known a life with organized government or life outside of their small Tribe. I would give this part of the book a higher score, but the later portion fell short of my expectations and the standards set by the rest of the work.As the book continued it became quite redundant and predictable, and though I had high hopes the book would somehow redeem itself and return to it's previous glory, I was left disappointed. If you are looking for a book with a strong resolution upon completion, this is not a book for you. While I am glad I finished it (the first half was quite good), and several major problems were resolved, a larger picture of what would happen with the passing of the main character was left unsaid (though a general idea was obvious and alluded to several times). This portion of the book brought down the overall rating I could give.I would recommend this book as an easy read with an interesting take on the traditional end-of-the-world concept.","Earth Abides from George R Stewart is a good book about what would happen if suddenly the entire world population, except for a few, would die from a disease. As such, the book is remarkable as one of the first post-apocalyptic novels in existence (dating from 1949). And it is a very well thought through one too. Aiming for realism, exploring the various effects and problems the survivors would face, it renders the many successive post-apocalyptic stories as merely unrealistic popcorn stories. However, don't expect the story to \"draw you in\". The events are typically kind of boring, and even though there is a distinct set of characters, they never really develop. Further, the writing style is not always really gripping, but rather unexciting. Also the dated moral reflections might be a let down for some, but I suppose that is mainly caused by the time the book is written.The book details a number of time periods: just after the epidemic, 5 years later, 20 years later, and 50 or 60 years later. The time in between is sketched very roughly. The story centers on Ish, a survivor of the mysterious epidemic. Ish is an academic, working on his (PhD?) thesis in Biology. We learn later that if the epidemic would not have struck that Ish would probably end up as a professor (like the writer). Ish is, apparently, the only 'thinker' left on the world, and all the people he meets are about (or under) average on IQ and ideas, but not necessarily in other practical matters. Ish is an observer, not really a natural leader, and he does his best to plan a safe way for the remaining people towards a new civilization. However, it becomes clear, that even though Ish knows a lot and has many skills, that a lot of work and ideas hardly influence the people in his community and that he fails on many great planned things, even though he also has some unexpected success with small but eventually rather important things.The good part of the book, what makes it a classic, is that it explores most issues you can think off about what would happen if such an epidemic would occur. It explores the psychological effect in the beginning, the scavenging of the stores for existing goods, the mingling of very different average people in a group, the effect on the rest of the ecology by the sudden disappearance of men, the effect of aging on materials, infrastructure and goods, the way the average people would face these changes, (small) group interactions, diseases, unnecessary skills (e.g. reading), the automatic development of groups of people, and the limited effect of the ideas of the intellectual few (maybe dealing with some of the writer's own frustrations). And probably I forgot a few explored ideas as well.However, the book is not perfect, and not a classic in the sense of some Heinlein, Clarke or Asimovs that I have read. Some flaws: characters are rather stereotypical, the main character seems to be a bit thick and single minded at many points (irritating sometimes), all characters have a great lack of initiative and many times things just stay as they are, but also not all ideas are fully (satisfyingly) worked out. Also some logical plot holes exist, and timescales of things happening seem to be bended a bit to fit with the lifetime of the main character.However, in spite of the many small flaws I shortly pointed out, I can still recommend the book. It is not for everyone, and certainly not for people that look for a really exciting story, but the discussed ideas and the thoroughness in which many of those are explored (making it a kind of hard-scifi book), combined with the historical value of this book as a very early post-apocalyptic book make this book really valuable and read-worthy. If you are not immediately letdown by its flaws and if you are interested in idea-books and speculative fiction, I would certainly give this one a try.","Some good ideas. Some interesting speculations on the nature of man and society. Some interesting predictions of how the earth would respond to a die-off of humans. Ruined by needless wordiness, 2 dimensional characters and very little to say of a philosophical nature. A bore and a disappointment. Skimmed the last 100 pages.","Glowing reviews, word of mouth praise and the subject matter all left me eager to read Earth Abides. Unfortunately this book fell far short of my expectations. The premise of a global plague is truly fascinating (and frightening), especially in light of recent world events, but the story drags on in such a depressing and mundane fashion that reading the book became a chore rather than an adventure. The lead character's over inflated opinion of himself is so prevalent through out the book that it prevents any character development on the part of any other survivors. Over 300 pages and you barely get to know any of them. That would not have mattered so much if the author had done a better job of portraying the aftermath of the plague. Too little attention was paid to what would happen to the local environment. Impacts are generally glossed over in short, simplistic passages. Survival was no more difficult than raiding the local grocery store and opening a can of beans, even after 20 years. I never felt the horror and struggle for survival that one would expect with such a global catstrophe. The technology in the book is certainly dated but I didn't find that a distraction. This is not an enjoyable read. Better classics on man wiping himself out include \"On the Beach\" and \"Alas, Babylon\". For a more up to date adventure try \"Ill Wind\" by Anderson & Beason.","I love to read, so there are very few books I don't finish. I usually slog through even the bad ones. Here's my take on this book. I was looking for a novel about how people came up with creative ideas about how to survive in a world after civilization is wiped out. This book dealt with that facet somewhat in the first hundred pages. After that most of the book deals with moral issues. \"What are the moral or ethical responsibilities of survivors\" is the main theme of the rest of the book. After an ok start, the whole rest of the book seemed preachy and a little like the author was trying to coerce me into agreeing with his point of view. Three-quarters of the way through the book I quit reading, because there were no characters I was interested in enough to care what happened to them.","Written by a self-righteous professor of English Lit from Berkeley. The authors preconceived notions about the ignorance of rest of us comes across pretty clearly, as his protagonist constantly judges everyone based on his perception of their intelligence. Book was very poorly researched....the protagonist and his children live mostly off of 20-30 year old canned food for most of the book (something that would probably kill you). He fixes up a jeep and then fills it with 20 year old gasoline (which is unusable a year or two after its refined). He raises his offspring in total ignorance...his greatest achievement being to teach them how to make a bow and start a fire (teaching them to read was apparently not important). Worse end of the world book I've ever read.","The plot in Earth Abides is very simple. It is basically the ongoing struggle one would face in creating a perfect society. The setting is in San Francisco, California after a great disease has struck and wiped out 99% of the human population. The main character is a survivor named Ish. He survived the disease an interesting way, and then sets out to build a new society. Through his trials and errors you find out the complexity to people and modern society. You understand the restraints that society has on a person, even if it is not present. For example alcohol is a big part in the novel. Without anyone to stop them, people begin to drink themselves to death.Earth Abides' plot is thin, and dragged to eternity and back. The author spends the majority of the second half of the book reasoning about worthless issues. They were worthless because they do not apply to the main theme of survival. This makes you very confused, as the book is already hard to follow. He also spends a good deal of pages with Ish's inner thoughts, which are basically a bunch of complex nonsense. It is very hard to put your self in his place, and understand his thoughts. He becomes so paranoid with every decision he makes, that he becomes overly analytical.This book could possibly be amusing to very patient adults. It has close to zero action, and does not keep you turning pages. In reality it is the exact opposite, it puts you to sleep. Anyone who likes a book that keeps you interested, Earth Abides is not for you. The only person I would recommend this book to, would be an insomniac who needs to find a way to get to sleep.","Not really SiFi. Fiction and Apocalyptic yes, but after a very few chapters to grab your interest, author drifts off into non-related daydreaming, repetition and his personal philosophy on various character's lives. I'm betting that he was a self proclaimed authority and certainly a pipe smoker.No science, little innovation, but it goes on and on. You keep hoping it will get better, but unfortunately, it doesn't. How it won any award remains a mystery to me. If you are looking for an exciting science fiction work, sorry, but this isn't it.","Having loved this story 20 years ago as a teenager, it pains me now to find that it is surely the worst novel on my bookshelves. All the characters are two-dimensional. The dialogue is uniformly stiff and amateurish. The story's hero is arrogant, aloof and dismissive of anyone he perceives as inferior. Since he actually perceives *everyone* as inferior, the book quickly becomes very tiresome. Perhaps the saddest aspect of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that the story is clearly and shockingly the fantasy of someone who dreamed of existing in a world without people, or at most with just a thin sprinkling of simple folks over whom he could rule as their intellectual master. &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is a truly awful book.","I love a good post-apoc book, but this one just wasn't that great. Other than the narrator, the male characters aren't very well developed and the female characters were even worse. The jumps in time threw me off and the overall plot just didn't grab me.","I'm surprised so many people rated this book so highly. It's hideously dated, both in language, and in writing style. Not even in the same ballpark as something like The Stand. It was interesting to think about what path civilization would take without a unifying threat after an apocalypse, but the writing just ruined it for me. No great character development at any point, a lot of cliches and brushed over details. It kept me reading, barely, mostly to see if it went anywhere. Pretty disappointing though.","I am a fan of similar themed books. But this one just does nothing for me. The only interesting aspect is the (almost consuming) focus on how other animals in the biosphere react to the human population crashing down.But that doesn't make up for these huge flaws:1) The interpersonal aspects are awful.People just don't relate to each other the way the author describes.2) Dominated bi sudo-Christian bible verse that gets added in to say something meaningful is happening3) The storyline takes place so long ago that it is hard to see it as anything but a time-piece.4) Racist, sexist views embedded very deep in the assumptions5) Overall a very boring story line. No emotional growth in the characters and no growth in the community or plot. Just terrible, really.","This is one of my favorite books. Written in 1949, it's remarkably contemporary and accessible. I love the references to hifi. It seems to me more of a work of philosophy; a meditation on humanity, relationships, change and civilization, which is precisely why it's so timeless. It's also something of a love story and there is a gentle tenderness pervades the entire story. Ish is a wonderful character. As the world is completely and unalterably transformed around him, he strives for continuity and permanence. In the end, his striving is for naught, he's failed. But there is no bitterness and remorse but an acceptance of the world around him and the love that expressed itself in his relationships with others. The story wasn't anything like I thought it would be, much better.","Earth Abides was written by George Stewart and released in 1949. The story follows the main character Ish, short for Isherwood, as he is one of the few people to survive a pandemic that kills the majority of the human population. Ish has an interesting perspective on the incident as he has an academic background and tends to view events through in a very historical, geographical way. Ecology and population dynamics are frequently discussed throughout the story. Stewart explores population fluctuations in nature in comparison to the die off of humans. Much of the story takes place in California, near San Francisco and follows Ish through most of his life following the outbreak. On a practical level, this book contains more generalized preparation information such as the durability of canned food, hunting and gathering methods and the continuation of life without public water and electricity. While Earth Abides is certainly entertaining, it also provides a very unique perspective on the end of civilization and it will leave you with some very interesting ideas for your consideration.","I read Earth Abides months ago, and I still find myself thinking about it often. Some of the reviews I read before I read the book mentioned the book remaining with the reader for years and years; I didn't expect that to be the case for me, but now I think it will. We take so much for granted, both things and people, but what would we do if life as we know it basically vanished? How would we manage alone? What abilities would we need which we don't have now? So much to think about!","This book is not so much about the end of the world itself; instead, it uses the end of the world - the end of most of mankind, anyway - as a plot device to explore how a new, small, totally contained society would develop out of the leavings of the old one. This task it accomplishes quite well; the growth of the Tribe in San Francisco and their mythological beliefs, traditions, and practices is fascinating, if a little slow-moving in several parts. But because societal development is the primary concern of the novel, the little details are simply glossed over, and there are so many technical errors or things left unexplained that it had a tendency to lift me out of the story and re-engage my disbelief. For instance, most of mankind is wiped out by a mysterious, very viral disease, but it's never explained what the disease is, where it came from, or why some people are immune. In fact, the main character of the book comes down out of the hills after it's all over, having no idea what was going on the \"civilized\" world, but he shows a total lack of curiosity about what happened to everybody that I found unbelievable. And when several survivors get together, they never discuss where they were or what happened to them when the Great Disaster (as it's called in the book) went down, which I think goes totally against human nature. And the survivors continue to live off the leavings for forty or more years afterward, eating canned food that must have long since gone bad and even smoking cigarettes that had to have been unsmokeable after at least a year. They never bother to start even a rudimentary garden - an idea which I think would have occurred to just about anybody - but somehow manage to live in nearly perfect health until old age without eating any fresh fruits or vegetables. Again, I understand that these details weren't important to the author, but they were important to me, and so these little problems served to disrupt what was otherwise a well-written, intriguing take on the old end-of-the-world plot.","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it. This maturity is perceptible all along this work.The story is situated in a world devastated by a sudden pestilence that annihilates most of humankind.

A rather feeble structure starts growing up.The author approaches universal questions about survival and extinction; civilization and savagery; social structure and anomie. He also examines religious values, ethics and life's ultimate sense.This book gives the reader a lot of stuff to think about.

The internal debate and conflict and the final resolution are wonderful. The characters are personable and easy to relate to. More importantly, in the time of the H1N1 virus and other diseases, a harsh and jolting wake-up call to humanity and civilization. Worth every cent.","This book is amazing in that it was written so long ago (1949). I have had dreams for as long as I can remember that resemble this story, but I only read it this year. It's a quick read but one must pay attention to keep up. Some things that were not accomplished by the people are disappointing, but since technology has changed the way we live in the last 60 years so greatly, who's to say what he would rewrite today. Overall I really liked it. I started reading this at a friend's house and just had to buy to reread again.","One of the best realistic future novels I have read, I enjoyed reading it many years ago,and reading it again was just as enjoyable, couldn't put it down, its not the usual science fiction story, but a realistic account of how ordinary people would react in these conditions, I highly recommend it I.M.J.","Science Fiction books are hard to remain classics given our growing understanding of science and technology. Earth Abides is an exception because it is written from the perspective of an anthropologist trying to cope with the fact that his world has been destroyed. Like many readers this book changed my life&gt; I read it in my teens, in my 20's and I guess it is time to pick it up again in my 30's.","First of all, I think D.D. Shade's analysis of today's society on Earth Abides is unsubstantiated. This book is still a great book today because it is a classic. A classic, by definition, relates to all time. The assination of JFK or MLK would not have had any greater impact on this book. This book, like Ish, will continue to stand the test of time because of it's overall classical themes. That man is the complicating variable on the planet earth. Regardless of if a man or men die, the earth abides.","I read this book in High School in the 70's in Saratoga Ca. I have a teenage daughter and I can't fathom that she is not required to read these types of books anymore. My mind constantly wandered with Ish. I dreamt of what I would do in that situation, of how I would react. Needless to say I finished the book in one weekend well ahead of my classmates, and decided to just start it all over. I recomended the book to my Mom, and she also fell in love with it. Ever since we are both on the lookout for others like it. I have read most of them (The stand, postman, alas babylon, on the beach, SWAN SONG (the best), plus mony other forgetable tales), and thank Earth Abides for my passion for these books. I wish someone would write another that is as good as this.","I have only read 2 books more than once - &quot;Earth Abides&quot; by George R Stewart, and &quot;The Quest of Aah&quot; by Alexan Farelane. If you read one book a week for 70 years, you would only have read 3,640 books in your lifetime. There are millions of books you will never be able to read - even with the Reader's Digest versions! Life is way too short to read the same book twice - except for books which can change your life. These 2 books are &quot;Life Changing&quot; books. The thing which most appeals to me with &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that our hero is just an ordinary guy and his failures are at least as impressive as his successes. He starts off with the best of intentions, becomes an unwilling leader by default, and is unable to persuade the other survivors of the need to maintain and/or restore the facilities and civilization we have come to take for granted. I KNOW that this is exactly how it would happen for me, if I was in his place! I know what I'd want to have happen, but circumstances would prevent me from being able to make it all happen.&quot;The Quest of Aah&quot; is a fantasy about the seven levels, the seven valleys, higher planes of existence, stages on the journey from Earth to Heaven, some of which any spiritual person can relate to, and anyone on a secular plane can be entertained by. The novel is presented as a memory, and is the way we hope it will be when we reach the end of our lives. It is completely different from &quot;Earth Abides&quot;, but if you like speculative fiction, then it is worth a read (or TWO!)","This is a story of the first years and the ensuing decades in the lives of the very few survivors of a natural plague. At first, there is a detailed overview of one survivor's (the main character and often narrator per se) actions in the first several months after the plague. This account of the &quot;short-term&quot; impact of a plague has been seen in other SF stories and might seem repetitous. But where this story is different, and where this novel is in a class of its own, is where the plot goes when this survivor meets others and small families begin and a community develops. The challenges which are faced by and met with by this group are detailed, yet are those involving environment and illness which are perhaps expected. But more interesting is what new moral values that arise and what &quot;holdover&quot; values (school, religion) which are attempted to be maintained, but are not or can't be embraced by the new generations which follow. The book follows the community though several decades, jumping years and stopping to go into detail about an event or time period -- but giving several pages in between as a summary to provide a good junction between sections...thus keeping the story flowing. The book ends with the natural death of the main character and seeing that the new generations have embraced a &quot;new and different&quot; value, knowledge, and societal system which is suprisingly similar to another culture -- and perhaps quietly challenging the reader to ask whether or not such the result is good or bad; and, whether or not the result was destiny, or the result of proper or improper actions of the original group of survivors. For a book written in the late 1940's, it was very, very far ahead of it's time.","After reading Earth Abides in 1968 as a 10th grader, I have read it six more times, getting a new insight of the book each time. My son (11yrs of age) has now read it twice with the same enjoyment as I have. It is a book that makes the mind think, wonder and dream the &quot; WHAT IF&quot; and &quot;COULD IT REALLY HAPPEN&quot; questions. Read it, sit back and think it. After the hair on the back of your neck sits down. Then read again next year.","I first read this book when I was 14, having borrowed it from the school library. I read it twice more in the following year. It affected me deeply and since then it has quite often crossed my mind to find the book again and re-read it. How surprised and happy I am after idly checking this website to see if that title would come up! I plan on ordering the book so I may savour every word of it all over again!","When my teacher first informed our class that we were going to read a science fiction book, my heart sank; I hated science fiction books! However, when I started to read Earth Abides, I found myself becoming engrossed in this book. The plot and the characters were something new and fresh to me in this age of quick storytelling. This was actually the first book I didn't skip to the end to read the final chapter because I was bored. It held my attention the whole time, and I was disappointed when it ended. This book reminds me of the movie &quot;Deep Impact&quot; because of the armageddon plots. I hope this is turned into a movie because it will probably be just as good as the book!","Of the novels written on this subject, I think I have read them all, this is by far the best. Most interesting is the authors attempt to regenerate civilization. Methodically covers natures reaction to the demise of man, fascinating! &quot;The Stand&quot;, &quot;Alas Babylon&quot;, &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; are all outstanding; &quot;Earth Abides&quot; stands alone!!!","I have read this book at least 6 times over the years. It ranks in my judgement with Jules Verne's, &quot;Mysterious Island&quot;, and Johann Wyss', &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot;. I have also read these books at least 7 times as well. I feel the three books could be invaluable in a survival library. They all teach survival in different circumstances!","Hello,The main character, Ish, manages to spend over 20 years mostly clutching his worry beads and freting. By the end of the book you just want to slap him and ask, \"What the hell is wrong with you\". His character is indecisive, and whiny. Over 20 years and the most productive thing he did was teach the kids how to make crappy bows and dig a well. If the characters in this book are supposed to be examples of the best way humanity could cope post SHTF we are probably all doomed. The only thing I can think of is that among the characters all had IQ's of 95 and Ish had an IQ of 100. This is more a human drama story (written in a most boring way) written around an apocalypse than it is anything else. If your interested in realistic post SHTF stories don't waist your time here. If your interested on how a small community could waste +20 years post SHTF in blissful denial with only one character recognizing the denial but doing nothing but hand-wringing about it than this is the book for you.","I found this book sitting on my mother's shelf, and after reading the description, couldn't wait to begin delving into it. The description of the book makes it seem like it's going to be very intriguing and exciting. It failed in that area. (And it's rare for me to dislike a book)In general, I really dislike the character. He shows no real or genuine emotion and is very full of himself. He is a geographer, but thinks of himself as a philospher. Which in his book, I guess that means spending a lot of time thinking about how unintelligent and hopeless everyone is. Including his wife and children. In fact, he had around five children, but you only learn about three of their names, and he spends his time only liking one of them. Since this book was written in the 40s, there are some racist and misogynistic undertones.The first two-thirds were mostly boring to me. He spends the majority of his time traveling across America and describing the scenery. When he's not doing that, he's judging people.Overall, I only like the last third of book, and that had nothing to do with the character. Instead, I enjoyed the process that could happen if civilization were lost, and the reforming of it.","I first read this book when I was 19 years old in 1974. At that time, most novels in this genre were post-nuclear where the United States and the Soviet Union were foolish enough to unleash their hellfire. This one takes a different approach. There are no mutants, no zombies, no cannibals. The end comes, as it has for so many human civilisations, from a disease that was not created in a lab but evolved from an earlier less virulent agent. Think avian influenza.It is based on the premise that any species that becomes so very numerous and lives in such dense number is vulnerable to a sweeping pandemic that kills many or almost all of the species. In this case, humans have skated by since the Black Death hit Europe and killed one third of the humans in Europe. A disease appears, but owing to the mobility of our species with rapid global transport, it manages to sweep the planet before anyone is really aware it is there.As with all pandemics, there are generally some individuals who survive either by peculiar circumstance, slight differences in genetics, or just pure luck. In Ish's case, it was more a combination of circumstance and luck. He has gone to a cabin to rest from the stresses of life and is not even aware at first that a new disease is abroad in the world. He just happens to be hiking and suffers a snake bite. The story suggests that he became ill with the disease at the same time and that venom and the disease basically worked against each other; thus, sparing his life. Once he recovers, he discovers a world empty of people. He takes a trip across the country from his starting point in California to New York City then down through the South and back to Los Angeles. This is where the first clear difference appears between this book and most all others. In this story, there are small numbers of survivors, but most are too shell-shocked and skittish to approach. So North America and presumably the rest of the planet is beginning to restore its natural balance, and the marks of humans are slowly being swallowed up.The second difference is that this story demonstrates what I think is the most realistic outcome for the survivors. Most do not have the skills to survive from nature and starve or die from injury, but some begin learning to survive. Ish is one who does. It follows him through the remainder of his life and the one or two generations that are borne from the small collection of survivors who collect around him. Unusual intelligence is not something that results from all matings. Mostly it is average intelligence sufficient to learn survival skills from the parents. Ish will make efforts to ensure some civilisation survives such as reading and writing, but even with that humans change. Domesticated animals survive in feral forms or die out. Predator and prey balance is gradually reestablished. Suburbs gradually revert to forest or grasslands. Natural fires become part of the norm, again.This book is an adventure but not in the same way of a story such as Alas Babylon or the movie 2012 (abominable science in that one). This is an adventure in that the world returns to a form that produced humans in the first place. This is a book for mind and heart more than the thrill. It has stood without becoming as dated as most of these books do. The words 'computer', 'radiation', and 'desperate' do not appear. I think more than anything, the survivors take a while to realise that their lives are not going to return to the way they were. I give this novel all the stars allowed and would give it more if I could.","I really enjoyed this book, George Stewart uses an interesting writing devise to describe time passing without you as the reader feeling as if he is grasping for ideas.Right from when people start dieing and the world changes the whole pace of life changes and this is captured really well and I feel is conveyed very effectively.I also loved the insights into what happens over time to various things that we are accosted to, cats, dogs, corn and cars. I know, I know I sound a little weird but it works !At only 337 pages this is not a taxing read, its definitely worth throwing at your younger readers in the home wanting something that is a little more challenging","I would like to say that in reading other reviews here that dislike this book, the people in this book remind me greatly of many people I have known. Yes, they didn't seem to try very hard to continue civilization, but then he explains that and ponders that at great length. Yes, the main characters were annoying and all too real. All the people that say, \"I would have done this!\" or \"they should have done that!\" are just getting what the author wanted you to do, think about it.They characters in the book, the few rag tag remnants of civilization, fail to even prepare for the inevitable illness that befalls them, typhoid. Just like all of humanity in 1949 failed to prepare for the pandemic that wipes them out. And just like we have still failed to prepare for the coming pandemic of today.This is a cautionary tale that is enjoyable to read. What I would say the the people who don't like it is, And what exactely have you done lately to prepare civilization for what the World Health Organization has recently stated is \"inevitiable\"?","&#8216;Earth Abides&#8217; by George R. Stewart comes with a considerable reputation. First Published in 1949, It was the first winner of the International Fantasy Award although it is clearly science fiction of the world catastrophe kind. That said the book isn&#8217;t extra-speculative in approach, it is set in much the same time as it was written, in an America of that late 1940s early 1950s. The main character, and narrator, of this disaster novel is Isherwood Williams a post grad geography student, Ish is one of the few survivors of a plague which has decimated the USA (and by inference the world). The book tells the tale of what happens to civilisation after the fall and describes Ish&#8217;s attempts to preserve some of it into the future. The story is told and progressed in a series of accounts, the exploration of the USA, the founding of a community, the growth of that community etc. It is written in a straight forward narrative style, with an occasional aside to speculate on the ecology, and traces the life of Ish from the time of the plague to his death. Through this journey Ish will face loneliness and find love, the small community he gathers about him will both flourish and suffer tragedy, and all along Ish chronicles things with his eye on history and ecology.For me, one of the main strengths of this book is that Ish is one of the most relatable protagonists of just about any book I&#8217;ve read. Ish is the sort of person who we&#8217;d like to think we would be in this situation. This is not to say Ish is perfect and he&#8217;s certainly no hero. He has a methodical and intellectual outlook to tackling situations, but he suffers as many failures as triumphs. This gives the book an emotional depth uncommon in a lot of SF and it is this humanity within the characters and their simple plight which drags you into the story. I think this is the book&#8217;s secret, it has the ring of truth. The characters send you through a gamut of emotions from nostalgia to anger, we care about them and are emotionally invested in there future.I don&#8217;t often read disaster novels and it took me some time to build up to read it, I wanted to read it because of its reputation but somehow I always seemed to find another book I needed to read first. Finally biting the bullet I found after only a few pages it had become compulsive and it ended much too soon. Whilst I have read some high enjoyable and great books both before and since, it is this book I find that sticks in my mind and the one that I contemplate upon. This book deserves all the praise it has received, and it has widely been proclaimed a masterwork. That it isn&#8217;t more widely known today is a shame. This book has probably become, even against my will, my favorite SF novel.","The premise of this novel is that mankind suddenly experiences a biological holocaust in the form of a new disease--a form of super-measles that wipes out all but a tiny remnant of mankind. The author explains that &quot;mankind had too long been rolling an endless succession of sevens&quot; and that like all animals that had multiplied out of turn, the sudden catastrophe was inevitable to set the balance back to what nature intended. This novel tells the story of a very small group of survivors, and suggests what life would be like under in the aftermath, and perhaps, more profoundly, what such a scenario might mean for mankind.The author's premise is that little or nothing of civilization would survive such an event. In the story **very minor spoiler** although the survivors make attempts at preserving the skills and lessons of civilization, this eventually becomes impossible against the tide of events sweeping mankind back not just to barbarism (in which some skills and beliefs might have survived) but to downright savagery and superstition. The most profound thought that the author successfully imparts is that all of the traditions, skills, and manifestations of our civilization could--and would--be lost in a single generation. Unforgettable is when one of the characters in the story looks out at the ruins of the San Francisco Bay Bridge (before it too passes away) and asks--&quot;who built this.&quot; The protagonist thinks for a second and answers: &quot;the Americans built it.&quot; The next question is &quot;who were the Americans?&quot; I have never forgotten this exchange, which I felt illustrated brilliantly how important it is for one generation to impart the best ideas of civilization to the next, and how easily all our achievements and successes might be lost in the face of a global catastrophe.The reader need not and probably will not agree with all of the author's conclusions about what would happen in this scenario. Would we really lose the skill of a written language? Would we really fall all the way back almost to the Old Stone Age? The author will challenge the reader's own thoughts on this subject, and that is fine. One need not agree with all of the conclusions that the novel contains to enjoy this story.Although written many years ago, upon re-reading this novel recently I found that it had lost little or none of its impact or relevance. It features a bit more prudishness than a modern novel might contain, but in my opinion is none the worse for this. The story is well-told, the prose is quite good, and the storyline moves along all the while capturing and retaining the reader's interest. This is a novel that I would recommend to everyone.","I could almost feel the age of this book when I read it. It is slow, the main character is an idiot (in my eyes), and he spends most of his time thinking about single-handedly saving (well, rebuilding) civilisation. Delusions of Grandeur. No critical thoughts about civilisation as realized in 1940/50 America, either: \"Modern civilisation is good. We need to rebuild it at once. End of argument.\"I took two things from this book - first, sheep are the most stupid animals on this planet. And second, people may come and go, but Earth Abides. The Author managed very well to show me that, by having his protagonist realize a few pages before the end that he isn't the center of the world. Wow. Finally. I was waiting for this for about 200 pages.This could have been done with a much shorter and faster-paced book. Still, the book poses some interesting questions, and it's vastly better than what you get today when being shown post-apocalypse worlds (I'm thinking along the lines of the Mad Max movies, or Waterworld, etc - the book never sells out this cheaply). So, all in all, Earth Abides earns it's place on my SF bookshelf. A serious book that tries to seriously investigate the end of civilisation as we know it, and guide us into the new world that rises out of it.","I could not put this book down. It challenged me, it entertained me, it made me cry.When I run across a copy, I buy it and give it to friends.","Perhaps because I've read several recently published books that deal with life after \"the end of the world as we know it,\" I found this book to be slow moving and even boring at times. However, I enjoyed moments of nostalgia when presented with phrases like \"tourist court\" and \"I pressed the starter button on the car.\" Brought back memories. Sadly, the world as we knew it then has already ended.","I have been searching for this book for the past 35 years. It was a story I have never forgotten since reading it in my teens. I applaude the publisher who has reissued it. Can't wait to read it again and share it with my friends.","Misinterpretations abide, it seems, when it comes to this book. This &quot;disaster&quot; novel merely uses the disease plague scenario as a backdrop to explore human nature. There are many subtle examples here of how individuals develop as adults, how everything people know and believe is dependent on their own life experience and frame of reference. Most of all this is about the myriad of seemingly small things that people take for granted every day and do not even notice, seemingly unimportant things which are really the foundation of society and culture. Here the characters are stripped of all their artificial interests, and are left with only that foundation. The genius of this story is that it will leave you wondering just how independent your own thoughts and views are. There might be many reasons people go in the various directions they go in life, the least of which have to do with independent choices. This book is much more than a disaster novel, it is a fascinating look at sociology in action. And always in the background, amidst all the human trials and tribulations, Earth and non-human life continue as they always have, oblivious to human superiority. Hence the title, and the ultimate humbling message.","One of the better disaster novels to come out in this century, Stewart essentially takes the Robinson Crusoe point of view and applies it to (then) contemporary America, having a plague wipe out most people, even though the rationale that it's because people are too numerous is a little on the shaky side, he should have just taken the Solaris route and said he didn't know. Would have made things more interesting. However, in itself the novel is an excellent and very realistic portrayal of people struggling to live after everyone else is gone. Nobody has any real need for ambition since everything they could ever want is right there. The main character is the only one who can think ahead far enough to see that the children have to be taught so that civilization can come back but when the book ends it's unclear if that will ever happen. The point I think is to show that we're not better than the animals when it comes to civilization and that our intelligence doesn't necessarily make us better, an old point, to say the least but one that should be stated often. Evolutionarily the human race just got lucky and as quick as we rose (a million years isn't that long really when you figure the age of the planet) we can fall just as fast. And the thing that makes Earth Abides so more real is that civilization isn't restarted, to have that happen would seem unreal, a small group of people does not a civilization make and to have them turn into some sort of super-community to go across the US and return society to what it was before would just seem unrealistic and that would have ruined the point of the book. The way it's written now is much more interesting because even though it's so depressing, it feels that much more likely and thus in the end is more satisfying.","I don't think that any of the reviewers have mentioned this, but I think that there are important details in understanding the book. George R Stewart was an English professor (at UC Berkeley), but he has a real strong feeling for the land, landscape, weather and nature. He wrote about storms, the Donner Party, and other geographical subjects, especially relevant to California.The story is set in the East Bay, and has many identifiable locations and views .that add a certain warmth and familiarity to the story, even after six decades. The tribe lived in easily identifiable Oakland/Berkeley hills of the late 1949's.Ish is initially bitten by a rattlesnake in the Sierra, which would have been familiar to many in Berkeley (then and now)-the mountains, not the rattlesnake. He has respectful and loving depictions of the UC Berkeley Library, which Ish needs to break into- Stewart would have used the library regularly. He described the natural changes in animals and plants that would be expected in the hills. He describes a fire which occurs across the Bay, in San Francisco and the northern Peninsula. Finally, the last scene has the tribe walking across the Bay Bridge. That is the same bridge that exists today (although it will be replaced in a few years).BUT the most important thing is his name. Ish (\"Isherwood\") really stands for Ishi., the famous Indian survivor studied by Kroeber at Berkeley in the early 1900's. That is a well-known piece of Berkeley lore, and Stewart was certainly familiar with it. ... Ish, the last survivor of a dead tribe....","A virus wipes out most of humanity within a couple of days. I've read many scifi novels that begin this way, and most of them spend the majority of the subsequent pages describing the ensuing social chaos in dystopian detail. Earth Abides takes a completely different tack. There is no swaggering little Napoleon lording it over a tiny flock of survivors--there are simply too few people left. There is very little deprivation--people can comfortably survive for years on the leftover canned goods in every corner store. Indeed, there is very little drama of any kind.This is more of a character study of two entities. One is the protagonist, Ish, an anthropologist by training who sees his role primarily as that of an observer of the slow, inevitable decay of civilization. He makes half-hearted attempts to save vestiges of knowledge but is mostly content to watch what happens to the environment around him. The question of what would happen to the planet itself--along with all the plants and animals--without its human caretakers, is the true core of this novel. I heard Octavia Butler recommend this book as one that inspired her, and now that I have read it, I can see why. Thoughtful and surprisingly gentle, it highlights the gifts possessed even by apparently unremarkable people to make a life out of what they are given, supported always by the ultimate Mother: Earth.","Being a fan of apocalyptic SF (among other things), I ordered this after seeing it on several peoples's lists of the greatest end-of-the-world/post-apocalyptic novels. It tells the story, of Ish Williams, who is one of a handful of survivors of a sudden plague that kills off something like 99.99% of the world's primate poulation. Earth Abides describes, in linear chronological fashion, the subsequent 50 years or so, following Ish who becomes the leader of a small band of survivoirs and eventually the shaman-like last survivior of the pre-plague people.The book was written in 1949 and feels very dated, in terms of dialog, ideas and socio-political themes. There are distinctly (although thinly veneered) anti-technology, elitist and generic christian motifs running rather crudely throughout, all of which turned me off. In a couple of places, the author's science is arguable or just plain wrong, and some of his plot devices (cars that still work after sitting on a lot for decades) feel contrived. All this aside, the writing itself just isn't that good.The main character, Ish is a neurotic misanthrope. No genius himself, Ish is nonetheless an incredible intellectual snob, judging everyone around him including his loving wife, to be of lower intelligence than he. A young (already lonely and alone) graduate student at the beginning of the novel, this remarkably unlikeable character goes on to comment negatively about the intellectual capacities of everyone who comes along in his life, except for one grandson that he deems worthy to become his successor.There is very little action, and many descriptive passages about changes in the earth and its flora and fauna following the disaster. The latter are fairly interesting, but not as interesting or well-researched as more recent works (e.g., After Man: A Zoology of the Future). The novel is unfortunately, not particularly well written. I guess, being written in 1949, one has to award points for originality, but compared to dozens of novels and a number of non-fiction works published since then concerned with the fate of the earth after man is gone, there is not much here that warrants this novel's amazing longevity.I understand how this novel could have been very popular when it was published. I am, however, at a loss to explain this novel's huge popularity and staying power today. That it remains in print 61 years after first publication is astounding to me, as are all the 5-star reviews. Virtually all of the ideas and themes visited have been done better by others who are much better, and more interesting writers. One particularly acute contrast is with James Van Pelt's \"Summer of the Apocalypse\", that I read immediately after \"Earth Abides\". It is far superior in every respect, although a superficial description of each makes them sound very similar. Nevertheless, they could not be more different.I was very disappointed by this \"classic\" and would not recommend it on any level.JM Tepper","A plague wipes out most of humanity, and one man (Isherwood Williams) tries desperately to save a piece of civilization to pass on to the generations of survivors. The first part of the story deals with his survival of the plague, and his journey around the country looking for signs of survivors.He returns to his home (in the Bay area of California) where he finally meets a woman (Emma) whose courage convinces him to start a family, which becomes a 'tribe' as a few other survivors come to join them. He tries to pass on as much knowledge as he can to the children of the tribe, but his efforts are largely in vain as civilization continues to regress. Ultimately he realizes a way to pass on some very basic knowledge to help his descendants in the future.The author does an excellent job of dealing with the plague, the after effects of such a plague on nature, as well as the slow decay of the cities and infrastructure of our civilization. He also describes well drop into a primitive society that would result from the plague. There is also an interesting moral dilemma when the tribe has to deal with a potential threatening outsider who tries to join them.The flaws of this story are few. There are a few sections which clearly take place at roughly the time when the story was published (1949). As a result, some of the references to technology and personalities make those sections of the story feel a bit dated. This only happens a few times though, and doesn't really hurt the story.This book won the first science fiction award given when it won the International Fantasy Award in 1951. In 1987, it rated 28th on the Locus All-Time Poll of All-Time SF Novels, and in 1998 it tied for 41st on the Locus poll of SF Novels written before 1990.","I read Earth Abides and was stunned with what a great book it was. Its attention to detail was unparalleled, its character development was exceptional, and its plot never got dull. Every part of the book was breath-taking, from the opening sentence to the closing words.Stewart wrote Earth Abides in third person and includes italicized background information which helps the book play before the reader much like a movie. Stewart doesn't just tell the reader the story; it is like they can see it for themselves. The reader is left to ponder many comments made by characters, and is allowed to reach conclusions for themselves. The thought provoking way in which Earth Abides is written was my favorite attribute of the book.Some books can be read and enjoyed, but do not really leave a mark on the reader. This one reshaped the way that I view the world. I have read hundreds of books, and consider this perhaps the best I have ever read. In one word, it was &quot;awesome.&quot;","Do you know the joyous feeling you get when you just happen upon a book quite by accident, read just a few chapters of it, and realize that it will be of great signifiance to you? Well, that was my experience with this book! I can't believe that I was not introduced to this book before now. It is with some sadness that I just completed reading it.My degree of connection with the main character, Isherwood Williams (Ish), astounded me; therefore, I must admit that my reaction to this book is quite subjective. It as is though the author looked into my mind and wrote a book about me in a post-apocalyptic world, including my greatest virtues and worst vices. The descriptions of the thoughts, triumphs, failings, joys, and frustrations experienced by the main character are poignantly honest and real. Metaphorically, this story seems to describe, with regard to many things, my existence in this, our so-far non-apocalyptic, world. For example, I find that I constantly struggle to define what I think to be the appropriate balance of individuality and community/state in our world. If you are one who consciously ponders such things or pursues a study of philosophy, I believe that you will view this book as a masterpiece. It just made my top 10, that is sure.I feel that I have gained much in my reading of this book. Mostly, I come away from this reading experience with a renewed feeling of peace and a reassurance in myself and the human spirit. I will no longer, I think, become quite so frustrated with regard to certain things or people in this world.&quot;Am I happy? Yes, I am happy. Things are as they are, and I am part of them.&quot; - Jack, great grandson of Isherwood Williams (Ish), the Last American.","That about sums it up for me. All others on this theme (with the honourable exception of John Wyndham's \"The Day of the Triffids\") are just cheap imitations. Earth Abides is the real thingCivilisation, and some 99.99% of the human race, is gone. The few survivors, all traumatised by what has happened to them (some more obviously than others, but they all are) either just commit suicide, drink themselves to death, live out their lonely lives in some familiar spot, or, as with Ish and his companions, get together into little \"tribes\".Having already read a few reviews, I get the impression that there are few neutrals on this one. You either love it (the majority, including me) or hate it. For me, Earth Abides' big virtue is precisely what some people seem to dislike about it. Its characters are just dead ordinary. Even Ish, the nearest thing to a brain among them, is too passive and contemplative to be more than a titular head. There are no survivalists who have long been waiting for the day; no jacks of all trades, conveniently endowed with all the needed skills, and above all no \"natural leaders\" (aka bullies and control freaks) out to remake the world in their own image. (Perhaps Charlie had some ambitions that way, but fortunately he is bumped off before the question can arise). They are in fact just a bunch of very average or even below-average people, trying to make a life for themselves amidst the ruins of the world. That, I suspect, is pretty much how such an aftermath would really be.Indeed, on considering the matter, I feel Stewart did a really good job of making his characters internally consistent. They are, essentially, the ones who come through the end of the world - and just react with a shrug. \"The human race is almost entirely wiped out, civilisation's gone and we're all back in the Dark Ages. Now what do I do about breakfast?\" Well, to be fair, Ish does throw up in the sink when it finally \"sinks\" in that his parents won't ever be coming home, but that's where it ends. If he ever considers the matter again, we aren't told about it. The other characters take a largely similar attitude. Em apparently had a family pre-Disaster, but never talks about them, while Ezra and the others have even less to say. They just write off their losses and \"move on\".Well, fair enough. That is probably exactly how they need to be in the situation. This attitude is probably what allows them to come through without being driven into insanity and/or suicide. But of course it has consequences. First off, it implies a decided lack of empathy toward fellow beings. Unlike some reviewers, I'm not particularly disturbed at their willingness to hang Charlie, and to at least consider \"mercy killing\" of the retarded Evie. Given such personalities, this is exactly how they would be. Indeed, it says much for their basic decency that they agonise as much as they do over the first decision, and never take the second one at all. Stewart has made his characters act \"in character\", as an author should.Secondly, however helpful this attitude was in seeing them through the immediate aftermath, it is far less so when it's time to think of rebuilding. Having taken the Disaster itself almost in their stride, they are likewise accepting of its aftermath, and generally take only such action as is forced on them by circumstances. The \"Lewis and Clark\" expedition in Year 22 is distinctly exceptional. And Ish's basically solitary disposition stultifies his attempt to educate the children. The only one he can \"reach\" is an academic loner exactly like himself, after whose death he essentially gives up. Stewart has wonderfully portrayed how the virtues which were such a help at the start of the book have now turned into vices.Loooking back on it (I first read the book at age ten) I have some minor gripes. In particular, the Great Disaster itself seems more than a little \"sanitised\", with mankind dying and all the bodies neatly tidied away, during Ish's two-week absence. Somehow, that does not quite carry conviction. Apart from that, however, my only real complaint is that Stewart was content with a single book, when the theme deserved a trilogy at least.Read and enjoy","Anyone who has read Alas, Babylon or Lucifer's Hammer needs to read this also. The premise is a panepedimic wipes out almost the entire population of the earth. Earth abides, but Man is almost extint. The turning point comes when the main character realizes that civilization as he knew it is over. He then turns his energies into teaching the Tribe to be self sufficient.A very good read, very on point and topical for today's world.","This book was hard for me to read simply because the pain of the main character became my pain while I read. In the aftermath of the end of the world You experience fear, loneliness, pitty, love, hope and finally resolution through the narrator Ish's observations.This is no adventure novel but it is a hard hitting look at just how much we truly rely on the trappings of the industrialized world to get by and how naked we would be without them. Although the book ends on a bit of a hopeful note you can't help but mourn for all that's been lost as well as watching the rest of the world's knowledge die slowly over the generations.This book made me ask what if it were me? A mark of a good thought provoking book.","Earth Abides by George Stewart is an incredible book. It follows the main character, Ish, as he tries to make sense of a world where humans are nearly wiped out by disease. What makes this book special, is that it's protagonist is a deliberate, thoughtful man that brings the story a sense of realism that is rarely seen in this kind of fiction. It is very interesting to see how and if civilization can survive such a \"Great Disaster\". The story benefits by being completely plausible, and even though the book was written over 50 years ago, it is still fascinating today. I highly recommend this reading.","A grossly interesting book, perhaps the actual first, to explore the thought of \"what to do to survive in post-apocalyptic America with little skills and a hammer\" - all avenues are skillfully probed and prosed.The first quarter of the book captivated my imagination with the wandering, scavaging and, ultimately, surviving. The middle half was deeply interesting to see how one man could restructure his life so that Americans could live after the plague. The last quarter was filled with expectation and anxiety, seeing how the family has turned out and whether or not the new Americans will prosper as they had before.","At the beginning of Earth Abides, Isherwood Williams, a graduate student alone in the wilderness and working on his thesis, is bitten by a poisonous snake. For several days, he drifts in and out of consciousness. When he is at last able to drag himself to civilization, he finds that a virus not unlike the common flu has mutated into a deadly strain, and the world is suddenly devoid of people. The rest of the book follows Isherwood as he discovers the strange freedom of the empty world, struggles to find other survivors, and works to rebuild civilization.Earth Abides is a sweeping saga, stretching across decades and roaming across North America. Most of the story takes place from inside the head of its protagonist, at a range so close that it takes us several pages to learn his name, as he simply does not think of his name that often. Stewart infuses the story with concrete details and scientific observations, giving it a strong sense of authenticity. Caught up in and believing the action, we are completely absorbed in the efforts of Isherwood Williams to survive and thrive in this strange new world.One trap lurking for any story, but particularly a science fiction story like this, is that of becoming quickly dated. Things change daily, and what is fascinating and new today will soon be old fashioned. Stewart has given his story a certain timelessness, at least so far, and I think he achieves this effect by incorporating very little medium-range technology. By this I mean that things are either seen close up, as in hands working with tools that change slowly, such as hammers, or are seen at a distance, such as the lights of San Francisco. In the middle distance, very little attention is paid to devices that evolve quickly, such as televisions, radios, and automobiles (other than the venerable Jeep). The result is that Earth Abides does not suffer from a feeling of being out of date, and it could easily be imagined to be a present-day story.One interesting feature to me as a writer was the use of interstitial chapters called Quick Years between each of the three major sections. These bridge the time gaps between the primary sections of the book, recalling the primary events in the passing years through Isherwood's eyes. This device lets the author tell a sweeping story while keeping the bulk of the detail in the activity at the turning points. On first glance, this sudden shift in gears seems likely to distance the reader, but Stewart handles the narrative so deftly that the reader finds the story as engaging viewed at this speed as when it is slowed down.Ultimately, Earth Abides is a masterful work. The author gives us enough detail and character to connect deeply with the story, then stays out of the way, allowing the story to unfold with its own power. The result is a riveting and deeply moving tale about all of us, how strong and resilient we are, but also about how fragile we are, how tenuous our grip on the world is, and how little it needs us.Do not miss this story. But do not, however, try to finish it without a generous supply of tissues. You will need them.","I heard about \"Earth Abides\" from someone reviewing \"The Stand\". In their review, they indicated \"The Stand\" was a one for one rip off of \"Earth Abides\". I decided to investigate this accusation and started reading an old edition of George Stewart's book. This book investigates what could potentially happen to human civilization if most people died from a highly contagious disease. The decay of civilization is seen through the eyes of the main character, Isherwood Williams.First, what was my impression of the book? I enjoy reading sci-fi and have read my share of \"end of the world\" books including \"Alas Babylon\", \"The Stand\", \"War Day\", \"The White Plague\", and most recently \"The Road\". I did not enjoy the writing style of this author. It was not fluid and was archaic. However, the subject matter was interesting as was the thought the author put into the story. Ultimately, the author kept my attention.How does this book compare to \"The Stand\"? They are two entirely different books. \"The Stand\" is more realistic in depicting the immediate aftermath of a plague. However afterwards, it becomes more of a \"good versus evil\" tale whereas \"Earth Abides\" seriously contemplates the state of civilization years after the plague. All in all, both books are worthy reads.\"Earth Abides\" is at times is an awkward read. However, the story is interesting and well thought out. All in all, I recommend the book.","I swear it seems that all the reviewers of this book seem desperate to convince people that they've been able to read for a really long time.\"I first read this book back in Vietnam...\"\"I first read this book about thirty years ago...\"\"When I first read this book, I was only twelve years old, and...\"Great, we get it, you're old, and you can read.Ahhh... Anyway, despite my grumbling, I do agree with the essential point that these reviewers made--that this is a book that pulls you in, that surrounds you with a \"world entire,\" that creates a place that you inhabit completely from page 1 to page 317 (in the edition I have, anyway), that creates a world that you'll find hard to forget.The book, \"Earth Abides,\" tells the story of a man who emerges from a long period of solitude to discover that more than 99% of the planet's humans have been killed by a powerful virus, the man himself having likely survived only because of having been bitten by a snake around the same time.The book's descriptions of the abandoned world are awesome, enlivening and atmospheric, and for some of us no doubt a secret dream come true. It gets even cooler whent the man decides to take a road trip across the newly desolate America--from California to New York City. That's the book's first section, and was probably my favorite part of the book, but the book remains interesting and engaging throughout. The man meets a woman, they have children, they meet others, they form a community, and then--this seemed a bit hard for me to swallow--they basically let all of civilization go, and three generations later they're basically a tribe of primitives who are happy and functional, but who can't read, can't use any of the technologies created by mankind, and believe the sun revolves around the Earth. Yeah, that happened kind of quick....Set your disbelief aside though, and read this. It's well-written, nicely paced, and enjoyable, and the depictions of the man when he's really old seem totally accurate in their depiction of the sort of fuzzy and uncertain warmth of old age, though I'd need to have this book's other reviewers confirm that to be absolutely sure.One of my only complaints about the book would be the 1940s mentality that saturates the main character's logic: at one point he says in a sort of wistful tone that maybe one day they might be able to care about such things as race again, he contemplates making himself king of two frightened black people that he meets, and he laments that the his community's lack of law has made it impossible for them to require that an insane girl be \"put out of her misery.\" At first these comments were kind of amusing in a kitschy way, but then they really started piling up, and didn't make his character more endearing to me.Overall though, this was a great book, and like almost everyone else who's read it, I'm sure I'll be thinking about it for years.","This novel did more than entertain, it made me think. Everything that we hold of value weakens when weighted against what is essential in continuing our existence after such a catastrophe. The main character \"Isherwood\" had such a difficult time with the notion of the \"Old\" world being forgotten. What impressed me was that their continued existence was not dependant on the \"Old\" structure of things. If all the demands of our everyday life are absent what is left?I am pleased to have read this book. I'll be honest I was reticent about reading a sci-fi from 1947. This was well worth it.","This is a great read, but before you spend the $50 for this paperback, go check your local used book stores and thrift stores like Goodwill, I got my copy of the 1962 version for 69 cents and it is in great shape at a Goodwill store.","Several reviews have noted what they call the essential pessimism of the book: Man Has Fallen, Civilization Is No More, etc. Well, yes, that is all there. But what is also there is a profound triumph of the human spirit: Civilization is Dead - Long Live Civilization. I will NOT spoil the ending, but book ends with a rebirth - an obvious societal pregnancy if you will - of a new civilization, one profoundly in keeping with the new conditions of their brave renewed world.One can imagine a sequel, and I wish Stewart ahd written one!I first read this book almost 50 years ago, and have re-read it multiple times. It is one of the best \"transition\" books ever written. I recommend it on several levels.","I love the apocolypse genre - so thought provoking, and Earth Abides is one of the best I've read so far. I was surprised I'd never heard of it before seeing someone on a message board mention it. I decided to give it a try, and am so glad I did. This has now been moved into my books to read again, and that really doesn't happen often.I didn't realize how long ago this had been written until the main character described going into a house and sitting down to rest on the \"davenport\" - how long has it been since we heard that term?Really though, the premise is such that it really doesn't matter when the book was written. The same thought provoking situations occur. Highly recommend.","I enjoy Post apocalyptic sic fi but this was not that entertaining after a while.","With so many books available to read, is this one worth your time? Ultimately, you'll have to make that decision, but I hope my review can help in some way.There are some technology issues with the story that clearly show it was written in the late 1940's; however, these don't detract too much from the story.There are also a few typos in the Kindle edition, which I assume is a scanning problem when converting to eBook format.The two main issues I had with the book are:1. Food - It is unrealistic to think that people would be subsisting off canned food for 20+ years, let alone, 40+ years at the end of the book.2. Future generations - Without ruining the ending, the book makes a plot decision on how Ish decides to pass knowledge on to future generations. I liked two aspects of what he did, but I thought the rest was foolish.I liked the book overall, but I didn't necessarily think it was a \"great\" work.","This review is a spoiler! Don't read on if you are intending to read it for the first time!I had heard many times that this was a classic that would haunt me for life. But I was not impressed, partially because there were things that were left unanswered. I may have missed something - what was the significance of the car on the bridge at the end? Modern man's constructions were all around him...the Golden Gate Bridge, for example. Why the car? Why did they want him to die there, instead of with their tribe? I thought it weird, too, and unlikely, that he saw so few bodies in the aftermath. I liked the hammer symbol a lot - and the fact that he passed it on to the young man he'd chosen - and why. I liked that his gift of leadership helped humanity live on. I also liked the way that he changed his desperate struggle from lecturing - to action...his building of the simple bow and arrows. I loved that he continued to describe the inevitable and looming corrosion of the modern world. That did make him the last American - his final months spent with his oldest friend. Those things saddened me a great deal.I have read another holocaust book that WILL haunt me for life...perhaps because it was on such a massive scale, and yet confined to only one remaining group of characters. The book is The Last Ship, by William Brinkley. I've read it 3 times, as has my oldest son.","This is an extraordinary novel, wider appreciation of which has probably been hampered by categorization as science fiction. While there are some slight anachronisms (the book appeared in 1949) the ideas, and the narrative, are disturbingly fresh. To me the most stunning - and frighteningly plausible - theme was how fragile &quot;civilization&quot; is, and how quickly everything could collapse even though the material and intellectual basis for &quot;civil society&quot; remained intact and available.","In short, I liked the first half of this book - the plot is intriguing and you don't want to put the book down! But after reading 2/3 of the story you expect something more to happen but the tempo goes down, the main character gets more introspective and the flow of the narration starts to falter. The book starts to get boring and you just want to get through to the end to see what the end will be like. With a better pace all the way through, I would rate this book higher.","Chris FitzgeraldEnglish 10Mrs. Cruces5-20-02Earth Abides Evaluative EssayThe novel Earth Abides, written by George Stewart, took place in San Francisco,California. This science fiction novel focuses on a plague that has spread across the NorthAmerican continent and is threatening the human species. The novel contains the life thatan individual survivor, Isherwood Philips (Ish), lives. A majority of the population hasseized to exist. Ish is an important part of the Plague because he is a biologist. Ish goesthrough his life in this novel by bringing other characters into his life. Ish is one of thesurvivors that has the intelligence to form a tribe and become the leader of this tribe. Ishhas a compassionate soul and struggles to help other survivors find their way.Earth Abides is a very interesting novel. This novel is easily enjoyable because ofits connection that it gives of the key characters who are intertwined in a drama that isdealing with a cataclysmic event of a Plague. This makes the novel a good read. Thiskind of event is very possible considering the times that we live in now. This novel doesnot only relate with people coming together to struggle for survival. It also deals with anevent that could very well take place.This novel is great for anyone over the age of about 12 years old, because of theway that this novel is set up to involve thinking and real life experience to understand thetrue meaning of the novel. Anybody who is looking for a good science fiction novel willlike the great novel Earth Abides.","I bought this book based on the overall good ratings.I speed read through most of it, hoping it would pick up. I can't stand the idea that these people weren't a little more intelligent and chose to preserve what they had and plan for the future without technology. They had a whole freakin' University Libary for pete's sake!Out of the whole book I got that Ish was the only inteliigent one but didn't have the teaching skills to subsequently teach the next generations.If you like post-apolcolytipic books, then I highly recommend \"One Second Later\" by Fortschen. The spelling may be off slighly....I don't have the book here. There is a line-up at work to read it. This book scared the hell out of me. And as a professional health care worker I could see the devastating domino effect happening like this book portrayed. Like the book \"One Second Later\" says, \"Its not IF, but WHEN.\"","If they did an audiotape of \"Earth Abides\", only Ben Stein would be up to the task of delivering the text into spoken words. The novel wastes no time getting into its subject matter. Within the opening pages, an unknown plague wipes out the vast majority of humanity, leaving the remnants to either rebuild civilization or bear witness to its final collapse. It sounds promising, but the delivery never comes.The story is narrated in the first person by \"Ish\", a young college student whose circumstances enable him to survive the disaster. Very early on, the reader gets the first inklings that this novel will serve as a sounding board for George Stewart's various preoccupations. The first hint is the dominant theme that nature has some innate sense of population control that strikes suddenly and absolutely on all levels, and this is explored not just in discovering what happened to humanity but also in a number of situations as the story advances.In fact, Ish seems to be merely a mouthpiece for a number of observations, ideas, and insights postulated by Stewart. For a work of fiction, \"Earth Abides\" reads more like an apocalyptic version of \"Future Shock\", the landmark Alvin Toffler sociological study. Unfortunately, it reads as dryly as \"Future Shock\" as well. All of Stewart's ideas are presented in a dry, impersonal manner, which precludes any emotional connection with the story itself and thus lessens the impact of these insights in the end. Recommended only for the most voracious of sci-fi readers.","\"Earth Abides\" is one of the best books I have ever read. Even though it was written in 1949, it seems to me like it could have been written yesterday. Very thought-provoking and memorable. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who desires a good read. I couldn't put it down. I finished it several days ago and it still stays in my mind. I bought this book for my Kindle, but I think I am going to order a hard copy too - it was that good.","I found this book totally by happy accident, and it remains one of my all-time favorites. What is chilling is that the basic premise of the book is quite possible and believable, given diseases like Ebola that are out there. He gave real-life examples of other species that became overpopulated, and then were nearly wiped out by a plague. What is man but another species of animal on this planet, and we are not immune--look at the Black Plague, for example. A truly unique look at what might happen to the earth if we are nearly wiped out, and what might happen to the people left to survive afterward. A great read!","As always, interesting to see the vast number of five star review for a book deserving of maybe three. Would be quite fascinating to easily see a breakdown of reviewers' ratings showing number of reviews at each star level - would we see most people rate things at 5 stars?I just finished this book, and have been thinking about why it was so bad. It never captured my interest, the characters were cardboard, astoundingly enough the plot was nearly nonexistent and worst of all, no conflict/tension!After the initial collapse, our hero drives across the country, from San Francisco to Manhattan, making trivial contact with a few people apparently for the purpose of seeing an empty New York City. He then returns to California, where he proceeds to settle down for the next 20+ years without doing anything except mosey down to the local abandoned grocery store to snag some canned food.My big insight from reading this book was realizing most people were essentially lazy before television was invented.There are so many other better genre books, including _On The Beach_ and _Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang_.","The book, first written in 1949 tells a story that could be just as true today. A pandemic that sweeps the contenent leaving few survivors. Isherwood (Ish) Williams is the protagonist. His life is the focus of the story, with interaction with a gradual collection of a few other survivors, that results in a slowly growing tribe. Well worth reading and rereading a few years later.","This book is great and I found it on Amazon at a great price. it shipped promptly and arrive in great shape.","Written in the 50s, it talks about ecology when nobody even knew the word. Ish watches the world spasm itself back into equilibrium after man is removed from the equation. Add elements of anthropology and sociology and and you have a truly remarkable book. Read it. NOW!","First published in 1949, Earth Abides is George R. Stewart's take on what would happen if all of the human population of Earth, except a few scattered survivors, were killed by a vicious disease. The tale is presented entirely through the thoughts and experiences one man, i.e., Isherwood Williams. Ish is a graduate student when the \"Great Disaster\" leaves him alone in the Oakland CA area. He eventually finds a few other survivors, including Emma (Em) who becomes his partner and the mother of his children. Ish and Em and their small band of survivors create a fledgling community that struggles with immense hardships to survive. However, they do survive and their community \"The Tribe\" grows slowly. Ish, as the only educated person among the group, becomes a leader and eventually becomes revered almost as a God after many years. Ish remains a thinker throughout his life, and a worrier through most of it. The book is very interesting and presents much credible (at least based on the 1949 knowledge base) information about what the world would be like and how it would change if humans cease to be a significant force. It also presents much logical information about how a very small human community would struggle to adapt and develop a simple but functioning social organization. Much of the book presents Ish's thoughts about how to help his tribe survive and also how to motivate or manipulate them to develop skills and knowledge that might enable them to develop a new civilization in the future. At times, I did not like Ish, but I usually understood the logic of his thoughts and actions. Although things did not work out the way Ish wanted, he finally realized that the tribe and Earth's changing environment would interact to determine the future without his help. I found this book to be a slow but interesting read. It was also intellectually stimulating and engendered much emotion. Reading this science fiction classic is well worth the effort.","I have read this book multiple times and have totally been immersed in WHAT IFS. I have talked more about this book than about any other book that I have read except for The Source by James Michener.. The idea of the world actually existing after most of the people have died from an unknown cause is so thought provoking. Most people I have talked to and let read my book have been as impressed by Earth Abides as I have been but then there are the very few who thought that they could do better if they had been in the same circumstances. I always thought that I would eventually have to go back to cave man status. It is a book that should be read in college. I would totally recommend it.","This book is less about an apocalyptic event that kills most humans and more about the reemergence of society and the influences that geography, history, and personal beliefs have on it. Ishi, the main character, strives to bring back the scholarly lifestyle he values, but is faced with convincing the new generation of its value in a world where his children are free from the society he knew.","One of my favorites that I surely will read more than once. I loved how you got to read about the main character from the age of 18 to his death. The book is amazing at telling the story of how they all survive and how mankind seems to revert back to tribal and superstitious beliefs. I almost wanted to jump in and live this life with them even though their hardships seemed too much to bear.","See this movie and gain a perspective on where we came from. Who we are and where you are going. Buddha jesus all the same guy. Whi knew?","I stumbled across this book a few decades ago when living in Japan for over a year. I was hungry for English words in a good book. It surpassed my expectations! The plot is beautifully developed and makes a surreal world believable. The human struggle and resourcesfullness was absolutely heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time. I cared so much about the outcome of the characters, I couldn't put it down! Very few books lure repeat reads like this one did. After misplacing it during my returning to the U.S., I hunted for a another copy everywhere to no avail. Finally, when it appeared in the dark corner of a small used bookstore, you would have thought I struck gold. Years later, at the end of a job interview, I was asked to name my favorite book--probably to ensure that I was cultured reader. Without hesitation, I recommended \"Earth Abides\" in full glory. The irony is that I'm not typically a science-fiction reader, leaning more toward drama and suspense. Well, that's exactly what this book offers as no other! If you have time to read only one book, make it this one!","I like reading older books, and this one certainly fits the bill as it was published in 1949.It was written in an older style with minimal dialogue. It's also written in the first person which makes it very subjective.I found Ish, the main character, at first, bland and uninteresting. But as I read he grew on me.I would recommend the book as one version of how things may evolve after a widespread plague and only a few survivors.It is well written, although in some scenes I found the dialogue a little too 'bible-ish'. I also found some plot developments a bit unrealistic. I believe it is an ingrained characteristic in humans to want to survive, to lash out at fate and try to beat it. I don't think that, as in this book, people would just give up and live off the remnants of the old world forever (or until the next generation picks up the ball). I think people would automatically try to herd cattle and sheep and try to start gardens and orchards.Another weak point is how the author seems to avoid the harder scenes in the book. When something is done about Charlie, when Joey contracts the disease and it's outcome, and when Ish's wife finally dies. All these main moments in Ish's life are avoided by skimming over them.All in all I do recommend this book, but it is not for readers wanting action. It's for readers wanting to think.I'll remember for while the passage in Chapter 2 of the last secion where we discover that Ish did make a impact on the outcome of the tribe. It reminded me that sometimes just by doing what we think is right we affect the outcome of our own immediate environment, our tribe.","Maybe today the plot of \"Earth abides\" is nothing new, but when it was written, in 1949, it surely was. Professor Stewart's only book in science-fiction quickly turned into a milestone concerning apocalyptic themes. William Brinkley's \"The last ship\", Pat Frank's \"Alas, Babylon\", Nevil Shute's \"On the beach\" and Stephen King's \"The stand\" all come to mind as having similar ideas, although each of the five books mentioned have their own characteristics and deal with the subject of \"end of human civilization\" in unique ways.\"Earth abides\" is more like a one-man chronicle. Isherwood Williams, a reclusive geology student, finds himself a survivor of an unnamed \"Great Disaster\" that has wiped out 99% of humankind. During the course of the book, Stewart tells the reader how Ish, as he calls his main character, learned to live again, without all the comforts of civilization, forming a new family, than a new community. Ish thinks of himself as \"the last american\", and Stewart explains very well why that is so.Although not overtly a \"dark\" science-fiction story - like \"On the beach\", for example -, \"Earth abides\" has a subtle way of making the reader very uneasy and impotent as he turns the pages. This book was written almost sixty years ago, but has a very modern feeling about it - not scientifically, of course, but if we think about how Man deal with his peers and with nature, Stewart's book will ring some known bells.Grade 8.7/10","I fully expected to enjoy this book. I've read piles of books in the same genre - The Stand, The Road, Plague Journals, etc. This is notably different in that there is absolutely no faith or hope - there is no striving for better, there is only just getting by.I was very put off my the narrator's belief that no one else possessed any intellect. I've met loads of blue collar workers who would have done a much better job in getting things started. I simply can't imagine a group of people who would settle for canned food instead of growing their own. Who would settle for no electricity? I can't imagine having access to a library and not researching how to start a power plant back up. There was no planning - just living day to day.I guess I have a different belief about the nature of man. And, as others stated, I don't know that the author had children or interacted with them. They are sponges and want to learn. They can be inspired - he was simply ineffective - it was his fault then that he couldn't get them motivated.","After reading Earth Abides (for the second time, in the early 1960's), I was moved to write to GRS, which I had never before done, with any author!My letter was passed on to his address via his Literary Agent in London, and arrived in San Francisco three weeks after his death.I received a treasured return letter from Theodosia Stewart, his widow, and after a few exchanges of letters, she invited me to come to San Francisco to meet her and that she would give me access to all of his notes and work in the archives at The Bancroft Library at Berkeley University.I took up this offer, and in 1985, travelled to California - my first flight!!!I have written an account, with photographs, of the people I met and the places connected with GRS, many of whom I am still in contact with, and will some day publish this account, but the above serves to show what an effect this book had on a young (38 years) englishman, to pull me across the world.The high points of my visit were meeting Theodosia (Ted) Stewart, visiting \"the house on San Lupo Drive\", and standing on the smooth slabs at Indian Rock Park.All of this came from reading \"Earth Abides\".","I hate to add a note of dissent to all the glowing reviews but this book really frustrated me. It`s not that it was badly written though I found the style a little clinical. I guess that is just a reflection of the personality of Ish, through whose eyes we see the unfolding of the years following the devastating plague. Myabe it was his character that annoyed me so much and basically put me off the book. He seemed to consider himself so superior to those about him and become almost unbalanced in his lofty plans for his favourite son. I found it hard to believe that everyone else in the community apart from him was so darn thick. I also found it very sexist, even though i know that only reflects the time it was written. The author`s attitude to race relations was dedfinitely more forward-thinking than towards women, who were mainly portrayed as baby-obsessed brood-mares. Even Em, the main female character was seen as reacting to events on an instinctual rather than intellectual level.The apathy of the community also bothered me - would people really be this unconcerned about their children`s future? Decades later and they hadn`t taught the children to read so they could learn how to do all that stuff they`d eventually need - like how to make candles, when to plant crops, how to weave fabric, etc etc. I can`t believe they were STILL living off tinned food all those years after and hadn`t even bothered to domesticate any horses or grow vegetable gardens! I prefer the English series Survivors, which I feel tackled the practicalities of having to provide and produce absolutely EVERYTHING necessary to life for yourself much better than this did.","First, as a story, the character development is poor and any drama is virtually non-existent. There are a few opportunities for drama, but in each case, the author fails to draw in the reader and make them care. Similarly, there's little to cause the reader to become invested in the characters. You could read abstracts on the characters and get as much out of them as reading the novel.Secondly, the \"hero\" is annoying and a bit contemptible, but perhaps this is the author's goal. Regardless, it made me like the story even less. In short, the hero prefers to sit around and do nothing while he complains inwardly about the dullness and laziness of his \"tribe\". This goes on, and on, and on... In short, I eventually got tired of the hero's endless elitism and hypocrisy.Perhaps the author's message is that the hero didn't understand while the simpletons did. Perhaps his message was that civilization is overrated compared to a simple and primitive life, we should stop worrying, live in the now, leave the rat race, etc, etc. If so, his delivery of that message is painfully boring and repetitive for the reader. At the end of the book, I really didn't care if there was a message or what it was.On a positive note, the prose used to break up chapters was often well-written. It just wasn't enough to make up for the bad execution on the actual story.","Every time the protagonist passes judgement on other characters, have a drink.Every time the protagonist compares himself to a god or demi god, have a drinkEvery time the protagonist says \"Oh! Mother of Nations\" or \"Oh Joey!\" have a drink.Every time the protagonist refers to himself as the last American despite there being evidence that other communities of survivors have formed, likely with their own elders, take a drink.Every time you find an editing error, have a drink.You may want to take it one chapter at a time so you are not utterly intoxicated. The book was most interesting for the interpretation of what post pandemic America could be like. However, the story moves slowly and the dialogue is stilted and awkward. Not as good as I had hoped for.","I know this is the grandfather of post-apocalyptic fiction but some of the attitudes expressed in this book are so dated and unrealistic that they pulled me out of the story. There are lots of poetic passages and lyrical writing but the hero is surprisingly unsympathetic and uncharismatic for my taste.","The premise of the story is interesting, especially in our time of ridiculous overpopulation of this planet and the ability for any virus to move worldwide in a short time, but the story wasn't especially well written. I really can't see so much of current civilization being lost as Mr. Stewart expects. Also, there wasn't very much character development.","Long ago, when I was about 12, I read a book by George Stewart called Fire. I remember enjoying this book. When I came across The Earth Abides last year I remembered thinking that I might enjoy this one based on my prior experience with his earlier book. Besides I liked the title. Well my enthusiasm started to wane after reading the first 100 pages or so. I started to think that perhaps my taste had changed in the intervening decades. In Fire, I had found interesting his asides where he described the fire and its growth. Here, when he interrupted the story in an aside describing changes to the world and the decay of mankind's works, I found it distracting and thought it broke the narrative flow. Several times I found myself saying \"that is not the way people would behave\" and second guessing the author- fighting against the direction the author was taking us. I thought that perhaps the story, being written in the late `40's, was dated. However, about two-thirds of the way through the book, right about the time when a couple of the colony members were sent on a cross country trip to see what was going on in the rest of the country, I had a major change of heart. It was like a log jam breaking. I suddenly let go of my preconceptions and opened my mind up to his vision, his story. I found the story suddenly compelling and the characters believable, and the writing, while not on the level of a Saul Bellow, moving and effective. I found his description of civilization slipping backward, and the growth of the colony into a tribal, superstitious society, in contrast to the protagonist's scientific \"modern\" leanings, very powerful and imbued the story with a powerful melancholy. However, the book is not necessarily all depressing. Indeed it makes clear that mankind would survive- and the earth would abide until his eventual return. Looking back, writing in the first person was very effective. The final chapter is a beautiful and fitting ending.","I don't think I've ever read a book where the author has done more research than Stewart has done for this one. Not only did he have to do all that research, but he had to sit down and think things through: the rise and fall of ants, the mountain lions running out of food in the mountains, the sheep being lost. It was truly amazing. It also brought to light several things that would and would not happen if man were gone. Some of them are bad and some are good. Stewart gives a fair, unbiased (and likely acurate) picture of an Earth where most humans have suddenly dissappeared.","I found the premise of the book interesting and, for the most part, it was well executed. However, the characters' passivity and lack of ambition is very frustrating. The people who survived the plague seem to have lost the will to achieve! Stewart seems to deliberately portray all characters except Ish and Joey as somewhat limited, despite the fact that they actually contribute more to the continued survival of the community that the \"smart one\". Ish seems content to just go along and then regret that things haven't advanced. Ish doesn't ever seem to gain any understanding that he could have taken the initiative to broaden the scope of the community. Even in the context of the time the book was written, the women are treated as objects. There is no indication of deep thought or emotion from any of them.","I first read this book when I was a teenager and read it again last week (30 years later.) I was surprised at how much I remembered from it (I have completely forgotten books I read 6 months ago!)Of course the book is dated, it was written over 50 years ago and of course technology and social attitudes have changed. Of course the main character is flawed and of course we think we could all have done better, but wouldn't fiction be boring if every character were perfect?I loved the descriptions (in italics) of the breakdown of civillisation, about how plants and animals evolve when \"man\" dissappears.I've looked at some of the reviews for this book and am not surprised that most enlightened readers have given this book 5 stars. Neither am I surprised to see the occasional reader give it one star and to read their vehement reviews. These show that the book has worked and all its readers have strong opinions about it.","This book is with out a doubt one of the best I have ever read. Stewart portrays the end of our world, as we know it and tells the story of a man's need to survive in a world he no longer knows and trusts. This novel is not one of action and amazing death defying feats, but one of a man's introspective thoughts and of the will to live in a world that has been brought down by it's own ignorance and naivet&eacute;. This book is like a huge juicy red stake, there is almost too much meat to handle. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to think, and think seriously about what it means to be human!","A must read for fans of apocalyptic fiction. Even though it was published in 1949 nothing about the book seems dated. It deserves its ranking (by David Pringle) as one of the 100 best Sci Fi novels of all time.","I read Earth Abides the first time over 35 years ago. It is one of the few books that genuinely presents an &quot;end of civilization&quot; as we know it and does it well without a lot of fanfare. This is a discriptive story that I plan to read again.","A friend lent me this book many years ago. I loved it. But I forgot the title and author and when I recently wanted to reread it no one was able to help me. I searched and searched for it to no avail. Finally someone on a sci fi newsgroup was able to help me. This book is fascinating. It is one of my all time favorites. The author has an incredible imagination and you really believe this is what would happen if civilization were to die off. It is so full of vivid details and really makes you think.","This is a book everyone should read; a book worthy of being read over and over during a lifetime. I've read it twice and will probably read it several more times. The subject of a disastrous plague almost wiping out civilization is written in such a way that it's entirely believable. It's fascinating to see how Mr. Stewart's characters face survival. The very last part of the book is a bit confusing, but then life viewed from the point of a very old person may be very confusing.","I throroughly enjoyed reading The Earth Abides because it compelled me to consider what motivations there are for the individual to continue living. I felt the most interesting part of the book was the notion that the individual must actively define what direction his life is to take, the setting of the story added to the importance of this decision and entertained different options and the validity of those decisions.","An aging story. I liked the book on a whole, but the middle and end dragged into tedium.The first half of the book was very interesting to me, and I enjoyed the writing immensely. The last half of the book, on the other had was very, very slow.By the time the end came I was ready for it to be over, and did not much care what happened to everybody after that. good riddance.","The book must be praised for being quite different from most sci-fi of its time. Much of the narrative is spent taking a look at the details of the slow collapse of man's works after he is gone. If you enjoy \"Life after People\" you will enjoy this. However, Stewart's Apocalypse is a gentle one, with little evidence of panic or struggle as mankind fell.I also love that the timeline spans many years, interspersed with important episodes from the anti-hero's perspective. Having a hero that was not a superman was definitely different for the time, as was his pessimism. I loved the cross country adventure and the gradual expansion of the Ish's tribe as it met others. The book felt a little like Asmimov's foundation, which is a good thing.I thought the ending sequence [minor SPOILER alert] concerning how old age affects one's cognitive abilities was particularly well done.This could have been one of my all time favorites, if not for two things :1) the main character's egotism was hard to swallow. Perhaps the author expected he would be disliked? I doubt it however.2) Dated 40's attitudes. It feels racist AND classist (in the author's/Ish's description of the other survivors).I do highly recommend this novel, but with the grain of salt.","I have just finished reading \"Earth Abides\" for the fourth time. The first time I read it I was in my early twenties after having been lent a copy by a friend. Like so many readers, the story haunted me and many years later I decided to buy a copy of my own to read again. It was out of print in the UK at that time but I did eventually manage to obtain a copy in the States. I read it again and again. I am now 59 and the member of a book club which had \"The Road\", another post-apocalyptic story which has recently been made into a film, as one of its reads. This had a rather mixed reception from members and so I told them about \"Earth Abides\". I am delighted to say that every one of our members has read \"Earth Abides\" and enjoyed it.I notice that, like me, 90% of reviewers are happy to give \"Earth Abides\" 5 stars. Out of curiousity I have read the reviews of the minority who give it less than 3 and I have the following comments to make. Those who say \"what happened to all the dead bodies?\" need to read the book again. There are numerous references to what happened in the final stages of the epidemic, the way that they dealt with the dead and the dying, the emergency centres that were set up and the subsequent places that Ish avoided on his travels because of the smell of rotting corpses etc.Another popular criticism of the book is the apparent inability of Ish and his tribe to be creative, to teach the children to read, or to make any progress in salaging anything of the previous civilisation. I have had about 30 years to think about this one myself and I am not convinced that given the small, random group of survivors that Ish had at his disposal, and the lifestyle that they had gotten used to, that things could have turned out differently. For me the whole point of the story was that in a situation where the population slips below a certain threashold it is not possible to hang onto civilization as we know it and that a new civilization has to be born. The children of the tribe instinctively knew this and taught themselves the skills they would eventually need to survive. Think about what happened to previous so-called civilisations in our history to what happened to them in times of climactic change - they disappeared.The haunting part to this whole story is the question what happened next? For me \"Earth Abides\" will be one of the best books I have ever read or am ever likely to read.","Audible.com recently recorded what I think is the first ever audio version of George R. Stewart's classic novel, Earth Abides, so I decided to give it another read. I've read it before of course, but it's probably been almost 20 years since the last time, so I was excited to get into it again.Written in 1949, Earth Abides, is probably the earliest \"modern\" example of a pandemic post-apocalyptic novel. It follows Isherwood Williams, known as just Ish, for a period of about 50 or 60 years, starting after The Great Disaster, an unknown plague that wipes out all but just a few pockets of survivors. We see The Tribe, as they call themselves, started from just seven survivors, as it develops into a group of over a hundred people in the hills of San Francisco.There are hundreds of reviews of the book around the web, so I'll just stick with a few thoughts. It' definitely a good book (it won several awards and is credited by Stephen King as an inspiration for The Stand), and I really enjoyed it myself, but I can see how if you're not a super-fan of the post-apocalyptic genre, you might think it's a little slow in places. The first third or so feels like watching Tom Hanks in Cast Away; there's basically zero dialog as Ish travels around the country looking for other survivors. Even when a few of them gather to start a community, the writing style is mostly descriptive, without a lot of talk.But the material that's covered is perfect for anyone who wonders about how civilization would fare after an apocalypse. Would the children born into the new world be curious about the old one? Would they care to learn to read or to carry on the knowledge of the \"Old Ones\"? Would they view the Old Ones as people like themselves, or would they look on them as gods who created all the indecipherable wonders they see around them?Ish struggles with the answers to these kinds of questions as he tries to preserve and pass on enough knowledge to keep some semblance of civilization, if not simply his people, alive. They face actual dangers, such as wanderers bearing disease, but the greatest threat to the future of The Tribe is their apathy. The few from Before are comfortable enough in their current existence to not want to bother reclaiming the comforts of the old world, and those born after don't know enough about what they're missing to care either. So they live off the corpse of the old world, eating wild animals or out of cans for decades, not bothering to learn how to plant their own crops or keep their own farms.So, if you're looking for a primer on how to keep a small community alive in an urban environment after the collapse of civilization, this isn't it. This is almost an anthropological study, seen as it's happening, of the recreation of society from scratch, and as it goes on, we're not sure if that society will turn out to be recognizable to those of us left behind or not.So like I said before, if you're not a fan of the genre, or are looking for a more action-oriented story, this might not be for you. But for a true fan, Earth Abides is one of the \"Big Ones\", on most every list of the best post-apocalyptic novels ever written, so if you haven't read it yet, you really should.","I first read this book in the 60's as my husband and I were in university. I carried it for about 20 years and lost it and life took over and I never replaced it. But my mind has continued to reflect on passages, in fact, I will tell someone how racial prejudice starts and I got it from this book. It covers a frightening time but the ingenuity, focus, and just \"I will not die\" leaves in the reader ideas that will live with you forever.This morning, I couldn't stand it and went to look for it and found it here at Amazon. Thank you, thank you.","I haven't read this book in at least 35 years yet I feel like I read it only last week. This story was unique in it's treatment of humanity and it's approach to the end of the world. This is not a Man conquers over all obstacles story. The future is bleak but the characters are real humans faced with the end of their civilization. They abide, after a fashion, but not near the same as the humanity we know. I wonder how this might have been done with man's dependence on technology even greater today. This is a classic and deserves more attention.","While doing research in a remote cabin, Isherwood Williams is bitten by a rattlesnake. Emerging from a short delirium, Ish returns to civilization only to find that a new virus has wiped out 99.9% of the Earth's population. Ish sets out to see if he can find any survivors.The story is told in an irregular fashion, slowly detailing Ish's immediate experiences, then speeding into the future only to slow again for years that are more important. I enjoyed the haphazard narrative, but wished that the author had focused more detail during several essential emotional scenes regarding birth and death.The focus of the story revolves around Ish's struggle to preserve the American society against superstitions that threaten to govern the new society. The author touches on many of the possible earth changes that might happen in such a catastrophe. Some systems immediately fail while some last for many years. Fans of Stephen Kings \"The Stand\" will enjoy this similar, yet simpler tale.","Earth Abides was a great book. It is not what you would call an action-packed sci-fi novel. Rather, it is extremely thought provoking. It makes you think about the meaning of life, human relations with other men and with nature, your place in the world, and the value of what you do. Although written in the forties, it is still very relevant because it also makes you question the value of our increasingly faster and busier lifestyles and constant striving for more advanced technology.Yes, like some reviewers did, you can argue with some details, but if this is your main concern you are taking quite a shallow view of it and not seeing the forest for the trees. The beauty of this book is not so much in the details, but in it's enormous scope and ambition.This was a book that I could not put down and one that I think will long influence me.","Earth Abides is an interesting take on the human condition. Whether you agree or disagree with what the author is trying to say, it is definitely a book that makes you think about the story line and characters.While I disagree with most of Stewart's assumptions, it is well written and thought provoking. Definitely a classic that should be read again and again.","\"Earth Abides\" is NOT a science fiction novel, which is probably why many readers...have been disappointed. It is much more a social commentary, a critical examination of the human race, and a thoughtful analysis of where the human race really rates in the grand scheme of things. Thematically, the novel has more in common with Daniel Quinn's \"Ishmael\" than King's \"The Stand.\" Stewart asks us to consider the true meaning of \"civilization\" -- is it all about electricity, running water, and refrigeration? Or is it more about community and survival? Stewart's main character tries valiently to convince the new race of Americans to work together to reform the kind of civilization that led to world overpopulation in the first place (and that overpopulation, he theorizes -- in very Quinn-like reasoning -- results in a very natural plague that wipes out most of the human race). The lessons learned in this compelling novel are both profound and frightening. Could it be possible that some day our ancestors, generations in the future, will look back on us as odd and strange creatures who depended too much on invention and not enough on ourselves? In some ways, the novel is about the conflict between intellectualism and naturalism. In other ways, it's about learning to deal with change. However you read it, \"Earth Abides\" is a terrific book you won't soon forget.","This is one of the great books of the 20th Century. Unfortunately, a poor job was done producing it for Kindle. It seems to me that the print edition was scanned using Optical Character Recognition software and not proofed. It is full of misspellings and incorrect words due to the software limitations. If Amazon expects us to pay for this, they should make some effort to be sure that their product is correct!","The start of this novel was magical for me - so engrossing and so convincing. But then it descends into the comfortable and the suburban. Is this the fate of all human communities? More disappointing was the ugliness of some decisions made by the community - and for me these were far from inevitable or even justifiable. These were presaged on p132 of the SF Masterworks edition - '... except for Evie, the half-witted one, who should never be allowed to have children.' How attitudes have changed since 1949 when this book was written!","This book is about what is wrong with us as humans. The beginning of the book is very interesting as the main character, drives around the country to see what is left in the aftermath of the disease that has wiped out most of the population. After that the book goes downhill. The characters are not that likable. The children are brats, and the adults lack the conviction to make them better people. The items which are in the story aren't realistic (it is very unlikely that gas would not be usable after 20+ years even if stored well), and overall the story just wasn't very interesting to me.","Was disappointed in this book. Expected there to be more action and survivors to be more aggressive in making a better life for themselves. In my opinion people would not act this way in a disaster. They would try to make things better.","This is one of my favorite books of all time and one of the few books that I can re-read. Oddly enough I almost find at times I want to live in the horrible world that is created in the story. Maybe that says more about me than it does about the book though.","I have read this book several times over the years, I really favor this type of fiction (science?) This book is so well written it has stood up to the test of time, as good as any newer fiction of the same genera. Give this book a chance, you won't be sorry. You don't have to buy it, I saw a couple of copies in my local library, I'll bet most full size librarys have a copy. Happy reading.","I loved this book from front to back. Its a beautiful story with characters you can invest in. I have passed it around to many friends and they agree its moving.","This book stands the test of time! A great survival/end of the world book that entertains as much as WWZ (without zombies). Like \"I Am Legend\", Earth Abides tells a great tale of survival of a lone man on earth (without vampires). Love the progression/deterioration of the man made world described here as well as how society evolves. Epic in scope this book covers an entire lifetime, not just a few months or years. I've read this several times and will again one day I'm sure.","Apparently, Amazon shows when a book was last published in the details section, but not when the work was first published. Earth Abides was written in the 40s or 50s.It's an interesting read, but coming with 21st century sensibilities, with ideas of the horrifying chaos and violence should civilization fall from the likes of 2012 (the movie) or Stephen King's The Stand, Earth Abides seems very pastoral and unrealistic. I won't spoil it with too much detail, but two examples are 1) one character is able to drive from California to New York after 99% of humanity had perished. Wouldn't the roads be full of abandoned cars? 2) There's no horrifying killings, rapes, cannibalism, robbery, diseases among the survivors ... something that we know does happen when authority breaks down from real wars in Africa and elsewhere, but in this novel, the only dangers are from failing electricity and running water.I'm not being fair. Stewart is probably reflecting the more naive era of the 1940s or 50s. The book does flow very nicely and I especially LOVE the very nostalgic and melancholic last few chapters of the book.","One of the handful of true classics in the Apocalyptic genre that are Must reads. This account follows a survivor in a post-pandemic world that decimated the human race as he seeks out other survivors and begins to rebuild. Excellent read from page one!!! Solid and believable story line, great characters, and very entertaining! Includes \"year zero!\"","Recently I took it upon myself to read the twelve books describing end of the world scenarios that are being recommended by Amazon in one of its lists. Of the twelve that I read, this is by far my favourite book. George Stewart wrote a story that is both believable and entertaining. In fact, with only a few minor historical references to culture in the 1940's, one could easily think that this book was written yesterday. I regret that the other books written by Stewart are not widely available. I think he's an amazing writer. Buy and read this book. You will not regret your selection.","Though it feels a little dated having been written over four decades ago, &quot;Earth Abides&quot; deserves its place with great 1950s era end-of-the world books like &quot;On the Beach&quot; and &quot;Day of the Triffids.&quot; The scenario is similar to the one Stephen King used in &quot;The Stand&quot; though the plague wipes out a much larger number of people and there is little spiritualism here. What affected me most was the latter part which shows the years passing in the life of the main survisor. I rarely get emotional while reading, but this story did it to me.","Global plague vectored through air travel has beenfeatured in recent films, television specials, andthe news. Set between the European Black Death ofthe late 1600s and this decade's African Ebola,Earth Abides deals with the hope, struggles, andresignation of modern-day plague survivors. Withfewer than one percent of the world's populationsurviving, how would you fare? What wisdom wouldyou pass on to those younger than you? The Centerfor Disease Control intimates that world-wideplague is more a question of When, rather than If.So... how do we begin the day after?Over the years, I've read this provocative bookseveral times, and have enjoyed it more each time.For those who enjoy Crichton's works(Jurassic Park, Congo, or Eaters of the Dead),Earth Abides is a rare find. Kay O'Cullane.","Stewart did an excellent job of putting your hand on thehammer! Classic tale of &quot;What if I were the last man onearth?&quot; Best read out loud at least twice in your lifetime.","I dont write too many reviews any more and I dont want to make this into a flame session but let me get this right Corie (from your review).The book is literally about the last man on earth, and you're indifferent to the character's guarded and self preserving manner. I think you are completely out of sync with the theme, let alone the character. This is a brutally honest portrayal of a human being (with all his short comings) in the wake of oblivion. Not a butterfly in the midst of smoke. It's a reactionary tale, one of struggle and survival. You seem to see it as moment for liberation and righteousness. If anything Corie, you have imposed yourself on this character, in the same vain you speak of.This is the individual, warts and all, and merely hating him does not render this book yucky.As for the racial tone that you claim, as quoted by Powell Timothy \"...its revolutionary (for the time) treatment of racial issues was particularly powerful in the mid-20th century when the book was published, and influenced many contemporary artists, most famously Jimi Hendrix. \"Earth Abides\" was Hendrix's favorite novel, and inspired some of the songs on his first album\"Perhaps, if some of you better relate to decisive characters, you should watch the post apocalyptic TV soap drama, 'Jericho' instead. There you will find your cliche depictions of heroes and villians.","Okay let me tell you how I really feel. WOW!!!I hesitated to buy this book after hearing it did not have much end of the world violence, no undead or lots of dead and has a more clean antiseptic air about it. They were correct but what it lacked in that area was more then made up in the quality and depth of the characters and the uncanny ability of the main character Ish to pull you into the story and carry you along in his experiences. I would compare Earth Abides to a movie from the 30's or 40's where there was more dialog and depth as opposed to many of today's films/books based more on spectacular visual effects and lots of gore but lacking in most every other area and are soon forgotten.(And I like some of those books and movies).Earth Abides has a much stronger human touch or bond as you see Ish from a young man dealing with a plaque that wiped most of humanity away and his final death at old age. What transpired between youth and death for Ish is something I guarantee you will remember for the rest of your life. I have read numerous Sci Fi books and rarely has any reached a level comparable to Earth Abides. This book is a keeper that I will definitely read again in the future.","This book reaches across time and avoids the technology trap. It hits home in many circumstances and is an excellent read. I liked its energy and symbolism. It avoids being grim and actually gives you hope for a disastrous future.","A worldwide virus has killed off nearly all the world's population. Ish starts exploring a world with no rules and few people. He finds some other people and they form &quot;The Tribe&quot; to restart their civilasation. Interesting book, and it actually survives pretty well considering how long ago it was written. There are very few passages in the book that date it significantly.","Earth Abides by George Stewart is one of many post-apocalyptic novels written during the height of the Cold War. However it is quieter and more introspective than most of its peers, something made evident by the manor of disaster that devastates mankind in the novel. Instead of a nuclear inferno, a viral plague almost eradicates humanity. Isherwood &quot;Ish&quot; Williams is trapped in an isolated cabin recovering from a snakebite when the epidemic is unleashed. When he heals and ventures outward, he discovers the near extinction of his species and begins a search for others who immune to the disease.That section is interesting but Earth Abides becomes a truly outstanding novel when Ish discovers others and they found a new society. Stewart takes a sociological approach to this development. He gives a fascinating account of a community completely isolated from other communities and a generation living in a Garden-of-Eden-state, completely isolated from its own past. One of the novel's best moments occurs when an untrustworthy visitor comes to the area and Ish and the other elders must decide what action to take. Their decision will surprise you. Both in the post-apocalyptic genre and the field of science fiction in general, Earth Abides is a gem.","I 1960, I was nine years old, I remember staying up all night during summer vacation to finish it, I still love this book!","I was very disappointed in this book. It was slow, boring, filled with uninteresting characters, and the writing was extremely stilted. And I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to accept that automobiles would still operate after sitting around with gasoline in their tanks for thirty years. I skimmed through most of the book hoping something interesting would happen, but I was utterly dissappointed. There are better books in this genre, don't waste your time with this one.","As I write this, negative reviews of this novel (one or two star reviews) are few and far between. However, I am compelled to join the minority. I could not, in good conscience, recommend this book to anyone. Maybe one needs to be an aficionado of the \"End-of-the-World\" genre to appreciate this book, but I found it to be contrived and unrealistic. The idea that most of the population would die off due to disease, but that the book's protagonist would choose to tool around the countryside calmly musing on a variety of generally immaterial and irrelevant matters seems absurd. Also, for quite awhile, he manages to encounter ONLY unsavory or potentially dangerous fellow survivors. The entire un-dramatic tone of the book seems way out of proportion with the incredible tragedy that has befallen the earth.I very, very rarely leave a book unfinished, and will usually force myself to complete any book I start. But, as they say, \"too many books, too little time\". I could not see giving up valuable reading time on a book that offers so very little to the reader, so eventually put this book aside. For me this is the most gravely negative review I could give a book.","This novel is possibly the worst piece of drivel I've ever tried to force myself through, and I didn't make it. I quit, and honestly I almost never do that. Ish is maybe the most detestable figure I have ever had the displeasure of meeting on the page. He's a passive aggressive psycho, a terrible father and leader, and the last man you would want to rebuild civilization. In this type of scenario, anyone with any intelligence that came into contact with him would disengage quickly. I simply might have shot him for being a drain of precious resources. If the whole point centers on the fact that most or any man would fail in this situation, I would have preferred that Stewart kill off Ish in a 20 page short story.","I see many people loved this book, but having just finished it, I just don't get the appeal it has for so many people. I found it incredibly boring and tedious. I do not exaggerate when I say I spent an afternoon struggling with it, nodding off to sleep every two or three paragraphs. To his credit, Stewart raises a number of issues about science and human nature, but it is done in the context of an uneventful story. The first book in years that almost made me abandon it halfway through, but I fought it out to the end. I remained disappointed.","Wow I can't remember the last time I started to hope something bad would happen to the main character in a story. Worst main character in a book ever. Annoying, Lazy, sexist, racist, boring and anti-religionist. Maybe it was the slow story line. Maybe it was the fact that NOTHING happens to the characters after the first 100 pages. I don't know. But I hate this book. I felt like yelling \"Get up and do something!!\" The power goes out and he sits. The streets start to flood and he sits. The water stops running and he sits!! Then he starts to think of himself as a god!! haha. The best part of the book is the end. Why? (spoiler)he dies and you don't have to read anymore.Sorry to ramble but my mind is cloudy now from finishing that \"book\".Do not buy this book. Get it from the library read the first 75 pages then take it back.","This book is dull, slow, and predictable. I read most of it hoping that it would pick up but it never did. I usually like these type of disaster books too. Lucipher's Hammer is ten times better than this one. I really have no idea how this book could have 5 stars.","Having skimmed the other reviews, it seems that one had to read this book as a young person and use those glowing memories to enjoy it. Since I approached the book fresh, the flaws are glaring.The main character, Ish, is pretty dull. There isn't much dialogue in the book, so most speech is communicated through his hearing others and describing what they meant. Since he's not particularly insightful, reading is slow and the pages creep by.Civilization seems completely lost despite the fact that books, machines, etc. remain intact. Ish rules The Tribe, who are a step or so above a Neanderthal group. They even walk from place to place like hunter-gathers. How about using the million and one bicycles laying around if you can't figure out how to get gas for a car?The book is not poorly written, just improbable and boring.","The concept of how civilization slowly succumbs to the forces of nature was an interesting concept. That part of the novel was very good. Ish the main character of the book was the leader of a small community of survivors. He sees himself as the most intelligent of them all and for some reason wants to keep it that way. He locks up a library and only he has access to it. Once children are born and old enough to go to school he cancels it, no children of the new world learn to read. Nobody seems to want to become self-sufficient but relies on the products of a past civilization. A stranger comes to join them and Ish murders him out of jealously that his role might be challenged. From then on he carries the hammer he killed the stranger with, with him all the way to his death. No interest was ever sparked by anyone to learn to read, farm, make things or anything else. Everyone lives off of canned goods for 20+ years. I won't say anything more in case the reader of this has not read the book and would like too. Ultimately I was disappointed but would recommend it anyway.","Earth Abides is a book about no matter what happens to the race of people, Earth will always abide. A Man named Isherwood Williams somehow survives this fatal virus that is going around killing the whole human population. Ish then spends almost the rest of his life driving across the country searching for survivors. When he finally meets a group of survivors he \"marries\" one of them and has about twenty children with her.Ish does find a few survivors, however it was definitely not enough to keep me interested in finishing the book. I thought this book was long, drawn out and sometimes too boring. If George R. Stewart, the author, would have spiced it up a bit with more science fiction things happening. For instance if more abnormal things happening to the humans than just death like it was a flesh eating virus and then something else happened with the virus. The genre of the book is Science Fiction. The plot this author had in mind was a god idea however if it was only about one hundred pages shorter and the ending with the twenty children was cut then it would have been easier to keepinterest.So all in all the book had very few parts that could have beenedited out and still would have made sense. The idea of the book and the plot of the book was good. I like the little reality the book had in it. Again if there were more science fiction, and less pages, it also might have been better. So that is why I gave the book a measly two stars out of five. I think this a reasonable amount and I commend the author on his work. I would recomend this book to someone who loves to read and is interested in books about little science fiction and little reality.","The protagonist is arrogant, lazy and stupid. He likes to sit around smoking cigarettes and thinking about how much smarter he is than all the other survivors while his wife cooks him meals and takes care of his children. He doesn't bother to teach his children to read, and he doesn't bother to learn anything medical or mechanical or any other potentially useful skills in a post-apocalyptic world. At one point he runs across some other survivors who are Black, and he thinks about how he could stay and \"be king\" of them because he is white. The ultimate self-absorbed old white man fantasy.","I read this book based on other reviews - having searched for good post-apocalypse novels. After reading Cormac McCarthy's \"The Road\", I was preparing myself for a depressing, yet thought-provoking read. \"Earth Abides\" was a thrill to read, and I kept turning back to remind myself that it was originally published in 1949! I thought the complete absence of any \"modern\" references to today's highly computerized world would make the story instantly outdated, but in fact, the opposite was true, for if we lost power, we would have to revert to very basic skills, just like Ish and his tribe did. This truly is a book that will stay with me for a very long time. Highly recommended!","I had read this book several times in the past and before reviewing it I read it again.His author was more than fifty years old when he wrote it. This maturity is perceptible all along this work.The story is situated in a world devastated by a sudden pestilence that annihilates most of the humankind. Taking into account the last SARS epidemic that jumped abruptly from China to Canada it doesn't look an impossible scenario.Isherwood Williams comes down from an isolate spot in the mountains to discover an empty world. He starts a search all across USA, from California to New York and back again. He finds only isolate human cells, couples or trios, overwhelmed by catastrophe and in a near catatonic state. Returns to his native town and contemplate with a certain scientific detachment the fading world around him.Mr. Stewart intercalate brief vignettes describing what happens to dogs, cats, cattle, plants, roads, dams, bridges, contrasting them with Ish's daily experiences.Little by little the story grip reader's attention and even if action is somehow slow, the book can't be putted down.Human cells began to draw near each other and a rather feeble structure starts to grow up.This is the story.The author approaches universal questions about survival and extinction; civilization and savagery; social structure and anomie. He also examines religious values, ethics and the ultimate sense of life itself.This book gives the reader a lot of stuff to think about. A very enticing read!Reviewed by Max Yofre.","I read this book over and over, loving it more each time. It gives the reader alot to think about because even though it's ficitonal, it is still possible. It is about a man who goes up into the mountains for some time, gets bitten by a snake and becomes very ill. He rests in his mountain cabin for several days, coming close to death, but eventualy regaining his strength. When he left the mountains and headed back home, he noticed the town was dead...literally. Very well written. I bought a new copy because mine was falling apart. Buy this book.","Like some of the other reviewers, I read this book 25-30 years ago. It changed how I viewed the value of the work we do. Stewart makes a strong case that if we can't maintain the infrastructure of our phyical world (roads, bridges, water works, electric plants, etc.), all our knowledge about the rest of the world is for naught.Stewart also explores &quot;events in nature&quot; and how them affect humans. In his book Storm, Stewart quotes Sir Napier Shaw: &quot;Every theory of the course of events in nature is necessarily based on some process of simplification of the phenomena and is to some extent therefore a fairy tale.&quot;In Storm the phenomena is a Siberian wind blowing south; in The Earth Abides, it is a virus. In both cases the earth is fine, but human are worst for wear.By the way, like The Earth Abides, Storm, and a third Stewart book, Fire, are set in Northern California. Everyone familiar with the great Pacific storms or the forest fires, will find these books fascinating.","I enjoyed this book and appreciated the thoughtful way in which the author depicted how the world could be with only a few humans left in it. Stewart covers a lot of topics (religion, education, environment, race, family, marriage, etc.) and how they would evolve or devolve over several decades. He describes a world where random people are left alive and those people may not be the most suitable people to live under the new conditions. The story moves along fairly quickly and generally kept me interested, if not fascinated.Some other reviewers mentioned how the main character, Ish, seems a little devoid of emotion at times. I agree, but I found another trait in main character more annoying. He spends a large amount of brainpower philosophizing and lamenting the lack of intelligence and motivation in the rest of the tribe. While Ish does some teaching, the children never learn reading or basic math skills. They also never work on any improvement projects or learn to recreate any of the basic disposable items they use regularly. My complaint is that Ish doesn't do any of those things either. I blame him for many of their failings. You could say that his shortcomings are realistic, but it drove me a bit crazy.Overall, this was an enjoyable read.","This book makes me want to explore Amazon's return policy for Kindle editions.Barring that, it has made me learn how to delete items from my Kindle.It has also taught me to pay attention to negative reviews.It is simply awful. Why, then, 2 stars?Well, the story - once you get past its one massively huge, incredibly off-putting major flaw - isn't too bad. Many folks have pointed out factual issues (ever volatile gasoline and canned goods that never go bad), and called these fatal flaws. I attribute them to the publication date: maybe, in 194x, when personal automobiles, gasoline, and canned goods were still fairly new, it simply wasn't known that they both spoil? I don't know, but those details weren't killers for me.What ruined the story, then? The protagonist. Our hero. I've read books with villians who were infinitely more likeable than the main character, Ish. He's a contemptible, amoral, elitist sociopath and I feel dirty having inhabited his mind for the past 2 days.I can kind of understand his elitish judgement of the people around him. Again, consider the context of the 1940s. Even today, college degrees are relatively rare (even though I think many of us who have them forget this fact. They are almost universal in the people with whom I associate, but still only 10% of the US population have them.), and in the 40s they were rarer still. So our disgusting hero was part of an elite at the time, and the majority of the population probably did not possess even high school diplomas. Once I realized that, he became slightly less unpalatable.However, our hero, Ish, views the near extinction of humanity with no more emotion than I view an empty of box cereal in the morning. In fact, I think I have more emotion over the cereal. His reaction to learning his parents have died? Effectively, \"eh, so what. What's in the fridge for dinner?\" Similarly, for no reason, he considers simply shooting the dog that accompanies him and, later, decides to shoot two cows just because. Not for survival or meat, really, just because he had a gun and they were there.He has no qualms about simply looting whatever he needs (a viable survival skill, I'll grant you), but views with contempt a group he encounters on his road trip who didn't move into a more palatial home simply because they could - and who are doing a more effective job of adapting to their new situation.He meets a couple in New York who insist on pretending nothing has changed, and looks down upon him. Yet the rest of the book, he exhibits nearly this exact behavior - living off canned food rather than adapting. He constantly disparages his colleagues in the Tribe for lacking imagination and drive, yet for all his superior intellect and thinking and ideas, does exactly nothing to drive change.I thought, eventually, that the author had made him so utterly horrible deliberately and that, over time, we'd see a metamorphosis in Ish, an awakening in him that he was not the paragon of humanity he believed. There are hints, here and there: his admitting that, though she's stupid, his wife was the true strength in the Tribe, etc. But, in the end, this contemptible human is still full of himself, believing his descendent's view him as a 'god', and, sadly, is still the same, utterly obnoxious, foul human that he started as. He takes pride in this, too, which is pathetic: to have survived the death of civilization, to have had even a weak hand in its rebirth, and to believe that the experience has left you utterly unchanged, that you would have been the same person if society had simply carried on, is truly sad.","George Stewart's super-classic is my favorite SciFi sub-genre--the demise of man by one means or another. Stewart uses a pandemic virus which is a bit cliche--oops, wait a minute, he did it first! Everyone _else_ is the cliche. His writing is dark and literary, brought to life by his protagonist, Isherwood Williams', gloomy, introspective personality. Stewart does not develop the science behind the virus, but given that he wrote the story in 1947, I suppose he can be forgiven. On the other hand, H.G. Wells and Jules Verne forcast many technological wonders in their stories, so maybe Stewart could have gone out on a creative limb just a wee bit more than he did. Nevertheless, the real gem of the story is Stewart's portrayal of the demise of mankind--not the virus that reduced his population to a handful--but the demise of his culture, his literature, his creative energy. It seems we humans are what we are because with great numbers of people scarfing up every last spot of ground and every last resource, each individual has to be ever on his toes just to turn a buck. Take away the people, say, overnight, and the detritus of their civilization becomes easy pickings for the surviving few. No need to grow anything to eat--just open up a can. When they ran out of cans, it was almost as easy to hunt for dim-witted, slow-footed domestic cattle, now living in the wild. But the real casualty was culture. Several generations after Ish, people no longer spoke Ish's English, at least not so he could understand it. Culture too appears to be a product of crowds. Stewart set the bar for this SciFi sub-genre. There have been many since 1949, including my own example listed below, but he has yet to be equalled.--Ejner Fulsang, author of \"A Destiny of Fools\", [...] 2007","This is the granddaddy of post apocalyptic novels. Whenever I read this book I see bits of so many post apocalyptic novels in it. Well written, well delivered. If you like post apocalyptic books then read this one. It wasn't until the release of EARTH THE NEW FRONTIER that I read a better end of the world book than Earth Abides. Both of these are classics in the post-apocalyptic genre.","This is a book that rewards close reading--not skimming. Written in 1949, it is still a haunting and poignant read. Those who dismiss this as cliche must remember that this is the book that gave birth to the cliche, the first truly prophetic biological-apocalypse piece of writing, and all who come after must merely stand on its shoulders. Re-released in the &quot;SF Masterpiece&quot; series, and deservedly so.","Earth Abides is a book concerning a plague that kills off most of humanity and the survivors' attempts to reconstruct civilization. The pace of the book is rapid in the beginning and the reader doesn't have to get very far before they realize something terrible has happened. We are initially with one character, Isherwood Williams, who seems emotionally well suited to survive this tragedy in which 99% of everyone has died in the space of two to three weeks. The story continues with Ish traveling across the country looking for survivors and eventually returning to his home in Berkeley, CA where he meets a woman, Em, and they marry each other. Slowly a group of people calling themselves &quot;The Tribe&quot; forms and Ish tries to lead his small group back towards civilization and away from a more &quot;primitive&quot; existence.Strengths are the good character development as well as interesting asides on how the world is readjusting to no longer having man dominate it. It offers some interesting insights on human nature and societies in general and as a disaster book ranks highly on the list. In a sense it is like The Stand except for that this plague is strictly natural, not a tool for a climatic battle between good and evil. The plague simply comes and kills humanity off and that is that.Some of the negatives are found in the style of writing. This book was written in the late 1940's and the language used is rather dry. The author seems to go overboard on his word usage and sometimes seems to be talking down to the audience a bit.Still, if you like disaster stories you should pick up Earth Abides, it is well worth any effort.Robert Merkamp","When I write &quot;one of the most memorable books I've read,&quot; that's saying something, because I've kept up a pace of reading at least four books a week since before entering Kindergarten and am now 67. I borrowed EARTH ABIDES from the library a year after it came out, in 1950, when I was a 14-year-old high school sophomore, reading everything and anything labeled &quot;science fiction.&quot; I didn't own the book until fairly recently, but it stayed vividly in my memory. I could call up characters like fussy Maureen, stolid George, loyal Em and the tragic genius child, Joey. I remembered the fascinating journey across America, the vague frustration I felt (even so young) over Ish's passive character and the generally negative slide of the tribe from scavenging off civilization into what appeared almost to be an Upper Paleolithic lifestyle at the novel's end--not even qualifying as barbarism.But it's Stewart's refusal to tread the usual Golden Age sci-fi path and make Ish a superscience hero that makes the novel very special. Ish may be a scientist, he's academically bright, but like many people he's low in energy, street-smarts, and foresight. By and large his motley clan possesses even lower survival skills. They aren't much different from the Valley Girls in another good story in the end-of-the-world genre, the movie NIGHT OF THE COMET. Both are based on an understanding that if the human race's average IQ is 100, half the people who are likely to survive a major disaster aren't going to be awfully competent. Stewart certainly knew that, and it provided both the uncanny realism and the rather depressing pessimism of this story. It's fascinating to note that the other reviewers have noted both aspects of EARTH ABIDES.","George R. Stewart weaves at once a beautiful and hauntingly believable tale with this novel, one that I've never been able to forget...or wanted to. Once considered dated, with the lessening of global nuclear tensions, the scenario Mr. Stewart envisions for a possible worldwide catastrophe, one brought about not by bombs but disease, has once again come to the forefront and become the most plausible ingredient in mankind's demise. More even than the fact that this is a truly enjoyable read is the deeper message Earth Abides shares with the reader as it reaches down and touches our very hearts, defining what it means to be human in an inhuman environment. The symbolism involved in Isherwood Williams' desire to keep a hammer with him for the future as a tie to the past is obviously an unconscious comment on his personal hope of rebuilding a fallen civilization. A hope that goes unfulfilled in his life time and maybe many lifetimes to follow. The insight into the human psyche that Mr. Stewart demonstates as he carries Isherwood from his youth at the beginning of the book to old age and finally death at the end and Isherwood's subtle change of attitude during that process, rings exceedingly true and speaks volumes about Mr. Stewart's keen and perhaps unique ability to put into words what it really means, or at least should mean, to be human. I've rarely read a book more than once because I just don't have the time, but I've read Earth Abides several times since I was a teen and I know I'll read it several more times before I too reach that stage in my life that Isherwood assures us won't be the calamity our youth oriented culture would have us to believe.","Due to a multitude of rude comments regarding this review I will edit to please. Here goes... NON-SPOILER ALERTI can't expound upon this book as some of the reviewers have. Nor can I recall in exact detail everything in the book.But I can add value in this way.... I read this book 30 years ago, and I still think about it. I can remember the xxxxxx, the xxxxx that xxxx the main character, the waves of xxxxx xxxxxx after the event... the xxxx, the forced xxxx, the eventual shut down of the xxxxx xxxxx as the xxxxxxxxx started to xxxxx. The shift from xxxxxxxxxx( for years) to xxxxxxx for themselves.The last breaths of the xxxxxxx and the xxxxxx for the xxxxxxx, the xxxx which every year the xxxxxxx took up to the xxxxx and xxxxx the time since the xxxxx.30 Years.... and I still think about it. How many books, movies, songs... etc... do you expect to think about 30 years down the road. You probably wouldn't even remember the title let alone a rough outline.Will I read it again? Certainly! I ran into a young lady reading this on the subway a few years back, and we had a wonderful conversation... it's that kind of a book.SPOILAGE AVERTED --- Skol","One thing that disturbs people about Earth Abides is its incredible humbling realism about the human condition. People who read it come away profoundly unnerved by the idea that civilization is not something guaranteed to come into existence if we lose it and that it requires an enormous convergence of many different kinds of stimulus to create the energies needed within a race of men to bring it into being. Even the most gifted races of people on the Earth can barely hold it together in the best of times, George Stewart shows us how easily it can all fall apart and remain in a primeval condition for untold generations.The protagonist Isherwood suffers from the same disease that afflicts even the best of men - he lacks direction, loses initiative, becomes too preoccupied with the daily stresses of living and watches his life trickle away in the post apocalyptic environment without ever seeming to summon the right kinds of ambitions to carry out his grand dreams of rebuilding the old world.Stewart was quite prophetic considering when this book was written because many modern anthropologists have since confirmed that many previous civilizations have died out precisely because of this &quot;critical threshold&quot; of the division of labor and sheer numbers of vanished races being too low to sustain a breeding population and achieve the critical mass that leads to a progress oriented civilization. Stewart was very perceptive too be able to articulate this phenomenon and even narrate its exact trajectory following the loss of so many people who were vital components in the world that Isherwood regrets the demise of.The most disturbing aspect for me was that I see much of the exact decay of western civilization going on right now all around us and we have not even have a catastrophic plague yet. The same loss of purpose, of drive, of a sense of our own individual worth as a nation and a desire to maintain our sovereignty is slowly giving way to the degenerative notion of a world socialist government of faceless consumers who lack any culture beyond the food court and cineplex.The terrifying thing about the book &quot;Earth Abides&quot; is that it is the story of our world and the modern era ... even before we suffer the inevitable collapse of our civilization in the physical sense. The reality is that we see it all crumbling around our eyes into the multicultural carnival of formlessness and we often find ourselves as helpless and feckless as Ish himself in doing anything about it.Highest rating, possibly on the top 100 list of best fiction I've ever read. I consider Stewart to be the author of a modern classic in publishing this book. It is so much more than simply speculative fiction, it contains eternal truths.","As I look at the many Amazon customer comments, I see a real split between very favorable and unfavorable reviews. This seems to be because some readers are looking for conventional science fiction/fantasy or adventure. Much as I love those genres, this isn't it, so if that's what you're looking for, save yourself the trouble and don't read Earth Abides. If you do read it, don't expect it to be something it's not.Earth Abides is a book for people with a strong streak of curiosity, who cannot resist thinking and speculating about the human condition. If this is you, few books will satisfy you as well as this one. It first captivated me when I was 14 - yes, there are teens who would be very excited by this book - and I am now on my fourth reading. There is no other novel to which I have returned so regularly. If you are possessed of this curious, speculative streak, then you will appreciate the protagonist, Ish, who himself is driven to understand the horrible event that has overcome the world and to raise and shape a new world. You will also appreciate the realism of the action and characters, and the underlying drama of the situation and tragic heroism of Ish, and you will not for a minute miss the contrived drama and heroism that make for conventional action fiction.","I read this book in '75. Since then I've been pretty much obsessed by it and other eoc novels (End Of Civilisation). I've looked for a book that had similar 'feel' to it. Unfortuntaly 'The Stand', 'Alas, Babylon' or 'Swan Song' don't capture the same magic. The closest I've come to simulate the read experience that was 'Earth Abides' is Alfred Coppel's 'Dark December' or Brian Hodge' 'Dark Advent'.Out of all 300+ eoc novels I've picked up over the last 25 years, 'Earth Abides' STILL ranks as the best. It's probably my all time favorite novel...I think I'm going to go read it again...","First published in 1949, this novel won the 1951 International Fantasy Award in Fiction (the first one awarded) even though this is not a true fantasy novel. The International Fantasy Awards were originated by four British science fiction and fantasy fans (Leslie Flood, John Beynon Harris, G. Ken Chapman, and Frank A. Cooper) for the 1951 British science fiction convention. The awards lasted between 1951 and 1957. George R. Stewart (1895-1980) was a Professor of English at the University of California in Berkeley. This well-read novel is about life after a plague has killed all but a few people on Earth. Isherwood Williams, a graduate student in geography, returns from a trip to the mountains to find everyone dead. He travels throughout the land and finds a female survivor. They settle down in the Bay Area around San Francisco and a small community grows around them. As time goes by, Isherwood tries to teach the children reading and the knowledge of the past. As the decades go by, he discovers that he is the only one who recalls the greatness of the past. Humans have become a band of hunter-gatherers. History has come full circle. &quot;...men go and come, but earth abides.&quot; Carl Sandburg considered it one of the best novels of its time. It is regarded by many as a masterpiece and was a precursor for many later disaster novels (note that one of the voters of the International Fantasy Award was J. B. Harris, whose pseudonym was John Wyndham and author of another classic disaster novel, &quot;The Day of the Triffids.&quot; One of the earlier reviewers suggested that Wyndham was a better disaster writer. But, &quot;Triffids&quot; came out in 1951, and Wyndham still chose &quot;Earth Abides.&quot;). The name &quot;Isherwood&quot; is a direct reference to Ishi, the last surviving member of a California Indian tribe who was brought to the University by Kroeber of the Anthropology Department (many science fiction enthusiasts are very familiar with Kroeber's daughter, Ursula K. Le Guin). Ishi is still quite famous in the study of native American cultures. This book has had such an impact in the development of the science fiction genre that it is now required reading for all serious students of science fiction and speculative literature.","Very rarely do I finish a book and immediately recommend it to other people. Mostly books help pass the time and end up portraying the same plot; another female FBI agent trying to catch a serial killer who ends up stalking her. However, after reading Earth Abides I called up my brother and told him to pick it up. The book, while written some 50 years ago is still topical. The book takes you on a journey of how a person survives after a disaster that wipes out almost the whole population. It then takes you deeper, you find yourself emotionally involved with the character. And you realize that George Stewart has moved from an tale of physical survival into a tale of emotional conflict. The transition is smooth and the two easily complement each other. If you enjoy reading about a world where civilization has been wiped clean and a new world must start over. I highly recommend this book. The writing was engaging and intelligent without confusing you. The storyline was deep and involving. Overall, the main character becomes immediately identifiable. The book ends; but the world created by George Stewart lives on in our imagination. And, I believe that is a definition of a good book.","As of this date there are 158 reviews of George R. Stewart's Earth Abides here in Amazon.com. I'm not sure that writing a 159th will really add any value or if anyone will even make all the way to #159 to see it. But I feel very strongly about this book and to the intrepid reader who gets this far, I hope it helps you to decide to give the book a try.I was 12 years old in 1968 when my Mother gave me this book to read. She was (and still is) a voracious reader. But she has never liked or appreciated science fiction. Then again, she never considered this book to be science fiction. I read the book in one day that summer and have read it at least a half dozen times in the 35 years since then. And I would agree. Although often voted as one of the best science fiction books of all time, I don't really think of it as science fiction. Stewart was not a science fiction writer. Rather he was more of an ecological writer looking at how the planet behaves in relation to specific circumstances. Two of his other novels, Fire and Storm are good examples of this.One area I differ strongly from my Mom is, I do have a good appreciation for science fiction as well as other apocolyptic fiction. Ray Bradbury, Frank Herbert, Robert Heinlein, Philip Jose Farmer and Issac Asimov have thrilled and entertained me for years. But Earth Abides was what got me started and remains my favorite piece of fiction.Earth Abides is a simple \"what if\" story. What if virtually every person on earth died and only a handful were left? Given the book's publication date in 1949, it was groundbreaking. No one had really written a novel on this topic before this. Virtually all the other books in this genre owe a debt of gratitude to Stewart. Books such as The Stand by Stephen King, Alas Babylon by Pat Frank, Malevil by Robert Merle, Lucifer's Hammer by Niven & Pournelle and Swan Song by Robert McCammon included.Stewart must have had his influences, but not from a book or author of this kind. Therefore the story does not focus on war or technology or industry (or science fiction). Instead it is a tale of how the people might behave under the circumstances, the struggles they deal with, the decisions they make and the decisions they fail to make. It is also a tale of how the earth changes and the previous efforts of mankind are so easily erased.Some reviewers here have criticized the main character Ish as being too passive. But this is a part of the novel that rings very true for me. How agressive would one be after living through a time when virtually everyone else dies? Wouldn't most people struggle to survive, never mind thrive?I won't give away the plot for anyone who has gotten this far. Plus if you've made it all the way to this review, you've seen the plot described almost 158 times. In the end the book is both depressing and uplifting. It is depressing in that most of man's advancements appear to be lost by the end of the book. But it is uplifting to realize that the earth heals itself and in the end man will start fresh.The book is both a product and a victim of it's time period, the late 1940's. Some of it will feel a little dated, after all it's over 50 years old and think what has happened in those 50 years. But remarkably, it still comes across as fresh. And with very little update could be brought up to present day and still be a powerful piece of fiction.All in all this is a great read for most people. For those looking for a hard core science fiction look at the end of the world, go watch the Terminator movies.","&quot;Earth Abides&quot; is a wonderful literary work. It's a shame that it's catalogued as a work of &quot;science fiction&quot; because it is so much more than that. I'm sure that many serious literary fans have failed to pick up on this teriffic book because of that &quot;tag&quot;.The book has a tremendous &quot;hook&quot; line - that being, &quot;almost the entire human race is eradicated by a terrible catastrophe&quot;. The plot is very believable and amazing when you consider that the novel was written in 1949. Author George Stewart is a great storyteller and has created some very interesting characters. The hero of this book, &quot;Ish&quot;, is both a &quot;superman&quot; and an &quot;everyman&quot;. He is both the leader of his tribe, but also easily led. His development as a person and as the head of his people is a wonderful progression throughout the book. His wife, &quot;Em&quot; exhibits all the great characteristics of the strong woman behind the &quot;great man&quot;. And, let me say that the symbolism of Ish's hammer was a very interesting facet of the book.My only criticism (and it's a pretty minor one) is that the book did not go into enough detail regarding the disaster and how other people throughout the country were affected. I think that this would have added some rich &quot;body&quot; to the storyline.All things considered though, this indeed is a book for the ages.It belongs with some of the best works of that era, such as &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot;, &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, and later &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. As an educator, I would really urge school officials to add this novel to their list of great American Literary selections for high school students.But, do yourself a favor - go to the library or your local bookstore get a copy of &quot;Earth Abides&quot; and delve into this great classic with its timeless message about the unshakeable human spirit!","Earth AbidesEarth Abides, a novel by George Stewart taps into people's fascination of being the last one on earth. In this book the main character Isherwood Williams (Ish) survives arattlesnake bite in the mountains and returns to find almost every single person dead from a cataclysmic plague. Ish survives the plague and explores. While exploring he finds other survivors and they try re-founding American civilization. They live above San Francisco Bay in the Berkeley hills.Although this novel is well written and very real, I did not like it. The author put a lot of thought into it but it just didn't interest me. This book wasn't all boring, it hadsome good things about it. One of which is how it was frightening because this could really happen to mankind if we don't watch out, but there was more dull things than scarythings in this book. I also thought that it was weird that Ish and the rest of the community were so interested in caring on civilization instead of thinking about their own survival.The only reason that I finished this book is that it is based in the bay area and that is where I live so I can relate to the scenery that the author describes. If you didn't live in the bayarea then this would be one more thing that wouldn't interest you.I would not recommend this novel. It is interesting at the beginning but then gets boring. It is too long and the author seems to drag on subjects to the point where I don'tcare anymore. If you were going to read this book I would say it is best suited to high school or college students. If a young person read it I don't think that they would understand it.","This book Earth Abides by George R. Stewart is about a man who passes by a massive disease which basically obliterates the US. This man, Ish, has to come to realization of this huge crisis and try to find survivors. It goes on and on about his thoughts and shows the struggles that he faces it the horrid situation. He goes around america finding survivors and ends up making a huge family in the end.This book was basically boring and depressing because it was just lagging on and on about how he thought of everything. It made you want to fall fast asleep at times too. (something that i obviously did) I am one of those kind of people who likes adventure and this book had none. It just was one of those books that wanted to show how horrible things could happen to us if we don't watch it. It sort of chilling and makes you depressed to think that it could happen. George R. Stewart was probably giving a good message out when he wrote this, but in the sense that people want to live there lives without this catastrophe, it is not very good.I would not recommend this book to kids under the age of 12 because it probably is too advanced for them. Also because kids do not have to worry about this sort of horror happening to them at that young of an age. People who need to sleep at night and want to fall asleep fast, please read. If you like adventure and mystery in a book, please go find a different book.","The book earth abides was about a man who passes up a massive disease that spreads throughout america and basically obliterates it. It has this man, Ish, come to realization of this huge crisis and shows his struggles to find civilization. As he searches through america he finds out that many other people have survived the catastrophe and he starts to make a family. As the book goes on it shows the will of human survival and the horror of this situation.I thought that the book was a little too slow. I am sort of a adventure book reader and this book had slim to none. It just went on about Ish's thoughts for like 2 chapters at a time. It made you want to just fall asleep everytime u read it. It was dull most of the times, but it does make you think how bad it would be if that sort of thing happened to the country.I would say that this book would not be very appealing to young kids because it is too advanced for them. I would recommend this to people who need to fall asleep at night definately. Also if you like to hear about the deep thoughts of a person who has no one to talk to for weeks, read this book. If you are an adventure or mystery reader who likes action, do not get this book.","\"Men come and go, but Earth abides.\" These chilling words written by George R. Stewart leave the reader feeling bare and stripped in the popular science fiction novel \"Earth Abides.\" A novel I read and still can't decide what to think about it.This book is filled with puzzling situations, frustrating moments, and mind-bending problems that make the reader ask, \"What would I do?\"Plague has struck the world, and people are dying by the millions. A lone survivor, Ish, on a mountain camping trip manages to fend off the disease with snakebite. He returns to a frozen, empty world, and is determined to find civilization and life in the seemingly dead planet. Most of the people he meets are in shock, having seen the horrors of death and destruction of the planet and are stupefied, unable to talk sense or even take care of themselves. One man Ish comes across is drinking himself to death; only eating things out of cans and seems only half-alive. Through his journey's, Ish has a growing urge to settle down and establish life as he knew it again. He alone must save the human race.I thought this book was very interesting, at first. The beginning was intriguing and exciting to think about. But after a while, the idea became old, and boring. Ish just begins to muse over the world's pathetic state, talk about how he's the only intelligent person left, and even starts to become a little snobbish to say the least. The way women were used merely as wombs, though logical in such a situation, got a little annoying also. The detail and wordiness left my mind to wonder away from the book, and I even recall something as simple as a storm drain overflowing taking up two pages to talk about. Ish's endless attempts to get people to think and work for themselves also become a bit momentous and bothersome. It really makes you want to slowly go crazy along with Ish, as you read his \"bible\", page after page of musing nonsense. I really wanted to tell him to start enjoying life and give up on trying to control everyone's thoughts and actions, just to let things go. But there were moments of truly beautiful writing and raw honesty that drew me out of the droning slump. When Ish finds something to believe in, though, it was really disappointing to have it destroyed so suddenly. Ish becomes so obsessed with saving the world, he becomes very self righteous and stuck up, he transforms from a hero into someone you are sick of and increasingly angry with. The author looses his grip on the story and turns the book into a guide of what to do if you find out the world's population has come to an end, and it's up to you, being the only truly sane and intelligent person, to save the planet. The character's personalities fade, and you are left with a bunch of names and occasional dialogue.The novel begins with a bang, and ends with a whimper, which makes the reader want to whine as well. It was not something I'd want loved ones to read, but I would highly recommend the first two hundred pages, and then move on to something else. The people who say they truly enjoyed this book through and through, in my opinion, are liars. It's a thoughtfully written piece, and deserves the recognition it receives, but if you are looking to be entertained, find another book, \"Earth Abides\" will leave you out in the cold.","It's amazing how despite half a century of technological advancement the Earth Abides is largely just an expanded version of the Red Plague by John Steinbeck.","Good story, but a bit unbelievable. Characters reasonably developed.Mostly clean, no gratuitous sex or violence, but some crude language.","Excellent book.. Highly recommend it. Very well written. Takes you through generations. a great read!","Dated but thought provoking aptly describes this novel. Set in post-nuclear holocaust America. excellent.","earth abides may have been original when it came out a zillion years ago but it's dated now and can't compete with stories being written today. the hero is some boob who survives the plague only by stepping on a rattlesnake? wow. and then he can't even teach children to read. why not? there are some good moments here and there, but in the end this book is a yawn.","The idea of an apocalyptic end of our planet and of humankind has always been extremely prevalent in society. From religion to movies, theories of annihilation can be found everywhere. But few books attempt to tackle the subject of life after the end. I think George Stewart wrote this book in the 60's and I wanted to see what his ideas were on that subject. The premise was great, but I was extremely disappointed with Earth Abides because Stewart brings in many themes/ideas but never goes into any of them in any detail whatsoever. There is absolutely no emotional connection with any of the characters,and even less so with Ish, the main character. I felt like I was waiting for something to happen throughout the book, and it never came. The author attempts to tackle way too many &quot;big&quot; subjects at the same time, and in the end,he fails. The only reason I gave this book even one star is because the reader can learn about how the world may deteriorate in the future when man is no longer here.One could say that that is a positive thing.","I'm not going to defend it; excellence stands the test of time, and this one has been around for decades (1949). I would simply ask you to read it for yourself.\"Ish\" came to be one of my favorite literary characters and an inspiration for my own work.","'Earth Abides' is a classic novel of the end of human civilization and it's rebirth. Unlike other apocalyptic sci-fi fantasy novels in the mold of Mad Max, there are no weapon wielding skin headed cannibals roaming the wasteland. In fact the only violence in this novel is an encounter with a pack of wild dogs and the heart rendering decision the community makes to deal with one of the human survivors. In light of recent research exemplified by books such as 'The World Without Us', 'Earth Abides' is astonishing prophetic and knowledgeable. You might say that this novel is an environmentalist's apocalyptic novel 50 years ahead of its time. The novelist's understanding of modern ecology is amazing considering when it was written. The theme of the novel is stated in the title. Human civilization may disappear but earth will abide. A modern classic that should not be missed.","Isherwood Williams is away in the mountains pursuing his graduate field studies in geology. In our iPhone, instant connectivity world it is hard to imagine the isolation this kind of trip entailed in the 1950's when George Stewart wrote his book. Recovering from a snake bite, Ish stumbles back from the hills to find most of humanity wiped out by disease. We follow Ish through the remainder of his life as he comes to terms with a changing Earth--an Earth on which humanity is a barely noticeable presence.The absence of humanity is not only a stark fact, but is emphasized by the author's writing style. Ish is a clear introvert and we experience much of the Earth's change through his internal monologue. Even when he encounters, interacts with, and teams up with other people, this produces very little dialogue. This style underscores the aloneness of the book's characters. It's not loneliness, in the emotional sense, but a continuing reminder that other people no longer play a significant role in the world.The Earth itself becomes an evolving character in the book. We experience the successive rise and fall in populations of insects, rats, dogs and other species as seasons in the Earth's changing life. The diminishing resources scavenged by human beings from cities and storehouses are important to their survival, but also serve as markers of change as the Earth sheds the thin layers of Man's influence. This change is not progress, nor is it overly mourned as decline. It is thoroughly described and documented as inevitable change. Ish observes it and reacts to it. But neither he nor the other characters influence its path or pace.Read and compare this book with two other classics of post-Apocalyptic fiction:Alas, BabylonandThe Day of the Triffids. These works also follow their characters through crises, scavenging, and attempts to preserve the technology and civilization of the past. They are both more optimistic and more social in narrative style and in the strategies followed by their characters. After reading them, return to Earth Abides and appreciate it for the melancholy and aloneness felt by both its characters and its readers. It is a good story, a moving experience, and a skillful integration of message and writing style.","Yes, this is a must-read. I found it 40 years ago and have never forgotten it. Very realistic, this runs rings around today's fantasy and sword-and-sorcery pseudo-science fiction. Countless derivative novels and movies owe this book a lot.","Earth Abides is not a typical post-apocalyptic novel. It doesn't present a world of mutants, giant cockroaches or bands of marauders. It simply shows the slow and inevitable decay of man and all his works, in the teeth of attempts by the protagonist to restore the old ways of civilization. In that it succeeds beautifully and shows us the grandeur of our world and the majesty of what we have wrought...then compares it to the greater majesty of nature and the eternal gaze of time. The novel works best as a family drama, more Swiss Family Robinson than Mad Max, and has no sensational adventures to offer other than the daily tribulations of life. For man may be a great creature, but he is still small and the world doesn't really need him at all...Earth Abides is the most meditative and serene post-apocalyptic novel I've ever read, and it's recommended for more thoughtful readers who won't be easily bored.","EARTH ABIDES is lauded as one of the most noteworthy post-apocalyptic novels ever written. It was originally published in 1949, and its author, George R. Stewart, was better known as a writer of nonfiction than fiction, but EARTH ABIDES is easily his most recognized work--it has been in print off and on for nearly fifty years.Isherwood (Ish) Williams is a graduate student working on his thesis--\"The Ecology of the Black Creek Area\"--in the wilds of northern California when a virulent virus destroys humanity. When Ish returns to civilization he finds emptiness. There are no bodies littering the streets, no signs of struggle, nothing except the surreal stillness of empty towns, streets, businesses and homes. Everything is gone, and Ish doesn't understand what has happened until he reads the bleak, desperate headlines of the last issue of a newspaper in an abandoned magazine shop.EARTH ABIDES is the story of how Isherwood Williams survives the death of humanity, and with it, modern civilization. He is man of intellect--he mourns the passing of knowledge--and he can visualize the future not as an abstract idea, but as it very well may be. Ish chronicles the remnants of humanity as they form themselves into small tribes. They live off what the \"old ones\" left. They open cans for food; they raid sporting goods stores for firearms and ammunition, and miraculously they survive and grow. Ish begins his journey as an observer, but he quickly finds himself a participant of this new world.EARTH ABIDES is one of the most troublesome novels I have read. It is troublesome for two reasons. The first is the writing--style, narrative, and plotting--drove me batty. In a matter of pages it would cycle from being an immensely powerful and energetic story to a dull, over analytical and tiresome diatribe. One of the reasons for this wild and frequent swing was the frequent, every few pages, interruption of the narrative with an omniscient perspective spoiler: It was italicized and, in a very technical and academic style, told exactly what was going to happen in the next few pages. It interrupted the flow of the prose, and generally annoyed me.Secondly, it was a very unflattering look at just how terrible it would be to survive the death of civilization. There is nothing romantic, or eerie, or wholesome, or evil, as in many other popular post-apocalyptic stories--but rather it showed the difficultly, the loneliness and down right miserable aspects of surviving past modern civilization. It read very realistic--the way it would be if our neighbors suddenly died and one or two of us were left holding the bag: suicides, drugs, alcohol and insanity all the flavor of the day.This aspect of the novel was its strength--Mr. Stewart's visions of desperation were apt and vivid. One example of this is when Ish returns to an empty world, and drives through town after town honking his horn, and then waiting for the answering honk that never comes. Ish's loneliness and desperation is palpable and completely understood by the reader.EARTH ABIDES was a roller coaster ride. I enjoyed it yes, but I also disliked it. It is a novel filled with ideas, but its impact is lessened with the over-evaluation of those ideas. If you enjoy a good post-apocalyptic novel EARTH ABIDES may be the answer, but tread warily, because some of its impact and importance has worn away with the passing years.-Gravetapping","Let me preach: I consider it a crime that _Earth Abides_ is out of print. But I can understand why. It challenges way too many of modern man's notions. It is seditious in the quietest of ways.I had never heard of this book till I wrote a review for _I Am Legend_.Some people compared both books and out of curiosity I picked it up at a used book store.Wow! Why is this book not in the canon of great works of American literature? True, it is a 300 page (in the paperback) _meditation_ by one man on the fall and gradual rise of mankind. I can understand why some reviewers loathe the book. It is an observation, not an adventure. The hero's meditations merely travel through time; through space his travels are almost incidental.Our hero, Ish, is no Odysseus. He is no Don Quijote. He is no Robin Hood or King Arthur or Moses. He is an ordinary scholar, a grief-stricken individual trying to come to terms with post-traumatic stress after witnessing the near-universal death of the human race. All he can do is make heroic attempts to _keep track_ of events and time.His meditations and road trip bring him in contact with stoic people, with depressed people, with defensive people and at one point, his Tribe encounters religious fanatics--all isolated groups of survivors trying to cope and remake society in their image.As _written by Stewart_, Ish's burden and character are not those of a civilization builder but rather of a witness to decay, ruin, and eventual rebirth, in which Ish _realizes_ that hubris and a need to control \"fate/destiny/the future\" drove much human action, human culture, and the human spirit.Ish's insights continually bowled me over as I turned page after page. His meditations on technology, progress, humanity, eugenics, government, economics, religion, philosophy, superstition, anthropology, education, and literacy (all man-made institutions) constantly challenged my views and I began an internal dialogue with Ish's character!Ish/Stewart challenges a lot of notions of what we call progress and culture. Amazing. No wonder some people have hated and, doubtless, will hate this book. Prepare to have your attitudes about culture, and civilization,--and what makes a _great literary character_--challenged.It's not one of those, what-would-you-do-in-this-scenario novels, but rather an exposition of what one man _learns_ from his circumstances. Does he challenge them? Fight back? Does he mold circumstances to his spirit or does he go along with them? Is the \"individual acting upon his circumstance and vice-versa\" _question_ some kind of cosmic constant?There are earthquakes, forest fires, city-wide conflagrations. The daily amenities are gone: water, power, fire/police protection, doctors/medicine, etc. You are on your own. What do you do? Responses are manifold. Ish's response and that of his \"tribe\" is just one. That is the brilliance of this novel. You can understand Ish's actions, but would they be yours? Would any actions make a \"difference?\" What is this \"difference\" and who gauges/judges it? Therein lies the crux of the novel. Those who hate the novel seem to resent this existential/metaphysical point.A harsher critic would say that \"events happen\" in _Earth Abides_ in order for Stewart to make his point. Fair enough. Very few characters are developed with fine detail, but that is not the point of this novel. The novel is _about Ish_, the man, his conundrums and his meditations. Not about what we would have done or written or how we would have developed the \"supporting characters.\"Oh, and the pathos in this book is very real. The human universals occur: love, births, bondings/friendship, weddings, tribalism, leadership-rivalry, loss, death. And even a morally ambiguous, ethics-challenging execution.If a few scenes don't bring you to profound sorrow, well...let's just say _I_ experienced the sorrow and emotion of the scene as the novel unfolded.I will not reveal more, but this sad and haunting novel is worth the read. This is a novel that for some reason reminded me of H.G. Wells's _The Time Machine_. Shelley's \"Ozymandias\" and Yeats's The Second Coming\" come to mind as well. Read it and buy your friends a copy. Be a friend. Be well. The Earth Abides.","In my top 5 Science Fiction Novels Ever.Earth Abides tells the story of one solitary man who survives a global, but short-lived plague by pure chance. The novel chronicles his life from that point until his eventual death and is filled with both adventure and introspection. At times the main character, Ish, is hard to like simply because his reactions are so human it's disturbing. He's no hero, and in the post-Heinlein flood of heroic SciFi novels you could be forgiven for calling this novel slow.Earth Abides reaches the lofty height of my number 3 favorite despite the fact that it DID NOT win either the Hugo or the Nebula Award, in fact it wasn't even nominated. Instead I award it this honor because it is the most brilliant example of the post-holocaust theme I've ever encountered, and that theme is a huge one in the Speculative Fiction genre. This is THE BAR, and no one has raised it in 50 years.Superbly poetic and graceful, Earth Abides is undeniably honest, realistic and human it's long, diary-like journey from start to finish. I could easily see myself as Ish... which is both a revelation and scary thought at the same time.","This is such a great book on so many levels, it's a shame that it's being subjected to negative comments from readers who have totally missed key points about the story. First off, the protagonist, Ish, is a geographer, an informed and detached observer and not meant to be a hero or role model. Please don't ladle 21st-century dramatic or politically-correct expectations onto him. He's more real than that. Second, some reviewers here are complaining that Ish doesn't teach his fellow survivors to read etc. But in fact he tries throughout the second half of the novel to do so. They just won't. Ish gradually accepts that his fellow survivors aren't capable of hard intellectual work, that the torch of civilization is going to be mostly extinguished. Ish theorizes that probably the few, functioning survivors of the global plague are going to be doltish people. The sensitive, intelligent ones that survived went mad and were deemed unfit to join the little tribe of survivors. So Ish has the human clay that he has -- simple, uncurious, habit-driven people. He's constantly frustrated that he can't rouse them to live above the level they quickly sank to -- of hunting and gathering cans from supermarkets, talking about fixing up things but never doing it, etc. The whole novel is about the unstoppable descent of the last survivors into primitivism, despite having all of the knowledge of the world at their fingertips in the library.The stopover in the south at the family of the \"negroes\" deserves to be called passe -- the book was published in 1949 after all.","A young man recovers, from what seems to be snake bite, to find humankind has basically been decimated from a strange disease. That's the way Mr. Stewart's work begins. And where does it go from there? Well, the protagonist procedes to explore the remains of the U.S. Eventually he settles down and begins a new life, in the new world that Earth has become.Even though this book might be classified as a sci-fi piece, it is a little less and more than that:- Earth Abides does not deeply explore the \"sci\" in sci-fi. There are not many explanations for the disease that destroys civilization. And there are not too many explanations either for what comes next in the book.- On the other hand, Earth Abides does a great job in exploring the psychological effects on the survivors of the demise of civilization. Moreover, Mr Stewart stretched his work through time to show us the way the first generations of the world (the survivors' sons, daughters and grandkids) would behave. This is really nice.I enjoyed this book. It really did not make a big difference on me the fact that it was written some 50 years ago (frankly, I'm not really sure if the outcome would have been different if this disease attacked us now).I recommend this book to anyone interested in exploring the possibilities and consequences of a decimation of humankind by disease (not impossible considering the bird flu). Regular sci-fi readers might enjoy it, too.Don't read this if you want a hard-core sci-fi book, if it being 50 years old is an issue for you (no Internet and cable TV here...), or if you don't want to share the protagonist's loneliness.Enjoy!","read it in Jr. High and it is still just as great today at age 67.","I found this post-apocalyptic story well written, but a bit slower paced that other titles of this genre. I attribute the pace to the era in which this book was written. I would consider this a must read, especially if you have read On the Beach and Alas, Babylon.","I have read this book several times. Once you start,...it's hard to put down.","I liked this book, though the introduction claiming i would remember the book forever and so on. Well, intro's like that turn me off a bit. It certainly is intriguing in a rather simple way. The later seems to add a certain plausibility which makes it much more believable. It's always a trade off, exchange a little drama for a little more realism. In all, a nice balance. I must say that the book is well written.","An excellent read -- an excellent re-read. The book is both entertaining and thought-provoking. If you like science-fiction with an apocalyptic theme, you will like this work.","great book about the aftermath of humanity and how the world deals with our absence, follows a young grad student from the extinction of man to the establishment of a new human society.","I think this is a post-apocolypse classic because of the unique perspectives the author presents. Rather than focusing on theh flu epidemic that wipes out the majority of humanity, the author focuses on one man's experience of it through the rest of his life as he joins with other survivors and the beginnings of their \"tribe\" come together. There is really less \"action\" than one might expect as the author tells the story of \"post-flu\" life and the subtle, slow changes that emerge as human beings begin living more in balance with the planet. A very beautiful story really as humanity comes to know iteself apart from \"civilization.\"","I did a comparison of this book with Childhood's End for A-level English. Two more different sci-fi books would be difficult to come by and that was the point. Earth Abides is a quiet story, full of the thoughts of Ish and the story of the community he helps found after a plague wipes out most of humanity. There is no scientific details as none of the characters have the expertise to know them. It a human story - not a science one. Some details are given of how the impact of humanity is gradually wiped from the planet and how the survivors - well survive.Don't expect explosive action or tales of daring-do. What you will get is an insightful book - even after all this time - what you will want to read a second and third time. Definitely one to keep - close!!","This was by far the best book I've read in a long time, in terms of pure quality. Coming off a run of John Grisham books before it (and after, I'm reading another Grisham story now), it was amazing how different the quality of the story was, and how much more thought-provoking. Grisham tries for some philosophical stuff in his books, but didn't come close to what you find here.The story itself was Ok...not fascinating alone, though surprising. A few things I certainly didn't expect to happen transpired. But what made it worthwhile was the \"what if\" factor. Imagine living through the apocalypse. Ponder the questions it raises:- What would I do? Seek other people? Focus on survival? How to judge others, and how easily to settle in with them?- How strong are the author's, and lead character's biases in the story? We get their perspective so strongly it's not clear sometimes what the reality is?- What about Charlie? There's no way I'd make the same vote as the characters in the book - so I think. But if I had lived as they had for 22 years, would that change my opinion? How can I know? (answer to that last question - I can't).Is there some deeper answer in the book about what the meaning of life really is? If we strip everything we have today away, we go back to a more primal state where the search for food, water, shelter and safety are paramount in our minds. So how much of what we experience now is a product of civilization and society, rather than our true nature? The memorable line which was something like (I don't have the book for a direct quote) \"I'm happy. Things are as they are and I'm a part of them.\" says a lot doesn't it? Goes back to Buddhist philosophy really - focus on the present. When there's no guarantee of the next meal, when there's no shelter because a fire can burn it all down, when wild animals lurk, how much time do we have to ponder, to worry, to debate? And does that make us happier - meeting our primal drive to just...be?I'd highly recommend this book, my \"top\" recommendation whatever that means. It covers ecology, philosophy, sociaology and so much more...I waited almost two years to read it. It's a shame I waited that long.","Starts off great, slows down too much in the middle but finishes well. If you are looking for a Robinson Crusoe post-apocalyptic type read this is not for you. Nothing like \"The Stand\". All the characters are at best low end of average and manage to accomplish very little over the 42 year span of the book. Somehow, I liked that about the book. The writer gets a little too esoteric though. Still, one of the better reads I have had this year. Written in 1949 and I got a hoot out of picking the small things that dated the book. Everybody smoking is an example.","Typical? maybe today, an age where every scenerio of doom has been played over and over again like some bad rock song. Fear not! This book is good. It was fresh once. . .now it reminds us of what fiction use to be written like. Like a good Doyle or Burroughs. I liked it.","I first read &quot;Earth Abides&quot; in a borrowed copy in the early 1950s ... and many, many times since. My problem then was losing the title --- but never the story. Finally, in the late 1960s, my 15-plus year project of telling the story over and over in search of a title (and a copy of my own) paid off. That copy, well thumbed is well kept. It's on my top shelf, handy for a quick read every couple of years or so. I just finished it again today ... not the first time I've made it through in one sitting and then regretting hitting the last page. In part, the book helped lead me to the East Bay (Clayton) in the 1980s and my time there also makes the story real and special. Now it's back to the top shelf ... the only proper place for this really &quot;great read!!!&quot;","I read this magnificant book over 30 years ago and I still canNOT get it out of my head. I was born and raised in the Berkeley/El Cerrito area. While reading EARTH ABIDES, I could visualize, with extreme clarity, all the areas mentioned in the book. I actually put myself in the possibility of REALITY while: the electricity ran out; the overgrowth of flora/fauna; the animals going wild; seeking tires at dealerships on Shattuck Avenue; seeking other humans in Berkeley, the UC Berkeley library; the creating of another human generation; no racial hostility; etc. I just ordered two more of EARTH ABIDES to give to friends who grew up in the Bay Area. They will be astounded and will love it. Although written in 1949, and what is going on in the world today, was this another prophecy?","Like most of the other reviewers, I too have read this book many times. There is some-thing about this story that stays with you. I can't say I have had the same feeling about any other book.","I read this book over 15 years ago and to this day I still cannot get the story out of my head. I wish I can find another copy so I can read it again and even pass it onto my family and friends.What made this story so remarkable was how logical the story line flowed. Everytime I ponder that faitfull question of being one of few left on Earth, I try to take into account the possibilities of how Earth will &quot;reset&quot; iteslf around me. Would I want to stay in Florida, move back to California, or go on a quest to some distant land and build my own civilization?Anyway, I highly recommend this book for those who have ever pondered the question of being the &quot;last person on Earth.&quot;","I first read this book at 11 yrs old (1965), and have read it 4 more times throughout my life. I continually think about this book and always recomend it to friends. I grew up in the desert with not much to do BUT read,when I finished it the first time I had to start over right away, Ive NEVER done that with ANY other book!!! have fun reading it!!!!!","It was a must read for my Physical Geography class. We were supposed mto read it from a Geographers point of view. My teacher prefaced it with &quot;this book was written in the 40's and it is sexist - so ladies please don't let it irritate you.&quot; I however, didn't find it sexist I found M, the lead female charachter, a strong and wonderful woman. I also liked the fact that there was interracial marriage and poligamy. Forward thinking ideas in the 1940's. All in all it is a good weekend read. But, it is way corny! Especially all the text in italics.","As a long time reader of sci-fi, this novel-EARTH ABIDESs is the single best story ever written. I have read it more than 30 times. From the time Ish begins his relent measures to understand what has happen, the start of rebuiding a social group, the developement years, and the final bridge location with Ishs' final thought of &quot;Men may come and go but Earth abides&quot; stirs thoughts of --how would you perform in a like setting.","What more can be said? Get it and read it!!! I first read it about 35 years ago and it has stayed with me. The book impressed me then and it impresses me now.","When the protagonist entered the Bancroft library at the Univeristy of California, and the author described him handling the books and the care which was taken when he left, was so beautifly described I almost cried. Living in chaos but leaving in such a humanly way left a strong message of the power of books and libraries that needs to be an inhernt value to our culture."],

      "reviews.text":["Have you ever wished you could believe in ghosts? Or Jesus or Bob Marley or Bruce Lee? &quot;Fiskadoro&quot; creates a bizarre, poetic world where the civilization that stands between us and earlier forms of belief has been wiped out in a nuclear attack.The new denizens of Twicetown (once Key West) live among the fragments of a half-remembered time, where scraps of different languages, musics, religions and machines exist without the memory of their earlier meaning or purpose. With no history to understand, the characters return to a more primal (primitive?) instinct for magic, ritual and resurrection.Johnson writes with the weird precision of dreams, where details like the heat or the color of a tree are crystal-clear, but the larger meanings stay blurred. He's especially good at describing extreme states--epileptic fits, the Saigon airlift, a druggy tribal initiation rite.But the characters themselves never felt very real to me. Maybe that's part of the point: without memory, identity softens and leaves a new margin for the spirit-world, for the deaths and strange rebirths that fill the story. But I found it hard to stay interested in what happened to anyone, and the novel ends (for me at least) with more muddle than mystery.Still, Johnson's makes his fractured world every bit as believable as ours. His sharp, lyrical prose will haunt you long after you've forgotten the plot.","A friend gave me copies of Denis Johnson's \"Fiskadoro\" and \"Already Dead,\" and told me to read \"Fiskadoro\" second since it was maybe too bizarre an introduction to the author's work. As a lover of the bizarre, I ignored his advice and read \"Fiskadoro\" first.As noted by other reviewers, probably Johnson's greatest strength is his poetic and creative use of language. Like Bruno Schulz (as so brilliantly translated by Celina Wieniewski), he gives you sentences and paragraphs that are truly breathtaking, like unexpectedly stumbling across a scene of incredible beauty. Also like Schulz, Johnson is also quite adept at conveying dreamlike states of mind, and can inspire the conviction that delirium is more true than \"objective\" reality.\"Fiskadoro\" can be called a science fiction book only in the most hair-splitting sense. It's not a druggy fantasy like the Carlos Castaneda books. Nor is it a cautionary tale warning us of the effects of nuclear devastation--although it certainly does convey some of those horrors very effectively. This is more of a psychological adventure, a meditation on human consciousness and being, with plenty of entertaining experiences along the way.Johnson's humor is very sophisticated. It's a sign of his great skill that much of the humor is totally contextual, but nonetheless very amusing. His humor is not the knee-slapping variety, but more the awe-inspiring, thought-provoking variety. But very funny nonetheless.Some of the imagery is so cinematic, so well described--with fairly ordinary language surrounding precisely the correct word to unlock the door to mysterious imaginings--that I would find myself thinking, \"Wow...Can someone really do that with just words?\" The guy is truly a gifted writer.Occasionally, too, Johnson throws in a wise observation or imparts a philosophical nugget of the sort that a serious reader might jot down in a commonplace book, and that's always very rewarding.The characterizations are less satisfying, for the most part. There are a number of very interesting characters, and we do get to know some of them pretty well, but I sensed a certain distance from most of the characters, except maybe Mr. Cheung. This is less a character-driven story than an idea-driven one. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but some readers may be disappointed by that.The attempts of Mr. Cheung, gardener, clarinetist, and Manager of the \"Miami Symphony Orchestra,\" to maintain a civilized sensibility in the face of choas and entropy are very touching. He reminded me of Mr. Tagomi in Philip K. Dick's \"Man in the High Castle\"--thoughtful, dignified, worried, prim, self-critical, conscientious, dogged, earnest. And Johnson does an excellent job of helping us see things through Mr. Cheung's eyes when he's the POV character.I thought the latter portion of the book, after Fiskadoro himself goes through his transformation, was less satisfying than the earlier sections. (This may be because I embarked on that section the day after seeing the second part of the Ken Burns documentary on Mark Twain. Suddenly \"Fiskadoro\" seemed trivial in comparison to the monumental works of Clemens.) Even though some very intense things happen, the story became more symbolic and less emotionally involving for me in its concluding stages.I was also a little put off by the growing feeling that the author regarded black and poor folks as very alien. Maybe that's unfair, but there's sometimes a condescending, patronizing vibe toward some of the characters. I prefer a writer who's in there with the characters to one who could be slumming. (Or is that my own prejudices rearing their hydra heads?)Overall, though, I highly recommend \"Fiskadoro.\" There is much more going on here than a beautiful writing style. Johnson shows you wonders, he embraces pain and fear and death as integral to life, and he reminds you that despite everything, life is precious and profound, and, yes, worth it--and sometimes strange in ways that are almost impossible to imagine. He gives you much to think about, but he slips the ideas in skillfully, organically, so that they appear in the light-bleached, desolate splendor of the landscape in a way that makes them seem like they always belonged there.","You've gotta love an eschatology that encompasses Bob Marley, Jesus and Quetzalcoatl.Denis Johnson's coming of age story revolves around the boy Fiskadoro, and hisclarinet teacher, Mr. Cheung. These inhabitants of Twicetown (set in thepost-WWIII Florida Keys), some of whom speak in a Spanglish or Rastafari patois, aretrying to restart civilization from the remains of the old. The apolcalypse has ruptured allcultural continuity, leaving Twicetown's inhabitants with cryptic items from the pastfrom which they fashion their lives and beliefs. Old auto parts are fashioned intofurniture, phrases with forgotten meanings, song lyrics, and prophesies gleaned from achildren's book on dinosaurs all become part of their new creation myth: a post-modernPopol Vuh.Events in time seem to recycle and inform the future: One character, Grandmother Wright,mute with age and senility, is trapped in her own memories of her escape from Vietnam duringthe fall of Saigon. Her memories of her survival parallel the present: past becomes prologueto the future.With me so far? This book might be a tough introduction to Denis Johnson's work, but for me, his poetic turns of phrases made me stop several times in order to reread and savor selectpassages. Overall, Fiskadoro shows that now matter how advanced our civilization may be, we're only a misstep away from new, spooky world.","This is a glowing work, rendered in a luminous prose that seamlessly undulates between bright-pale caprice and dimmed, primitive(in tone, not execution) heaviness. Fiskadoro is a tale of the ancient human tribes of the future and Johnson is our masterful archeologist/anthropologist, an amnesiatic clairvoyant of the end of the world. We're presented with a post-apocalyptic glimpse of humanity's persistence in the lush yet devastated area south of the Florida Keys. It's a story about time's confluence, the ghosts of history's wandering presence in the present(our future), the self as a product of culture, the self as an ever dying vessel of forgetting, family, greed, born leaders, born failures, birth, death. To attempt to further encapsulate this novel is to truly do it a disservice for it unfolds magically before the reader's eyes, transports us far away to the here and now... if that makes any sense. Its somber tones(somber in the way a cello seems to lament at the same frequency of the heart) are moving, its compassion mixed with sudden moments of darkness is striking, its thematic, structural, and philosophical complexities are easily savored, devoured, drunk, basked in... for Johnson tells it with a sensitivity and a love and a vision that is both unique and rare(inspiring).","I have had a difficult time wrapping my head around this book, what it is supposed to mean, what it means for me. So this is less of a review and more of a stream of consciousness dump of some of my thoughts on it. First of all, it is set in the post-nuclear war Florida Keys. This area of the planet was saved from nuclear destruction (twice actually, giving one local town the new name of Twicetown), and the residents seem to be divided into several camps, one of which is a hallucination-infested swamp-living voodoo people. But back to Fiskadoro--the main character, a young kid who has a still-intact clarinet and who learns to play it under the tutelage of an old Chinese fellow whose grandmother dreams about her youth during of the American exodus from Vietnam during the final days of the war and is purportedly the oldest woman still alive.I tried to find the point of the book, and I'm sure I missed it on my own efforts, but since it was written by a poet, I assume it succeeds on many literary levels that I haven't taken the time to explore and didn't digest slowly enough during my read to perceive them.If you're looking for a different type of post-nuke story, and appreciate the fine art of trying to understand a language consisting of a mix-mash of English, Spanish, and who knows what else, spoken by introspective, dreaming, hallucinating, memory-tripping people who have little qualms about public nudity, this may just be the book for you.The used book store that sent the book to me (on a promotion they had about giving away their surplus books and my suggestion they send me something in the post-nuclear war genre) wrote in the inside cover \"a book of genius.\" I think they're right, but I am not sure I spent enough serious effort trying to understand the book to completely know why, so I'll just take their word for it and let the themes of the book simmer in my subconscious for all the effect that may have.One final thought: a connection that I did make, perhaps a stretch but still one that occurs to me, is that I couldn't help but chuckle at the setting, in light of the post-nuclear (neutron bomb) computer role-playing game, \"Fountain of Dreams,\" set in the swamps of Miami, Florida. At least there were no mutant killer clowns to make a mockery of things in Fiskadoro!","FISKADORO is a radically different work than the other Johnson books I've read, JESUS' SON and ANGELS. In those works, Johnson renders gritty realities with poetry and spirituality that make them transcendent. The language is still poetic here, but now Johnson is rendering a strangely mutated, postapocalyptic world.While the language is lush, and spiritual themes constantly emerge and submerge, FISKADORO strikes me as one of the most realistic portrayals of the post-apocalypse that I have seen. Too often, the post-apocalypse is portrayed as a hellish nightmare where basic humanity has disappeared (see Jack Womack's work). Johnson's survivors are shamefully ignorant by today's standards, and the cult offshoots of this future world demand horrific and seemingly needless blood sacrifices, but Johnson's future never devolves into caricature. In fact, at times I find myself considering that Fiskadoro's world, with the survivors eking out a quarantined existence starved of resources and information in the Florida Keys, is probably how most people on the Earth live NOW. Johnson seems to be suggesting this as well, with the interpolation of Fiskadoro's post-apocalyptic world and Grandmother Cheung's similar escape from the chaos of collapsing South Vietnam in the 1970s.All in all, this is an extraordinarily thoughtful and exquisitely rendered work, almost more of a portrait in poetry than a traditional work of fiction.","I have to admit the first time that I read this book I had almost no idea of what was going on. After I second reading I now see that it was not the authors fault but my own. This book, sometimes just very haunting, is also at the same time very beautiful. It's the fourth book of Johnson's that I've read, and it was entertaining enough for me two read two times, so that is saying something. It is not as powerful as say &quot;Jesus son&quot; or as poetic as some of his other works, but I think that if you are a fan of Johnsons than you will not be dissapointed.","I have to admit I didn't finish it. But I tried. I loved Denis Johnson's Tree of Smoke and Already Dead. This book was written much earlier that they were, and the author wasn't nearly as good when he wrote this book as he later became. The others are beautiful. This is not.","What is a culture without a collective memory? When the structures of a society have collapsed what good is information or knowledge? They are useless, according to Denis Johnson's post-apocalyptic novel Fiskadoro. Like most novels set after some great, world destroying event, the characters in Fiskadoro live among the shards of a grander time. There is little collective memory of the time before the atomic war in the Key West of Fiskadoro, and the characters live with an acute awareness of their fallen state. This fixation on memory and reality, on the unknown past and the uncertain present, gives the novel a dream-like, disjointed quality. Nothing makes much sense in the world of Fiskadoro and the mixed patois of English and Spanish the characters speak fails to convey precise nuance of emotion or thought. Any information the citizens of Fiskadoro can glean about their world only confuses their sense of reality. Without an overarching culture to ground them, facts and information disorient. At one point Fiskadoro, the main character, points to the sky and the ocean and says \"I don't know what es.\" The world itself is an ontological question mark. In the shadow between one world's destruction and (perhaps) the birth of another, there is only a persistent and inexplicable now.","Johnson has written a very different post-apocalypse novel compared with the normal fare. I really enjoyed the first part of the book, but the latter sections didn't draw me in nearly as much. While it's fine to leave some loose ends in this type of book, he left too many.I really feel this should have been twice as long so he could more completely construct his world. I still rated it four stars for the inventive language and writing.","Is it a novel about *the* End of the World, the horrifying vestiges of a nuclear war? Or, is there something else at play, in this master writer's intriguing novel? On the one hand we have a fascinating examination of humanity rebuilding, picking up its own shattered pieces and putting itself back together. On the other hand, Johnson reminds us that The End of the World is, in many ways, both a collective and an individual experience.One parralel (End of the-) World is the Fall of Saigon in 1975, for a refugee, Maria/Grandmother Wright. Against her experience, the novel is hinged. So too, Fiskadoro's coming of age ritual experience is also his own End of the World--the end of all that he once knew, and his rebirth as a new man.In the end, Johnson asks us to reflect on memory and existence, and the subjectivity of life's great epochs. He leaves us with a novel not easily forgotten.","This book is about humanity, and coming of age. I thought the language was beautiful. Like a symphony that is both sad and wonderful."],

      "book_title":"Return to Isis",
      "description":"On a spy mission for Freeland, Whit is almost safely home when the brutal forces of Elysium find her. When a battered and destitute farmer comes to her aid, Whit can’t leave the woman to a certain death, setting in motion a homecoming that is anything but safe. Whit’s feelings for Amelia complicate their return, especially when the other women of Freeland are wary of Amelia—who may not be the simple farmer she seems. There are answers in Amelia’s haunting dreams, but those are as deep as the secrets that surround Isis, a colony mysteriously destroyed by Elysium forces. The ruins of Isis hide an adversary Whit has never faced before, one whose plans for Freeland have been dormant for ten long years and whose hatred of the women of Isis lingers from a distant past. The year is 2093. Isis is only a memory, but the future survival of Freeland depends on remembering… Return to Isis is the first book in Jean Stewarts’ beloved science-fiction series, and was shortlisted for a Lambda Literary Award. Originally published by Rising Tide Press 1992.",

      "reviews.text":["Jean Stewart wrote a three book series staged in a post nuclear war, all female society separated (by choice) from men. A great blend of science fiction, romance and strong female characters that will entice you to read all three books in one sitting. It is a simple, quick read that goes well with a hot bath and chocolate.","Jean Stewart has set her novel in a future where a virulent virus has decimated America's population, and, as a consequence, divided the country into three distinct zones - one is a wilderness where no one can live, another is Elysia and is run by white right-wing Christian men bent on cleansing the race and who use women as breeding stock, and the third is Freeland ruled by women. This is the story of Whit, a Freeland warrior, and Amelia, a Farmer from Elysia. Together they unlock Amelia's past and solve the mystery of who betrayed Freeland ten years earlier. This is a well-written combination of science fiction and lesbian romance. The characters are well drawn, the societies are clearly defined without bogging the reader down in detail, and the writer has down all this in 173 pages. This is definitely not your formulaic output of either genre. It deserves a wide audience because it talks about a future that is possible as well as tells a story along the way.","I took a segue from my usual fare to try this sci-fi series of books and am glad I did. From the first page of 'Return to Isis' I was hooked. Freeland is a mixture of all races, but mainly homosexuals, women in particular. They live by the good ole US Constitution, have protogenesis (in this case, reproduction without sperm), and a cure for a mutated form of AIDS called AGH. Elysia is what is left of the white, Christian, heterosexual society of America. The region is dominated by men, women are kept as breeders or drones, and they are over-run by AGH.Whit is a warrior from Freeland who is doing an undercover operation in Elysia. When trying to return home, she accidentally saves Amelia from from her horrible life in Elysia. This book is about their struggle to gain acceptance for Amelia and about Amelia regaining lost memories. It is well-written and edited, and kept this reader's attention. Although the setting is in the future, the science fiction theme only enhanced the story.I'm glad I took the time to read this story and am looking forward to the remaining four books in the series.","I read first read Return to Isis when it was originally published in 1992, and it was one of my favorite lesbian novels at that time.It's a science fantasy novel, taking place 100 years in the future from when it was written. Whitaker escapes, with help from the mysterious Amelia, from the repressive Elysium, where she's been living as a spy, back to her home, a utopian all female community in Freeland. (The West Coast of what used to be the US.) It's part adventure, part thriller, and part romance.I hadn't read the book in a very long time, so was curious if it would stand up to my current reading standards. It seems that the older I get, the pickier I get.It holds up surprisingly well I thought, and I very much enjoyed reading it again. It's not great literature by any means, but it's an engaging read with good pacing that kept me avidly turning the pages.There still isn't much in the speculative genre to choose from in lesbian fiction, so I recommend it to anyone with an interest in that type of book. It's definitely a unique story in the body of lesfic work.","I was pleasantly surprised by Jean Stewart's riveting science fiction adventure, \"Return to Isis.\" To label this wonderful book merely \"lesbian science fiction\" is denigrating both to the author and the material. Albeit this is the story of a futuristic lesbian society, I found it thoroughly enjoyable, and as well written as any number of \"straight\" distopian novels. The world Stewart creates is a frightening one, not because it is far from our own, but rather a bit too close! It envisons a time when AIDS has mutated and blended with genital herpes to create a more deadly strain, AGH, which devastated most of the world. In the United States, a war broke out between conservative Christians, who blamed the victims of AGH for its spread. This split the country into Freeland, where women, minorities, homosexuals, Jews and others blamed for AGH live without fear, and Elysium, basically the US from Chicago east of the Mississippi, where \"New Order Christians\" run a repressive, facist regime, hiding behind a \"Star Wars\" type laser barrier that keeps undesirables out and slaves in. Enter Whit, a Freeland Warrior, and Amelia, a simple farm girl who harbors an ancient secret. I won't spoil the plot for those who haven't read \"Return to Isis,\" except to say that it contains may twists and unexpected turns. It's a supremely well crafted and well written book which deserves a much wider audience. I found it a delight, and literally couldn't put it down. I am now reading the sequel, \"Isis Rising\" with equal enthusiasm.","Setting of an estranged land with it's major nemesis just across the continient is good basic fare. A mystery-like approach allows for outlining of how Freeland came about and how it functions. A little unhappy with all men being seen as 'bad' and some of the sugary 'lets all get along' stuff is excessive, in my opinion. All in all a good view of Lesbian possibilities in the future with a nice story of two very different women slowly falling in love.","For a long time, I avoided reading Jean Stewart's Isis series. I was under the misconception that they were the stories of Amazon women in some past or alien society. Only recently did I learn that they are post-apocalyptic stories...and I LOVE post-apocalyptic stories. So, I started the series a couple of days ago.Wow! When I finished \"Return to Isis\" I could say nothing but \"wow!\" It's so rare that a book catches me by surprise. It's difficult to explain without giving away spoilers, but I never saw that coming. Up to a sentence before I got \"the name,\" I kept yelling inside my head \"who is it? who's doing this?\" Once I got \"the name,\" almost at the end of the story, it all made perfect sense. All the clues were there, but I had missed them.My partner and I discussed this after I finished the first book. Of all the many books I've read in the past few years, this is only the second or third time someone fooled me. I've been reading so long that generally halfway through a book I've figured out the entire storyline and all or almost all of the secrets. In many books, I've figured it out after the first couple of chapters.Many kudos to Jean. My hat is off to anyone who can provide me with the clues and yet keep the story mysterious enough that I am surprised.","What a delightful novel. I found this book to be both entertaining and thought provoking. In &#65533;Return To Isis&#65533; Jean Stewart has given the reader a stirring tale of love found in a world where women have carved out a splendid society for themselves. Called Freeland it is a land of modern amazons. They live, they love, they work together to create the kind of civilization that we can only dream about here in the real world. It is a society built on love and freedom. It is idyllic. And yet it does have its problems for right next door to Freeland can be found Elysium, a land still ruled by men. Elysium is the hell to Freeland&#65533;s heaven. &#65533;Return To Isis&#65533; tells the story of one woman&#65533;s escape from Elysium and her struggle to find a home in Freeland where she is thought to be a spy at best and at worst a traitor. Unaccustomed to the freedom of her new home Amelia must look deep into her self and her soul, she must dig through long buried memories, she must find allies and defeat enemies, and she must come to grips with the truth of who she really is on her quest to find peace. Guiding her on this quest is the hardened warrior woman Whit whose own troubled soul paradoxically gives Amelia just the foundation she needs to succeed in this new land she has come to. Toss in to the mix a jilted ex-lover, a wise and motherly matriarch, and a plotting and suspicious captain and &#65533;Return To Isis&#65533; becomes a fully rounded and well thought out novel of a future that very well may be better than any we can realistically hope for. I for one would love to live in such a world.","The writing is bad, the plot is old, and the whole idea of a little utopian community in the post-Apocalyptic US has been done so many times, it has to at least have an interesting twist to hold my attention.I could have ignored all that if I cared about the characters at all. But each of them was a walking stereotype, from the wise older woman to the warrior to the innocent outsider. The only character who showed even the slightest spark of life was the healer who kept hitting on every woman who walked by.The secrets from the past that kept coming up weren't at all believable for the characters. I was reminded of the end to Scooby-Doo cartoons, or Hardy Boys books. (&quot;Ha ha, I was the traitor all along! And you never suspected anything! Now let me tell you all about my plan while I lower you into a vat of acid!&quot;)I like mindless entertainment as much as the next person, but it has to actually be entertaining, and this isn't.","The best I could say for this book (and the others in the series) is that I can get a good chuckle out of the deplorable writing. I am really quite amazed that these were published at all, as the writing is reminiscent of poor fan fiction sites, but in the interests of nothing more than lesbian solidarity and a good laugh, you should buy them."],

      "reviews.text":["Walter Miller's only major novel is not simply a post-apocalyptic science fiction novel but also a multi-layered meditation on the conflict between knowledge and morality. Six hundred years after a nuclear holocaust, an abbey of Catholic monks survives during a new Dark Ages and preserves the little that remains of the world's scientific knowledge. The monks also seek evidence concerning the existence of Leibowitz, their alleged founder (who, the reader soon realizes, is a Jewish scientist who appears to have been part of the nuclear industrial complex of the 1960s). The second part fast-forwards another six hundred years, to the onset of a new Renaissance; a final section again skips yet another six hundred years, to the dawn of a second Space Age--complete, once again, with nuclear weapons.The only character who appears in all three sections is the Wandering Jew--borrowed from the anti-Semitic legend of a man who mocked Jesus on the way to the crucifixion and who was condemned to a vagrant life on earth until Judgment Day. Miller resurrects this European slander and sanitizes him as a curmudgeonly hermit, a voice of reason in a desert wilderness, an observer to humankind's repeated stupidities, a friend to the monks and abbots, the biblical Lazarus, the ghost of Leibowitz (perhaps)--and even the voice of Miller himself.Throughout \"Canticle,\" Miller's search for religious faith clashes with his respect for scientific rationalism. For Miller, Lucifer is not a fallen angel but technological discovery unencumbered by a moral compass; \"Lucifer is fallen\" becomes the code phrase the future Church uses to indicate the imminent threat of a second nuclear holocaust. The ability of humankind to abuse learning for evil purposes, to continually expel itself from the Garden of Eden, perplexes and haunts the author: \"The closer men came to perfecting for themselves a paradise, the more impatient they seemed to become with it, and with themselves as well.\"Some readers might be turned off by the book's religious undercurrent, but that would be to mistake fiction for a sermon. The work is certainly infused with the author's Catholicism, but its philosophy is far too ambiguous to be read like a homily. This is no \"Battlefield Earth.\" Instead, it is Miller's highly personal act of atonement; he acknowledged later in life that his fictional monastery was first subconsciously, then purposefully modeled on the ancient Benedictine Monastery at Monte Cassino, which, as a World War II pilot, he bombed to smithereens. (An historical aside: most of the major Greco-Roman scientific and mathematical texts were preserved for posterity by Arabic scholars--not by medieval Catholic monks. But this is fiction, and it's not clear whether Miller is trying to replicate Church history as it was or as he felt it should have been.)In many ways, Miller's Catholicism is as conflicted in the book as it was in his own life. He changed religious beliefs several times; in the 1980s, he immersed himself in Buddhist texts. Throughout \"Canticle,\" you can see Miller wrestling with his spiritual beliefs and with his own demons, and in the final chapters, Miller includes an extended debate over whether suicide and euthanasia (and, tangentially, abortion) are ever viable options, even to avoid the worst forms of pain and certain death. Although he seems to side with Catholic views on these issues, Miller himself committed suicide in 1996.Rather than distracting the reader with religious and philosophical musings, however, \"A Canticle for Leibowitz\" is enriched by them. It's not only a compelling, well-written story, it's an allegorical tale that might encourage readers to struggle with their own beliefs and demons.","&quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; chronicles the rebuilding of &quot;civilization&quot; after nuclear holocaust. It has three distinct sections, each separated by hundreds of years, centering around life at a desert monastary named in honor of a very unusual &quot;saint&quot;. Since each section tells its own story, and could be read separately, I'm going to rate each one separately.PART ONE: FIAT HOMO (5 stars) Tipped off by a mysterious old man (could it be Saint Leibowitz himself?), a nervous novice monk discovers an underground chamber that contains some highly significant relics, for which he suffers abuse from a fearful and sadistic abbot. Eventually, he is sent on a dangerous journey to New Rome, under constant threat from primitive nomads. The ending of this section is rather chilling and ironic, much like a Flannery O'Connor short story.PART TWO: FIAT LUX (3 stars) This is the only section among the three that really is not able to stand alone as a self-contained story with a definitive ending. I suppose this could be considered the &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; of the &quot;trilogy&quot;. The basis of this part is the mistrust that exists between religion and science, when a scholar visits the monastary to study the ancient Leibowitz documents and finds, to his astonishment, one of the monks has invented (or re-invented) the electric light. The old man reappears (remember, this is hundreds of years after the first story) as a rather significant player in this section, but, ultimately, this story is merely transitional.PART THREE: FIAT VOLUNTUAS TUA (5 stars) I wanted to give this part 6 or 7 stars, but that would be cheating. This last section is absolutely brilliant. Many hundreds of years later, the inevitable happens, proving that mankind apparently never learns from its mistakes. The very wise abbot (it is interesting how each abbot in these stories is wiser than the last) sees the handwriting on the wall and commissions a group of monastics, accompanied by the relics of Saint Leibowitz, to escape by rocket ship to a distant planet to guarantee the perpetuity of the order and, indeed, of the faith itself. Meanwhile, the abbot and a medical doctor grapple over the appropriateness of euthanasia for suffering victims of the fallout. (Any groups or classes that might be discussing the subject of mercy killing would benefit greatly by reading this section since it lays out the opposing arguments very clearly and forcefully). Although the ultimate disaster takes place, hope is still found in the most unlikely person: a mutant, two-headed woman. And so we begin again.This book takes a very positive, optimistic view of religion, while it is pessimistic about mankind in general. The stories included here work on many levels, and the book as a whole makes for an enlightening reading experience.","This novel from the 1950's is a deserved classic among the sci-fi intelligentsia. Maybe its laborious title has kept it from being noticed by the popular masses, but this book is a hidden gem for those looking to broaden their horizons. This is probably one of the earliest stories to speculate on a post-nuclear apocalypse, and here Walter Miller created one of the most imaginative and far-reaching examples of that motif. Later nuclear winter stories would get predictable and formulaic, but not this originator. In this masterpiece of storytelling, three ages of human development pass by over the course of 1800 years, but in the end we see that those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it. While it's a bit dated in places, this brilliant and disturbing novel will keep you thinking for a long time after you're done reading it.In addition to its unique take on historical processes, this book is essentially about the pros and cons of organized religion. In Part 1, humanity is stuck in the middle of several centuries of dark ages after a nuclear war, and once again the Catholic Church (or what's left of it) holds sway over a fearful and unenlightened society. Among the few records of the pre-war world that have survived are some inconsequential notes and blueprints by a minor scientist called Leibowitz. The church has made Leibowitz a saint, and here Miller appears to be commenting on the reverence of organized religion toward matters of doubtful authenticity and importance. Is religious belief built upon weak foundations? In Part 2 humanity is entering a new renaissance of knowledge, with religion being unable to adjust to the new enlightenment. In Part 3, humanity has reached a new technical age, but society is again oppressed by nuclear paranoia and mutually assured destruction. Humanity is about to destroy itself once again in this 1800-year cycle. Miller then takes us on an examination of the strength and relevance of faith in the face of such suffering and destruction. However, for the entire 1800 years and more, the disciples of Leibowitz have kept faith and hope alive. So is organized religion the curse or savior of humanity? Walter Miller contemplates these issues with great lucidity in this lost classic. [~doomsdayer520~]","There's no point in even trying to describe A Canticle for Leibowitz. It's pure Genius-with-a-capital-G. If you're literate and don't need all the whiz-bang crap that usually populates sci fi (I don't even think I would consider this sci fi, it's so... WAY beyond the norm); that is, if you can think independently, Read This Book. Don't worry about all the latin... he doesn't translate most of it but you can imply meaning from context.So... I can't describe it, but here are some reasons why I consider Canticle pure Genius.Canticle :1. Offers an entirely classical and yet revolutionary reading of history.2. Is a darn good story.3. Is purely intellectual, working to excite thought and reason and possibility rather than visual senses or innovations.4. Gives credit to Christianity for preserving literacy over the centuries, a fact that is usually overlooked.5. Respects religion; most sci fi novels either disdain religious people, lampoon them, or write them off as annoying or dangerous quacks. This one treats them with the respect they deserve.6. Is, perhaps, an incredible act of penance by the author (read the \"about the author\" when you finish).7. Addresses all the serious questions in life: suicide, war, pacifism, what the role of religion in society is... the list is endless.8. Is the epitome of intertextuality. It doesn't mention any specific works (though the Inferno is quoted), but it draws heavily (purposefully) from world and biblical history... not only so that it may enlighten us about the current text (the arrow usually goes that way), but rather to prompt us to view PREVIOUS texts in a totally different way.9. Asks the question: Why do we mistrust our historical sources so much?10. Hasn't dated itself a day since it was written in 1959. Not a day.11. Contains thoughts so terrible and yet beautiful it made me cry.So read it. Or abandon hope, ye who enter here.","A Canticle for Leibowitz is one of those you books you read because you heard it was a twentieth century classic and thought, \"Maybe I should read that.\" I am not sure why it is a classic, but it was an interesting read. It is a collection of what amounts to three novellas set in the desert Southwest after a nuclear holocaust. The first story (set some 600 years in the future) introduces the reader to the Albertian Order of Leibowitz, a group of monks whose founder was murdered by a mob for protecting books, and are dedicated to the protection and preservation of knowledge. The order hopes the blessed Leibowitz will be canonized a saint, and a young novice called Francis may have found something that could turn the tide toward Leibowitz's recognition. The remaining two stories follow the Order through two millennia of the development of civilization again. To tell more of the plot would spoil the fun. This book is an examination of the preserving role the Catholic church played in history; only it is set in the future in periods similar to the Dark Ages, the Renaissance, and another period hauntingly familiar to the Cold War Era. Miller not only spins a compelling yarn, he wrestles with practical, historical, and theological questions we all wrestle with. There were slow parts, hence the 3 1/2 rather than 4 stars, but over all it was worth reading for its sheer ability to provoke questions in an entertaining fashion. Over-all, worth reading.","I am not the &quot;smartest&quot; reader all of the time - I often can catch only the most obvious of metaphors and allegories. This book really speaks on many levels, and I think that's the true secret to its lasting power.On the surface, the book is a well-written tale of an Abbey that has survived through the ages (the book takes place a millennium from now). The book is heavily layered, however, like an onion.How many times you read this book and how quick you are to catch on to various themes will determine how many layers you experience.I was fortunate enough to consider some of the themes of the book, particularly that religion, although divinely inspired, will always be fallible because it is man-made. Some of the things the Abbey has made sacred (including the canonization of a Jew) really makes you think about how today's religion has been interpreted through the centuries. Another theme worth exploring is the fact that man really doesn't learn from his mistakes. This becomes hauntingly obvious in the last third of the book.I would recommend this book to nearly anyone, especially those who enjoy a good sci-fi yarn or who like books that can be explored from so many different angles. I doubt this book will stay on my shelf too many years before I decide to give it another go.","As the book description tells us, this is the story of the abbey dedicated to St. Leibowitz (not the story of Leibowitz himself) who tried to save mankind's knowledge after a nuclear war. There are three distincy parts to this story, each separated by several generations, linked by their common history (the abbey's quest for knowledge and preserving Leibowitz's memorabalia). I do not normally enjoy post-apocalyptic stories, but this one seems more plausible than most (although you have to wonder how not a single high school science text survived the war, but only advanced circuit diagrams and such).This book struck a chord with me for two reasons. I am not a Catholic, but I am a Christian, and was pleasantly surprised by the depiction of the monks and priests. Usually science fiction introduces Christianity (and religion in general) as being mythological, irrelevant, or evil. Here, we have individual Catholics with assorted personalities praying for guidance, discussing theology with athiests, trying to puzzle out thousand year old manuscripts - in short, what you would expect monks and priests to do! Secondly, as a chemist, I am in the science most traditionally maligned as &quot;evil&quot; (although genetics is giving us a run for the money at the moment). The persecution of scientists trying to save information against destruction from the mob struck a chord for me as well. It seems reasonable that post-war society would vow revenge on either religion (Look what God did to us) or science (Look what Science did to us), or both. The characters in the book have the courage to stand up and say &quot;It's not God or Science that did this to you, it was Man,&quot; and the book seems to be saying &quot;If nuclear war really does happen, man has no one to blame but himself.&quot;However, I was left at the end of the book feeling strangely unsatisfied. Any given part of the book was interesting and enjoyable to read, sprinkled with wry humour and subtle messages. However ... The fact that the three parts of the story are only loosely tied together, that the second part seems unfinished, and the bleak ending, leave me wondering what the point was. That mankind is evil and doomed to destroy itself? Or was it a warning against nuclear war (and if so, why bother having two)? Finally, I can't help thinking that the story of Leibowitz himself would have been more interesting than the story Miller gave us.Thus, I recommend this book as an interesting and I think realistic look at a post-apocalyptic world. And I think it's best read as a warning - just because there's little chance of full-scale nuclear war at the moment, it doesn't mean that man's aggressive tendencies have diminished, and we're very capable of destroying ourselves.","A Canticle for Leibowitz begins when nuclear warfare (aka The Flame Deluge) destroys the vast majority of civilization. Immediately following the holocaust, a group of survivors called The Simpletons wage a full-scale pogrom and book burning campaign against surviving scientists, politicians, teachers, etc. - those they feel were responsible for the war. The new Dark Age is called The Simplification, which lasts for many hundreds of years. A former physicist named Isaac Leibowitz devotes his life to the Catholic Church after the Deluge. Leibowitz is able to persuade the Church (whom The Simpletons leave alone to a certain extent) to protect whatever written material remains. After being turned over to The Simpletons by a turncoat technician, Leibowitz is killed and considered a martyr by the church. ACfL is a story that spans nearly twelve centuries centering on the abbey seeks to canonize Leibowitz, The Albertian Order of Leibowitz. The story is broken into three sections: Fiat Homo, Fiat Lux, and Fiat Voluntas Tua.Fiat Homo is about a bumbling young monk named Brother Francis who has a squabble with The Wandering Jew, who later directs Francis to a bomb shelter which contains a few papers that may have belonged to Leibowitz himself. Fiat Lux deals with a war about to be started by powermad dictator Hannegan, who is Idi Amin-like in his stupidity. The dictator's nephew is a brilliant scientist who hasn't quite come to terms with the fact his discoveries are actually rediscoveries. Fiat Voluntas Tua shows two warring societies about to make the same mistake that nearly destroyed humanity eighteen hundred years before.In addition to writing this brilliant novel, the late Walter M. Miller Jr. was in the same bombing raid that destroyed Benedictine Abbey at Monte Casino during World War II. This event I'm certain had much to do with Miller writing ACfL. ACfL brilliantly proves how no amount of technological progress exempts us from responsibilty for our deeds. When something bad happens, be it to us or someone else, we are not to say \"That's life.\" in order to lessen the load on ourselves. ACfL also points out how people have gone to downright atrocious extremes to reclaim Eden instead of accepting the world as it is. The closer someone comes to making paradise for themselves, the more miserable they become. In short, the problem is not technology. The problem is not God. The problem is us.","This is one of my favorite books. I read it years ago, and was stunned, then recently read it again and was positively shattered. It is beautifully written, and has a serious message to deliver as well. However, it is not exciting. If you are expecting a rousing romp through a post-apocalyptic world, don't buy this. It is a serious, heavy, and beautiful book and I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks they can handle it.","I first read this book over thirty years ago, after hearing Frederick Pohl on the radio say that if you only wanted to read three Sci-Fi novels, this was one (the other two were Dune and Stranger in a Strange Land). Having been raised an Orthodox Catholic during the time of bomb shelters, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the fear of godless communism, this book was a fair warning to mankind of what the future could become. Understanding the beliefs of the Old Catholic faith does make the story easier to understand but the messages are just as thought provoking to any one who will just ponder the story. There is no happy ending but a very real one instead.An earlier review stated that this story can inform our children and grandchildren what type of thinking went on during those grim days of the 50's and 60's. The story will also let them know what a real nightmare is to anyone who had to live under the fear of a nuclear holocaust where there are no survivors, only the dead and those who envy the dead: &quot;Lucifer has fallen!&quot;.","This is a long ranging story about post nuclear disaster world where the monks have retained the few scraps of pre-trepidation literature still left after the purge. Over the centuries that follow, the civilization begins to return and the order wrestles with the questions of the need to save knowledge for the future until the nuclear age again arrives. This is a thoughtful and well paced story. My problem with it is the lengthy lapses into Latin, a language I have no knowledge of or interest in. I felt left out and somewhat discriminated against by my protestant upbringing. Perhaps had I read the book and been able to skip over the lengthy Latin verses, I would have enjoyed the story more. I do feel that the Latin was not then translated to let me in on the content and that I must have missed many points and observations that one familiar with the language will enjoy.","This is an easy, &quot;must Read.&quot; My only disliking was the ending. I just feel it could have been alot stronger. This is a classic though and should be read by all.","I had never heard of Miller before (I guess he was too old for me), but when this book got into my hands, it held me for a very long time.The story is so familiar to the modern generation, but was the first of its kind, father of the fathers. Sci-fi of the origin!It all starts with a thing we all wait for, a nuclear war between the nations which innitiated and destroyed biggest part of the Earth. Few that were left had to look for refuge from the radiation... and so it goes.What's interesting is the approach author took to write the book. Book itself consists of three parts: part 1- Fiat Homo (no, that's not an obsenity of Italian car), Latin for Let there be man, see Bible, 2- Fiat Lux- Let there be Light and 3-Fiat Voluntas Tua - Let there be will (or Thy Will Be Done). While CREATING the universe, God said the same, but in opposite order. So if pronounced backwards, it would equal to the same as DESTROYING the universe. That's basic idea of the book.Starts with a man coming back to his minds after the great war.Continues with man getting back all the inventions and creating artificial light.Ends with....well guess.A reader who likes to see details will also understand that author is mocking our current civilization by showing how silly it looks when a Religious civilization tries to understand what scientific civilization was doing (in our case we are trying to understand what religious guys did, e.g. Sumerians).But if all that might seem not enough for a Sci-Fi fan, book is also field with a great humor, something that kept me laughing for days.Conclusion: Excellent Sci-fi book! Must read for anyone, not just Science Fiction freaks. Especially recommended to the kind of people who think science does not explain everything.Two Thumbs and a Toe Up!","This book is certainly a must-read for anybody at all interested in 20th century novels on atomic warfare and its potentials. The pro-Catholic slant is what sets is apart, since most sci-fi writers are anti-religious and carry union cards. The book might serve as the biggest intro. to the bizarre logicism of Catholic thinking anti-religious people will ever get, ironically. It was astronomically arrogant to include so many Latin sentences and not supply translations in footnotes or anywhere else. People should get even by just skipping the Latin completely on a first reading, for Miller must not have really wanted it to be read anyway except as an in-joke for others inside the CC. The saying is that the more the CC changes the more it stays the same, and that's the reality here too, that all science and technology and politics are just so much background scenery to the 'real' CC, and even if mankind blows up the planet, it will just send out spaceships and start somewhere else. So it is profoundly anti-science and anti-technology in its final message. I believe Miller really took Catholicism seriously when he wrote it, that's why his suicide in 1997 should be taken as his final belly laugh. The world did not blow itself up, the Communist party self-destructed even, but he gave up on his faith.Or maybe the royalties dropped. :) In sum, read it, and weep. Legite libre ad astra per aspera. :)","A Canticle for Leibowitz came highly recommended to me and justly so. I really liked the book and beleive that you must read it if you call yourself a SF enthusiast. But beware, you will not find high-tech adventure in this book. It is a path of morality with many other themes integrated into it. The author describes his characters' thoughts and actions very well.","Miller was one of the rare writters of SF to write one great masterpiece that is so good, that they rank his work among the Pantheon of great SF writters.This is the grand daddy of the Nuclear Holocaust novel. The ideas here have been gone over in several other SF novels, and in several movies and television shows. It is a sad statement that this has not been turned into one of those movies.Walter Miller is also one of those writers who felt he had to take his own life in the end.","This book is quite complicated and tedious. Not for the faint at heart. The first half of the book was excellent and very interesting. From there it became a chore to figure out. It might need to be read numerous times to actually figure it out but why would you?","Honestly, I thought it was boring. I didn't care about any of the characters - mostly because they weren't around long enough to develop into anything worth caring about. It is an interesting premise but this book was like going to a lecture on a fascinating topic given by an extremely boring person. It took something that could have been interesting and instead made it dull.I like to read and re-read many books, but I won't be re-reading this one.","Book was exactly what was advertised; good condition. It was shipped in a timely manner. Very satisfied with service.","This book is still incredible and incredibly prophetic 50 years after it was written. Monks try to preserve what is left of a culture after a nuclear war. The three sections of the novel each follow a different era in the history of the monastery. But in style and content-a science fiction story about a group of people trying to preserve knowledge after the fall of civilization told over several generations- is very much comparable to the Foundation series(also excellent). The main difference between these two stories is that the former is very much imbued with a Catholic worldview while the other has a more secular scientific perspective. Miller spend much of his own novel considering that worldview. One of the themes seems to be this:technological progress and moral progress are not synonymous. The same science that gave us all our modern wonders also gave us the capability to destroy it all in a nuclear war. Of course, the same could be said of the church. Perhaps that is Miller's one fault in the book. The church almost seems too perfect in this book. While Catholics believe Christ is perfect, that doesn't mean the church itself is always perfect(thought it is always guided by Christ to perfect itself). The same religion that gave us monks who preserved and revived learning also gave us the inquisition. In science, religion or any field, humans can make mistakes.","Certainly one of the greatest masterpieces of the 20th century. It hasn't been recognized as such because science fictions is (usually justly) not respected as literature. If you read only one science fiction book in your life, this is the one to read","Walter Miller was not noted for a long string of novels or great works, even though he had received some acclaim as a short story writer.. But, with this novel, he has accomplishe a master work. He has traded (in a philosophical and literary sense) a lifetime of good novels for the immortality of a masterpiece. Is this novel merely a popular fear stated of the Cold War? In a sense yes, but not &quot;merely&quot;. it is a sociological and religious statement on the nature of mankind. Much a precursor to the plot line of The Gripping Hand, this novel proposes the horrors of apocalyopse, the cyclical nature of developemnt, and the hope for something grander than repeating history.The literary style is captivating and moving, intellectual yet common. It is a work for the future written in a time of fear in the past.","I was only fourteen years old when I stumbled onto Walter Miller's forgotten masterpiece. Since, I've read it with some degree of regularity and consistancy.At my first reading, I fully appreciated the stonework that Miller layed in the concrete plot, but didn't grasp the rich symbolism which makes it a terrifying yet truthfulinsight on human nature. Miller has written a novel that unravels the horror of mankind's fate in a way that gives me the sense that our destiny, not only is one thatcannot be changed, but it is a destiny that should not be changed","A Canticle for Leibowitz is a 1959 science fiction novel by Walter M. Miller, Jr.; it won the 1961 Hugo Award for Best Novel. In the centuries after a nuclear holocaust, a monastic order works to preserve the remnants of scientific knowledge as civilization rebuilds. The book is comprised of three parts, essentially novellas, which take place in the 26th, 32nd, and 38th centuries, respectively.Miller's themes are prominent, and will be obvious to even the casual reader. Primarily, there is recurrence: Miller's novel spans so many hundreds of years because he is setting up a cyclical history for humanity, and the periods of his story reflect the focus and worldview of different historical eras. And there is the timeless issue of church versus state and faith versus reason: Miller's future generations explore the same theological and moral issues humanity has wrestled with all along.Many books in the postapocalyptic genre, when confronted with the issue of religion, dismiss, punt, or avoid entirely. But Miller addresses religion thoughtfully, respectfully, and satisfyingly. He focuses specifically on Catholicism, but his issues and points are applicable to Christianity broadly.Miller's story unfolds rather slowly, and the casual reader may wonder what the point is, exactly, of the book's first two sections in particular. Admittedly, they aren't always interesting on their own (particularly part two). But they are necessary to set up the book's finale, and they are a key part of the Miller's bigger picture.A Canticle for Leibowitz's third section is superior, not only because it features the culmination of Miller's buildup, but because it has an excellent protagonist. In part one, \"Fiat Homo,\" the bumbling Brother Francis is carried along by circumstances that develop the story with little force of his own. Part two, \"Fiat Lux,\" neglects character focus and is instead a rather obvious struggle between the church and secular science. But in \"Fiat Voluntas Tua,\" Abbot Zerchi is both a principle actor upon the story and a grounded, strong and well-rounded Christian figure, and he is eminently realistic. He is Miller's best character, and gives the book's conclusion some vital punch.In the end, A Canticle for Leibowitz is an always thoughtful and occasionally poignant look at the history, struggles and prospects of humanity.","I'm not sure why I didn't really like this. It had an interesting premise (Fall, rise, fall of human civilization) but it failed to grip me. It was somewhat difficult to read and relied too heavily on religious doctrine.","This is an examination of the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust and the struggle between religion and rational thought. Others have reviewed this in detail, so I'll just say that it's charming, sad, horrifying, and quite funny. I and most others I know who have read this consider the first part the best, but the other two acts have their charm as well.Other reviews here cover the book in detail, but from discussing this with other people who have read it, there are three major points to keep in mind:- This is dry humor, with no laugh track. It's counting on you to keep up. Do so and it will reward you. The funniest bits are the most understated. It will also help to be able to parse some basic Latin as there are a few untranslated jokes, but it's not required. You will also find many, many correspondences and references from act to act if you're paying attention.- The religious angle is very strong, but if you have a kneejerk reaction towards or against Catholicism, don't be blinded. The author himself was very conflicted and there is no 'winner' here. You will find much here to love and hate about both blind faith and progress at all costs, especially in the final act - and that's how it should be.- The Cold War mentality here is a bit alien now, but keep in mind this was written in the early 1960s when everyone was convinced imminent nuclear war with the Soviet Union was inevitable (in fact as far as I know this is the first major post-nuclear holocaust book, but I wouldn't swear to that). This is probably the most dated aspect of the book, but the other aspects are universal.This is well worth the read if you're old enough to comprehend it.","This is a gorgeously written, wonderfully structured book, which remains relevant despite its obvious Cold War inspiration. After a nuclear holocaust, an order of monks has preserved what they can of civilization -- it's a deliberate reference to the European \"Dark Ages\", and Miller carries it off well. Society rebuilds itself... only to fall into warfare once again.I found myself wanting to hear some of the stories mentioned only in passing here -- the abandoned and betrayed Laredan troops particularly caught my interest -- and that, I think, is a sign of good worldbuilding.The story is told in episodes, some hundreds or more years apart, but the characters are still quite engaging. Miller's writing is a little old-fashioned and expository, but is also clear, lucid and precise. The combination of powerful themes and understated language makes this book a genuinely moving one which, in my view, deserves credit as bonafide literature.","I read this book at the age of 12 first, and I thought it was great. But now, at the age of 20, when I read it again I found that it is one of the best SFs I know. Well, it consists of three parts, and three individual plots, only the imagined future and the scene are the same, but there is one idea connecting the three parts and making them into an organic one: the view of history, the chances of our future after a total atomic war, and the deep thoughts against the destruction. Well, and one more thing: I am a believer, a saved child of Jesus Christ, and I found quite valuable the thoughts connecting to religion in this book, although I am not a catholic, and I will never be one. But the role of religion in this people's life, the role in improving the human civilisation, and the questions about life or suicide in the last part about an atomic war are real. I don't know that Miller was a believer or not, but I am sure, that he wrote one of the best book, not just in the genre of SF, but, I think, in the &quot;high literature&quot;, too.","The only book published by Walter Miller, a Canticle for Leibowitz is a timeless morality play that applies today as well as it did in 1959. Though some of the technology alluded to in the book is outdated, it is vague enough to prevent this from &quot;merely&quot; being an excellent book from the golden age of science fiction.I would not have written a review at all if it were not for another review, which took its pro-Catholic stance as a reason to condemn it. Alas, this poor feminist of unknown gender did not understand that this was a book about a monastery (of monks0 and was expected to be lacking in women. A novel of a nunnery filled with male characters would have equally appalled me.But that is beside the point. The novel is excellent as it stands. It is not biased towards the Catholic Church despite the accolades from the Christian Science Monitor -- and I am sure that I can say that ANY Christian Scientist would be shocked to learn that their Protestant denomination is an arm of the Catholic Church! Instead, I would put it as slightly heretical if anything. The story of the cenobite on his pilgrimage is enough to cast away idea that this work is propaganda of the RCC. And, unfortunately, that same story, which contained a total of two characters, the aforementioned monk and the appearance of the &quot;Wandering Jew&quot; did not have an opening for a female character. Perchance she could have appeared when the holy monk was trying to stone the Wandering Jew for wandering too near...Alas, I will end this as my sarcasm ebbs. This really is a fun, irreverent book with a real moral: a moral about both nuclear war and the folly of forgetting one's past. All science fiction fans, even those who dislike golden age science fiction, should read this book.As for the sequal, St. Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman, I could not finish it. While it was being written some 30+ years after Canticle with a co-writer, Miller took his own life, but sequal was completed and published despite this event. The only good news is that the sequal did not ruin my love for the original.","I first read CANTICLE as a college freshman and have re-read it several times. I also got myself a first edition hardcover so I can pass it along to my children and grandchildren. This is truly one of the great works of 20th century literature, and as major a figure as Walker Percy thinks so too! It's curious that this book keeps getting classified as SciFi. Yes, yes, it is that, inasmuch as it concerns the aftermath of a nuclear war and the re-establishment of a technological society. But it is incalculably more than that!There are so many marvels in this book it's hard to enumerate them. It is first of all literate - beautifully written. Second, it's a wonderful story that can be read on many levels: as terrific SciFi, as a comedy, as a tragedy, or as both. There is a Greek tale of hubris, a Hebrew tale of the Wandering Jew; there is wit, good humor, hope. There are riches that can only be tapped in re-reading, which you will find it a pleasure to do. Get this book!","A Canticle For Leibowitz is a story about life in and about a monastery following a society-busting nuclear war. Isaac Leibowitz was an engineer during this war, and following the break-up of society he established an Order to collect and store whatever written memorabilia could be found. Eventually, he was caught and executed as \"one of them\" - knowledgeable people who must have been involved somehow in developing weapons - by the remaining people who called themselves, with pride, simpletons.But the Albertian Order of Leibowitz lived on. Six hundred years later, actual evidence of his existence was rediscovered, and Leibowitz was canonized as a Saint. Over hundreds of more years, the reinvention of the scientific process was combined with the ancient written records preserved by the Order. The result, eventually, was the development of space travel, and...Let's just say that author Walter Miller, Jr., didn't have high hopes of humanity learning its lessons.A Canticle For Leibowitz, as a story, has engaging characters, a span of over two thousand years, debates on the role of science and religion, sparring on ethics, and more.This is a classic end-of-the-world book. For a book written in 1959, it still reads very well, because we bomb ourselves back into the Dark Ages, and thus start over.Historically, I'd say inspiration for this book comes from that dangerous period that we call the Cold War. This book fits in with the other pessimistic books of that time period, such asOn the BeachandEarth Abides.","I had read \"Canticle\" ages ago as a teenager, but after reading \"The Day After Tomorrow\", a slam bang thriller that was fun apocalyptic fiction, I was tempted to re-read \"Canticle\" to compare it.Was I ever surprised.\"Canticle\" is the story, not of one man, but of humanity itself after nuclear war has utterly destroyed civilization. Mankind went through a frenzy of book burning after the nuclear holocaust, machines were destroyed, and only a few monks hidden in the desert were left to memorize old texts and save whatever fragments they could find.By the time the book begins, one of these monks, Brother Francis, stumbles across an ancient nuclear shelter. \"To find a bit of the past which had escaped both the bonfires and the looting scavengers was a rare stroke of luck\" (p 30).Miller works out humanity's destiny with brilliant logic and real insight into human behavior. So many of the apocalyptic books are fun, but never convincing because the author's never delve into what drives men.Miller mixes his story with plenty of humor. For example, towards the end of the book, which is many centuries after Brother Francis, another monk in the desert glares at his new electronic Autoscribe and complains, \"'Nothing could be that perverse without premeditation...It knows good and evil...and it chose the latter'\" (p 241).Miller's real question is whether or not humanity can avoid destroying itself again, once the nuclear genie is out of the bottle.Expect wonderful writing, symbols, deep questions, and one wandering Jew.This one is worth your time.","Saving clause:This review perhaps emphasizes feelings more than the actual events in the book. If you want a plain description of the plot there are other reviews at hand which does that job perfectly well.For me the most important part in any reading of a work of fiction is the feeling of presence. When I read I want to feel that I really are at the place which is described and feel the same way the protagonist does. When he sweats, I want to sweat. When he rejoices, I want to rejoice, and so on. That aspect works perfectly well in the first and third part, and that is well enough.On the surface the book describes the falling and rise of a civilization and all of its knowledge through the destiny of a church and its monks. You get to know different key persons from inside in three different periods. It is hard to succeed in creating \"heroes\" with whom you can identify using such a composition method, but Miller succeeds perfectly well here.The real protagonist, though, is the discussion which takes place between the author, the reader and the actual protagonist persons in the book when you read. In a way the narrative can be described as a union of things which we humans create, feel or do all the time: misunderstandings, hope, hard work, creating myths and living in accordance with them, striving for excellence, bizarre humor, moral discussions, and so on.The author succeeds in creating an atmosphere where you as a reader get the feeling that you are welcome to participate in an alternative world and take part of its rise and fall and the labors and joy of its persons. Said that, I've also mentioned the second most important part for me when reading a work of fiction: That the author clearly want to give you something positive instead of just remove something from you. (Your time and money for example.)This is not just good sfi-fi, this is good literature! The author creates a believable world, which you want to be a part of, and he gives you many good lessons about life from the best of his heart!","Canticle For Leibowitz is an amazing post-apocalyptic novel. A wonderful assessment of the human condition, the place of religion in despair, the cyclical nature of humanity. It is well written, well developed, and moving.Written almost 50 years ago during the height of the Cold War, it resonates on a new level today.Highly recommended.","As I looked at the cover I thought \"oh golly gee another post apocalyptic piece of crap.\" We all know the score for these types of books usually follows A. The Trials of an isolated community that has somehow become the last vestige of civilization or B. The chronicle of an army of survivalists attempting to reinstate what they see as the natural order of things.This was my understanding of what books of this type were supposed to be. I was (thankfully) incredibly wrong. Divided into three parts of 600 years or so first detailing the struggle of a post apocalyptic monastic order in a more or less dark age setting a renaissance setting and finally a post modern setting. What seems at fist to be a simple story about people who want to survive becomes something greater and more complex as the novel progresses.Will humanity ever learn from its mistakes or are we just doomed to repeat them for the rest of eternity?Can human knowledge ever truly be preserved? Is the cost of keeping hidden knowledge alive worth martyrdom?When we finally leave earth for the last time will it be to create a New Eden on some distant star or will we simply take our problems with us?Overall-Thought provoking and even though at times the Latin references can be extremely frustrating this is one of the deepest books I have read in years.","Do you know many science-fiction books that quote Latin? Where the heroes are monks and abbots? Where the protagonists argue over illuminated manuscripts? A Canticle for Leibowitz has an appeal well beyond science-fiction fans.Too much of it shouldn't be given away, but the story takes place after a nuclear war and concerns the fight to preserve what is left of human literacy and knowledge. Of course, this is about the need for spirituality and wisdom to balance progress in scientific pyrotechnics. But A Canticle for Leibowitz is first and foremost an utterly convincing political fable, interwoven with a host of private adventures and tribulations. And while nuclear holocaust may sound less likely today than in the 1950s, what is astonishing is that this book hasn't aged a bit, that it has none of the technological and contextual faux pas that makes so much of science fiction dated.Walter Miller wrote with authority, conviction and humour. His dialogue between churchmen is jaw-dropping in its veracity; I couldn't believe afterwards that he was never a priest or a novice. The novel's politics are as credible as they are subtle. Miller creates a reality in which you will find yourself completely immersed without wanting to leave it, however harsh it may be. My only quibble, in fact a major disappointment is that, incredibly, Walter Miller never wrote anything else.","After reading the many insightful reviews I just wanted to add my two cents and make a point that others seem to have glossed over. The great irony of this book is that the Church perpetuates humanity's destruction by preserving the scientific record. They then have the audacity to deny people the one relief that will save them from suffering. Miller portrays the individuals involved sympathetically but the book seems to be a clear attack on the the Church as an institution, with wider implications into abortion and other issues.","This is one of the classics of sci-fi or fantasy literature -- a post apocalyptic world that's been bombed back into the Dark Ages, complete with religious enclaves and bandits and unsafe food and roads and intrigues and terrible fear of all technology -- and St. Leibowitz is known to us by . . . his grocery list found on a scrap of paper. A TERRIFIC good story, thought provoking and masterful.","This book is well worth reading. Set in the future, after a nuclear holocaust on Earth, the ideas presented are compelling, and there is a slightly dark humor throughout all of the events. The development of religion and technology in the novel is interesting. I would highly recommend this book.","I have given away 6 copies of this book to friends/relatives. It has never been returned. One factor may be my Catholic upbringing, another my &quot;job&quot; as a nuclear weapons targeting expert. The book accurately reflects &quot;early&quot; strategic thinking in doomsday scenarios, and the hypothetical reconstruction scenarios are fascinating. The settings of scenarios, the feel of developing civilization, the development of scientific process are all noteworthy. This is my most &quot;given away&quot; book.","First read this book many years ago when I was 13, and thought I ought to re-read it again... It was the first book that I read in less than 24 hours, and it still holds up well today! Great commentary on society, and it was pointed out to me that apparently it was one of the first post apocalyptic sci-fi books... Really well written and also can be a great perspective for students of history! As great a read now as it was long ago!","Walter M. Miller Jr. tackles profound themes; that of science, or more precisely the use of science versus religion, man's inability to learn from the past, and the way the man seems condemned to repeat the errors of the past. This is done via the technique of a telling a story of a future patterned on our past and present, which becomes their past. The pattern is the fall of civilization and way in which monasteries tried to save as much of the past as they could. This is done in the form of three novellas. The first corresponds to the period of the \"dark ages\", just after the fall of the civilization of Rome, but in the case of the book after the fall of the 20th century civilization due to nuclear war and its aftermath. The second novella corresponds to a period of a renaissance, where the fragments of the past are being reassembled, understood and used to redevelop science and technology. The third novella deals with a subsequent era, corresponding to our own, where the errors of that past may be repeated. All these stories are told in terms of the Monks of Saint Leibowitz, a man who tried to save as many scraps of civilization (our present civilization) that he could. The primary protagonist of each novella is the ruling abbot and the actions deals with his attempts to preserve the bits of information that Saint Leibowitz collected and prevent their misuse. I recommend this book to all those who are looking for science fiction that is more than spaceships and aliens.The book is a somewhat depressing read as much of it is concerned with the euthanasia of the terminally ill and those born with horrible birth defects. The author gives the Church strong, but ultimately unsuccessful arguments against euthanasia. It is a testament to Miller's writing that these sections can also be read as opposing the Church's positions. Miller went on a lifelong quest to gain a spiritual understanding of life, entailing many shifts in his religious beliefs. Ultimately, as the introduction points out, Miller was a suicide, albeit almost forty years after the book was published, which underlines the generally pessimistic tone of the book.","Good, enjoyable SF. Always interesting and often funny, though no in a laugh out loud way. But also a serious satire with a somber message. &quot;Will we ever learn?&quot; seems to be the question this book is asking and it seems the answer isn't very promising. But this book is not about the destruction of mankind; it is about mankinds tedency to destroy himself but not to give up--to rise up again even if it's only leads to more destruction.","I have nothing but the highest praise for this book. It works so well at so many different levels - story line, dialogue, characterization, philosophical and theological asides. There are many powerful and memorable scenes in this story. If you are looking for a thoughtful and thought provoking story of the highest quality, don't miss this one!","I bought this book off a pavement shop. It was tattered. Still I acquired it as I have read praises about this work. I was not disappointed. Searing piece of fiction.Every nation's leaders should read this novel and bury nuclear madness forever.","A grim, yet uplifting tale of the canonization process of the Beatus Leibowitz. Overall, a great book.","I just finished it about an hour ago for the first time. I wish I would have finished the day I started reading it. It has left me doubting a great and many things, but I don't doubt that it will always remain the most thought provoking book I've ever read.But now I must go and think some more. Thanks to all the amazon.com reviewers who made me want to read this. I love you all.","I came to ACFL at college and have re-read it many times. The characterisation by Miller of a number of figures facing different but universal personal and religious problems strikes a chord in many friends who have also read this book. Miller's attention to detail is superb, even down to the careful amendments to the Litany of the Saints to reflect a post-holocaust list of terrors from which the sinner requests salvation. A book of hope about a subject of fear, I would recommend it to anyone.","Miller is as meticulous in character development as the illuminator of Leibowitz's work. By the time Miller is done the reader will have become intimately acquainted with these people. Yet with equal tenacity Miller is bold enough to let death visit upon his characters. In the end the reader is left mourning the loss of people met and rejoicing at the cycle of life renewed. Or perhaps dreading the renewed doom that Miller has woven us into again.","This is definetly my favorite book of all time ... frightening in the likeness it has to the modern world, and barely hopeful in that times will change, this is a warning book. One to be taken in and examined, not because it might appear farfetched, but *because* it might happen.Definitely a must read!","Spanning 1800 years this is a fascinating and scary 'tour de force'... that at its root has the purpose and spiritual necessity of the church in the world.About how it, for the secular world, becomes harder and harder to grasp the reality of God, as science and comfort become masters; about the death wish inherent in humanity, due to the consequences of 'original sin'.I'm normally not a fan of sinister works of fiction, but this has so much more... check it out!","I bought the Canticle for Leibowitz in 1960 (it was copyrighted in 1959). I have reread and reenjoyed this book over the decades always comparing the story to the changes in the Church (slow)and in computers (very fast). While modern computers rarely commit errors like double syllable writing (doudoubleble sylsylabablele), a frustated user can feel with the Abbot's wish to sell offending equipment to an atheist....and churchmen still like their long titles and honorifics.","I was introduced to \"A Canticle for Leibowitz\" by a literature teacher in 1968. Young as I was, it touched me deeply. Every time I reread it there is something new to find out about mankind and about how wonderful an author Walter M. Miller Jr. is. It is one of those books that change the way you face life. The old pocket book came apart and I couldn't live without a copy of it in my library.","I had to purchase this book for a mandatory college course. I found upon reading it that I quite enjoyed the work. It highlights disturbing aspects of the human condition. The book also has great entertainment value and the emotions it leaves its audience with range from chilling to touching. I would recommend this work.","This is classic Cold War SF and powerfully reflects the angst and political overtones of the era in which it was written. Reading it now is as much a history lesson as a flight through fantasy. If you'd like a comparison to something more recent just consider it a precursor to Joe Haldeman's Forever War. I enjoyed it immensely.","Very good book. Spanning 18 centuries of human future-history after an apocalyptic event, the scope is immense. Running throughout the narratives are some very deep philosophical musings on what it means to have self-awareness. To see the possibility of divinity and yet not be able to rise above petty everyday squabbles that can lead to ultimate tragedy. And yet, despite those tragedies and doubts, there is always hope that someday, as a species, we may find a way to grow up. That is what I took away from this otherwise mostly bleak, sometimes humorous set of stories.Recommended, (with the caveat that, since 18 centuries pass during the telling of the story, don't expect to get too attached to any of the characters).","The threat of total nuclear annihilation is not as omnipresent as it was when this book was written but the themes and story are still worth reading even today. Most sci-fi of this period deals with nuclear war so it is an overused trope of the genre but it is used in a novel way. The rebirth of the monastic system as a venue to protect the knowledge of the destroyed civilization is a great concept. This book is not technically a true novel but more like a trilogy of novellas showing the rebirth of civilization from the view of the abbey of St. Leibowitz and the struggle between science, religion, and politics. This struggle is the part that is most pertinent to today's readers. It provides no easy answers but provides interesting questions.","I read this book when it first came out and at least three times more since then. During those years I went from being Catholic to Agnosticism but my opinion of Leibowitz has never changed. I think it is a terrific book.I just read the one star reviews on Amazon and while I respect those opinions I feel they may be missing the point. It has nothing to do with religion which is merely a device to demonstrate the foibles of humanity. It is thought-provoking and if you get into it with that in mind...and not expecting Mad Max...you may enjoy it. I hope so and I do recommended it.","\"A Canticle for Leibowitz\" is a book that defies standard categorization. I suppose it has enough future-world, post-apocalyptic concepts that it falls in the science fiction realm, but it's not your basic laser beam and alien fare. This story goes much deeper.\"Canticle\" is made up of three stories that span thousands of years. Each story focuses on a distinct time period, looking progressively further into a post-apocalyptic future. The setting is the same abby in the American West, founded to protect and preserve the learnings of the pre-apocalyptic society. Specifically, they've developed a myth around a martyered scientist named Leibowitz.The first story revolves around Brother Francis who accidentally discovers certain original papers created by Leibowitz, including the blue prints for a technological device. The second story centers on a new technological awakening where future theorists come in contact with ancient (modern) technology. The sequence comes full circle in the third story as our future world is faced again with mutual mass destruction.Miller wrote \"Canticle\" in the late '50s when World War II and the atomic bomb were still visible in the world's rearview mirror and the cold war threat was very much a reality. Much of Millers discourse is on the cyclical nature of cultures and societies, the interconnectivities between religion and science, as well as death and politics. It's clear that much of the evocative emotion stems from Miller's time in the military and a youth grown up during a World War.The story is at times light and humourous but threaded with a very heavy and serious undertone throughout.The root story I found very interesting - how this future-world's archaeology is our modern world's past. I felt that the first two segments of the book were strongest and was only saddened that each couldn't have more ink themselves. In reflecting upon the discoveries of their past, and their promises of hope for the future, Millers writes, \"For Man was a culture-bearer as well as a soul-bearer, but his cultures were not immortal and they could die with a race or an age, and then human reflections of meaning and human portrayals of truth receded...Truth could be crucified, but soon, perhaps a resurrection.\"The development of religion, while always founded in christianity, morphs over the course of the story and we see a mythology grow over time. This book is successful on many levels...as simply an intriguing story with attractive characters, and as literature built upon a foundation of religion and war. It's solid story telling at its best, with heart, emotion and intelligence layered on top of the tale from start to finish.","Cycles: History occurs in cycles. That is the main idea Walter M. Miller, Jr. explores in A Canticle for Leibowitz. Taking place in three distinct periods; 600, 1200, 1800 years after the present year. The present year would probably point to mid-to-late 20th century. Through the novel, Miller explores human development and sees it as cyclical. There is always a Golden Age... followed by complete and utter destruction. It is sad in many ways as it implies humanity will always make the same mistakes. Though he does imply that with every cycle, humanity goes a little further in development.In many ways, I view this book as a compliment to Dostoevsky's chapter inThe Brothers Karamazov, \"The Grand Inquisitor.\" Why? The Catholic Church becomes the vanguard for scientific knowledge. Towards the middle of the book and recurring in the end, there is an argument over who should have this knowledge. Secular characters argue everyone should have this knowledge. The Church argues everyone should have it when they are \"ready for it,\" meaning when they have developed passed the conflict that drives politics and many human interactions. Other characters argue this is an unreasonable standard for anyone to follow. Eventually this knowledge becomes widespread again and as before... because humanity has not developed in manner that allows for peaceful coexisting, it destroys its Golden Age yet again. Why I see \"The Grand Inquisitor\" here is because of the criticism the Grand Inquisitor made toward Jesus Christ. God gave humanity and impossible road to follow; only a few could ever follow it. Thus the Catholic Church made a deal with the Devil to provide humanity with security... and they give their freedom to the Church and, thus, to the Devil.Here, you could argue that the Church has given and impossible goal to humanity, thus humanity develops in a manner that gives power to those powerful enough to enforce security and protection, commonly known as the State. However, with the State comes nationalism and nationalism taken too far becomes a source of conflict, especially when ideologies become dogma. Therefore, if we continue to make this decision as a collective... we are doomed to continually destroy ourselves. Miller does provide a sliver of hope in the end despite the sadness and tragedy of the end.","Had I expected to read I futuristic novel I could probably say better things but I was strangely dissappointed in the lack of more comedic aspects to the plot. When I read the back of the book it sounded like I would be reading something of a parady on the common misconception of what the world would be like after a second dark age. Over all after discovering the true content of the novel I was pleased with the characters and the setting but was bored with the dull dialog and changing time frame. The character Brother Francis was probably the best at making the story interesting next to the obnoxious Poet who, in his twisted perception, added greatly to the story at points when it didn't seem worth reading anymore. If you like science fiction and have some time on yourhands you will love this book.","I was forced to read this novel as part of a history of science course I took at univesity and I hated it. I kept the book, however, and picked it up again a decade later and thoroughly enjoyed it. Although the overt theme of the novel is nuclear annihilation the underlying theme of hope and re-birth provides as good a definition of what it is to be human as any I have found. This novel manages to be deeply depressing and uplisting while the plot and characterizations keep the reader engrossed. I have read it several times and intend to re-read it soon.","&quot;Canticle&quot; is amazing--from its delicately layered symbolism to its overwhelming waves of sadness and, eventually, hope. This book, enjoyable enough during the first reading, is one that you will want to read over and over. Miller's carefully built metaphors seem to become deeper and more complex with each new reading. You will long to have someone else read it just so you can discuss all the issues that emerge from the novel. &quot;Canticle&quot; is not to be missed.","I hope this doesn't give people the message science is bad. I think the book says science is a morally ambiguous tool. Need all sorts of voices in this world. This book may weird you out, but celebrate the diversity in the world. Good to hear alll sorts of voices in science fiction, besides techno-worshippers &amp; luddites.","I first read this book eight years ago (after meaning to read it for many years before that). Having just finished reading it again, I am happy to report that it wonderfully bears multiple readings. When one reminds oneself that this was written in the late 1950s, one is struck by Miller's prescience (though the world has not destroyed itself--yet). When one forgets the book's particular historical context, one is then struck by its timelessness. This is a marvelous meditation on the frequent foolishness of the wise, but it is something more as well. It reminds us that those who enjoy quoting Alexander Pope (&quot;A little knowledge is a dangerous thing&quot;) should not neglect, as they so often do, to finish the couplet: &quot;Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.&quot;","To the preceding review, I might add that, while the book has no footnotes translating the many Latin phrases, the Web contains many sites with study guides that do, and all free for the asking. The Latin is mainly quotes from the Bible, but it adds to your enjoyment to be able to understand it so use a search engine and download and save the translations before beginning your reading.","Miller reminds me of Bizet, the composer of the great opera &quot;Carmen&quot;. Both Bizet and Miller are essentially one-work men, but what a work each has created! Just as &quot;Carmen&quot; is recommended as an opera for those who otherwise hate opera (poor souls), so do I recommend &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; for those who otherwise hate science fiction (like me). It is a stunning book. I've read it several times, and our book club went crazy for it.","I first read Canticle 10 years ago on recommendation of a fellow bibliophile. It is an extraordinary, thought provoking view of a post-apocolyptic world. Humorous twists on our views of technology and religion as the mysterious Leibowitz looks down on his handiwork. A must read for all those enamored with technology or who question religious icons","There are literally dozens of post-apocalyptic fiction books to choose from. My review intends to persuade you to choose this one among your first.This book is really three different books, each set 600 years after the other. They require some description just to give you a sense of how expansive the book is--all in a mere 300+ pages.The first story is set 600 years after an extremely devastating nuclear holocaust. Civilization has been blown back into the Dark Ages. The story revolves around one Brother Francis who is a feckless and aspiring member of the Order of Liebowitz, a Christian sect in the future. The Order's job is to painstakingly preserve historical documents, much like how the Medieval monks preserved Hellenistic and Roman knowledge during our own Dark Ages. Early into the story, Brother Francis discovers an ancient fallout shelter during one of his fasting rituals and the story develops around his relationship with the Order and his tribulations.The second story is set 600 years after the first story; now civilization is beginning a Medieval Renaissance. Education is starting to revive and kings have their eyes set on conquest. This story primarily deals with the conflict between a brilliant, but arrogant, scientist set on rebuilding the world to its former glory and a wise, but physically frail, Abbot of the Order.The third story is, of course, 600 years after the second. Civilization has not only rebuilt itself to 20th Century standards, but now is capable of deep-space flight and robotics. This story describes a new pending nuclear holocaust and the moral conflict between Christianity and euthanasia.In sum, this is not just another science fiction novel, but a short epic into what humanity is capable of, both good and bad. Miller infuses his characters and scenes with life, running the emotional gamut from witty comedy to heart-wrenching tragedy. Best read in short bursts, this book will stay with you for some time as the question of humanity's potential is always a relevant one.","I had hear of this book many times in the past as one of the finer speculative fiction/ sci fi books ever written (and a Hugo winner). This book deserves its reputation. It is at times scary, funny, poignant, rediculous, and mocking of human nature and society in general. Mr. Miller makes several excellent and thought-provoking points throughout. Written almost 50 years ago (hard to believe), it holds up very well in the face of today's events. If I had to choose a negative it would be the numerous references to Catholicism. Not because I disagreed or found them distatseful, but because I am not Catholic and felt like I was missing or not understanding things because of my lack of familiarity with it. That said, it did not take away from this highly effective and enjoyable book. I highly recommend it and will read it again in the future.","What a pleasure to read again! This book of science fiction from a bygone era was marked as \"Used\" but its condition was superb. I had donated my original copy years ago and was delighted to have it back in my hands once more.","Push \"Mad Max\" and [[shudder]] \"Water World\" out of your thoughts. This book deals with humanity's struggle to recover after global nuclear war. An order of Catholic monks are devoted to preserving as much of the scientific and technical writings (others as well) of the pre-war civilization. This means protecting it from angry mobs, marauding tribes and warring nation-states as well as the rigors of time. Though for long centuries no one understands the concepts contained in the writings (which they refer to as \"Memorabilia,\" they faithfully preserve, copy and even illuminate the works.This book is in the genre of science fiction, but there is a strong (not off-putting, in my opinion) religious perspective. It's a meditation on human nature and history. Pessimistic almost to the point of humor, \"Canticle\" is a compelling, thought-provoking read.","This is a book that everyone over the age of 18 should read. Is humankind doomed to destroy itself? Rather than try to eliminate the weapons (or other things) that can destroy our species, should we spend our resources trying to populate other solar systems? Or would human colonies also eventually destroy themselves?Despite the seriousness of the subject of this book, it is at times very humorous.You'll need to either brush up on your Latin or print one of the translations that are available on the Web.Any person that has a \"library\" worthy of the name must have this book.","I first read this book in college for a class, and I loved every page of it. This is a great book for any thinking person who likes to ponder the human condition. I could also see how this novel has influenced other Science Fiction books and shows. When you watch \"The Deconstruction of Falling Stars\" [Episode 22;Season 4 of Babylon 5], you can connections between this episode and the novel A Canticle for Leibowitz","7 January 1991\"A Canticle for Leibowitz\"A SF type of book about the end of the world and afterwards. It has many deep impenetrable meanings in its facade of Catholism, manhood, feudal empires, et al. They read and talk Latin, but do not know English from before Armageddon.","Given that this novel tells a story spanning almost 2000 years, it's maybe not surprising that this is still a great SF book almost 50 years after it was first published.The central theme in this book is the self destructiveness of secular society, with the catholic church as an eternal counterforce trying to preserve wisdom through the ages. From today's perspective, it appears that Miller may have overestimated both the self destructiveness of society and the eternalness of the church: Less than 10 years after this book was published, the church mostly dropped the use of Latin, so the book's frequent use of Latin must come across as rather quaint even to fervent catholics.It's not clear to me to what extent this novel was intended to be an apologia for Catholicism. The church is portrayed as having a far more positive attitude to science than it had historically in the actual dark ages. Also, towards the end, the novel has a lengthy discussion of the church's position on voluntary euthanasia, which did not really seem all that relevant to the story (and which did not convert me to the Catholic viewpoint).None of this should destract from the fact that this is a brilliant science fiction novel which I highly recommend.","A splendid story of human disaster, survival, recovery, further disaster, and ultimate hope, well written and well told, unlike most religious-themed writings.Even devout agnostics like myself can read &quot;Canticle&quot; without feeling annoyance or spouting derision. It stands alone in that regard. Regerdless of what or who you believe in, do read it.","When the &quot;Canticle&quot; was first recommended to me the person said &quot;It is Science-fiction that anyone will enjoy&quot;. I am not a big fan of the Sci-fi genre. &quot;Canticle&quot; can only be losely defined as Sci-fi. It is more a study of human nature and society than anything else. The book covers very large spans of time which evolve, and yet remain completely unchanged. No matter what genre you prefer, if you are a fan of reading, this book is a must. Enjoy. (ps don't worry about all the latin, it is an aid not the substance of the story)","I am in Advanced placement english at Churchland High School in Portsmouth, VA.

A young acolyte stumbles into an old Fallout shelter and discovers the remains of what appear to be Saint Leibowitz's holy artefacts: shopping lists and papers of electrical drawings signed by the Holy One.Written in 1959 during the Cold War hysteria the painted future and how rituals can preserve human culture through faith of the Church must have been revolutionary. The writing has nuances, it is eloquent and prose flows nicely. The character of Francis, which starts the first part of the book, is humble monk, sweet and quiet. His monastery duty to preserve the found Leibowitz's holy artefacts are told like a meditative sermon. Many consider this book classic of the doomsday novels.One (1) star. You can easily read the first part of the book and appreciate the idea of technology being held by the church. The new Rome, the cast of brothers and abbots, Latin phrases and the small Benedictine Monastery at desert are all well versed but the next 400 pages are like doing a self pilgrimae; those who endure. For consumption of To-be literature professor or professional book critic to enjoy.","The prolonged conclusion in the book almost negates an otherwise brilliant work. The astoundingly uninformed portrayal of atheists is startling. The good parts have been sung enough by other reviewers, I presume.","Don't know why this is a \"classic.\" I read this in a science fiction class. EVERY student in the class hated it as compared to liking everything else we read.","There was nothing in this story that I found interesting much less exciting. Each of the three parts was more boring than the previous. None of the characters really stuck out. This could have done just as well as a short story. A very short story. The entire story is told from the sidelines. It does a good job of conveying the boring lives that the monks live though. Reading this book was just like the job Francis did making that golden copy of the drawing by Leibowitz which took him years to finish.I kept waiting for something interesting but nothing happened. I thought that maybe the schematic that Francis found would be the missing piece needed to create a nuclear weapon again but nothing so deep happened. There was the two headed woman thrown in at the end, but I didn't bother trying to figure out what she was for. The only thing that tied the stories together was the wooden sculpture of the saint that was created in the first part. But that was pretty weak.Overall, this book was a big bore. Choose sleep over reading this book, it is the better choice.","This is post apocolyptic garbage. No characterization, just politics. I reread it now anticipating a good work but I must have remembered another book. This is pure delusional ramblings. Politics are intricate and boring. Compare it to Lichtenberg or Butler or Brin's postman (the book of course) and it falls way down.","Its just hard. There is definitely nothing that is gripping me. Ok I did get past chapter 1 but nit far. I think I had gotten 50 or so pages in before announcing the futility. The concept sounds great but there is difficulty getting through the pages and pages of stagnancy.","I read this book maybe 20 years ago, and it was so painful, that I remember it's title to this day. If Amazon offered negative stars, mine would hit somewhere around -100.I'm a speed reader, and back then I was hitting something like 400 WPM, with a frighteningly good recall. So I'd burn through books during my lunch hour, and I love reading, always have.This is the only book that took me more than a month to read. It took me 4 YEARS to finish it. I'd lay it on a shelf, and hope my magic godmother would come down and turn it into a remotely interesting read. 4 years! I could only read so much before it became traumatically boring. But I slugged on, as there's only been one other book I've never finished reading. And that one I threw out of a 3rd story window.If you're a masochist unable to sleep and interact with human beings, you'll enjoy the book. Actually, I'm questioning your humanity right now. This would be a good book to torture political prisoners with. If I hated someone more than life itself, I'd chain them to a table and make them read this book. Throw this book into a book burning pyre and this damn thing would be the only book to survive. There is a special level of hell where they make you read this book every day for the rest of eternity. And all of this is just the iceberg of how I feel about this mutant horror masquerading as high-browed science fiction.BTW, I can't Remember the Title of the Book I threw out the Window, but I remember it Capitalized every Other word because It was Significant and Artsy.","TIME magazine, February 22nd, 1960 said Miller's dedication is &quot;a scratch where it itches&quot;, and intellectually speaking, so is his book. Also claimed to be &quot;a dull, ashy writer&quot;. Doctor George Kumler Anderson, in his &quot;THE LEGEND OF THE WANDERING JEW&quot;: too formless to be satisfying.","I bought this book with high expectations--after all, it has been highly recommended as a classic of science fiction. I couldn't finish it. The lack of women characters made it impossible for me to relate to the story. It may be a good book, but with so many other thoughtful science fiction books out there that more realistically include women, why bother?","A very good post-apocalyptic novel. A story that is clearly a cautionary tale about nuclear war. The book postulates about whether or not humanity can manage to avoid such cataclysms and the destructions of major civilisations, while also looking at the story of some local monks who work hard to try and preserve and recover knowledge to improve the situation.","The author does have writing skills, make no mistake about that. He's intelligent and knows how to make sentences. Yet his metaphorical expressions are rather fanciful and miss the mark. \"A skyherd of cumulus clouds,\" a fist \"exploding\" on a desk, a \"crawling\" desert, and so on, and we also had people \"grunting, hissing, chuckling, croaking, and howling\" words of dialogue instead of simply saying them. I could've accepted these flights of fancy with minimal annoyance, but the infernal and ever-present Latin expressions and the expositions of scientific principles had me wondering what the devil any of this had to do with advancing the story. Why did the author presume that the readers of this book would have a working knowledge of a dead language? And why the pseudo-scientific jargon in intervals? Did he just throw all of this stuff in to show the reader that \"hey, I know something you probably don't\"? Who the heck cares about monastic melodramas and the ritual routines of life in the cloister? You couldn't escape them in this book. I think the whole work, all three sections of it, could have been encompassed in a short story of 50 pages or less.But what was really missing, for this reader, was the face of Eve, to speak in bible-babble like the characters in this misdirected work. She's over one-half of the human race, and yet the only female presence in this book was the sadly deformed Mrs. Grales and the Lady Reporter, both of whom made short appearances in the last section. And oh, yeah, a brief tragic episode with a scarred young woman and her daughter, dying from radiation exposure. Otherwise, nothing but men, and all speaking and thinking in churchly Latin gibberish far too often. (Was the author a defrocked priest, an ousted seminarian or a monk who left the refuge of the monastery?) Why write a SF book centered in the monastic lifestyle?I read it because it was supposed to be some kind of SF classic, according to a few people. My conclusion was that it was a monumental waste of time for the author to write a book that delivered only a few fruitless hours for the reader. Did we really have to plow through so many pages cluttered with ecclesiastic drivel just to get the point that humans will continue to repeat the same calamitous mistakes? (That is, I presume, the theme or point of this whole effort.) Give me a break. Perhaps the reason they still sinned so greatly was because they had never outgrown the mindset that got them courting disaster in the first place, and somehow medieval monasticism doesn't strike this reader as a path to liberation for the human race.","This is a great book. I admit to usually liking post-apocalyptic books, but this one is in a class by itself. One suggestion: Read it with a dictionary. You could manage without it, but don't be satisified with knowing approximately what a word means. For this book, it's worth knowing EXACTLY. It will definitely deepen your understanding and appreciation of this work. I wish I could figure out precisely where the abby is, though... I'm not from the west; maybe if I were I'd recognize it. New Mexico or Arizona?","When I saw this book referenced on Mary Doria Russell's website - AND saw that she had written a new introduction to it - I had to buy this book. \"The Sparrow\" and \"Children of God\" are two of my favorite books.I agree with her that this post-apocalyptic novel has some eerie similarities to today's horrible \"Learning, knowledge, science and facts are evil and we should just spend money and listen to George Bush\" culture. One of the most telling quotes is this: \"To minimize suffering and maximize security were natural and proper ends of society and Caesar. But then they become the only ends, somehow, and the only basis of law - a perversion. Inevitably then, in seeking only them, we found only their opposites - maximum suffering and minimum security.\"But I think I missed many of the ground breaking aspects of the book. (Either that or I just read it in the wrong decade - which is often the case.)I certainly sympathize with the monks and their despair at Man's seemingly unrelenting determination to destroy itself...along with Man's complete inability to learn from the past. I sympathize with them and certainly agree with them...but I don't FEEL what they are feeling. There was a certain...distance to this book that kept it from having the impact that I expected.So I give this book a four star rating...yet will most likely not seek out the sequel.","It's after the atomic war, and the earth is in a new dark age. What organization take control in the dark ages. Yep, the Catholic Church. Only this time, for a change, the church is an organ of positive change, although still within the usual religious superstitions. This is dark, though, and the future is not a wonderful place for most people. Miller is an excellent writer, though, and he presents his ideas with great skill. I recommend this book, but religious people with no imagination will hate it.","Don't get me wrong, this does have its exciting moments that rival that of any thriller but the bulk is philosophical and political ponderings. Be prepared for religious intrigue and questions of character motives. If that is the type of book that you like then this is for you and you will not find it done any better.","An excellent book, to be sure, and a distant future that leaves one somewhat discouraged and terrified, and an interesting glimpse into the workings of a church in isolation, if not exile. But nevertheless a disappointment. It was recommended to me very highly, and it just never got to that high point. Nothing really happened. There didn't seem to be any message, any purpose, any great design. But I do love this, from page 265: &quot;When the world was in darkness and wretchedness, it could believe in perfection and yearn for it. But when the world became bright with reason and riches, it began to sense the narrowness of the needle's eye, and that rankled for a world no longer willing to believe or yearn.&quot; I suppose that's enough of a comment on religion for any one novel to hope to accomplish.","I recently read this book for my english class. After hearing all my friends, who had already completed the course, rave about how good this novel was, I was disappointed in the novel. I believe it is well written, but that it is not for everyone. It's shocking reality appealed to me, but I found the religion content to be a bit much. I believe, I could recommend this novel for the quality of the writing, but I myself will never pick it up again.","It may be a classic of SF, but I could not get through it. Found it dull and gave up about 1/2 through.","And one we need to read over and over again, or at least make sure our leaders read it! It is a beautiful text, full of lovely prose juxtaposed with indescribable ugilness (the hermit, the mutants). As someone raised Catholic, I could relate to the religiosity of this book and the reverence that true believers have; the gorgeous aspects of the Catholic religion (myths, saints, martyrs, and monks) are neatly tied up in this package, a safe haven away from the didactic preaching we Catholics have to endure from a hierarchy more interested in our sex lives than our souls. It has a lot to say about not only religion, but also about science and technology and how we must balance the scales of science to reach Utopia, not Armageddon. Are we headed toward our mushrooming deaths or are we ready to embrace science in its glory? Well, let Miller tell you his tale...","Easily one of the top sci-fi stories written. This is a classic. It fills in so many gaps that are present in mainstream science fiction novels. There is indeed room for faith amongst the development of a possible future for the world. The connection between past, present, and future along with the circular nature of our fate works so well in this novel. I will never forget even the minor plot character such as Lazarus.","\"A Canticle For Leibowitz\" represents not only the best of the \"apocalyptic fiction\" genre, but it is also one of the most unique, for two reasons. First, the story takes place in three unique segments over the span of about 1800 years. The first section corresponds roughly to the early Dark Ages, the second to the Renaissance (with the benefit of 20th century technology as an example) and the third to what we might expect of the 2200's barring self-annihilation. What links these otherwise disparate periods is the second unique feature of the book: the use of a Catholic monastery as the setting for the bulk of the novel. In much the same way that monasteries preserved classical thinking through the Dark Ages, so to does the Albertian Order of Leibowitz preserve 20th century learning, often to their dismay.This use of religion may strike some as odd, even sacrilegious, but it is a surprisingly effective vehicle for Miller's consideration of the morality of mankind. His purpose is to consider whether humanity's pursuit of knowledge comes at the cost of our happiness and our very souls. Only the backdrop of an institution as long lived as the Church would prove suitable for such an endeavor. Furthermore, while it's only fair to admit that I am Catholic, I don't believe that you need be religious, or even believe in God to appreciate this novel. Miller's arguments are more moral than religious; the monastery just provides a vehicle for his discussion.As for the story itself, it is absolutely fascinating, all \"big picture\" elements aside. One might think that a story told over such a great span of time would be disjointed, but that is not the case at all. Miller creates a fascinating picture of a world clawing its way out of the horror of nuclear holocaust. In the first section, the world has reverted to ignorance as the survivors of the war (the \"Flame Deluge\") have turned their backs on science and literacy in revulsion at what \"progress\" wrought. Only Saint Leibowitz, a former nuclear scientist, and his followers struggle to preserve learning. In the second section, mankind has begun its rebirth, and looks to the \"Memorabilia\" as a touchstone to progress. Finally, in the third section, mankind has once again placed itself above nature and is prepared to reap the horrors it has created. Yet even at this bleakest point of global d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, Miller sees hope. Technology is not inherently evil, in fact it's neutral, and while it does give us the power to destroy ourselves, it also gives us the ability to save ourselves and try to avoid the mistakes of the past. Hopefully, it will even grant us the ability to break the vicious cycle of man's fall from grace.Throughout the novel, actions in one era echo through the others, such that seemingly insignificant events take on great importance in later chapters. Often funny or ironic, and frequently sad, this resonance is Miller's way of trying to show there is hope in the lessons of the past, even as he predicts a bleak cycle of violence. At the same time, it is fascinating to follow the rise of political dynasties and the evolution of life on earth over 1800 years. Not only does Miller create an arc than spans two millennia, but he plugs in little asides and historical footnotes that bring great depth to his creation.\"A Canticle For Leibowitz\" is a powerful novel, rich in both story and moral and intellectual thought. It is a dire warning against mankind placing itself above nature, but it is also a fascinating, brilliantly conceived and executed story. It rightly ranks as a classic of the Cold War era, but is no less powerful for having been written 55 years ago. Whether you are looking for apocalyptic sci-fi, thoughtfully commentary, or just an enjoyable read, \"A Canticle For Leibowitz\" has it all.","I do not wish to add more substantial comments to the already long list of reviewers: this a classic, powerful, masterpiece of literature. It is about the interplay of political and religious power, and of science and ethics, posed in a very intense manner, particularly in the last chapter. I almost cried and some scenes haunted my sleep for some days, like the abbot's tomcat, refusing to die. I wish only to post a word of warning for readers whose first language is not english, like myself: it is not easy reading, both in terms of the vocabulary and the usage of the language. However, it is absolutely worth the effort as the novel is guaranteed to stir up your system of beliefs in the subject.","Upon the recommendation of my husband, I picked this book up at the end of the summer when I was searching for something... different to read. I'd attempted to read Leibowitz a few months ago, but school demanded much of my attention at the time, so I had to put it down. I wish I hadn't, in a way, because it's really a spectacular book. Set about a half a century after a devastating nuclear war, the book tells the story of an abbey dedicated to Leibowitz, a scientist and engineer of the twentieth century, who, upon the destruction of his world and life after the bomb dropped, became devoted to the Church and a bookrunner -- one who gathers texts to ensure the protection of history for the human race. Walter Miller's attention to detail and graceful prosiac style engaged me immediately in the story, and I knew I was hooked at the end of the first section when something incredible happens. No, I won't spoil it for you, because you have to invest the time and emotions just like I did to really feel the impact and continue with the tale. In two subsequent sections, each set some six or seven hundred years after its predecessor, the story continues to unfold as man rebuilds society following the Bomb. What I found most remarkable about this story was the investment and care Miller took in describing, with the utmost respect, various religious aspects of the story. Specifically, life at the abbey, the monks who reside there, and the moral dilemmas each must consider with regards to the Lebowitz papers... and progress. Ultimately, the question must be asked: does history really repeat itself or does Man? Read this book and find out? :)","Not your standard Science Fiction fare. A book that would NEVER EVER make it through to a small-time SF magazine let alone a major publisher today, far too Catholic (and unapologetically so) and one of the greatest books I've ever read. I think it's fortunate that I waited until my middle age to read this as I'd likely not have had the depth of understanding to fully appreciate all the layers of this. Unfortunately it's the kind of book that also makes me question why I even try to write at all, it's shown me again that the art has already been mastered and to \"abandon hope all ye who enter here\"... !A sampling: \"The closer men came to perfecting for themselves a paradise, the more impatient they became with it, and with themselves as well. They made a garden of pleasure, and became progressively more miserable with it as it grew in richness and power and beauty; for then, perhaps, it was easier to see something was missing in the garden, some tree or shrub that would not grow. When the world was in darkness and wretchedness, it could believe in perfection and yearn for it. But when the world became bright with reason and riches, it began to sense the narrowness of the needle's eye, and that rankled for a world no longer willing to believe or yearn.\"","This book is phenominal. Reading it takes strong reading comprehension skill. Even after grasping the story line, there are people studying the underlying meanings of this work to this very day. This can be read for pleasure, and re-read for thought. Worth owning, if a salvageable copy is located.","There is pretty much nothing new I can say that another reviewer has not already said, but I'll try. I normally do not gravitate toward Sci-Fi, but the underlying philosophical motifs in this book make it an amazing read. I think this is the only novel he wrote in his lifetime. Too bad, because this is a work of genius. If you are interested in the very dense philosophical version of Miller's central thesis, read Alasdair MacIntyre's book \"After Virtue\" (or, at least his 'disquieting suggestion'). Or, if you are trying to understand After Virtue, read A Canticle for Leibowitz. There. How was that for something different?","A difficult book to say the least, A Canticle fir Liebowitz is, as several reviewers have stated, deservedly a classic. Taking the reader through three eras in a post-apocalyptic society, it is as thought-provoking as they get.For a \"ligher\" (as much as you can use \"lighter\" inthe context of thermonuclear war) I would recommend Alas, Babylon by Pat Frank (also available from Amazon).","Walter Miller was obviously a very intelligent man and this gem is less well known than it deserves to be. Miller combines humor, religion, and archaeology with a plausible end of the world doomsday scenario. There are bright moments but the novel ends depressingly with mankind destroying itself (again) after two thoudand years have been spent recovering from the previous end-of-the-world event. The story is entertaining despite having a unusual structure of taking place over a two thousand year period. The only constant is the monastery of Saint Leibowitz and the piety of the monks cloistered therein. Like the monks of medieval Europe who preserved and transmitted some of the knowledge of the classical world, the monks of Saint Liebowitz carefully preserve scraps of information from the vanished world of the late twentieth century. Just as the Renaissance was brought about by renewed interest in and discovery of relics of the classical world, in this book the rediscovery of the technology of the late twentieth century century brings about a second Renaissance. The only downside is the pessimistic ending, reflective perhaps of the inner demons that led Miller to commit suicide many years after writing this book.","I can't add much to what previous reviewers have already stated. A Canticle for Leibowitz deserves to be mentioned along with the greats - Foundation, Hyperion, Ender, Dune and Stranger In A Strange Land. What many authors were able to accomplish across multiple volumes, Miller accomplishes in one intricate novel. And while its `science fiction,' Miller's story is based on emotions, faith, belief...things that are of value not only in the world he creates but in ours as well.","This novel has virtually everything I enjoy in a book. Comedy, tragedy, religon, science, symbolism, epic plot. It is pessimistic about man's nature, but optimistic about our salvation (both spiritualy and physically).","Now that it seems most science fiction authors are mainly interested in writing 800-page books (and usually as part of a series of books), &quot;A Canticle For Leibowitz&quot; is that less common form of the genre: a meditation on humanity, science, and character. If you are more interested in story than in overly-detailed pseudo-scientific, engineering-manuals-disguised-as-novels, then this a book worth reading. I read it as a boy, and re-read it 15 years later, and was still deeply moved. Very few of the hundreds of science fiction novels I've read remain with me. This is one I treasure.","This book goes around in a circle, but somehow it manages to cover all the big issues of life in the process - religion, politics, end-of-life issues, war, and faith.I have recommended this book to my entire family, and I recommend it to you as well.I love the character development of this book - all of the characters are believable, and each has his own unique viewpoint on things. Miller just sits back and lets them all duke it out in the book.The central message is still just as relevant today as in the 60s - unless humans can accept that there are lines we shouldn't cross, we will pay the consequences.Read this book as soon as you can get a copy. But not mine - I'm re-reading it right now.","I had heard of this book a long time ago and knew somthing about the plot. I went into the book with high expectations, as I had always heard this book was a classic. For the most part I was not disappointed.The book centers around a monastary established following an all-out nuclear war. Not only did the bombs destroy the physical accomplishments of civilization but the survivors reacted to the holocaust with an utter hate towards science and the written word. Leibowitz and others like him saved some of the books from destruction but at a heavy personal cost. The Church came to be the collector and preserver of the old knowledge, just as they had done following the end of the Roman EmpireThe book looks at three points in history: the Second Dark Ages, the dawn of new renaissance (which ironically will also see considerable warfare) and mankind's return to space and the danger of another nuclear war. A little slow at times it is still an excellent work and I recommend it.","What an amazing read- truly a great novel with an amazing plot. Lots of information to delve into and keep you wanting more.","Great book! I was assigned this book for a class on Medeival and Modern Apocalypticism. A classic in apocalyptic literature. Definitely a re-readable book.","I first readA Canticle for Leibowitzin 1974. It is post-post-Nuke, perhaps the greatest post-catastrophy book ever written.I just read the Wikipedia article on \"Canticle\" and was very surprised by it's reputation.Miller's writing style is very spare - the reader is free to create as much personal imagery as desired. His ironic humor is bone-dry and very pointed, making it all the mroe amusing. \"Canticle\" can be read rapidly and superficially, but deserves some additional think-work from the reader.I recommend with top marks.","Winner of the 1961 Hugo award for a very good reason --it is a riveting read! I read this book in 2 days, couldn't put it down.","Excellent read. Makes you think. Well worth the time to read. I'm not a big fiction reader but this one is good. Couldn't really happen. Right?","Loved this story when I read it as a kid and it's still fantasticWith this cd version I can listen to it while commuting","This book is one of my favorites. It's a tale of hardship, loyalty, danger, and humor. It's also a tale of monks of the order of Leibowitz.This book is one of the best made and won't let you down.","Frustrating because the author painted some great scenes that I will always remember, but I hated wading through all the psychobabble and religious claptrap.","I don't know if it was the 1950's style writing or simply the slow story but 50 pages in I was so bored and had to put it down and move on to \"The Passage\" (an amazing novel!). My husband read this one and thought the ending left too many gaps unanswered and simply just ended. It reminds me of one of those 'art films' where there is no true closure and you wondered why you just spent the last 2 hours watching something horrific that was pretty crappy. (like Shame) Perhaps I'm just not 'intellectual' enough, but I doubt it. This is a poor excuse for a book posing as some timeless novel.","This book belongs on anyone's list of top 10 science fiction novels. In three episodes, divided by centuries, it tells a post-nuclear apocalypse story of the resulting dark age and slow recovery of civilization in North America. The story is anchored by the presence of both the Wandering Jew and of St. Leibowitz, a pre-apocalypse TV repairman (and his wife/girl friend(?) Em), elevated to stainhood by miraculous interventions. A must read - but ignore the sequel - St. Leibowitz and the Wolf Woman - it is a very poor piece of work.","A shame that Walter Miller wrote so few novels, because his writing and characterizations are superb. But perhaps that's the way it should be - at the expense of quantity, the author produced only the finest quality.This is the second time through Canticle for me, and certainly nowhere near the last. There are enough themes, issues, and ideas in here to hold my interest for years to come. This time around I found the description of the Simplification and the Simpletons to be particularly poignant, especially in the light of the recent election. Miller presents us with a populous fed up with intellectualism, education, science, and generally anything that smacks of intelligence on any level. Their anger stems from fear, the basic fear of that which they do not understand and do not want to understand. Flip forty years forward, and some half of the American population rejected a presidential candidate who was intelligent and well-educated; they not only resented his intelligence but also distrusted the man. They chose instead a man who is very amiable, very non-threatening, and shows no open display of intellect. Somewhat frightening to me, at least, that our society already and still harbors an intense distrust of the intellect.Next time I read this book there will be a new lesson to find. I hope you find the book equally enlightening.","The writer uses subtle influence techniques. An example is the time the book enters doubts into readers mind on the ability of monks to accurately record written history by manually copying texts by hand. The writer assumes the reader accepts that the Bible, being copied over the centuries by monks, is subject to copying errors, and such errors would occur also with any monks of the future. However, recent archeologolist discoveries have proven this modern assumption of the monk's 'copying skills' false. More subtle implications continue with references to mercy killing being deemed evil by the church, in opposition to 'modern societal values'. Also, the writer, through characters' dialogue or sub-plots, has an assumption that science and Christian religion are opposites. This is simply not the case in the real world. And interestingly, is not implied in the book as often as some other book reviewers claim it is. I did notice the writer seemed to drive home a point to recognizes that 'man-made' morals (humanism) are evil, or lead to evil.","I just again finished reading \"A Canticle\", having read it a number of times over the last couple of decades. It's truely a magnificent book: entertaining, well written, concise, inspiring, and extremely though provoking. I highly recommend it.","Strange. Very strange. My son had to read it for his AP English class, he asked me to read it with him....ugh, I see why....hard to get.","While I don't regret picking up the book, I just didn't find it the page turner that some do. It seemed disjointed to me and when I finished the book I felt unfilled. While I can appreciate Miller's struggle with reconciling science and religion, the final product didn't deliver as I had hoped.","I am still wondering what is considered so good about this book. I feel fairly well versed in SF and this one ranks as low as the last few books in the Dune series. There were interesting flashes in the book. The idea of technology being held by the church was fairly interesting, but never panned out for me. Thon Taddeo's visit had my interest, but lost it because nothing that interesting transpired. One thing I will concede, the literary level was high for SF (no, I am not just saying that because the book contains Latin). I hope that you are enjoying, enjoyed or will enjoy it more than I did.","I grew up reading sci-fi but until I saw NPR's list of the \"TOP 100 SCI-FI/FANTASY BOOKS\" I'd never heard of \"A Canticle for Leibowitz\". It's a fantastic book and extremely well-written. This is literature, not pulpy kid stuff. When considering how sophisticated the story is it's surprising -and disappointing- that this is the only novel the author published in his lifetime.(There is a sequel but it was published posthumously and, though I haven't read it, it seems to be regarded as inferior.)","This is some of the best post-apocalyptic science fiction I have read. The three sections of the book offer snapshots of life in a Roman Catholic monastery approximately 600, 1,200 and 1,800 years after nuclear holocaust which resulted in environmental devastation and anti-intellectual riots that virtually destroyed civilization. The brotherhood's attempts to preserve and rediscover lost history and science is a dark, occasionally humorous, mostly depressing look at religion, science, and the depravity of mankind.","Its really hard not to like this book, I bought it and devoured it and its been getting passed around my circle of friends like a .....good book. You won't regret it.","This is a very dark book. How could a post-apocalyptic apocalypse be bright and cheery, really? It has a real feel ofEarth AbidesandOn the Beachto me. This book explores the long-running struggle between science and religion. The main players are monks and abbots. But in this shattered world, the church is also the repository of science. Come to think of it,Anathemcomes to mind, but is much more upbeat. By the end of the book, there is hope, yes, but we are also shown that man is just predisposed to destroy himself over and over. Don't get me wrong; I loved this book. But it is not a feel good kind of read. You must read it, though. You can't consider yourself as being well-versed in sci-fi if you don't. And it's a great book regardless.","Though this book was written over 50 years ago, its questions about knowledge, ignorance, power, violence, faith, strength, weakness, and redemption are as relevant as ever. But relevance is not the only reason to read the book. It can be read simply for the beauty of Miller's writing and his meditations on faith, reason, and the role of the institutional church (Miller was a Catholic convert). The story takes place during three eras, with a gap of roughly six centuries from one to the next. But by frequent reference to the 20th century's apocalyptic Flame Deluge (a nuclear holocaust resulting from the suspicions and greed that accompany power), the effective time span of the novel is roughly 1800 years. Ostensibly the story of a remote abbey in the southwestern part of what was once the United States, whose monks are dedicated to the mission of preserving remnants of the learning achieved by the last pre-apocalypse civilization (i.e., ours), the tale begins as the monks are awaiting the results of their application for canonization of their patron. The Blessed Leibowitz (ultimately Saint Leibowitz) was an electrical engineer who survived the Flame Deluge and devoted the rest of his life to preserving knowledge through the dark time of the Great Simplification, the term used to describe the thorough and violent reaction of most of the surviving population who blamed not only their leaders but the knowledge they utilized in destroying the world. The Simplification was aimed at minimizing the possibility of another destruction by finishing the work of the first destruction: eliminating books and other carriers of civilization's collected knowledge, including its scholars. The first chapters of the book are set in the 26th century, a time when there is no electricity, no motorized transportation, no rapid communication. In this environment, the monks of the Order of Leibowitz are the guardians of the Memorabilia---bits of books, scraps of paper, diagrams, anything that survived the destruction of the wars and their anti-intellectual aftermath and that might provide clues about the development of knowledge (especially science). In the second and third sections, set in the 32nd and 38th centuries, respectively, Miller explores two primary questions: Is mankind doomed to a constant cycle of self-destruction, fueled by the lust for power? (A corollary question is whether or not the human race can continue to rebuild from whatever is left from each cataclysm.) And what is the role of organized religion---specifically the Roman Catholic church---not only in preserving knowledge but in acting as a conscience for a society that doesn't really want to listen to it? This latter question becomes especially potent in the last section of the book, when both of the roles that the story reserves for the church are taken to their logical conclusion, one on a cosmic scale, one on a very personal scale. Although the Leibowitzian monks are happy to make their own knowledge trove available to investigators (much of the second part of the book concerns one such episode), in the end, one cannot help feeling a sense of futility. Given man's warlike nature, the futility does not lie in dedicating one's life to preserving knowledge. The futility lies in thinking that any amount of knowledge will curb the corrupting drive for power, and the destruction that (inevitably?) comes in its wake. Is it also true that no amount of faith will adequately shield against compromise or simple human weakness?","A Canticle for Leibowitz is a 1959 science fiction novel by Walter M. Miller, Jr.; it won the 1961 Hugo Award for Best Novel. In the centuries after a nuclear holocaust, a monastic order works to preserve the remnants of scientific knowledge as civilization rebuilds. The book is comprised of three parts, essentially novellas, which take place in the 26th, 32nd, and 38th centuries, respectively.Miller's themes are prominent, and will be obvious to even the casual reader. Primarily, there is recurrence: Miller's novel spans so many hundreds of years because he is setting up a cyclical history for humanity, and the periods of his story reflect the focus and worldview of different historical eras. And there is the timeless issue of church versus state and faith versus reason: Miller's future generations explore the same theological and moral issues humanity has wrestled with all along.Many books in the postapocalyptic genre, when confronted with the issue of religion, dismiss, punt, or avoid entirely. But Miller addresses religion thoughtfully, respectfully, and satisfyingly. He focuses specifically on Catholicism, but his issues and points are applicable to Christianity broadly.Miller's story tends to unfold rather slowly, and the casual reader may wonder what the point is, exactly, of the book's first two sections in particular. Admittedly, they aren't always interesting on their own (particularly part two). But they are necessary to set up the book's finale, and they are a key part of the Miller's bigger picture.A Canticle for Leibowitz's third section is superior, not only because it features the culmination of Miller's buildup, but because it has an excellent protagonist. In part one, \"Fiat Homo,\" the bumbling Brother Francis is carried along by circumstances that develop the story with little force of his own. Part two, \"Fiat Lux,\" neglects character focus and is instead a rather obvious struggle between the church and secular science. But in \"Fiat Voluntas Tua,\" Abbot Zerchi is both a principle actor upon the story and a grounded, strong and well-rounded Christian figure, and he is eminently realistic. He is Miller's best character, and gives the book's conclusion some vital punch.In the end, A Canticle for Leibowitz is an always thoughtful and occasionally poignant look at the history, struggles and prospects of humanity.","Six centuries ago, the world was destroyed in the Atomic Flame Deluge, leaving humanity scattered and broken and the world infested by radiation and mutations. One of the few surviving points of continuity to the old world is religion, with the Christian Faith surviving in the form of isolated monasteries and a 'new Rome' that has arisen in the east of North America. When a monk discovers relics dating back to before the nuclear war, a chain of events is set in motion that will reverberate down the centuries.A Canticle for Leibowitz is a central text of the classic science fiction canon, originally published in 1960 and winning the 1961 Hugo Award as well as a slew of other awards down the years. Unusually for an SF novel, especially one published at that time, it has won significant acclaim from mainstream literary circles, impressed with its grappling of themes such as religion versus science and its assessment of the cyclical nature of humanity's ability and willingness to destroy itself. Whilst there has never been a filmed adaptation, the book's structure and some of its ideas directly inspired an episode of Babylon 5 called The Deconstruction of Fallen Stars which also addressed some of the same themes.Leibowitz shares a common premise with Asimov's Foundation sequence, with its band of educated men seeking to preserve the knowledge and wisdom of a prior age through the barbarian dark ages of ignorance and fear until civilisation arises again, although the book lacks an analogue to Asimov's psychohistory. The monks of Leibowitz also have themselves little idea of the worth of the knowledge they are protecting, with complex technical schematics stored alongside shopping lists and betting slips. Still, the information they are guarding eventually gives humanity enough clues to begin its rise to technological greatness once again.Leibowitz is a 'fix-up' novel assembled out of three short stories, set 600, 1,200 and 1,800 years in the future respectively, with corresponding shifts in cast and the technological levels of humanity. Each of the three sections addresses different but related ideas, such as faith and belief in the first part, the seductive nature of technology and power in the second and the clash between religious morality and common morality in the last part. For a novel written in the late 1950s, this book touches on many topics that remain contentious today, such as euthanasia, abortion and the relationship of Church and State. Miller supports no sides, but uses his characters to make compelling arguments on both sides that provides much to think about. The book also has deliberately, even powerfully ambiguous moments (particularly revolving around a recurring character and events involving a mutated woman near the book's end) that introduce huge potential for debate and multiple layers of interpretation to the book.Leibowitz's literary qualities are founded in excellent writing, strong characterisation (with only 120 pages or so for each part, Miller gives us several memorable and impressive characters per section) and an excellent sense of humour (often very black indeed). Unlike some of its contemporaries, Leibowitz has not aged or dated itself at all, and like Non-Stop, The Stars My Destination and Lord of Light remains a compelling, essential read from this era of SF.A Canticle for Leibowitz (*****) a rich, funny, dramatic, dark and thought-provoking novel. It is available now in the USA. There is no current British edition (for the time being anyway) but the book is easily available on import or second-hand in the UK. Walter M. Miller sadly took his own life in 1996, but a successor volume, Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman, was completed and published with the help of Terry Bisson.","Science fiction writers often steer clear of religion in their works, partly because of the mistaken belief that science and faith are incompatible, and this is a shame, since the relationship between faith and science can be a strong and interesting one. \"A Canticle for Liebowitz\" brings us a post-apocalyptic world where the remnants of science become intertwined with faith in a most fascinating way. Liebowitz, a figure who in this world has become the focal point of myth, was once an engineer, and represents the world we all know: technological, worldly. But for those who have survived Miller's apocalypse, new meanings are needed to explain their world, and its relationship with the old.What is most interesting about \"A Canticle for Liebowitz\" is the fact that the monks who have gathered and maintained Liebowitz's relics ask the same questions that those who seek answers through faith always have, and as a result their journey is more familiar to us than we might expect at first. Miller succeeds on many levels with this book: rather than making action the focal point of the story, as science fiction novels commonly do, he focuses on broader themes. The novel has multiple protagonists, which again is unusual in the genre.The themes of this story are woven together well. They include the relationship between technology, which tends to be inventive, and religious dogma, which is skeptical of such innovation, the relationship between politics and religion, with each attempting to use the other (often with negative results), and the very nature of human history; are we condemned to repeat the mistakes of the past? Miller's novel wrestles with these, and makes us wrestle with them too. This book is worth reading and then re-reading.","There are certain classic science fiction novels that everyone with any claim to being an sf fan absolutely must have read -- and this is one of them. Now fifty years old, it's still one of the most original and most literary post-holocaust novels every written. The setting is the Utah desert a couple of centuries after everything ended -- and we're never told how, but given the era in which Miller was writing, it's easy to imagine. For all that civilization has mostly failed, the Catholic Church has just kept on going, and Brother Francis Gerard is spending Lent as a hermit in search of a true vocation. He stumbles upon a fallout shelter (no one is sure any longer just what sort of beast a \"fallout\" is but it's probably unpleasant) and a sealed metal toolbox which turns out to include a grocery list and a couple of electronics blueprints signed by the Blessed Leibowitz -- the patron of Brother Francis's own monastery. His life become wrapped up in copying one of the blueprints on vellum as a gift for the Holy Father, but only tragedy follows. That's only the first part of the monastery's story, however, as the world tries to climb back up out of the abyss. Will it all come to an end again? Because this is a cautionary tale, written with gentle humor and fully realized characters. I read this book in high school when it was first published (one of my English teachers was a secret sf fan) and it had such an effect on me that when I decided to publish a fanzine a two decades later, my first choice as a title was THE POET'S GLASS EYE. If you haven't read this book, do so. Immediately. If you have, but it's been awhile, read it again.","I read this in Fantasy and Science Fiction.

This SF novel deals with mankind and how we insist on &quot;evolving&quot; (intellectually, economically, technologically) only to lead ourselves to destruction time and time again. It is an excellent piece of literature that deals with nuclear destruction and why the &quot;meek&quot; inherit the Earth. Are we destined to fall as a species...? Read and find out.","I found myself thinking about Ecclesiastes 11: 1-11 many times throughout this novel.\"Is there anything of which one can say,'Look! This is something new'?It was here already, long ago;it was here before our time.No one remembers the former generations,and even those yet to comewill not be rememberedby those who follow them.\"The author has created a book that seems to me to be based on the supposition: \"what if?\", or \"maybe, like this...\", and then proceeds to connect the dots in an interesting, albeit dialogue-filled and character-driven chronology. The book displays characters that have a 'true faith' in their beliefs while at the same time allows for some (perhaps justifiable) speculation, although they flirt closely with some heresy at times. I was myself amused at how important Leibowitz had become to the story, especially when his former life is mentioned in passing as it related to the story. Less focus was placed on Jesus by the monks in the story (maybe intentionally?) although they did mention Jesus as Messiah when speaking about him, which must be taken into account.I found myself shaking hands with the author, while at the same time keeping him at arms length. It is such a unique book, one that presents ideas I may have even accidentally thought about before. I wondered that no one had written something like it before.Not what I expected, but worth reading","Powerful book, this, despite the irony that fifty years after it was first published, nothing remotely close to its apocalyptic vision of nuclear holocaust has yet occurred or even seems likely. Not even with the Iranian push for nukes.There is another irony about this classic SciFi tale (which is only really SciFi at the end and then space opera not hard science) and that's the lengthy and inspired Catholic discussion about how even people dying in pain should not offend G-d by taking their own lives. Then, Googling, one discovers that the author killed himself.Nevertheless, his book is a wonderful read, thoughtful and challenging, from beginning to end. With plenty left to chew over long after the last few paragraphs are done with. I love the fact that it takes place in Texas, with Texarkana, Pecos and Laredo in starring roles. I think I can see why he did not write a second one until forty years later and it never equaled the first. The lit crits must have smothered him with love. Then, being a World War II combat vet, he had PTSD guilt to deal with, also. R.I.P.","\"A Canticle for Leibowitz\" is a post-nuclear holocaust drama set primarily within the walls of a Catholic monastery in the middle of what was once the United States of America. It is divided into three parts, roughly six centuries apart, beginning about six hundred years after a global nuclear event. The story finds the monks of a religious order striving to preserve knowledge and culture (as had been the case in the middle ages) in the hope that it will benefit humanity at some future date when mankind once again attempts to establish an ordered and (hopefully) just civilization--at least more ordered and more just than the last. The question which pervades the story is this: Is all knowledge good and therefore worthy of preservation? Or is it possible that the use (or misuse) of some knowledge has led humanity to nearly annihilate itself?The story is brilliant, down to the final detail. Miller's work is a reflection on humanity's struggle for objective \"progress\" while, due to his fallen nature, inevitably digressing into a subjective relativism which--though under the guise of service to mankind--is actually oriented to the service of self. Miller's grasp of the nature and purpose of the Catholic Christian Church is exceptional (Miller converted to Catholicism after serving in World War II), and his reflections demonstrate the applicability of \"old\" (traditional/universal) Christian principles to new scenarios and circumstances. \"Canticle\" also shows the resilience of ancient heresies in their ability to resurrect themselves with newer, more \"sensible\" packaging. Miller's characters even muse on the fact that good intentions entered into with complete sincerity are still not sufficient to render an act as \"good\"; as the Abbot of the monastery reflects, \"Perhaps Satan was the sincerest of the lot.\"I find no weaknesses in this book to speak of. Some have lamented upon the relatively frequent use of Latin (which is not always translated), though usually its meaning can be gleaned from the context (the reader can also find translations using a search with \"Leibowitz Latin translation\"). Others have attempted to dismiss Miller's reflections and even Catholicism itself due to the fact that Miller--who suffered from clinical depression--took his own life decades later. This misses the point entirely; humanity's nature is fallen, and even knowledge of the Truth is not sufficient--it is a day to day battle, and in moments of weakness, any of us can succumb to the darkness.I would not only identify \"A Canticle for Leibowitz\" as a good read, but a MUST-read for anyone interested in the so called \"post-apocalyptic\" genre, but even more so for those who themselves desire a deeper reflection on humanity's existential place, purpose, and ultimate destiny.Other books of similar genre and/or philosophical reflection:Father Elijah: An ApocalypseDominion I: Seed(A 7-book apocalyptic epic)Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman(a sequel published posthumously, though possibly \"tainted\" by Miller's illness and a second writer)","Considered to be a science fiction classic, Walter Miller's A Canticle For Leibowitz, first published in 1960, is one of the best known post apocalyptic novels. Spanning some 2000 years into the future, A Canticle for Leibowitz is truly incredible in its vast sense of scope and depth. Worthy of dissection in a literature class, the treasures are plentiful in these pages and clearly beyond the scope of my short review. After a full-scale nuclear war, a small order of Catholic Monks strive to preserve a collection of scientific and historical records for posterity. This small monastery, located in the southwestern United States, has struggled for centuries to preserve and protect the remnants of a forgotten age. Originally, the monastery protects records from the violent backlash against technology following the nuclear war. Later, over the centuries, documents and parts of ancient books are carefully preserved from decay through the march of time. The story progresses through several eras covering nearly a 2000 year time span. Often viewed as a cautionary tale, A Canticle for Leibowitz explores the repetitive nature of the rise and fall of civilizations and the inevitable destruction that seems to be the pinnacle of mankind's technological progress. Obviously, the story is religiously oriented though it does not promote any particular religion. In fact, the Catholic Church bureaucracy is often the object of the author's discourse. Some of the extensive Latin dialogue and references may be considered tedious by some, however, it does add to the grand scope of the book. While A Canticle for Leibowitz is not light reading, it is brimming with insight, satire and imagination and is certainly a must read for connoisseurs of apocalyptic & post-apocalyptic fiction.","This is an incredibly enjoyable novel, especially for anyone who has more than a passing knowledge of the history of Western Civilization from the fall of Rome to the modern day. The basic conceit is that this period of history will repeat itself in the future, after a nuclear war that leaves much of the world decimated. An order of monks, named the Order of Leibowitz after a nuclear scientist who became religious after the war, is the last group devoted to the preservation of learning. The great mass of surviving humanity burned all the books it could find, blaming the war on education and science.As might be expected, the novel takes an unusual approach to the relationship between science and religion, making them interdependent. Much like the historical monks of the Dark Ages, the Leibowitzian monks find their purpose in preserving what is left of the wisdom of the ancients. The book is divided into three sections, which are recapitulations of the Dark Ages, the Renaissance, and the Modern (Nuclear) Age, each of which provide a commentary on the religion/science debate.Much of the book will make more sense to Catholics than to other readers. Latin is spoken profusely, and some of the ideas towards the end require a basic knowledge of Catholic dogma to be properly understood. As mentioned earlier, some knowledge of Western history will also help. Miller was writing to an educated audience, and he expects the reader to do some work to appreciate the novel.","Amazing telling. Three epochs of post apocalyptic earth are well outlined. The first is in a monastery which has kept the tradition of learning alive after the Great Burning in which the masses rampaged and destroyed all books and learning, reverting to tribal living. The second is an epoch similar to our own. The third is far in the future. Unfortunately, the lessons of the past have not been learned, and man destroys his only Earth. This is the saddest ending I have ever read. I won't detail it to spoil it. Lots of religious allegories and philosophies are reviewed, debated, acted on with consequences. The story here of John the Baptist is wonderful. This book has the absolute best discussion of euthanasia I have ever read, presenting both sides pro and con beautifully and emotionally. A professor could truly enrich his college level philosophy of religion class with this text. An truly great professor could us this as his only text.Strangely, the book was first written in 1957. That edition is a valuable first edition. That was a surprise success and was quickly reprinted for the mass market in 1958, and has been reprinted several times since. The author wrote to my knowledge, only one other book, well worth forgetting. There is a hard to find NPR dvd reading of this that is well done. That really draws out the slow, sad ending with true emotion.","Although widely considered a masterpiece of science fiction, an honour endorsed by the 1961 Hugo Award and by almost any ranking of SF classical books, the Canticle is hardly typical SF. Miller's enigmatic and sardonic prose delves into many humanistic, metaphysical and theological questions, nuclear annihilation, recurrence in History, the civilizatory role of Catholic Church and euthanasia among them. Written in a cryptic style, an almost endless list of puzzles and conundrums pop up, never to be answered, most of them with biblical undertones: how many souls a mutant double-headed woman is supposed to have?The book comprises three stories, each of them set roughly six centuries apart. Since the first one - Fiat Homo - unfolds approximately 600 years after the Fallout, a nuclear war that had taken place in the 1960's, the Canticle covers thus a time span of about eighteen centuries. The war was followed by the Great Simplification, a backlash led by the \"simpletons\" initially against scientists, but which soon degenerated into a crusade against teachers, technicians or any \"man of learning\". The Catholic Church was the only organization to battle this movement, protecting the persecuted. One of them was Isaac Leibowitz, a jewish electronic technician. After converting to catholicism and joining the Church, he became one of the monks whose job was to try to save as much knowledge as possible from the book-burning mobs. A new order was then established, specifically to carry out this task. The abbey of the Albertinian Order of Leibowitz is the thread that links the three stories.In the last one - Fiat Voluntas Tua - technology has already surpassed its pre-Fallout level - robots and space travel are common fare, and so are nuclear weapons again. In fact, it begins when the final steps of the crisis which leads to another global nuclear war are taking place.Only one character is common to the three accounts: a wandering jew, alter ego of the Jewish people. Apparently immortal, a condition I couldn't find a rational explanation for, and ironically named Lazarus, he watches the human folly around him and carries out witty conversations with the catholic monks while waiting for the Messiah.Although understated, a strong sarcasm permeates the narrative. When some Leibowitz's possessions, a list of jewish shopping items among them, are found by Francis, the not-so-bright novice that threads the first story, they end up venerated as relics from the saint.There are obvious allusions to History as a cyclic process in the Canticle, whose plot is delimited by nuclear wars, seems to mirror actual history from early Middle Ages to present day and parades abbots ranging from Arkos to Zerchi. In the end lingers the question whether mankind's progress is doomed to end in materialistic disaster and self-destruction. That's what Miller seems to dread; regardless of our technological height \"we are the chin-choppers and the golly-woppers, and soon we shall discuss the amputation of your head\".Miller converted to catholicism shortly after WWII. According to legend his group helped in the bombing of the Monte Cassino catholic abbey. Whatever demons he might be exorcizing, the strong religiousness that suffuses the Canticle may turn the book uninteresting to some readers. This is no catechism though. In fact its complexity, ambiguity and opacity - aggravated by the widespread use of latin, the Church's lingua franca up to the 1960's - make it one of the most thought-provoking texts I've ever read.By the way, a good help with the latin in the book can be found in Paul Brians's guide ([...]).","The story is absorbing and the characters well drawn, the conversations thoughtful and challenging. All very plausible and authentic in feeling with only a little bit of pure fantasy that is consistent with the dreamy or hypnogogic experiences of the characters..","Chilling, compassionate, penetrating, original... I cannot think of better words to describe this book. At once epic in scale and deeply personal and human, A Canticle for Liebowitz is a remarkable achievement in the work of speculative fiction. I read the book based on a recommendation I read somewhere that listed it with other books about survival after a nuclear holocaust, like Pat Frank'sAlas, Babylon. What I got was a cautionary tale of mankind's inhumanity to man, and a sensitive meditation on the relationship between knowledge, compassion and the divine. I cannot recommend this book more highly.","This is a great all-around tale. Fans of more story-driven sci-fi will enjoy as much as people who simply enjoy a great story. One of only 2 sci-fi books that I own (see also 'The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldrich' by P. K. Dick). A grim warning of what could become of the world after a nuclear holocaust-type event wipes out everything..leaving only brief and hard-to-descipher bits of written language from 'the past' (our present)..in this case..a grocery list from a Jewish family..including bagels! Funny and brutal, this is a oft-forgotten or overlooked classic.","WOW! I haven't much to say about the theme, because I haven't analyzed it enough. But I can say some very optimistic things about &quot;Canticle:&quot;Though the characters are not very personal and emotionally developed, they are very well developed in terms of their roles in society, religion and to show us what this story is all about. You become attached to them, even if they do not touch you in a personal way. And a good thing too, because each segment is a few hundred years apart, you must move on.As far as I could tell, from my point of view and others, the story was based on how humanity will not learn from their mistakes, and how science and technology don't mesh well with faith and religion.The ending was expected when I read it, but later I realized that the climax is less important than the theme itself.As for the characters, Leibowitz and Rachel are the most important to me, because they are connected in a not-so-subtle way, by the fact that they are the &quot;hope&quot; for the next civilization. We can refer them both to the &quot;Wandering Jew&quot; story. They were the chosen ones by Christ to live forever. Think about it, because it made a superb point in my presentation in class.So, as I conclude, I can say that this book is definitely worth buying, if not, then reading over and over again, to satisfy your hunger for some good old sci-fi enrichment. I just hope that you know Latin.","YOu want an &quot;end of the world&quot; novel that actually involves you? Look no further, fellow reader: here it is.This book takes place in 3 parts, all of which are very involving and dynamic. Miller's approach of how mythology comes about, just how quickly things fall apart, and how faith can play such a key role in keeping the old knowledge alive. The characters are believeable and wonderful to get to know. This is a rare book where the events that unfold become a part of your life, where the people within its pages become your friends. My only regret was that the book ended WAY too soon.","I am writing this review many years after reading it, because I am recommending it to my son. This is a true science fiction novel of the early cold war, when the fear of nuclear devestation was real. This is a philosophical chronicle of mankind's circle of self-destruction, not a Star Wars type zoom-zoom story.","All the great sci-fi books require the reader to think. Ender's Game, 2001, Rendezvous with Rama, Stranger in a Strange Land. If you've read and enjoyed any of those, you owe yourself a read of A Canticle for Leibowitz which fits that mold. At times the pace is slow (comparable to 2001 in the respect), and it's definitely the darkest of this cluster of greats (save the ending of Ender's Game).This may not be for everyone. But for me, I rate it in the top 5 all time.","Miller's A Canticle For Leibowitz is broken down into three separate but mildly interrelated stories. The first story takes place some centuries after the nuclear annihilation of our civilization, the second story some centuries after the first, and the third some centuries after that. All three of the stories are connected via a common thread...The Abbey of the Order of Leibowitz...whose task it is to collect and store the remaining knowledge of a more advanced civilization (ours') and preserve it for the day when humanity will be able to use it again.Miller's story is an interesting, if dated one. Written in the 1950's Miller's view of the world clearly isn't the modern one. But there are certainly similarities. Miller's story reflects possible nuclear annihilation of both the US and the Soviet Union. Today, the threat of terrorism, is at a minimum, hovering on the back-burners of all our minds. Throughout the entire book there is the constant theme of cyclicality. That everything in the human world (including our spirituality) goes through cycles. From just the smallest tradition (in terms of the overall story) of the yearly Lentin fast, to the underlying mantra of the book that, like Santayana said, if we don't learn from our past mistakes we are doomed to repeat them.This story is heavy on the symbolism. In this way, A Canticle For Leibowitz would make a great reading assignment for high school or college English classes. Unfortunately, this reader is only intelligent enough to pick up only the most blatant of metaphor and not intelligent enough to catch the more subtle.The two major downsides of this book are that it can be awfully slow and drag at times, making it difficult to get through. Also, there is quite a bit of Latin liberally dispersed throughout the story. Seeing that most of the book is set in and around an abbey, it makes sense that the Latin is in there...it just would have been nice if Miller had given us more translations of his Latin verses.Overall, this book is worth reading if you're interested in the way religion effects our lives (and may in the future); are interested in a well-written (if dated) piece of post-apocalypse scifi; or are just plain interested in reading an intelligently drawn story.","I always think that Miller's &quot;Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; should be required reading for students. This is a masterpiece that reflects in a brillant way on many aspects of our human nature.The writing is artful and efficient, the story flows naturally and well paced, and the characters are simply unforgettable... full of tenderness, fear, courage, failures...yes...so human. I will hardly forget Brother Francis of Utah, Dom Paulo de Pecos, Dom Jetrah Zerchi, Lazarus...In this intellectual and moral novel, every page glows with important topics for all humanity. Read it, and you will be touched, and hopefully moved. I am convinced that if the men governing our world read books like this, things will be much better.In sum, &quot;Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; is a Universal Masterpiece.(The Latin on the novel has seemingly been a problem for some readers: Well, no problem, there are at least 2 excellent study guides available in the www with all the translations).","This product arrived as promised and on time. I have no complaints. It is what it is&#8230;a collage book. I used it for class and it served its purpose.","Lord St Leibowitz keep them dreaming down there. Actually a quote from Michners Space. It says I need more words.","For me, it was Science Fiction being used to bolster and promote Christianity, and not just Christianity, the inter connectedness of all faiths. Much as C S Lewis usen his 'Narnia' books to promote Christianity to the young through Fantasy or Orson Scott Card's reinforcing moraliy with his SciFi also aimed at the mid-teen to mid-octogenarian.Read it, you won't be sorry.(this books target audience is mature Science Fiction fans)","... had I read Canticle for Leibowitz, and read it now because my \"school\" reading group included undergraduates who had never read it. The book is, of course, far, far better than I could possibly have grasped as an adolescent. It stands up remarkably well to the passage of time, and remains a memorable read.It raised, for us, three areas of discussion that proved valuable.1) How fearful should one be now that a nuclear apocalypse is possibly around the corner? It is easy to mock the excesses of my youth in the 1950's (\"Duck and cover!\"). But I was dismayed to discover how little attention to the still-very-real threat is found in undergraduates. The proliferation of nuclear weapons, even though Saddam had none, is terrifying, and we have done little or nothing about it for many years.2) The portrayal of the Catholic Church is highly illuminating., At first you think, Those idiots, don't they know they're making a Jew into a saint? But then one thinks a little, and notes that the Church has indeed survived as an institution when little else has ... again! And that part of the secret of its success is that it steals from others, like the holiday of Christmas. (Did you know that in the 4th century A.D., they had _no idea at all_ of the month in which Jesus had been born, and chose that day because it was a popular Roman holiday, celebrating the Birth of the Glorious Sun? and that the holiday is truly far more ancient than that?3) So what causes a Dark Age? What survives during one? What does it take to start a Renaissance? Canticle ... raises such fascinating questions, and does a credible job of dealing with them.In short, a fine read and an intellectually provocative one.","This book has an admittedly clumsy title that makes for a difficult sell intially. When I have recommended this book to people, their first reaction is usually a puzzled look at hearing the title. However, this book is remarkable in every aspect. Miller paints a tale here that draws you in from the beginning and leaves you amazed through the end. There are elements of dark comedy, tragedy, theology and human nature here that will make you think and reflect. The book is a bit dated as it was written in the Cold War era. If you can make the mental journey with Miller back to that point in history, you will not be disappointed. It also helps to understand a bit about Miller's life--he was a Roman Catholic electrical engineer who served as a bomber pilot in WWII. This book won the Hugo Award in 1961 and belongs among the classics of the genre. If you love sci-fi that has substance and meaning, this is a book you will enjoy.","Read this a few months ago and it still brings a smile to my face. It starts with a monk living in a hole doing abstenance, he is met by a strange old hermit and during the course of things discovers a cache of ancient artifacts including a shopping list bearing the name of the religious orders founder. Anyway, it goes from there and is hugely enjoyable. A very interesting view of an Order founded on keeping knowledge alive vs those who view such knowledge as dangerous heresy.Enjoy!Mike","This is a book that any socially conscious Sci-Fi reader will love. One can not call themselves a serious lover of the genre without this book in thier library. Not only is it beautifully written, the story still conveys a message that even your grandchildren will apprciate in generations to come.","Some books, you want to stretch out the experience so you don't finish the enjoyment too soon. A Canticle For Leibowitz is not one of them. It took me over eleven years to read, not because I couldn't part with a great read, but because every time I committed some time to Leibowitz, the book begged to be put down. I don't know how many times I tried to get into the book, only to think of better ways to spend my time. It wasn't that A Canticle For Leibowitz was just dull - it seemed more as if the author could think of enough ways to disengage the reader. Imagine a story of post-apocalyptic monks copying electronic schematics without the first clue as to their meaning or utility. Characters come, their slow-paced lives are described in tedious detail, then they're killed off or drift into the past, as if they meant nothing to the narrative, after all. Throw in dead rituals in Latin, a constantly shifting cast of chartacters you couldn't care less about, reinvention of long-disappeared technologies, and a church-sponsored starship to seed distant worlds with born-again Adam and Eve. A capsule review would be foolish to try to summarize the movement of centuries described in a book, but this one moves in seeming-real time, plodding so slowly, you might wonder if you have to stay around long enough to see it fail to cover much ground in eternities of doledrums.","The message of this book can be summed up by one quote from its last chapter: \"To minimize suffering and to maximize security were natural and proper ends of society and Caesar. But then they became the only ends, somehow, and the only basis of law--a perversion. Inevitably, then, in seeking only them, we found only their opposites: maximum suffering and minimum security.\" It is the story of a civilization once obliterated by nuclear war that lives to evolve into another society that even knowing what was wrought centuries ago, must wrestle with the choice to detonate again.I first tried to read this book in college as part of a humanities course entitled \"Science Fiction.\" I believe this was the third or fourth Sci Fi book I ever endeavored to read. I was unable to complete even the first section. The frequent ues of latin words and phrases that are not translated and the descriptions of monastic life assume a familiarity with Catholocism that I did not (and still do not) possess. However, several more years of life experience, and a much more thorough knowledge of Science Fiction has enabled me to at least finish it and, I hope, to glean from it the sentiments I refer to above. I'm still not a huge fan of the book, but I now understand its place in that curriculum. I'm not sure I would recommend the text for that purpose, or to anyone who isn't better versed in the genre than I am now. A background in Catholicism or at least a course in Latin would also help.","A Canticle for Leibowitz is the first book I've read in a while that I can unconditionally recommend to anyone looking for a good book. Contrary to reports I've heard, you don't need to have any familiarity with Catholicism to enjoy the book, but I'm sure it helps. The book itself is certainly steeped in Catholicism, following an order of Catholic monks through the centuries after a devastating nuclear war in a way that suggests the author wasn't simply looking for a caricature.I hate reviews that give away the plot, so I'll just say what I found so great about the book. There are few boring parts. The cantos/chapters aren't of arbitrary length - I think it's apt to relate them to scenes in a play. When the action shifts, the canto shifts. That's not a structure I find most authors following, but it works really well.Miller does a great job of bringing his environment into the story. He discusses (and briefly anthropomorphises - if that's even a word) vultures and their place in the postdiluvian world. He talks briefly of fish and feeding. He even discusses the sun, and all of these things make the setting real, but through all of that, the setting itself never overshadows the story. It just makes the story make sense and gives it a place to come alive.And the story is ultimately one about the tension between human hope (represented by the monks) and the human desire for power over one another, represented by the state. He pulls it off well, without being too preachy or condescending.","This book is great. Illuminated manuscripts of half melted circuit boards. Texarcana, \"a king rode from the south...\" \"their broken roadways lie everywhere one cares to dig...\" Enough said.","Walter Miller's \"A Canticle For Lebowitiz\" is such a brilliant subversive story, it is for me almost the penulatimate example of what literature is supposed to be. Not romanatic seduction, not escapist fantasy, but a story that somehow gets past your conscious mind with an idea so powerful that after reading for a while and following the story for a while a larger inescapable idea about human universals looms into view. This story and the ideas in it are really great. I don't want to go into the story here, I'll just say that if you are real human being this book should be a delightful experience to read. I had to read it for school the first time, and it was such an effort until all of a sudden I got how great it was ... why they call classics classic. 5/5PS. It's sad for me to imagine that someone would actively dislike this book so much as to give it a 1/5. I have to wonder what could be going through such a person's mind, if anything.","I am still wondering what is considered so good about this book. I feel fairly well versed in SF and this one ranks as low as the last few books in the Dune series. There were interesting flashes in the book; the idea of technology being held by the church was fairly interesting, but never panned out for me. Thon Taddeo's visit had my interest, but lost it because nothing that interesting transpired. One thing I will concede, the literary level was high for SF (no, I am not just saying that because the book contains Latin). I hope that you enjoyed, are enjoying, or will enjoy it more than I did.","This classic tale of nuclear holocaust is written in 3 sections; Fiat Homo (Let There Be Man), Fiat Lux (Let There Be Light) and Fiat Voluntas Tua (Thy Will Be Done). The &quot;Flame Deluge&quot; (i.e. nuclear holocaust) has occurred at the &quot;twilight of the Age of Enlightenment&quot; (i.e. the 1960s) and is already six centuries in the past as the story opens.In the first section, we meet Brother Francis Gerard of Utah, a novice of the Catholic Albertian (named for Magnus Albertus, teacher of St. Thomas Aquinas and patron saint of scientists) Order of Leibowitz whose abbey is located in the southwestern desert. The Order had been founded by a weapons engineer before he was hanged by the post-Deluge mob during the time of &quot;Simplification&quot; along with all men of learning for their presumed role in the catastrophe. After many (well described) years of routine abbey life, Brother Francis is selected to make the long and arduous journey east on foot to deliver the \"blessed blueprint\" for the Church's canonization of Leibowitz. Unfortunately, on his way back to the Abbey, he is killed by a bandit.The author is fond of representing the passage of time from the perspective of the buzzards of the region, repeating often that they &quot;laid their eggs in season and lovingly fed their young.&quot; He adds comically that the buzzard &quot;philosophers&quot; have determined that the supreme being has tailored the world to their needs, since there is always so much to eat (perhaps implying similar deficiencies in our own thinking?). Eventually the great city-state Texarkana rises from the prior destruction.By 3174 (6 centuries later), Texarkana Emperor Hannegan is plotting conquest against the other major powers of the time. A scholar of his court, Thon Taddeo, becomes interested in the Leibowitz documents. When he visits the Abbey, we feel the tension between the faithful, meek obedience of the monk scholars vs. his cold, skeptical, hungry and proud attitude (typical of the secular scholars). Like many seculars, he has had a loveless childhood and has used his great intellect as a weapon to humble those who have refused to love him. He views Hannegan's plottings for dominance as undesirable but inevitable and necessary to the support of his greatest goal, the revival of learning and civilization. Abbot Dom Paulo can't understand how the Thon can justify his emperor's acts in this way. This still speaks to us today, as we witness the moral ambiguity of learning and even civilization.By 3781 (6 centuries later), spaceships have been developed and nuclear weapons again perfected. There is growing tension between Texarkana's empire and the Asian Coalition. When a nuclear explosion destroys an Asian city, it is unclear who is responsible. The Asians respond by destroying Texarkana in a nuclear counter-assault. The code phrase &quot;Lucifer is Fallen&quot; is used in the last Canticle of the Leibowitz Brethren (thus the title) to warn members of the church to prepare for the likely worldwide nuclear holocaust to come.In the aftermath of these attacks, the main concern of seculars is mercy killing (they set up a clinic just outside the Abbey in the desert to voluntarily &quot;terminate&quot; those with terminal radiation sickness), while the church is caring for those hurt and activating its special plan to launch a spaceship containing a remnant of 58 scholars, priests, women and children and the precious documents that have been preserved by the Order of Leibowitz. A philosophical and theological climax is reached when, during an argument about whether to use the Abbey for secular clinic work, the main secular character, Dr. Cors, claims that &quot;pain's the only evil I know about, its the only one I can fight&quot; and that society is the sole arbiter of right and wrong. Abbot Zerchi later reflects &quot;Dearest God, how did those two heresies get back into the world after all this time&quot;. As the book comes to its close, Abbot Zerchi is trapped in the wreckage of the Abbey after another nearby nuclear blast, and theremnant is lifting off for their one-way journey into space.The author explores the &quot;sacralization&quot; of knowledge in the absence of science. The Abbey's prized artifacts are the blessed blueprint, the sacred shopping list and the holy shrine of Fallout Shelter. The monks have very little idea as to the meaning of these writings and artifacts, but nonetheless make it their lives' work to preserve them as sacred items for some future time when they may be understood. The implication is that ancient writings considered sacred by religion are merely not well understood today and that, given sufficient knowledge, could become demystified commonplaces of natural science at some point in the future (i.e. an attempt to reconcile faith and reason by elevating reason above faith).Despite this, it seems likely that the author was a believer (he took his own life in 1997). He displays deep knowledge of and respect for catholicism (latin quotations pervade the story). As he grapples with the question of faith vs. reason, he sees that knowledge isn't enough to solve man's dilemma. All of man's attempts to create order (without God) eventually fail (giving the impression of an endless cycle of creation and destruction as portrayed in the book). A key role of the church is to preserve ancient knowledge during the inevitable dark years (even rediscovering some technical knowledge), but the author doesn't seem to develop the theme that a solution is available to this dilemma. When man admits his own knowledge and abilities are insufficient and seeks God's help, he finds forgiveness, moral insight and guidance, and courage to do what is right.","This book stands out from its genre by its originality, by its positive portrayal of Catholic Church and by the unyieldingly pessimistic view of human nature. I probably liked it most for the humor and tongue in cheek Part I, could not really relate to apocalyptic Parts II and III where i felt the author becoming more stiff and moralizing.Despite the strained analogies that pervade the book, the knowledge-loving preservationist Church portrayed in the book is nothing like its medieval predecessor which actively persecuted new metaphysical or scientific developments, burning a few unfortunates in the process. Another part that surprised me was the almost complete absence of women - which, for Miller, do not seem to exist except as breeders of men. Any church that does not accept women into 'priesthood' is not going to make it in the XXIst century.Still, the book was enjoyable for its uniqueness, weirdness and perhaps most of all, the unmistakable scent of the American Southwest. Which I love.","Is history destined to repeat itself over and over again? Yes would seem to be the main premise of A Canticle for Leibowitz.Priests turn an electrical engineer into a saint and try to maintain every scrap of technology from a civilization that has just blown itself back to the stone age. These religious artifacts, as they become, are revered and even carried aloft on a spacecraft headed to distant stars as the human-kind, once again tries to annihilate all vestiges of life on Earth. One has to wonder what will become of the distant world after a few hundred years of human colonization.I read this after Neil Stephenson'Anathemand, while there are some similarities, Anathem was a much better read. I also thought Canticle went way overboard with religiosity, especially towards the end.","In this book, monks preserve not only Christian scriptures, but also the totally misunderstood random notes and scribblings of a nuclear scientist named Leibowitz. The book asks: Does civilization have any hope for survival without blind obedience to religious institutions? The title is a joke (a lame joke)- A Canticle is an old Catholic tradition- a chant, hymn or song, with words from a biblical text (often in Latin), while Leibowitz is clearly a Jewish name. Get it? The author converted to Catholicism after he took part in the WWII air bombing of the Benedictine Abbey at Monte Cassino, Italy. This book reflects a lot of knowledge about the Catholic Church, but also reflects doubt and expresses wavering faith. Miller also despairs of humanity's ability to avert self-destruction. Perhaps Miller would be unsurprised by the misinterpretations of some reviewers here on Amazon.","This book is an excellent depiction of post-apocalyptic life and church politics. Some of his assumptions are wrong (such as the fact that a large portion in Latin) The Latin isn't really a problem, however; the important parts are mostly translated and the rest is only supplementary. There is a delicate balance of humor and realism that makes the story wonderful to read. This is inherently a timeless novel. We gradually learn that after a nuclear war, the common people, 'simpletons', blamed the intellectuals for the destruction, burning books and lynching the learned. I.E. Leibowitz rebelled against this and fought to save knowledge, forming an order devoted to saving knowledge. The book consists of three novellas, each one covering less and less time and farther in the future. Each reveals something new about the world as it stands then and shows mankind's advancement. Miller wrote this when Communist paranoia was high, in the time of bomb shelters and paranoia. At the time, it was entirely possible that a set of explosions could devastate the world; he writes as such. He wrote far enough in the future that these situations could still occur, creating a piece that's universally accepted. Sadly, he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head in 1997. This book requires a fairly large chunk of time invested to read but certainly pays off. It many good points about mankind and our nature while remaining readable and is very well written, making it one of the best pieces of science fiction I've ever read. If you have the time, you should read this book.","I was a raised a Catholic. When they turned the altar around and removed some of the mystery, placed the doxology into the vernacular and made hymns into sappy folk songs I left. Mr. Miller indicated the majesty, dignity and humanity that is the essence of this religion through his narration of mankind's efforts to better itself. His book has not returned me to the church, but he has made defending it a reflexive action. This is not science fiction but an application of high principle to a frowsty, grizzling species that would try to be better than it is. This book should be read by anyone who wants to consider the &quot;greater picture.&quot;","'Wow.... what an extremely pessimistic ending!' Those, unfortunately, were the exact words I muttered to my self after reading Walter M. Miller's 'A Canticle for Leibowitz.' But, after a few days of thought, I realized that feelings of pessimism must have been exactly what the author intended readers to experience.This book provides a strong WARNING to the people of our world of what may happen to it, if we choose to ignore the mistakes of our predecessors. History does in fact repeat its self, as the author of this book stresses. To provide a warning to humanity is exactly what science fiction is all about.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. If you are looking for something provocative and out of the ordinary, I suggest that you pick this book up....but be prepared. This book may leave you stunned!","My first encounter with &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; was in 1982. It was a Russian &quot;samizdat&quot; translated version of it. Even in terrible, almost illegible condition it took me just one night to finish the whole thing. I just gulped it down. It seized my imagination completely. 11 years later I translated this book into Russian by myself. I had a contract with a publishing company in St.Petersburg, which quickly went out of business, so my translation was never published. I have no regrets about it. It was a pleasure to work on translation of the perfectly crafted novel. It is a &quot;must read&quot; for every human being who thinks about him/her-self as of intelligent person. The &quot;Canticle...&quot; is not very optimistic book, and, I hate to say that, I share Miller's view on humankind and its future. Too bad. The book is good, though.","This novel contains the best and most comprehensible portrayal of the workings of the medeaval mind I have ever seen. Brother Francis and his abbot demonstrate the typical and highest levels of that mind; something totally forgotten since the age of skepticism. For this reason alone this is a great book. Miller apparently only had one book in him; but what a book it was! This is one of only a half dozen books in my life that I have ever re-read.","I am a Catholic Boomer from the '50s. I remember backyard fallout shelters, test runs of air raid sirens, extensive discussion of nuclear war and fallout in Boy Scouts, Nike missiles on Chicago's lakefront, the Cuban missile crisis, priests and nuns fulminating against godless Communism. How to explain to future generations what it means to walk the rim of the crater Armaggedon? As always, the best distillation of an era, a state of mind, a cultural phase is through great fiction. And the work of fiction that best encapsulates my reaction to the 40 odd years I spent under a nuclear Sword of Damocles is a fable, A Canticle for Leibowitz. It is to Nuclear Fear what 1984 is to Stalinism.I am overjoyed that there is a posthumous &quot;sequel.&quot;","This book holds some interesting points and ideas on religion and society, but mostly it shows how easily it is to write a book that can become very dated.The ideas may have been provocative and inspiring when the book was released, but these day it read kind of stale and boring. When the idea in an idea book, gets outdated, there's not much left.","Contrary to the indications of some other reviewers here, this book cannot meaningfully be separated from its Catholic message. Aside from the \"wandering Jew,\" the only \"character\" who continues through the whole story is a monastery and its Catholic values, with its changing cast of brothers and abbots -- and that is exactly what the book is about: the central importance of faith, religion, and the church to the preservation and salvation of mankind, as set against secular forces that express themselves only as ignorance, arrogance, and destruction.I hated it. I found it simpleminded, alienating, and offensive, its \"values\" depressing and often even hateful. The climax of the book comes with an abbot bravely fighting to prevent a dying woman and her child from seeking euthanasia after having been horribly irradiated by a nuclear explosion: when the mother indicates that she would rather let her child die than live in agony, the abbot ORDERS her not to do so and punches a doctor in the face for trying to stop the abbot from KIDNAPPING her child to \"save\" the child from its mother. (The only part of this that is questioned is the abbot's choice to punch the doctor, but even that we're supposed to think was pretty great: the doctor himself concedes that he had it coming.) What a heroic tale! What a great message!If you are a devout Catholic or are otherwise sympathetic to authoritarian systems of \"morality\" -- and if you see nothing wrong with the example I give above, other than my having given it -- then this is probably just the sci-fi book for you. If not, or if your morals run toward humanism and you do not believe that ancient texts are the source of all meaning and value in the universe, then avoid this book at all costs unless you want to be bored and annoyed for no good reason.My guess is that this has only received such wide praise because it was written at a time when nuclear annihilation was a much fresher threat and hadn't been played out in sci-fi yet to the point of becoming a clich&eacute;, so that people reading it who wouldn't have been sympathetic to its religious propaganda chose to overlook all that because of its anti-nuclear message -- which at this point is very much old news, as far as sci-fi storylines go. The Cold War is over, and now the dogmatic faiths threatening us with nuclear war are explicitly religious (as opposed to unofficially religious, in the case of the Marxist faith): no longer can we ignore that blind faith and authoritarian submission are anything but the solution.Oh -- and did I mention that Walter Miller is a terrible writer? How the Spectra copywriters had the gall to compare this book to Orwell I can only imagine.","I was really shocked at how unintelligible most of this book was to me. I am obviously not a big fan of stream of consciousness narration. I prefer a story that goes somewhere and not a probing search into philosophies. That was my real complaint. I felt that the book was just a jumble of ideas and not a tangible story. I did enjoy the last \"book\" more than the other two. I guess I liked it because it had the least narration, latin and covered a smaller chunk of time. It actually contained more dialogue than the other two books as well. Sorry I didn't get it, but I guess that's mumbly-peg!","I read about 1 book a week and this was the biggest waste of that week in a LONG time. I kept at it thinking it would get better but even the ending was garbage. Slow and boring as heck and whats with all the latin? Am I really expected to know the latin? And the ONLY interesting character, the old man, the writer never really brings to resolution or conclusion. I never write these reviews but this book was so ridiculously bad I thought I might save just 1 person the horror of reading it.","Nothing really happened in this book, and that includes the nuclear war. Divided into three parts, the first involves the story of a young monk discovering some of the artifacts of the title character centuries after the apocalypse. Unfortunately, it takes 120 pages to convey what could easily have taken ten or less. The second part, set centuries after that, has an argument with no winner. Nothing besides that happens, including the land war among the barbarians. The third part, set centuries after that, shows that society built itself back so well after the apocalypse that another nuclear war is looming. Something finally does happen here, and by this time you're rooting for the apocalypse. The story did come full circle and showed the church as the antagonist, but a nihilistic story with no protagonists at all does not make for a good read.","Thanks to the previous reviews and the collective high rating, I gave this book 4 opportunities to give me a reason to stay. The 4th came 2/3 of the way through. Normally, I would not have stayed that long but felt like I just wasn't getting it and did so want to. However, no memorable characters, a wandering plot and a pretty nothing premise forced me to not just shelve the book, but to actually throw it in the trash. It was certainly no invitation to try out sequel that took 40 years to put out. Pretty much the stupidest read that I can remember, and I have tried to choke down a many of one.","This was one of the worst books I have ever read. Given the rave reviews I saw prior to reading the book, I kept reading in the hope that it would get better. It never did. From start to finish it was a constant struggle to continue reading.I give this review to try and save others from the fate of reading such a dire work.","I'd rather have to endure a thousand years of Chinese water torture than to have to read this again.. It could have been a great short story, 60 pages or so. And I'm only giving it a star because at least there are some interesting concepts and attempted prophesies, and I learned a lot of new words I'll never use too. How do you screw up a post apocalyptic book? This was by far the slowest 300 pager I ever read. Gruelling indeed. Read On the beach instead. Or The Road. Or just read the ingredients on the back of the Cheerios box.","I would love to have read this when it came out first. I truly would. I think it is the only way I would have caught the spirit which seems to imbue every other review here.But to pick it up in 2001 as I did ..... well, the closest parallel I could make is watching one of those creaky old black and white episodes of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. In other words, one and a half minutes into it you're saying \"saw this before, thank you very much\".I had to abandon it before I managed a hundred pages. My lingering memory of the experience is that is was like the Key Stone Cops in graphic novel format, small characterless figures stretched across an empty landscape, plodding through set pieces at pre stand-up pace.I adore good SF, but Canticle is unbearably dated.Let it rest in peace with &quot;Duck and Cover&quot;.","As I recall, the copy I read included a hearty endorsement by the Christian Science Monitor. No wonder, as this terribly skewed book portrays the Catholic church as a preserver and creator of all worthwhile human knowledge and ingenuity through the &quot;dark ages&quot; of past and future. There is some small historical basis on which this post-apocalyptic tale of the church is written, though again history is viewed through jesus-colored-glasses.If you're a hardcore feminist, you'll enjoy the fact that the *first* female character appears over 200 pages into the paperback. She's shrieking in horror at something, and we never see her again after she runs from the room.The first female character we actually get to know is a woman who kills herself and her child, despite the best efforts of the head monk to convince her not to sin.Though Jesus returns as a woman. And then that horrible Jew who turned Jesus away millenia ago finally gets to die.On a positive note, it's a well written book, and it stands up to analytical literary standards. It's just very biased. So I give it two stars instead of one.This novel WAS a groundbreaking one in some respects, and so it has been referenced frequently and subtly (Babylon5 &amp; Terry Pratchett to name a couple). Read this book if you want to understand the development of sci-fi better.Or if you're Roman Catholic, or just a bible nut.","A morte perpetua, Domine, libera nos.A sweeping tale of Man's struggle with Lucifer as he seeks to regain an Eden lost to the Flame Deluge. The stories of Brother Francis, Dom Paulo, and Father Jeth Zerchi, monks of the Albertian Order of Leibowitz, span the eighteen century road back.","The most thought provoking book I've ever read. Its deeply detailed characters and scenes will remain with you for many years. It is a story that cannot be summarized in 10 words or 10,000.","When science fiction deals with the Catholic church it is generally hostile this book is a little different. I sometimes wonder if that is because it is made of novellas that appeared in the Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction when Boucher was editor. I think this book shows good &amp; bad things about the Church so non-Catholics will enjoy it too. Ultimately, the Catholic feel is there &amp; so it made me feel I could enjoy sf without being apologetic about who I am. It'll read more like an alternate future to modern readers &amp; it is a little bleaker then I usually like. As for Miller himself, I read that he became disillusioned with the religion he so eloquently described, that along with the depressiveness the book hints at might explain his end.","A Canticle for Leibowitz is an extraordinarily powerful book. Its message, once one cuts past the Catholic overtones, is one that applies as much today as it did in the fifties, perhaps even more so than it did then, in light of the insanity in India and Pakistan. If ever there was a stronger literary work against nuclear war, I have yet to see it.","This my second favorite book, the first being Hofstadter's _Godel, Escher, Bach_. It's incredible. What I particularly like about it is that it never stops being profound-- ending the chapters with the ubiquitous buzzards, the assisted-suicide debate in the end, and other devices. Read it.","Okay. I don't remember the author if someone asks me who wrote it. Yet--I love him! A great writer. An excellent craftsman!The story: It's great! Especially if you like those doomsday--stupid humans ruin civilization--types of books. I read this story when I was in school studying anthropology. The class was pretty boring until we looked at various books that reflected man's inability to build without creating events that eventually lead to some cataclysm. The story is mostly mystery. What does the strange writings from the ancient past mean? Who were the holy ones? Is mankind worth preserving? Can mankind save himself?The story is thought provoking. The story is a page turner that kept me enthralled. In a very humble way, it ranks up there with the Foundation books!","Many years ago, I picked up a dog-eared copy of this book in a local second-hand store. Since then, I've read it every couple of years, and it remains one of the true classics of this genre. For anyone who hasn't read this book: Stop what you are doing and RUN to the nearest bookstore.","I dislike post-apocalypse stories--possibly unreasonably so--because of past experience. For every Alas Babylon, there were real dogs like The Postman or The Day After. This is the main reason why I had never read Walter M. Miller's classic novel A Canticle for Leibowitz. Since it kept appearing on my Alexandria Digital Literature recommendation list, and several people had expressed amazement that I had never read it, I decided to overcome my bias, and at least give it a try. It started out bad--the main character avoiding a possible mutant in a desolate Utah setting that included a fallout shelter (and the word fallout had new meaning, describing a \"scary\" monster of the past). Yawn. But I persisted, and it got better.Split into three equal sections, each covering a different main character and time period. The first section, \"Fiat Homo,\" is the least interesting, or maybe, the most irritating, describing the young initiate Francis and the results of his Lenten fast; nuclear devastation has driven science underground, preserved by a strange order of Catholic monks. This live-close-to-nature aftermath scenario is the type so over used to be annoying, yet Miller's version, which I initially disliked, actually has something that all the imitators lacked depth. The priesthood role of preservation, initially a silly concept, is quite fleshed out by Miller until it achieves believability. Compare this with, say, Waterworld, where the groups of people and technology have no rational logic. . .The middle section, \"Fiat Lux,\" occurs a few centuries later, when human society is being rebuilt, as well as new scientists trying to re-work the old knowledge. The interplay here is between the monks who wish to preserve the old information until the time is right, and the new scientists, who insist that the time is now. The opening of this section, describing one of the nomad groups of the plains, reads too much like Robert Adams' interminable Horseclans novels, but Miller can be forgiven that, by not only being first, but also for having the good sense to stop after one chapter.It is the last section, \"Fiat Voluntas Tua,\" that really sets this novel apart from the crowd, and, in my opinion, confirms its classic status. Set in the far future, when all of society has been rebuilt, including the nuclear technology that caused the first cataclysm, the Abbot of the preserving order finds that humans did not learn from the past, and that preparations must be made for another period of darkness. As in the other sections, Miller is able to make this future scenario entirely believable.If A Canticle for Liebowitz had been confined to just one of these sections, I would have hated it. But the three sections are basically inter-connected novellas that do manage to create the semblance of a single novel at the end. Miller did nothing to change my aversion for post-apocalyptic works, but I did gain appreciation for his take on it.","The parallels of the events of this book and the events that transpired following the fall of the Roman Empire are obvious, but that doesn't make it stupid. For whatever reason, I've gotten into a \"post-apocolypse\" reading frenzy. Prior to this book I read \"Damnition Alley\" which was a fun read, but a light read. Like the forward here says, \"A Canticle for Leibowitz\" is definitley Literature, with a capital \"L.\"Some people might get frusterated with the bits of Latin that appear throughout the book, especially in the first section. However, you can get the idea from reading around the Latin. My one year of high school Latin certaintly didn't help me much as I read this book.Aside from the Latin, and even less Hebrew, this book is a deceptivley easy read. Agian, don't let that fool you because there's a lot to pick up in this book. What's more, as I was reading the second part (with Mad Bear and the Thon) I couldn't help but wander if the path mankind takes in this book is not rather... accurate? I'd suggest that there's nothing fantastic about the human situation in the story... though I do think the Benjamin character didn't aid the realness in any way.Undoubtably, I will read this book again.","Let me start out by saying that this is not the kind of book I normally read. I enjoy Science Fiction on occasion, but I prefer fantasy and when I read Science Fiction, I usually read the fantastical future variety. This is a book that I never would have even picked up off the bookshelf much less bought if it hadn't been one of the books of the month in one of my book clubs.I am, however, very glad that I did. While it's not what I normally read, it was interesting and engaging, and I found myself anxious to read more and unwilling to put it down.Canticle for Leibowitz is divided up into three sections, each one dealing with a different part of history, each a turning point in the circumstances at the Abbey of Saint Leibowitz. The first part is only a few hundred years after the destruction of civilization, when mankind is back in the dark era. The second is the renaissance when things are being rediscovered, and the last is when technology has again reached the point it had reached before the last nuclear destruction.The second part was my favorite, though my favorite character was Brother Francis from the first part. The third part was my least favorite all around, likely because it was the most depressing. The beginning and middle were full of hope, desperate hope, but hope nonetheless, and the end made the destruction of humanity seem inevitable, which wasn't pleasant to read.Each part was confusing at first, as they all started in the middle of something, but once I was able to figure out what was going on (usually after a few pages), I got into it a lot. The characters were engaging and well developed and Miller made me care about what happened to them.One thing that I really liked about the book was the symmetry. Each part began in the middle of some insignificant task that lead to something greater, and each part ended with a death and circling buzzards and the passage of a lot of time. It gave finality to each part and kept them separate, yet at the same time linked them together.While I was disappointed by the ending (I had wanted things to end on a more hopeful note than they did), I think that the story accomplished what it had set out to accomplish-show the reader what things would be like if the world continued the way it was going. It was written in 1959, back when nuclear bombs were being developed at terrific paces, and it was obviously a commentary on that. I'm not sure how much it managed to change things, but it was a well-done social commentary and one that was pleasant to read at that. Some of the things could still be applied to today, though with the Cold War over, it's not quite as urgent as it must have seemed to Miller then. I'm very interested to see how he deals with the world situation that was presenting himself when he wrote the sequel 40 years after the original.","I must admit, it was the cover-art to this book that 1st caught my attention. Not the reviews. Not the conext. That aside, I am glad to have picked it up. A tale of a possible outcome after a nuclear holicost, I must say that it is a most enjoyable read (even if the Latin was difficult to get by) and full of hearty laughs. As it was before, it shall be again comes into a whole new light after reading this book. The middle-ages rose and passed and in my opinion if civilization were to fall once again, it would be the shoulders of the monastaries to once again hold the pieces until people are ready.","I'm not going to get into whether this is or is not Science Fiction. Some people think it is, some think it isn't. For the record (and whatever it's worth), I think it is. Ultimately, debates about what genre the book belongs to are kind of pointless. What matters is that this is truly great literature. It's engaging, disturbing, ironic, thought-provoking, touching, and beautifully written. What more does a novel need to be?","This book is excellent. Just a bit weird. A Canticle for Leibowitz is intended to show that Humanity may be able to rise from its mistakes (a nuclear war), but repeat the exact same mistake. In other words, Humanity goes boom. Twice. Before the beginning of the book (Fiat Homo), and in the end (Fiat Voluntas Tua).One other reason that made me find this book was the fact that it teaches you about the process involved in canonizing someone.","A Canticle For Leibowitz was assigned to me by my Lang. Arts teacher. I wasn't sure at first how good it would be, considering the fact that a friend of mine had read it and hated it. I understand now that she was wrong. The book deals with complicated subjects and deep thought, and it is a true classic. I will remember it as a great book, and look forward to re-reading it. I would recommend it to someone who can look past the lines and into the story.","A Canticle for Leibovitz was a revelation in terms sci-fi content for me.Bored with-Studly guy meets/rescues Buxom babe on Hostile planet-scenarios,I borrowed this book,not really expecting much.A genuinely great story,it's take on the Church is both convincing,compelling and ultimately disturbing,because as we Catholics know,it comes close to non-fiction,showcasing both the good and the bad in the Catholic Church.","This book is excellent writing, but it is not what most people will consider as science-fiction. It did resemble science-fiction in one narrative cliche: scientists are naive pawns of darker forces they can't understand and won't recognize. This attitude is almost as prevalent in the body of science-fiction as is the other great sci-fi cliche, the obligatory adolescent sexual component found in half of the sci-fi stories written since 1960. It was very refreshing not to have *that* raise it's clumsy head in this book. ##### The sometimes heavy-handed christian moralizing near the end had me literally throwing the book against the wall, but if you are a practicing Catholic, you shouldn't find much to object to here. ##### *On the other hand*, &quot;A Canticle For Leibowitz&quot; is easily some of the best writing I have ever come across. The story is involved and has real depth and yet the book almost never gets bogged-down and slow. The characters are well-developed and believable. The depiction of the interior struggle of the human mind to come to grips with issues of life and death, good and evil is handled so expertly that at times it seemed that I was seeing my own thought processes transcribed on the pages. The question of faith, one of the most difficult questions for anyone regardless of their religion (faith in God, money, work, spouse, pleasure, or--mine by the way--just a mule-headed faith in the relentless stupidity of our species: whatever) was treated in such a simple, direct, compelling way that I found myself thinking about the book a lot when I wasn't reading it. ##### I think it is very telling that Miller, the author, was a tail-gunner in World War II. The quick, cruel and absurd turns the story takes reminded me very much of another WWII author, Joseph Heller and his book &quot;Catch-22&quot;, and I was not at all surprised when I finished the book this morning to read in the author note at the end that Miller had endured much combat in that war. ##### The conclusion of the book is an inspired argument between the (as Miller evidently sees it) naive weakness of scientific and humanistic secular expediency, and the rigors of ascetic Christian Virtue. While I find Miller's apparent conclusions frustrating and offensive, his skill as a storyteller is beyond repute. I won't be reading the Catholic propaganda *Fiat Voluntas Tua&quot; (third part) again if I can help it, but I will be reading &quot;Fiat Homo&quot; and &quot;Fiat Lux&quot; again sometime. Miller's ability to depict the Dark Ages alone guarantees his book an everlasting place in the canon of great english lit. ##### One thing is sure though: this ain't Larry Niven, and it also ain't pulp fantasy-romance. But if you like good writing with it's feet in the pools of history, head in the clouds of the spirit and a nice warm meal of roadkill pudding in it's belly, pick up a copy today and Fiat Ignis!","It is unfortunate that Canticle is labeled &quot;sci-fi.&quot; The only hint of science fiction is at the very end when selected representatives of the Order of St. Leibowitz depart by rocket to a distant destination to save the Memorabilia as this planet goes up in smoke. In all other respects it is classic fiction, portraying the effects of an albeit fictional nuclear war, and depicting humanity and dehumanization in much the same fashion as All Quiet on the Western Front, Gone with the Wind, The Naked and the Dead, and War and Remembrance. Canticle surpasses all of those in spades. Miller draws vivid pictures, and just as ancient texts were illuminated in our own dark ages by cloistered monks, so too can one visualize a dedicated cleric spending years producing a blueprint by pen and ink as a simple labor of love without having a clue about what it depicted. Miller's dark age was followed by a renaissance, then the scientific method, then the industrial revolution, and eventually by weapons of mass destruction. This book is a magnificent demonstration of the hypothesis that those who ignore the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them. In our own time we came within a hairsbreadth of nuclear winter in the Cuban missile crisis, and it would take but one small step by a couple of lunatics to recreate the very situation that Miller presents so vividly. Canticle is one of my prize possessions - it is not lent to anyone except upon the pledge of their firstborn.","If you consider the names George Orwell and Aldous Huxley essential to a solid literary foundation, add a new name to your list: Walter Miller, Jr.Miller's post-apocalyptic vision, A Canticle for Leibowitz, provokes thought in a way few works of literature can. What role can religion play in a world destroyed? What simple things are simple people doing now, will they do in the future, that may alter the course of humanity? Or is the course of humanity set in stone, unalterable, doomed to an endless cycle of purge and renewal?Canticle draws one in easily, without being grim or grotesque, and becomes an important milestone in the readers experience. Don't overlook this powerful book","This book takes a look at what would happen if the world underwent a neuclear holocaust.The book begins several hundred years after all civilization was destroyed ina monestary commited to preserving books.The author then takes a look at society a thousand years after the halocaust.He then takes a third look at humanity two thousand years after the cataclysm.This allows us to come to some neat insights on religion, humanity and society.This book is surely one of the best I've ever read.","This one's really thought provoking, as any good science fiction novel should be. Based on a &quot;what if&quot; scenario of worldwide nuclear devastation (mainly by fallout) and the resultant shift of civilization back to the dark ages, Canticle explores a possible unfolding of events over the next millenium or so. It contains three novelettes set in widely separated time periods with no common characters (except for a strange one who doesn't age). All three parts are great; I think the first one is best with respect to the narrative and the last one is best with respect to engaging the mind.All three stories focus on a single monastery, which was founded by Saint Leibowitz to accomplish a primary mission: to collect and preserve as much pre-war printed material as possible in the hopes that one day when technology catches up, people will be able to make use of it. The monks call this collection the Memorabilia. In the first story everyone outside the church is extremely hostile to any printed material and to education in general, because education and technology caused the development of weapons of mass destruction. So the monks have sort of a tough time preserving their Memorabilia. The story centers on Francis, a monk who when new to the order makes an interesting discovery in a fallout shelter.By the second story, secular education is set to thrive again as the world begins to embrace technology and modernization. The Memorabilia start to show their worth while at the same time a large empire is rising. As technology improves, the church is taken less seriously. In the third story, technology has surpassed ours today and the Memorabilia's usefulness has been exhausted. However, the people of that time seem not to have learned from their past and the church prepares for a desperation move to start anew.It's clear that Miller was a brilliant author and I wish he'd been more prolific. His style is casual and easily digestible yet full of subtleties and wit. Unfortunately Miller committed suicide before completing the sequel. It was published anyway in its incomplete form but apparently lacks the polish of Canticle. Nevertheless, it continues the second of the three stories in Canticle and explores new themes as well. I hope to get around to it someday.","I rediscovered this classic recently during an uneventful weekend to learn that I loved Miller's novel more now than ever. I have read quite a few science fiction classics in my time, but this one has been etched in my soul since my high school years.Separated into three acts, A Canticle For Leibowitz is an exploration into the evils of civilization and knowledge spawned after major religious movements; in this case, the discovery of a shopping list by a long deceased scientist after worldwide nuclear devestation. The result of this 3-part movement is the overlying \"history repeats itself\" theme and the universal idea that man's drive for perfection only leads to inevitable self-destruction.A Canticle For Leibowitz is in itself perfection for science fiction, leading the audience with profundity and an intense philosophical exploration into humanity that is as truthful in a fantasy world as it is in reality. The world Walter M. Miller, Jr. has created feels more like \"truth,\" and though the message was ultimately concieved out of the heights of cold war politics, it still holds strong today.","This book really did catch me off guard when I read it. I picked it up at the recommendation of an employee at my local bookstore, and while I have read several good books via a strangers recommendation, I have never read one as good as this.This book is basically one story split into three sections titled \"Fiat Homo\", \"Fiat Lux\" and \"Fiat Voluntas Tua\". They all take place after the 'Flame Deluge', which is when mankinds ignorance and evil have culmanated into a nuclear holocaust. The story is about an abby named after a man of science who learned the errors of his ways late in life and sought to preserve our knowledge, while ignorance roamed the land in the dark times after the flame deluge. The plot is a straight forward one and I while I was able to speed read some parts of the book, I had to slow down and sometimes reread sections that dealt with some serious philisophical matters that, even now I find myself thinking about. This book is truly thought-provoking and I thought, for once, the jacket aptly described it when it says this book is a book that ranks with 1984 and Brave New World. I even think in some ways it is better than those two. It's very seldom when reading a book of the sci-fi genre (my favorite along with fantasy) that one reads a book that let's one reflect on themselves and human nature in general and provides such valuable insights into life.I give this the highest rating I can. I advise you get it as soon as possible. I am glad I did, I had never heard of it and it is almost fifty years old too.","Well, amazing. So many novels in this general genre completely discount the power, much less the existence, of faith and ritual in human culture, or else they deride it. This novel shows the monastic community at its core as a genuine and human place, most of its inhabitants at least trying to achieve meaning and goodness in a world suffering the aftermath of disaster. There are shadows here of the Christian monks protecting European culture in the early Middle Ages ... the struggle with the meaning of suffering, the skepticism of easy &quot;miracles,&quot; and the odd play of faith and distrust in technology in the context of a tenacious Judeo-Christian culture, are examples of some of the issues that enrich this story. Enjoy!!!","Walter Miller's classic, A Canticle for Leibowitz, has been one of my favourite books since the first days I read it (I read it in three days, one day for each of the three parts of the triptych). The premise is one that we have come to recognise as a familiar theme -- post-nuclear-holocaust earth. However, this was a relatively new theme in the early 1950s, when this novel first appeared as a serialised story in the pages of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. Remarkably, for an early work, this remains one of the standards by which subsequent efforts have been judged.--Fiat Homo--In the first part of the story, we are introduced to Brother Francis, a member of the order of St. Leibowitz (well, not yet a saint, but considered one by his order), who, as it turns out, was an early survivor of the nuclear conflagration (later described as the Deluge, in biblical tones that recalls the flood of Genesis). Leibowitz, we discover, was looking for a way to help society maintain order in the destruction--being an historian, even though he was Jewish, he remembered the relative stability of society in the Dark Ages being guided and enhanced in the aftermath of fall of Rome by the Church in general, and monastic orders in particular. So, he founded a house, which continues.Brother Francis, on a desert retreat, happens upon a scrap of paper that bears a possible signature of Leibowitz. Becoming ecstatic, he devotes his life to preserving and illuminating this document. Eventually he takes a doomed trip to New Rome (which we discover is in the heart of the North American continent). He is killed on his way back to the monastery, but not before delivering the Leibowitz document to New Rome and aiding the order in its quest for sainthood for Leibowitz.--Fiat Lux--In the second frame of the triptych, we come upon a political situation several hundred years later, much like the middle ages (Hannegan II under papal interdict while claiming title as Defender of the Faith) -- yet there are new discoveries both among philosopher/scientists of the present and researchers looking back into the past. There is to be to the order a visit from Thon Taddeo, a noted scholar and poet, and politically important person, and the monastery is concerned in many ways to make a good showing. Brother Kornhoer, figuring out texts on ancient electricity, contrived an electric light to the amazement and consternation of Thon Taddeo.The poet, too, ends up dying on a journey, out in the desert.--Fiat voluntas tua--Again hundreds of years have passed, and mankind has once again reached the space age. Genetic purity is a concern (as mutations continue among many of the people due to the fallout of the Deluge). Warfare continues to grow in intensity and severity, and politics remains as ever ineffectual in containing the ambitions and greed of potential dictators. We have come into the nuclear age once again, and illegal nuclear testing has been detected. The world has become a much more secular place. But, once again, the monastery is at involved in the tensions, and more importantly, toward planning for life after another Deluge.Visionaries at the monastery prepare to send brothers into space to survive what seems a sure collapse and nuclear war, so that they might once again be able to help rebuild society, preserving knowledge and the order of the Church.* * *This story is filled with small details of great insight -- how a Dark Ages person might interpret finding scraps of the modern world; how rediscoveries might be welcomed and not welcomed variously; how human personality is, alas, unlikely to change despite much pain and effort.We are introduced to a man called 'the Old Jew of the Mountains' -- I at first thought this was the apostle John (who is referred to in legendary lore as the apostle who wasn't martyred, or the apostle who wouldn't die until the return of Christ); later I realised that it was Lazarus -- he who was raised from the dead by Christ, and because of this power, could not himself die, but remained outside society awaiting the return.There are so many philosophical points which remain alive for those of us in the post-Cold War world, that this is a work of vision akin to Verne or Wells (though without their higher literary ability). This is a great story, and one that stays in the mind ever after.","As evidenced by the fact that this novel has inspired over 140 reviews from Amazonians, it has clearly had a substantial impact on many of the millions who have read it since its publication in 1959--and I count myself among them.The late 1950s and early 1960s--the height (or depths) of the Cold War--inspired a number of apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic novels, including Nevil Shute's On The Beach (1957), Pat Frank's Alas, Babylon (1959), Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler's Fail- Safe (1962) and Philip Wylie's Triumph (1963). George R. Stewart's Earth Abides (1949), though written somewhat earlier, also falls into this category. But Walter M. Miller's award-winning novel is the standout of this excellent group--a visionary, thought-provoking tour-de-force to be read and re-read.While those who know Latin or are steeped in Catholicism and the ways of the Roman Church may have an initial leg up on the rest of us, neither is a prerequisite for an appreciation of this book. In fact, the look at abbey life, the new &quot;Middle Ages,&quot; the re-invention of the the electric light, etc., are all highly interesting and educational. When I studied the Fall of Rome, the rise of the Church and Medieval history in college, much of it seemed eerily similar to stuff I had read years before in what was commonly described as a mere &quot;science fiction&quot; novel.The best stories are the ones that stay with you long after you've read them--sometimes forever. This is one of those. Read it and think, read it and wonder, read it and remember.","Imagine North America divided into entities named Laredo, Texarkana, Chihuahua, Denver, and the Mississippi Republic and you have the beginnings of the post-nuclear holocaust world created by Walter Miller in &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz.&quot; Nuclear devastation, followed by a &quot;cleansing&quot; of all educated people held responsible for the development and deployment of nuclear weapons, has left a world in which &quot;Simpleton&quot; is a term of respect and knowledge is considered threatening. However, the monks of the abby named for Leibowitz, an engineer martyred for trying to preserve books and writing, continue to save every scrap of information from the time before the destruction and Simplification, even cherishing a shopping list in Leibowitz's own hand. Through all three sections of the novel, a burlap-clad beggar/traveler/mystic moves, leading me to wonder if he is not somehow a reincarnation of Leibowitz himself. The man is mostly an observer who only occasionally influences the action, but his presence is always tangible. He watches as the world progresses (?) from huddled communities connected only by footpaths beset by robbers and murderers to city-states with renewed nuclear capabilities--but without the sensibilities and cautions that should have come from having already seen one disaster unleashed. Inevitably, it happens again. What knowledge and beliefs will survive? What should survive? Who should survive? You'll have to discover (or rediscover) this 41-year-old masterpiece for yourself! As to why only four stars in my rating, it's simply that the somewhat extensive use of Latin phrases left me wondering what I was missing because of my unfamiliarity with the language and Catholic church custom.","The story presented in this novel of alternate worlds is about renaissance after an Atomic Flame Deluge on earth. It describes the future dark ages, which is also presented as a warning. The author of this novel conveys the warning by modifying and designing the story in such a way to interest the reader and convey the warning. He conveys the warning effectively by changing our inner attitudes towards the technology. We are being informed every time in the story that mankind has self-destructive tendencies. This warning is explained in an indirect way, (meaning that the author doesn't clearly say it as a warning, he delivers us the warning by the use of this story).Wry, descriptive, engaging and vastly disturbing, Miller's prose hurls the reader into a parallel universe: Earth as it might have been if we had destroyed ourselves with nuclear weapons. The story follows the lives of the Monks of the Leibowitz Abbey from the discovery in an abandoned bomb shelter of the actual relics of Saint Leibowitz, the blueprint and the sacred shopping list, to the struggles of the Monks against the violent warlords who rule the world around them and the dispossessed Papal presence in New Rome.The warning is explained to an extent which make the reader think specifically of the things, which are happening in the novel and recognize the similarities with the world that we ourselves live in. The writer achieves this by modifying and designing characters, themes, emotions and using certain language techniques. Writer has also included dark humor, anger and struggle between good and evil in order to convey the warning.","This book was one of several that taught me what science fiction had the potential to be when placed in the correct hands. There are numerous messages in this book, but the most important to me was how history can repeat itself - so, in the end, what's it all worth if we don't learn? This is one of the few books in my collection which I've re-read numerous times. I stumbled upon it by pure luck about 10 years ago - I was helping my mom dispose of old texts at the school in which she works. Back in the corner of the bookroom was a stack of boxes from what I assume was an english class. Inside was a trove of sci-fi: Canticle, the Perelandra Series, Left Hand of Darkness, etc. After reading them, I was surprised that a high school class possibly studied these. If only schools today put this much thought into their required reading.","It's the dark ages again. A 20th century nuclear war spawned a \"Flame Deluge\" which destroyed human civilization's infrastructure and technology, killed most of the people, and created genetic mutations in many of the rest. Then there was a backlash against the educated people of the world who were seen as the creators of both the ideas that started the war, and the weapons that were used to fight it. They were persecuted and killed and all knowledge was burned up. After this \"Simplification,\" people took pride in being illiterate and the only institution that seemed to come through intact was the Roman Catholic Church.Walter M. Miller Jr's A Canticle for Leibowitz is divided into three parts, which were originally published as three separate stories. In the first story, \"Fiat Homo,\" which takes place 600 years after The Simplification, we find a cloister of monks who are applying to New Rome to have their martyred patron, an ex-electrical engineer named Isaac Edward Leibowitz, sainted. Leibowitz's monks have been collecting, preserving, and copying fragments of the Earth's previous civilization. As keepers of pre-Deluge history, they attempt to piece together knowledge and history, without knowing for certain what they're looking at. One day, while maintaining a vigil of silence in the desert around the abbey, Brother Francis stumbles upon the entrance to Leibowitz's fallout shelter containing precious relics, such as a circuitry blueprint and a deli shopping list. These relics cause quite a stir in the abbey.\"Fiat Lux\" begins 600 years later. Genetic mutations caused by the fallout are still affecting mammalian DNA, and the monks of St. Leibowitz occasionally wonder whether there really ever was an advanced civilization on Earth, but progress is gradually being made. This is especially true in the abbey of St. Leibowitz where the monks are safe from the tribal wars that are common in surrounding Texarkana. Their studies of the fragments they've been collecting have prepared them to ignite a new renaissance.Another 600 years pass. In \"Fiat Voluntas Tua,\" humans, though still affected by \"genetic festering,\" have reached the pinnacle of civilization and culture, progressing beyond what had been experienced before the nuclear war in the 20th century. But there's been a cold war going on for 50 years between the two world superpowers and they both have nuclear weapons. At the abbey of St. Leibowitz, the monks wonder if humans are destined to repeat the cycle and, as keepers of the world's knowledge, what is the abbey's responsibility to humankind?\"Are we doomed to do it again and again and again? Have we no choice but to play the Phoenix in an unending sequence of rise and fall? .... Are we doomed to it, Lord, chained to the pendulum of our own mad clockwork, helpless to halt its swing? This time, it will swing us clean to oblivion... Back then, in the Saint Leibowitz' time, maybe they didn't know what would happen... They had not yet seen a billion corpses. They had not seen the still-born, the monstrous, the dehumanized, the blind. They had not yet seen the madness and the murder and the blotting out of reason. Then they did it, and then they saw it... Only a race of madmen could do it again.\"Obviously, the main theme of A Canticle for Leibowitz is the repetitive cycle of human history and the role of our advancing knowledge and technology in our own destruction. This provides the reader with plenty to think on, but Miller also addresses issues that the Roman Catholic Church has tackled during its history, such as its role in state politics and its insistence that euthanasia is a sin. While the novel is meant to be a serious consideration of these ideas, and while its predictions and warnings are frightening, A Canticle for Leibowitz still manages to be amusing and agreeably quirky all the way through. Though there's a powerful and unforgettable message here, it is the irreverent, eccentric humor that makes it so enjoyable to read.A Canticle for Leibowitz is a classic piece of post-apocalyptic science fiction that had mass cross-genre appeal when it was published in 1960, won the Hugo award in 1961, and has never been out of print. Thus, it's a must-read for any true SF fan. I recently tried the audio version which was just released by Blackstone Audio and narrated by Tom Weiner. Audio readers, even if you've read A Canticle for Leibowitz before, you won't want to miss Blackstone Audio's first-rate production of this imaginative, chilling, and humorous novel.","There are some outstanding reviews of this book here, and I know my own limitations. I am not a scholar, religious or otherwise. I know very little about religious teachings and agendas. I cannot take informed positions about the messages of this book, or the motivations of the author. What is left?I love to read, because every once in a while a book moves me in some profound way. It is rare. That is as it should be, because the joy is in the search. Here was very tangible fruit for me. Above all, it's a great story. Never mind the dark moments, the contemplative moments, the agonizing moments, and the religious influences. The story is entertaining first, and the rest grows from that. The book follows an order of monks hundreds of years in the future, as they struggle to study and keep the knowledge of mankind's ancestors alive in their abbeys. Nuclear war has destroyed much of civilization, and the reader follows the monks over more than a millenia as they watch the slow ascent of society again, toward an uncertain future. The powerful moments are difficult to do justice to here.There's a bit of humor here and there. But this is a very serious book, and the questions that arise are tough. Some readers will be firm in their own positions, and will not likely be swayed by events and conversations contained here. The material is intellectually challenging, but it does not seek to convert readers into a particular path of thought. But thoughts should form for the reader at several points in the story. Whether profound, or dismissive, will depend upon the reader. But for the general reader, it is hard for me to imagine that most will not be moved at some point. \"Why are we here?\" is perhaps one of human kind's oldest questions. Miller made it fresh again here, with a heart-felt story of the struggle to save humanity, and to preserve what it is to be human. He achieved it with characters you can understand and believe, and with skillful writing that is modestly controlled so that it never detracts from key moments. The genius of this book is that it will satisfy many reading personalities. The impression it left for me was one of wonder. Specifically, how was it that I was swept along so firmly? I'm not sure that I know why. I just know how it made me feel. Quite thankful, that I have imagination enough to be cautiously optimistic that this scenario will never be more than fictional. God willing.","This book describes our future after a nuclear war which destroyed civilization and the lost of technology that is slowy recovered throughout the centuries. We see the world through the eyes of a abbey. This is good book with an intresting storyline. However this book is boring at times and repeats itsself.","This novel is the story of an order of monks dedicated to preserving the knowledge of human civilization from before nuclear holocaust. Miller tells it in three parts, each separated by several centuries and showing the monks' role at each stage of civilization's rebirth. Miller succeeds in stimulating thought about what qualities of man drive him to destroy himself and then how he rebuilds. I also appreciated the fair portrayal of each side of the conflicts between religion and science in the novel.I only wish I knew more Latin; untranslated phrases pepper the story.","This is a spooky book set in the post-nuclear holocaust American Southwest was first published in 1959. The holocaust survivors lose nearly all the structure of modern civilization yet retain a bizarre sense of religion, wherein anything from our era becomes sacrosanct. The first half of the book deals with a bumbling desert monk Leibowitz who stumbles upon an old fall-out shelter which is, of course, a holy-of-holies to his confused contemporaries. The second half of the story jumps ahead to a time when civilization and science have been re-established and guess what!? they are at war with nuclear weapons again.Very well-crafted, read carefully or you'll miss the nuances. I re-read it every decade or so. Any Y2K end of the world enthusiasts would probably enjoy this book a little too much.","It's a sad commentary on literary types that the only way they can take this seriously is by denying it's science fiction. It's just as sad that science fiction types accept dressed-up dark fantasias like Hyperion as science fiction &amp; list this as &quot;fantasy&quot;. And you guys wonder why these days fantasy is getting more literary respect than sf. To be honest ,though, I didn't entirely enjoy this. Much science fiction is dark, but this is bleak. However it's nice to read SF with a Catholic perspective &amp; it actually had some funny moments. In an anthology I read a different version of the Brother Francis section that was less bleak &amp; I must say I liked it better. Still, since I have a strong dislike for post-nuclear holocaust stories the fact that this could break through that says a great deal.","I attempted to read this book a year ago, but found it all too troubling and confusing to follow. Though, now at 15, and a Latin scholar, i adored the book. The message of mankind killing itself and re-building...only to destroy again, should be one known by all world leaders today. In fact, if it were possible, reading this book should be international law for all who enter the field of nuclear technology! Besides the actual message, i found the following of the same characters, through eons extrememly interesting. abbot Zerchi noticing Francis' skull in the last chapter does much to tie things together. In addition, the mystery of the wandering jew and a number of other inferences add great intrigue to the book. Miller never comes right out and says something, instead always using an indirect, implied method. I found this one of the best aspects of reading the Canticle. It is among the best books i've evr read, and i strongly reccomend it to everyone!","I read this book for my high school english class this spring; it was a course devoted entirely to the Science Fiction genre. My eccentric, opinionated teacher, at the beginning of the semester, said that this novel was his favorite of all time, and that when people asked him what book to read before they died, this was it. The book did not turn out to be exactly what I expected it to be; there weren't any spaceships, laser ray guns, etc. Nevertheless, the book spoke to me in a way that no other book ever has. In a way it frightened me. The devastating results of nuclear war, radiation poisoning, and the loss of knowledge within humanity made me think about the future, and how actions of society at this time can shape the future of generations to come. Most importantly, however, is the underlying theme of responsibility. Take for instance, th &quot;scholar&quot; of the novel, Thon Taddeo. Ever thought about his last name? Fart and Trot. Avoiding the blame for his actions. Notice, also how Miller makes the novel take place over nearly 700 years. Brother Francis' experiences shape those of Brother Joshua. This book, I belive says more about the human existence than any other book I know of. That alone makes it science fiction. It is extrapolative.","A Canticle for Leibowitz is not a novel. Rather, it is 3 linked novellas concerning the Order of Saint Leibowitz. Each of these novellas have different focuses and at first glance, would seem to have little to do with the other novellas. However, when you get down to thinking about it, they are actually pieces of a united work.The first novella, Fiat Homo, is squarely about the Abbey of Saint Leibowitz and begins with the discovery of the Sacred Shopping List. It is the story of how the brothers seek to have Leibowitz officially recognized as a saint.The second novella, Fiat Lux, is an espionage thriller dealing with the diabolical plans of the Emperor of Texarkana for continental domination. The third novella, Fiat Voluntas Tua, deals with the Second Nuclear Age as the nations that arose from the ashes of the First Nuclear Age and the nuclear war that ended that age, grapple with both nuclear weapons and the knowledge that a previous civilization died from those weapons.As you can see, the 3 novellas deal with diverse subjects, but it is the way that Miller weaves his stories that the 3 become one.A Canticle For Leibowitz is a most intriguing and well executed book and should be required reading in classrooms today.","Walter Miller, Jr. had a vision of the future despite writing this 20 years ago. It is so applicable to todays threat of nuclear war or strikes. And each period describes today in a general way our universe as it exits today.I regret Walter Miller, Jr. committed suicide, and failed to live and see things as they exist today. He was a talented writer, and could have contributed so much more.I would recommend this book to any reader! It's an excellent work.","...but i might as well.i first read &quot;canticle for liebowitz&quot; some 30 years back when i was a high school student. (thanx for the recommendation, mrs solomon). since then, evry few years i have come back to it and with each re-reading find it a richer experience. miller's splendid storytelling weaves three related and distinct tales, each separated by six centuries, yet each linked by the commonality of the search for truth.i suppose the first section, laying out the tale of brother francis gerard of utah, is the most celebrated in that as in all trilogies, the first section is the one that most easily stands alone; but the two later sections are equally wonderful in portraying the battle among blind faith, informed faith, technological wisdom, and naivete -- all finally adding up to something akin to truth.and now to read the sequel, which has been sitting on my bookshelf for the past several months.if this WAS miller's only book, his is once again proof of the value of quality over quantity.","I am a Catholic campus minister- I used this book as part of a summer science fiction & Catholicism series to spice up our ministry offerings for college students. I had never read the book before and absolutely loved it. A dear friend of mine had just finished novitiate with a Benedictine monastery and the first third of the book so reminded me of him.Although the book is set in a post-nuclear apocalyptic future, it reveals our past, our traditions, and our human weaknesses.As for use with students, these were the themes that I was able to draw from the book for discussion topics:1. What is novitiate? How does one become a monk?2. How did monasteries maintain historical documents and literature over centuries?3. Why would the abbot be so distrusting of the young brother's strange revelation in the desert? Who was right?4. How are saints canonized?5. What is an illuminated text?6. How were monasteries seedbeds of science and technology?7. What is the significance & story behind the \"wandering Jew\"?8. How does the ending foreshadow America's abortion debate?9. Why is the abbot against mercy killings?All in all, great, very useful book. Should be read by all!","I have read \"A Canticle for Liebowitiz\" at least a half dozen times over the years and am constantly reminded why this novel has received its much deserved acclaim as a classic masterpiece.By now most readers should know that the setting is the post-apocalyptic future where civilization has been devastated by nuclear war. Isaac Liebowitz, a scientist who helped cause the war, establishes an order of monks charged with the mission of gathering and preserving all remnants of scientific knowledge. The first third of the novel takes place shortly after the devastation. The second third skips 600 years later with the final third commencing another 600 years after that.What the novel reflects is mankind's resiliency in surviving and rising from a catastrophic event to regenerate itself. What one man's mind has previously created can be recreated by another. But while all of mankind's brilliant achievements may again be replicated so may mankind's ability to destroy itself. While the theme of cyclic history is not new the manner which author Walter Miller pens it was, and is, very real to people in 1960 (when the novel first came out) who earnestly believed that a cataclysmic nuclear holocaust was inevitable.Other themes are embedded within the novel especially the philosophical debate between church and state. For me, \"A Canticle for Liebowitz\" is an ingenious work that was well ahead of its time. A classic masterpiece for sure.","I loved this book. I just finished it and I am trying to think of books that are better than this, and I can't think of many. I won't go into details, there are over 235 reviews to discuss this. I can only say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. Loved all short stories.Andre","Many good reviews here explain the book well enough. I'll only add that it seems clear that this book was one of the inspirations for the recent Battlestar Galactica reboot.Quickly, though, the book was very good. Miller was clearly a talented writer and the message he conveys is engaging and thought-provoking. Certainly deserves its lofty place in American Literature.","One of those books that is very difficult to put down once you've begun to read. Humor, suspence,mystery: there'll all here. Glad I purchased it. Thanks, Amazon!","I read this many years ago and just re-read it. It still holds up. Good Scifi for the thinking man.","Theme of this fifty-plus-year-old book -- written with some sardonic wit -- is what happens when nearly all recorded history is lost, and survivors have to reconstruct civilization almost from zero.To me, the book is a \"heads up\" for today. With our indifference to past events that predicted and create threats we now face, we could be headed to chaos similar to the destruction Mr. Miller wrote about.","The monks of Medieval times spent much of their life copying manuscripts in philosophy and theology that further generations would read, thus maintaining lost knowledge after the decline of Western civilization following the fall of the Roman Empire. Through their efforts and Islamic scholars classical Greek thought was introduced back into Europe and facilitated the reawakening of Europe.Now a nuclear holocaust has put humanity back into barbarism, and the monks are keeping blueprints of circuit designs and they have no idea what they mean, and a recipe of items that do not exist anymore. As time progresses humanity once again civilizes itself and the new scientists are interested in the data kept by the monks. It doesn't take long for one of the scientists to become at odds with the monks with his speculations.This is a classic, tragic tale of how the hubris of knowledge without the humility to use for a moral end will always bring disaster. Walter Miller was a disturbed figure, and it shows reading this. It was probably his mental disturbance that lead him to know so well the foibles of human beings and how easy it is to bring about destruction though ego thinly rationalized as good intentions.","7 January 1991\"A Canticle for Leibowitz\"A SF type of book about the end of the world and afterwards. It has many deep impenetrable meanings in its facade of Catholism, manhood, feudal empires, et al. They read and talk Latin, but do not know English from before Armageddon.","This book was required reading for a Lit class at UNC Chapel Hill, and for good reason. It brought together many of the themes we discussed over the course of the semester in a morbidly comic way that focused my attention like none of the other SF classics we read (Childhood's End, Starship Troopers, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Akira, etc.). I found the arguments around suicide near the end less than compelling, but the third act taken as a whole is powerful. Completing a second (final?) circle, the story will (should) leave you asking questions about history and humanity.Readers will find SF and religious themes and tropes warped in ways that are pleasantly challenging. From the disfigured Mrs. Grales who challenges conventional notions of the virgin birth to the low-tech treadmill generator of the 32nd century, Miller brings to life a future that is chillingly familiar and... hilarious. Miller even manages to make the Wandering Jew a powerful character.Worth the read. Keep google handy if you're not familiar with Catholicism or Christianity. If you like a harder edge, go instead for a book that tackles fewer themes: Neuromancer by William Gibson. It's another SF classic that will leave you wanting more.","I would echo everything on of the reviewers said about the use of the Jewish hermit as an observer of humanity, except for one thing - I came away thinking of the hermit as the Lazarus (risen from the grave) and not the repeat of the anti-Semitic slander.Miller weaves a tale which is as meaningful today as it was during the height of the Cold War. The Catholism and Latin segments are critical, not as a struggle of the authors own demons, but as a scaffold by which to measure the changes over 1800 years (and by implication, 3800 years). In other words, this is the only constant other than Mankind repeating the same errors.A brilliant read.","We grew up in the shadow of the very real possibility of nuclear warfare. As children we lived with the Red specter of the East haunting the outskirts of our otherwise safe and peaceful childhood. Our parents had just fought a long bloody war against a Nazi Germany and an Imperialistic Japan. We saw the black and white images of that war played across the grainy screens of a new modern wonder we called a television. But the Red menace of atomic warfare had no face we could see and focus on. Perhaps the sight of a silly old man at the UN pounding on the desk with his shoe as he threatened to bury us, was the closest personification we had of that threat. So we went through the 1950's and early 1960's. It would be another 30 some years before that Red specter collapsed under the weight of its own inconsistencies and illusions.Of all the nuclear apocalyptic literature of that era, A Canticle for Leibowitz remains the most profound and classic. It was one of the few Sci-Fi books I choose to keep in my library.After thirty some years, I recently read it again. From the perspective of an Evangelical Christian, I found it even more profound the second time around. Miller wrote Canticle during the Roman Catholic period of his life, but the issues and questions regarding the relationship of morality to science and life that he wrestles with in this book are fundamental to all of mankind as a whole.At the end of the book there is an allusion to the words of Jesus in Matthew 10:14-15. To understand that allusion, you will need to not only be familiar with that passage of the Bible, but also know that this last scene takes place around the year 3781 A.D., about 1800 years after the world had first blown itself up in nuclear warfare, out of which carnage it had relapsed back into another long dark age in which knowledge had once again been preserved in the monastery. Out of the ancient ashes of that 20th century collapse, civilization has finally risen again only to once again self-destruct.","I was given a copy of Walter M. Miller, Jr.'s, &quot;a Canticle for Leibowitz,&quot; by a design engineer when I was an electromechanical draftsman at the height of the defense/computer boom in the early 1980's. To say that I was delighted to discover the vocation of the Leibowitz of the title is an understatement. But that was only a very small part of what I found to be wondrous about this book. Nuclear holocaust was still uppermost in people's minds since it was pre- the fall of the Berlin wall and the dissolving of the USSR so the story was modern. There is morality and wit in the sanctifying and lampooning of organized religion throughout the text.Miller's writing is as finely wrought and scholarly as any illuminated religious script:&quot;...the abbott's frown, Brother Francis had come to observe, was the causative source of radiant energy which traveled through space with finite velocity and which was as yet not very well understood except in terms of its withering effect upon whatever thing absorbed it, that thing usually being a postulant or novice.&quot;Though dark, this novel carries a message of hope and is, above all, simply a good story carrying you along from start to finish. This book is as fresh and fine a piece of post-apocalyptic work as it must have been 40 years ago when it was first published.I am rereading this book for a fifth time now and am enjoying it as much now as I did the first time. I hope everyone else will, too!","A book in three related parts (Fiat Homo, Fiat Lux, Fiat Voluntas Tua) the first part, the story of Brother Francis, is a poignantly brilliant novella by itself. I loaned this book to a friend before she joined the Carmelite order and she told me that she laughed and cried as I did when I first read this. We both wondered what would have happened if Miller had stopped at the end with &quot;Fiat Homo&quot; as a standalone work. You don't have to be a Catholic (I'm not) to understand what Miller is doing - he's putting a human face on, of all things, humanity. I don't want to say much about the content of this book (it's pretty easy to find out too much by reading these reviews) but recommend you check out a copy from your local library (which BETTER own this award winning novel) just for &quot;Fiat Homo.&quot; I'd love to sit down with a rabbi, an imam, and a Jesuit who've all read this for their insights on the universality of the human condition. -- P.S. This is another book that suffers from being stamped as &quot;Science Fiction.&quot; Those who will enjoy this the most are least likely to read it.","Absolutely the most profound book I have ever read. I read it first as a teenager and initially found it amusing and was suckered in by the humourous exploits of the simple-minded Francis, only to be horrified and moved by the end of the book. I will further comment that, like _The Exorcist_, it is a book which can be most appreciated by one who was raised in the Catholic faith, though it is an excellent read for anyone. Being fluent in Latin wouldn't hurt, either. I have read it no fewer than ten times in the past eighteen years or so, and always come away from it staggered, and utterly amazed that I find something new, different, and profound with each read. This is not a book for the dimwitted or unimaginitive, and you should not expect quick or easy gratification from it. Nor should you expect to grasp it entirely on the first or even second read. I spent half a semester dissecting this book in a literature class in college, and still to this day find new aspects each time I read it.Incidently, _Fiat Voluntas Tua_ usually translates as &quot;Thy will Be Done&quot; (as in the line from the Lord's Prayer), which does not bode well for the characters of the third section of the book, or for mankind as a whole._Fiat Lux_ is &quot;Let there be Light&quot; and _Fiat Homo_ is &quot;Let there be Man&quot;.A _canticle_ is a holy song of praise, as might be sung in the Church in celebration of a Saint (i.e. Leibowitz).This book has occasionally been referred to as a youth's book. Though as a teenager I enjoyed the book immensely, I can hardly see Miller writing such graphic and horrific passages dealing with mature subjects like cannibalism, warfare, euthanasia, and injury and death associated with nuclear detonation, with children or teens in mind.Miller has quite a sense of humour, and if the reader is literate at all he will find himself getting many good belly laughs out of the book. But do not mistake the fact that Miller is deadly serious about the subject matter. I assure you that you will not be laughing at the final few paragraphs.That is the really the charm of this book, you know, that Miller uses wit and an (initially) deceptively simple plot to gently introduce and bind us to some concepts which few can take pleasure from, but whose implications are profound in the extreme.I have lately been wrestling with a real life analogue of the &quot;abominable autoscribe&quot; (Kurzweil Voice for Windows) and in doing so have noted an eerie parallel with the book. One can only wonder what other concepts imagined by Miller will come to life &lt;gulp&gt;","It took me years to get through this book. Honest. And I'm a fast reader, going through at least a book a week. I first picked this up about ten years ago and couldn't get past the first ten pages. I've tried several more times over the past decade, never getting beyond page 20. I finally forced myself to sit and read it all the way through. Was it worth it? Yes... and no.The concept is brilliant, and the concept is what makes A Canticle for Leibowitz deserving of being called a classic. The end of the world as we know it has come, and people are forced to survive as best they can. Most people chose to survive by throwing away everything that seemed related to causing the end - from modern day conveniences, such as electricity, to the basics of civilization, such as books. From this new beginning, post-apocolypse, the reader is taken on a journey spaning thousands of years. It is truly an awe inspiring journey, and leaves the reader both sad and hopeful for humanity.BUT - and this is a big but - the reader isn't given a single character to relate to during this journey. Or a single character to like. With no one to root for, other than a Wandering Jew character seen occassionally, the reader is left without any real desire to see how the book ends. And worse, the reader doesn't really care.I do agree that this is a must read for any hardcore sci fi buff, and for anyone that enjoys end of the world books. But be prepared to struggle through it and to feel somewhat underwhelmed by the end.","This is one of the best post-apocalyptic novels I have ever read. Even though the novel spans over a thousand years, there are constants: a monastery, Latin and the Roman Catholic Church.The premise of the novel is that at some point in the 20th century, there was a nuclear war that almost destroyed humanity. Those who survived turned their fury on the scientists they thought were responsible for unleashing nuclear weapons on the world. Soon, the mob began to attack the educated, the literate, all those thought to be associated with the scientists. The collective knowledge of all humanity would have perished except for the efforts of Leibowitz, a man who tried to preserve fragments of knowledge amidst an almost overwhelming climate of fanatic anti-intellectualism.Centuries later, a monastic order, which legend says was founded by Leibowitz, holds the world's knowledge, by copying books and memorizing texts until the world was ready for it. At one point, a monk discovers a 20th century nuclear fall out bunker and attempts to understand its contents. It is interesting to note that he finds \"pre-Deluge\" English difficult and he thinks that \"Fallout\" is a beast or monster, instead of a side effect from nuclear weaponry.The next section takes place several centuries after the first. There is something of a recovery under way, some primitive electrical devices are created and there is a drive to revive learning outside the Church. Also, the warring factions of the former United States are slowly being conquered to form a single whole. As the secular centers of learning gain strength, the old rivalry between the educated clergy and the educated secular man resumes again.The last part takes place around 3750 A.D., almost two thousand years from the present. At this point, the world has been united into a few factions (Asia and North America-Europe), nuclear weapons have been developed and advanced space travel is available. The monastery continues to exist, although some new buildings have been added and now the monks are engaged in science. Then, there is a mysterious explosion somewhere in the Pacific. It triggers a second global war, but this time the Church was prepared. Over a generation before this, the Church prepared a contingency plan. In the event of nuclear war, the Church would send enough priests, bishops etc.. to reestablish the Church elsewhere, even though Earth perishes.Now you know something about the book, you might ask, \"Why did you like it?\" As am I something of a history buff, I found it fascinating that the Roman Catholic Church preserved knowledge single-handedly in the novel somewhat similarly to the fall of the Roman Empire (in reality, the Arabs and the Byzantines played a major part in preserving the heritage of Greco-Roman civilization). The novel took religion seriously; indeed monks are the stars of this novel, yet the novel never becomes preachy. There were great scenes in the book too; an Abbot (the ruler of a monastery) mediates on whether humanity is doomed to destroy Earth using nuclear weapons, rebuild and do it all over again, a secular scholar and an Abbot argue in a matter reminiscent of the current evolution-creation debate. The epic scale of the book which spans almost two thousand years is executed remarkably well, although it is jarring to end section and begin the next knowing all the characters you got to know have long since died.The only drawback to the novel, for me, was that the monks often use Latin, in their chants, letters etc... and well, I just don't know Latin. Sometimes, it is translated but more often than not, it is simply left. The effect is to remind the reader that the Church is as a nearly eternal organization; century in, century out, everything is the same. Yet, not all is the same.I thoroughly enjoyed the novel; a very satisfying read overall.","William M. Miller's A Canticle for Leibowitz sits on shelves with the masterworks of 20th Century science-fiction, like Dune, Stranger in a Strange Land, and Alas, Babylon. Perhaps the first book (aside from pulp novels) that dreamed of a far-future, post-nuclear scenario, Canticle set new standards not only for science fiction, but it more or less spawned the genre engaged in serious examinations of the long-term effects of the breakdown of civilization. Where Alas, Babylon and Earth Abides talk about the immediate effects of apocalypse, Canticle starts thousands of years in the future, and centers around a monastery somewhere in Utah, where the Order of Leibowitz keeps watch on ancient books from before some nameless war - endlessly copying them, but unable to comprehend what they mean.One day, a young acolyte stumbles into an old Fallout shelter (he wasn't sure what a Fallout was, but he didn't want to meet one!) and discovers the remains of what appear to be Leibowitz himself (or one of his family members) - along with some holy artifacts. This pressures the church to name Leibowitz a real saint, and gives the abbey a much-needed boost in funding. Cut to a few hundred years in the future. The abbey prepares to host a young nobleman who has discovered an ancient secret - electricity. He uses the abbey's books to make a contraption work that generates light from a tiny glass bulb. Cut another thousand years in the future. Where has all this new progress led? It's not difficult to guess.Miller has a knack for prose, creating and developing likable characters and taking the reader on a personal tour through his labyrinth of personalities. He keeps the reader grounded in the big picture by forcing him or her to care about a character, and then ripping that character out of the story in a disconcerting fashion. It's a technique that works, and works well, as the ultimate moral of the story is humankind's eternal drive to destroy itself.And there is the rub: it's a cynical message told for the first time by a special author. That colleges still teach Canticle is a testament to its value as literature, but Canticle's message has been done so many times by now, in books, film, comics, and every other pop culture outlet, that it has lost its impact amidst a sea of imitators. It's like trying to tell someone \"I got the concert t-shirt first!\" - they just don't care, because they have one, too. And it's an unfortunate fate for such a fine novel.But it serves another purpose as well: with the dismantling of the two main nuclear superpowers, there's a degree of hope in modern life that Canticle never could have had. While we still run the risk of wiping ourselves out, it's something that has taken less precedence over smaller, more concentrated acts of violence. Those are things we can deal with; the annihilation of our entire civilization is something much larger. Even if Canticle stands as a mile-marker in human progress, it's an important one, and one to recommend to all sci-fi fans.","This book is an excellent depiction of post-apocalyptic life and church politics. Some of his assumptions are wrong (such as the fact that a large portion in Latin) The Latin isn't really a problem, however; the important parts are mostly translated and the rest is only supplementary. There is a delicate balance of humor and realism that makes the story wonderful to read. This is inherently a timeless novel. We gradually learn that after a nuclear war, the common people, 'simpletons', blamed the intellectuals for the destruction, burning books and lynching the learned. I.E. Leibowitz rebelled against this and fought to save knowledge, forming an order devoted to saving knowledge. The book consists of three novellas, each one covering less and less time and farther in the future. Each reveals something new about the world as it stands then and shows mankind's advancement. Miller wrote this when Communist paranoia was high, in the time of bomb shelters and paranoia. At the time, it was entirely possible that a set of explosions could devastate the world; he writes as such. He wrote far enough in the future that these situations could still occur, creating a piece that's universally accepted. Sadly, he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head in 1997. This book requires a fairly large chunk of time invested to read but certainly pays off. It many good points about mankind and our nature while remaining readable and is very well written, making it one of the best pieces of science fiction I've ever read. If you have the time, you should read this book.","Walter M. Miller Jr.s' magnum opus, constantly in print from the date of its publication, this work is considered by many to be the most beautifully artistic work of Sci-Fi ever written. In three parts, (Fiat Homo, Fiat Lux, Fiat Voluntas Tua,) it traces the future history of man from a post-thermonuclear dark age, through the re-invention of electricity, and back to the brink of self destruction. Written as an explicitly Roman Catholic and pre-Vatican II novel, the story revolves about a monastery named for the titular character, who never appears on screen. A basic knowledge of Latin or a willingness to look up a term every other chapter, and an ability to suspend any anti-Catholic bias will be necessary. But the work is one of worship for heroic effort, of principles upheld, and values passionately pursued. Miller's sense of history and discerning psychological skill lead to vistas and characterizations of Herbertian depth. With the wry dark wit of a Cold War culture that produced Strangelove and Planet of the Apes, irony wrestles with ecstasy. Leibowitz is a Jew, canonized by the Church for accidental reasons. Spanning centuries, another strand woven throughout is the apocryphal Christian persona, the Wandering Jew, condemned to walk the Earth 'til Christ return. Miller's language is unsurpassingly poetic, his words evoking imagery of Randian clarity. I have read this book three times through. Miller was known primarily as a writer of short stories, often, as in Dark Benediction, of great skill and originality. He led a troubled later life, and never finished another novel. The posthumous, disillusioned and anti-climactic Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman was finished by a ghost writer. But this masterpiece has all the pathos and beauty of a great mediaeval cathedral, altar piece included.","Miller's work done in A Canticle for Leibowitz is an insightful reflection on the nature of human work, The Catholic Church, and its direction for the edification of culture. The themes undertaken in the work are heavily laden with his view of Catholicism, and he uses his faith to argue a point that is as pertinent to the world today as it was at the time of the work's writing.Although there are three chronologically distinct sections in the book, one theme permeates it. In the first section, the story progresses as the fabled Blessed Leibowitz is investigated for full Canonization based upon the findings of one Br. Francis. The first section is most importantly a reflection on the work done to preserve the \"memorabilia\" of human culture after nuclear fallout. The monks of the Albatian Order of Leibowitz work to preserve those works that they can find, followed by prudence and the grace of God, so that the world may one day relearn the knowledge which it destroyed after the fallout.This theme is picked up in the second section as the Utah Monastery is visited by a secular scientist, Thon Taddeo, who is interested in the records kept by the monks. The story in this section reflects on the course of human action and how it should be related to the individual, the state, and to God. It is during this time that the Second Renaissance occurs after the fallout, and the Church once again argues about the nobility of directing work to the glory of God and not to the good of a state (or individual) which (who) has imposed itself as a god. The attitudes of the monks are contrasted with the views of Taddeo and the state which he represents.The final section views the second modernity and the perils which have developed with the forces of secularization. For the sake of not spoiling the story, I will not say much about this section other than it functions to show the outcome of the reflections undertaken in the first two sections.A Canticle for Leibowitz is an excellent reflection on the nature of human work (as well as many other matters as they develop throughout the story). It offers a counsel for direction which is especially needed in this very day.","In books, the themes of a story are often sketched by their genre. Normally, authors are cautious in using themes that fall outside of familiarity, and this is too bad. Genius rides on originality; and A Canticle for Leibowitz is original, ignoring genre altogether and being much the better for it. Although, on the surface, an engaging story about monks in a desert preserving literature in a post-apocalyptic world, there are deep undercurrents running in this book that smack of theological struggle, true virtue and an excellent examination of the definition of humanity.The originality extends to important little things, like the pace of the story. None of the chapters is particularly short, but neither are they laborious or could be said to be long. Everything seems to fit just right. Excellence in a human invention is always marked by effective simplicity, and Miller's book is effectively simple.Lastly, Miller seems to have an amazing sense of timing when it comes to expanding the scale of his story. He can swoop the reader effortlessly from the struggles of an ornery hermit in the desert to the passing of centuries, and manages to keep the reader comfortable with everything going on.On the whole, I never got bored, I wanted to know what was coming next, and when the story was over, I had that satisfied feeling of an appetite for genius satiated.","A Canticle for Leibowitz is one the few science fiction novels elevated to the status of high literature by the literati, even as they relegate the rest to us hoi polloi. Miller's first (and almost only) novel rightly belongs on the shelf next to George Orwell and Aldous Huxley. Like 1984 and Brave New World, Canticle is a negative utopia, but unlike either of them, this novel does not exist to point out the dangers of any one extreme, but to weave together an ironic tale of a society which slowly meanders from one extreme to another so as to illustrate how one state of affairs ultimately leads to its opposite.Miller served in the Italian theatre during World War II, participating in the infamous shelling of Montecassino, a monastery built by St. Bennedict in the 4th century. The shelling devestated the ancient structure, which had also been repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt in previous centuries.This book is Miller's penance.The cyclical nature of Montecassino's rise and fall was not lost on Mr. Miller, nor was the fact that the monastery was built upon the ruins of a Roman citadel that also had fallen. Over the millenia, Montecassino saw glory and decline several times, much like the history of the western world.The book is divided into three sections that mirror western civiliation's own cyclical rise and fall. The first section, entitled Fiat Lux, is a post apocalyptic world that bears a striking resemblence to the middle ages. Here, we are introduced to the order of Liebowitz, a monastic community devoted to its founder. The monks take a long view concerning their namesake's canonization, as well as everything else in their lives. To emphasize this point, we meet Francis, a monk whose life reflects the values inherent in his time. Our visit with Francis is doomed to end, however, because the narrative shifts six hundred years into a Renaissance, and again to a scientific age. The shifts in surroundings are less jarring than the abrupt change in values exhibited by the world at large. One constant, however, is the attitude displayed at the order of the Blessed (and finally Saint) Leibowitz.The anger with with Miller writes this book is famously recognized. What is less clear is exactly what Miller rages against. What appears to be a critique of ignorance might be a disguised defense of it, and a condemnation of dangers of knowledge. Perhaps, on the other hand, the real danger is only the use of knowledge. The one conclusion this reader can make is that Miller doesn't warn us any one element of progress, but of the process itself.To describe the narrative further would be to give away too much. Suffice it to say that several of the voices in this novel may be Miller's, or may be your own. In fact, the lesson this novel teaches is too ambiguous not to depend on your interpretation. That is perhaps, what makes it great.","Having grown up watching 1950s sci fi I was familiar with many of the Doomsday tropes from such films as The World, The Flesh, & The Devil, & On The Beach. Most were fairly pessimistic. So, I was a bit surprised when I picked up & read Walter Miller's A Canticle For Leibowitz, in that it both used & subverted the genre & its tropes. The book is not really a novel, but 3 linked novellas that follow the Resurrection of Mankind after a 20th Century nuclear exchange, through the prism of a secretive order of Catholic priests, in the Utah desert, that prevent the total barbarism of what was once the United States of America. The 3 novellas are set about 600, 1200, & 1800 years in the future.The 3 sections of A Canticle for Leibowitz give, at the same time, a cyclical view of history that's pessimistic, yet hopeful. Even the long suffered for knowledge of the past the Leibowitzians preserved cannot save humanity from near-annihilation, yet it is only near-annihilation. Humanity perdures. There is also a watcher- the only character that appears in all 3 tales- a combination of the desert wandering Jew & Lazarus- a deathless figure.The book deals with many issues- large & small. For example, there is the recurring theme that most people work for purposes they have no grasp on. In part 1 Brother Francis wastes 15 years copying a Holy Liebowitzian artifact, only to have it stolen. In Part 2 Brother Kornhoer follows ancient blueprints & builds an electric light, unaware that he was doing so. Another theme is how history is shaped as much by its recorders as its participants. Just how much we think we know of the Mayas, Phoenicians, Chinese, Minoans, or even Neandertals, etc. may be our own imposition of biases, rather than fact.Given that the book was written in 1959, during Cold War hysteria, yet is still relevant, is a good endorsement of its timeless quality. Yes, the idea that any organized religion- in this case Roman Catholicism- represents an answer, rather than a problem, is a bit of Miller's own n&auml;ive-t&eacute; &/or bias leaking through. After all, he portrays the Church as an unchanging vehicle for ignorance whether it be in the Dark Ages, our time, or the 3 future periods of mankind- a highly suspect proposition in the post-9/11 world. This is but a minor quibble, though, for the overriding point is it's a good tale- whose overall narrative takes precedent over any individual.Although most post-Apocalyptic tales tend to be either to too gloomy or too optimistic, A Canticle For Leibowitz strikes a believable balance. Would that its subjects could do the same the book would be as superfluous as the devotion to the Blessed shopping list!","I bought this through the Scholastic Book Club nearly 40 years ago when I was in 7th grade. I understand it now, and I love it even more. I can see why it was one of Walker Percy's favorite books. The author had a fine -- and sad -- understanding of human nature. Nothing really changes, you know?","This book was recommended by a history professor I had while attending a Catholic college. Instead of a novel, Canticle for Leibowiz gives us three connected short stories.The first divulges the events surrounding the canonization of St. Leibowitz, an engineer from the long dead 20th century who founded an order to preserve knowledge during a post-nuclear holocaust time of book burnings. There is a little sly humor here as the characters misunderstand what is, to them, ancient history. For example, &quot;fallout&quot; is assumed to be some kind of demon that accompanied the &quot;flame Deluge&quot;. So there is great puzzlement as to why someone would want to protect them in a &quot;fallout shelter&quot;. However, Brother Francis, the main character of this section, is pretty much a simpleton who merely flows with the course of history. This isn't his story; the story happens at him.If the first story chronicles a time of the new Dark Ages, the second story plays out at the dawn of the new Renaissance. A scholar arrives at the abbey to pore over the records they have preserved, only to discover that one of the brothers has created a rudimentary generator and electric light. However, much of this section seems to involve discussion of the mired politics between a neighboring empire and New Rome. There's a lot of telling regarding off-screen characters, leaving less room to show the main characters.Fortunately, the third story does a lot towards redemption of the book. Society has once again gained technological prowess and has, once again, let slip the dogs of nuclear war. Zerchi, the current abbot of the monastery, faces two crises: a plan to take to the stars to preserve the Church, and the more immediate concern of government-sponsored euthenasia for those deemed hopelessly irradiated. Though there is a sense of history (characters from the previous sections are obliquely referenced), Zerchi doesn't seem drowned in it. Whether you consider his actions right or wrong, they are *his* actions, and the rationale for them is made plain, which makes him a more compelling character.All in all, this isn't a bad piece of storytelling (though there is a disconcerting profusion of Latin), but with the exception of the dialogue between Zerchi and Dr. Cors about God and suffering, there wasn't much that stuck with me.","Canticle is one of the best post-holocaust stories ever written. Told in three separate sections that were originally published as separate stories, it details a post-nuclear war society where (once more) the Catholic church has become the repository for what little learning there still is, complete with monk scribes happily copying by hand the few remaining books. But at least for the first section of the book, the scribes don't understand what they're copying. When they uncover some ancient relics of Saint Leibowitz (a twentieth century engineer who tried to stop the book burnings and other atrocities) they end up enshrining one of his grocery lists and venerate a common blue-print as rare and sacred. Later portions of the book detail the resurgence of science, fueled by the church's repositories of knowledge, but as becomes increasingly obvious as you go further in the book, there is still no change in mankind's basic human nature, and war enters the picture again (and again) - covering almost a two-thousand year span.There is a large amount of ironical humor suffused throughout this book, which makes its prime message that man is doomed to continuously repeat his mistakes, leavened only by the love of a distant God, much easier to take. In many ways this book is a hard look at both the ultimate value of religion and at basic human nature, couched alongside some heavy symbolism (the Wandering Jew makes multiple appearances) and some very sharp satire. The story itself is told with such emotional power that I found myself both plumbing the depths of despair and laughing uproariously, while the moral and ethical questions raised kept poking sharp daggers into my under-brain, just waiting for the chance to come to the fore of my consciousness and force me to re-live this book again and again.Within each section of the book, characterization is excellent, from the young initiate Francis in the first section to the Caesar-like Hannegan and Brother Taddeo of the middle section to Abbot Zerchi of the final section. But the very fact that it is told as three separate stories leads to a little disjointedness, as the characters you have come to know and love in one section disappear in the next and a whole new set make their appearance. The unifying force between these sections is obviously the church, the one constant across all the years, and this provides the foundation for not only the story, but a framework for all the philosophical questions to reverberate against. Questions of is man inherently evil, what role God should play in an individual's life and his surrounding society, when does pride become hubris, what constitutes sin and can an earthly representative of God truly provide forgiveness, why do good deeds so often seem to lead to bad consequences, and many more. Miller does not really provide any answers to these questions - nor should he, as these questions are really only answerable at the individual level, but his story provides some powerful illumination of these questions, and his ending does leave some room for possibly the most enduring of human emotions, hope.This book is what science fiction should be, a book that enlightens what the human condition is within a context of an all-too believable future world, literate and profound without hammering the reader on the head. Winner of the 1961 Hugo award, it clearly out-classed all the other contenders for that year, and ranks as one of the best the field has to offer.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)","What more is there to say about this innovative work from the Age of Nuclear Terror? In those times we were assured by our &quot;leaders&quot; that a &quot;balance of power&quot; was the way to keep peace. Those with an IQ greater than room temperature, however, well knew that one finger on one button in one second could obliterate the world. Many writers sought to wake America to the threat they had created. FAIL SAFE, DR STRANGELOVE, the list of works explaining how the nuclear holocaust could occur expanded in this era. Few writers addressed &quot;the Day After&quot;. CANTICLE was almost the first to picture the aftermath. Harlan Ellison's incisive analysis A BOY AND HIS DOG, honouring directly Miller's groundbreaking work, essentially closed the genre.This Miller's tale is a vivid examination of the workings of the American mind. America in the 1950's was a seething cauldron of anti-intellectualism, of distrust of the learned and the innovative. When CANTICLE was published, America was coming to the end of the Eisenhower presidency, the eight years that &quot;showed America could do without a President&quot;. Social programs, education, health care had all been pushed aside in favour of intense military buildup and corporate expansion. With a simple-minded ex-general in the White House, the hovering threat of a &quot;flame deluge&quot; was at the forefront of most minds. The McCarthyite inquisition was the blatant expression of American fears. Miller's rising new governments exhibit a similar desire for mind control, with predictable results.Miller's use of Mother Church as the sole organized survivor of the nuclear exchange was inspired. Catholicism was viewed with suspicion in America. The debate over John Kennedy's presidential candidacy the following year demonstrated the feelings the Church engendered. Yet, Miller got it exactly right. No other institution in America would likely have survived the Flame Deluge. Neither government nor the military commanded the talents nor ability to bring continuity to those who survived. How ironic in the fundamentalist America of CANTICLE that Miller could successfully raise this issue.An even greater irony is the Beatification of Isaac Edward Leibowitz, descended of Polish Jews, by an American Catholic monastery. Jews were subjected to the same distrust from America's Silent Majority as Roman Catholics. One facet of that suspicion related to the numbers of Jews in universities, technical programs and science. Anti-Semitism and anti- intellectualism resided in the minds of many &quot;Middle Americans.&quot; Leibowitz parades through this story as mythical figure with a dual role - the founder of the Bookleggers and representative intellectual, and perhaps, in the symbolic Wandering Jew who reappears time and again over the centuries after the Deluge. Miller's handling of Leibowitz and the desert hermit is without equal in the literature of the time or today. The image of a admonitory Prophet has nearly disappeared in today's writing, making CANTICLE valuable for its timelessness.More than simply fine writing and innovative thinking, CANTICLE has a message that remains valid today. The rendering of the Berlin Wall and the breakup of the Soviet Union has not brought peace nor stability to the world. Wars, especially religious wars, are occurring with increasing, not diminishing frequency and intensity. We have brushed with enlarging one or more of those conflicts more than once. Miller's warning message remains valid and should be read by the new generation. Remember, the source of the Flame Deluge still resides in those Prairie silos and hidden Red Octobers, both Russian and American. Read this book and find out what that might mean.","The premise is fascinating: A nuclear war in the 20th century sends surviving humanity back into a second Dark Age. 18 centuries later, humanity is finally modernized again to a point roughly 2 centuries more advanced than the height of the prior civilization (complete with space travel to other solar systems), only to fall again in a second nuclear war. Relics and information from prior to the first nuclear war are preserved and protected by a succession of Catholic monks.The novel begins 600 years after the first war. It ends with the second war 1200 years later (or 1800 years after the first war). It is ultimately a story of the peculiar self-destructive cycle of the human race seen through the eyes of the monks and abbots of the strict Catholic Church.What a fascinating idea! Unfortunately, I found it hard to get through. It bogged down in philosophical discourse complete with annoying passages of Latin. Sorry, but I didn't feel abliged to follow along with a translator. The writing was a little too \"creative\" and high-and-mighty for my taste. The person who wrote the intro in the copy I had made the claim that there was a difference between \"fiction\" and \"literature\" and Canticle for Leibowitz falls into the rarified air of \"literature.\" Why, just because of the Latin and convoluted prose? I don't think so.Still, it was just good enough to hold my attention and I closed the book feeling entertained if a bit annoyed. I have to admit that the subject matter and the 1200 year timeline must have made for a challenging writing project for the author. And, somehow he makes it work--just.","Drawing many parallels between the European dark age which followed the collapse of the Roman Empire around AD 476, and a dark age on planet earth which comes after a nuclear war in the twentieth century, this brilliant book is the story of an order of Roman Catholic monks whose founder (or at least inspiration) was a twentieth-century Jewish scientist whose life work helped place humanity in the very darkness his order seeks to combat. The monks of the Order of the Blessed Leibowitz keep written knowledge in the library of their monastery in the desert of what had, six and more centuries before, been the southwestern United States. The monks live in a world wrecked and ruined by the \"flame deluge' as the semi-mythical nuclear war of a technologically glorious past age is called. What had been the United States of America is, like Europe after the loss of central Roman authority, divided into a number of petty kingdoms, who make war on one another on an almost non-stop basis. In this time of rebuilding and place where genetic mutants are as common as lepers were in the landscape of the Middle Ages, the one light of learning left on a planet of illiterate savages is the Roman Catholic Church, now headquartered near the river confluence that had once been the site of St. Louis, Missouri.In the first section of this novel, entitled Fiat Homo (Let There Be Man) a young man in training for the life of monk, discovers a ruin from the age of the flame deluge that holds within it relics of the great scientist Leibowitz, upon whose work the order was founded centuries ago. The young Catholic Brother is sent by his superiors on a journey to present his discovery to the court of the Holy Father, and the description of his pilgrimage across a broken, danger-ridden landscape makes up much of this first section.The second part of A Canticle For Leibowitz, Fiat Lux ( Let There Be Light) takes place several hundred years into the future of the first section and sees the world in a slightly better state. Nations have replaced the warlord-run petty kingdoms of the past and technology has advanced to a level where gunpowder is again employed. Against the wishes of the men of God, a terrible war between the nations of Texarkana and Denver is about to be fought, and the rulers of Texarkana are allying with barbarian forces who dwell on the great grasslands, herding cattle and maintaining a horse-worshiping nomadic life. To the abbey of the Order of Leibowitz is sent a delegation from Texarkana, which contains a man of such intellect and learning that his like had not been seen since the time of Leonardo. This man is enthusiastically greeted by the monks of the Order, who have long awaited such an individual to whom they can show their precious library in the hopes he might make use of their knowledge and aid mankind in its quest for a return to technological greatness.The concluding section of this novel is set more than a thousand years into the future from where it began, and is called Fiat Voluntas Tua (Thy Will Be Done). The world of this age has advanced to surpass in technology, population and capability that of the twentieth century at the time of the flame deluge (as our world has surpassed that of Rome). The Order of Leibowitz is still extant, though in an irreligious age, al but forgotten. The learned leaders of the Order see that mankind will go on throughout its existence making the same mistakes over and over no matter how many chances God in his patience affords it. For that reason, with the threat of another nuclear war looming, the Order has devised a spaceship from which a select group of colonists may leave behind the earth in the hopes of founding a better world in some far away corner of the galaxy. The ship is no sooner launched than the war comes and society again falls into darkness, and the thoughts of a dying monk, perhaps the very last member of the Order of Leibowitz, is on how tired God must be of the folly of man to waste all it is capable of with the many gifts it has been given.Walter Miller's novel is a fantastic vision of how things might truly be if (when) our society collapses, for whatever reason. I really found my mind stimulated by the concepts here, with history presented on a grand scale and the psychology of humankind explored, judged, convicted of its inherent tragic failings. This ranks among my all-time favorite books.","The three sections of the book project into the post-nuclear world of the 27th century, the 32nd century, and the 37th century. Each section follows the activities of a religious order of monks who were the sole recipient of knowledge during a centuries-long dark age. As the centuries pass, a civilization slowly emerges, and is ready to make use of the documents from our age which hint tantalizingly at the secrets of \"electrical essence\" and the rest of the scientific discoveries that man made in the days leading up to the nuclear era. The first book is undoubtedly the best of the three, having the advantages of unveiling the futuristic world that Miller has dreamed up, and also the best character in Francis, an aspiring monk with a heart of gold that may have been the magnet for a miracle. By the end of the third book, a new nuclear war is threatening to break out, and the monks are considering taking to the stars to keep the flame of humanity burning bright. The book draws on religious themes, with lots of theological and moral arguments being made by the various characters.The Good and the Bad:I loved the first half of the book or so, and couldn't get enough of learning about the post-apocalyptic world and the characters who populated it. The story had a very faint quality of artificiality, especially when it came to politics, but generally, the strengths of the plot and characters overcame this. The character of Francis was very engaging for his sweetness and almost gump-like simplicity, and his murder at the hands of cannibalistic mutants was a shock that required rereading. The longer the book goes, however, the more the characters began to feel like vessels for theological and moral arguments, and the final few chapters are so steeped in religion that it was difficult for me to finish. The fascinating story, involving a basic conflict between an abbot and a doctor on the morality of encouraging radiation victims to commit suicide, takes a back seat to dreams and symbols that are less compelling. Overall, the book has those ingredients that make a classic; an inspired background, intriguing human interactions, and philosophical statements all coexist on the same pages. The warnings against nuclear war must have seemed especially relevant when the book was first published in 1959.What I learned:This book gave me an appreciation for the intricate inner workings of the Catholic Church. I grew to appreciate the seriousness of sanctity, as it is built on an unbroken chain of tradition that has been passed on for thousands of years.","If science fiction fans had an organization equivalent to Gideons International, dedicated to disseminating the sacred texts of the genre along the traffic lanes of life, you would find a copy of A Canticle for Leibowitz lying next to the Gideons Bible every time you slid open the night stand in your motel/hotel room. It would be stamped AOL (Abbey of the Order of Leibowitz), and it would be a call to the faithful, a reminder of just how good sci-fi CAN be, when brilliant wordsmithing, sophisticated humor, and an excellent tale are couched in richly layered philosophy and theology.The tale itself is bi-apocalyptic, in and of itself filling a very sparsely populated niche. Beginning with Francis, a young applicant to the Brotherhood of the Order of Leibowitz, fasting and praying in the post nuclear war ruins of what had 600 years earlier been the United States, and subsequently stumbling upon an intact fallout shelter, a story spanning many centuries unfurls. Technology reawakens, Lucifer in nuclear form begins once more to stalk the earth.William Miller Jr. published his only novel (the sequel to Canticle was not written by Miller) in 1959. The date is important for context. The Cuban Missile Crisis, arguably the closest that mankind ever came to nuclear annihilation, was a mere three years in the future. The threat of nuclear war was pervasive, a common topic in magazines as popular as Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News and World Report was the building of fallout shelters; every major U.S. city had designated underground shelters for civilians stocked with olive drab square five gallon tins containing water, medical supplies, and survival biscuits that tasted something like a cross between dust and graham crackers. Virtually every school routinely went through nuclear war drills, in which the Civil Defense sirens would go off, the students would \"duck and cover\" under their desks to wait until the all clear signal was given. Daytime images of Nikita Khrushchev pounding his shoe on the lectern and saying \"We will annihilate you\" merged in my mind with the 2 AM growl and roar of the Strategic Air Command nuclear armed B-52's doing practice launches against the USSR from nearby Beale Air Force Base. Few books, if any, have captured the ubiquitous dread of those years as well as Miller's.At the same time, the Catholic Church with its pre-Vatican II liturgy in full Latin throat, was at a peak in terms of mystery and majesty, long before its loss of priest and nun vocations, long before what atheist Christopher Hutchens refers to as the Church's \"No Child's Behind Left policy\" become a scourge of the Church's image. Miller's depiction of postulant training, the role of the Church in the preservation of pre-apocalyptic knowledge (including the mysterious sacred relic from St. Leibowitz himself that reads \"Pound pastrami, can kraut, six bagels\"), and the Church's role in trying to preserve the gentle candle light of the soul side by side with the eyeball frying arc welder light of technology is mesmerizing, nuanced, and yes, brilliant, hearkening back to the role of the Church as protector and promoter of knowledge during the Dark Ages. If there is much that is dated (and there isn't much) about this tale, it is the idea of the contemporary Catholic Church as a beacon in the age of intellectual darkness.There are other sci-fi tales that eschew space opera and military hardware to examine the role of religion in an age of nearly omnipotent technology, e.g. Mary Doria Russell'sThe Sparrow, a gentle but provocative tale of the Jesuits privately financing an expedition to make first contact with a nearby alien civilization. But there is something special in the intensity of the technology versus science duel in Canticle for Leibowitz, the awkward waltz that results when the two ways of knowledge WANT to dance, but can't avoid treading each other's toes into pulp. I suspect the articulate, profound, and tragic conversation on the topic is a direct reflection of William Miller Jr.'s own trichotomy: an excellent scientist, a man of liberal arts education, a person of great religious passion. It was no small struggle for Miller to resolve, who eventually took his own life.Miller's quest in this book, though, is not to give us one more iteration of the potential conflict between science and religious faith (though he does address this), it is a bigger fish, maybe a Leviathan, that is at the core of his search: does the very nature of being human condemn us to endless cycles of destruction and redemption. Poignant, haunting, and uncommonly accurate in depiction, A Canticle for Leibowitz functions as a sort of Hubble Space Telescope turned towards the surface of the Earth, rather than towards the stars, with the resulting images no less spell-binding. Bravo, William Miller, Jr., and thanks for the gift you bequeathed to us.","It was with some trepidation that I sat down to read \"A Chronicle for Leibowitz\" for the fourth time, and for the first time in two decades. Could it possibly be as good as I remembered it? Would the great-granddaddy of all nuclear apocalypse books seem like a period piece, now that we know mankind has dodged the mushroom-shaped bullet?It was better than I remembered it. There's so much wisdom, so much breadth of sympathy for humanity in every state of belief and unbelief, so much erudition, so many sly jokes I hadn't caught the first three times. The more you learn, the more you grow, the more you'll find this remarkable book has to offer. (And, incidentally, the book stretches your perceptions further than yesterday's headlines. Yes, mankind has dodged one nuclear bullet; but our self-destructive folly is still with us, the weapons have not been destroyed, and our wise leaders have begun telling us it's important to keep the ones we have in reserve, and a good idea to build more of them.)The book begins after atomic apocalypse, abetted by mob rage, has dismanteld all of civilization except the Catholic Church. It is structured as a series of three novellas, separated by centuries of future time. These novellas, linked by a common location at the abbey of Saint Leibowitz in the Utah desert, encourage identification with richly detailed , funny, admirable characters; and then enforce a cool objectivity by sweeping those characters away into the dust of the past. The simultaneous caring attachment and disengagement that result are more effective than any theological treatise in conveying a sense of what it might be like to practice the virtue known as charity.On one level, the whole book becomes a medieval _memento mori_, a reminder of the transience of life. On another level, it is a tryptich: an ornate altarpiece painted in three realistic panels. The panels proceed from near future to far future, and from innocence (the bumbling and easily awed novice Brother Francis, through whose misadventures the Blessed Leibowitz becomes canonized) to devastating experience (the abbot of Saint Leibowitz, providing for the continuity of a human race that may never outgrow its self-destructiveness, forced to impose and to suffer crucifixions, and to watch an hours-old child begotten by virgin birth die before his eyes.)The midcentury saw four great sf novels on the theme of the apocalypse. One (George Stewart's \"Earth Abides\") preceded this one, and in its own way matched its dignity and grandeur, though not its multileveled complexity. The other two, Zelazny and Dick's \"Deus Irae\" and Fritz Leiber's \"A Specter Is Haunting Texas\", both now sadly out of print, owe obvious debts to Miller's work. But in the end, Leibowitz stands alone.","What a great book! As a person who favors technology and space related fiction, I had serious reservations about reading a book concerning, what I thought to be, a rather dry, heavy topic--nuclear holocoust. From the standpoint of someone who never lived through the Red Scare or Cuban Missle Crisis I've never been particularly interested in books that explored the fears and social ramifications from that era. However, based on the reviews, I decided to give it a try. I was thouroughly impressed. Miller writes in a readable style and the plot was driving enough to keep me interested. But what impressed me the most was the way that Miller divulges the thematic issues in the book. It is as if they are subtly layered. They develop rather than force-fed down the reader's throat. The breadth and depthness of the issues explored in this book should give any reader plenty of material to chew on. I highly recommend this book and hope you enjoy it as much as I did.","Nuclear war...Dark ages...Rebirth of learning...and once again, a technological world that is about to destroy itself in nuclear war. All seen through the eyes of an enduring, yet changing religious order which manages to help to hold things together, somehow. There is mysterious symbolism in, for example, the buzzards. There is a curious old man who keeps reappearing at intervals of thousands of years. Who is he? There are times when we can't find a simple Right Side to a controversy that shakes all society (ie, is it good or bad to uncover ancient knowledge, [that is, 20th century knowlege] when the parties in power are evil? Should euthanasia be routinely available to persons dying of radiation poisoning?). Nothing is constant; human beings keep making the same mistakes! And yet, there is a gleam of hope at the end.","The third and final chapter, &quot;Fiat Voluntua&quot;, has a long-winded polemic against suicide woven into the narration. After I finished the book, I became interested in what kind of person Miller was. When I read that he killed himself, I broke down and cried. I believe that whether or not a person kills himself is between him and his God, and is none of society's business. But that someone who could argue with such passion and conviction against suicide and yet would later fall to such depths of misery and despair that he would kill himself is one of the saddest and most awful things I think I've ever heard of...","When A Canticle for Leibowitz was published, there were Cistercian monks teaching at my university, refugees from the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. They were cultured men, and they relished Miller's book. After all, Leibowitz was a Cistercian. The novel is rich with profound philosophical insights, and the chronology echos Western Civ--the author certainly knew his history. Those familiar with Catholicism can perhaps appreciate Miller's subleties better. Many reviewers have struggled with the question of Rachel'sidentity. I had no problem with this. She seemed clearly a second Immaculate Conception. Rachel's character had an impact on mypersonal beliefs. I had never taken to the Virgin Mary particularly--it seemed she had it made. If one were truly without sin, doesn't one have a built-in advantage? But when Miller inserted Rachel in that brief interlude in the third book, it struck me that God can do whatever He wishes. It is not for us to question his decisions. If He wants to create a dozen human beings and endow them with His special favor, is that not His priviledge? So Rachel awakens, perhaps to give solace to the dying, perhaps to demonstrate the presence of the Almighty, perhaps to bring hope to that destroyed world...whatever the reason, I have thought of her often. M.B. McArdle","This is the first and the best of the post-apocolyptic fiction, and nothing since has come close. I first read this as a youngster and saw a story. I reread it in college, and realized that it is one of those rare books that -- like Orwell's Animal Farm -- offer one thing to children and another to adults.Humankind has nuked itself almost to oblivion. The question Miller poses is: will we do it again? For anyone lucky enough to get a copy of the 1961 Bantam edition (available through at least 1980), the inside cover quote actually represents the book well. This quote was removed from subsequent editions.Miller's split the book into 3 sections: Fiat Homo (Let There Be Man), Fiat Lux (Let There Be Light) and Fiat Volultas Tua (Lord, According To Thy Will). Fiat Homo address the question: what happens when men start organizing themselves into statelets. Fiat Lux addresses the question of what responsibility do scientists bear for the application of their findings. Fiat Voluntas Tua addresses the issues of church v. state, sin (original or otherwise) and will we do it again. Given its title, this section title particularly terrifying. Wandering through the book is Lazarus, whom Christ raised from the dead. Watch for him, he's interesting.Or you can read it as a novel and enjoy it at face value.One final note: Miller's other works are a very different kettle of fish -- typical 50's short stories for teenage boys. I would love to know how he came to write this book.","Reading these reviews, you will find all kinds of disagreement - and that is exactly what you expect in great literature. Different events can be interpreted in different ways because the author allows us to find meaning for ourselves. And that quest for meaning is the theme of this book.The author, Walter Miller, never wrote another full-length book. For that matter, this book is really 3 novellas strung together. I wouldn't really call this book science fiction any more than I would describe Plato's 'Republic' or More's 'Utopia' as science fiction. There are no aliens or the like; only a novel set in the future.The 3 novellas concern 3 periods of times in the 2000 or so years following a nuclear holocaust in the 1960's (which would have been 10 years after the time the book was written). In one sense this book compares to several other post-nuclear holocaust books written in the same time-period - Frank's 'Alas, Babylon' and Shute's 'On the Beach'. These latter two works, though excellent reading, really are just novels set in such a period. They really don't have any depth or philosophical questioning other than blowing up the world would be bad. About the level of a medical school interviewer who once asked me what I thought of Nuclear War - trying to get at my politics to see if he would let me in. I, of course, responded, \"Well, I'm for it, naturally\" - and it was all downhill from there. Anyway, the point of this book is not necessarily that nuclear holocaust would be bad. Unfortunately, to the simple-minded, this seems to be the theme of the book.In my opinion, the theme is the long battle regarding knowledge and its applications - a novel length exposition of the question \"Was gaining the Knowledge of Good and Evil a good thing, or a bad thing?\"The unifying theme of the 3 novellas is that all are set in a future monastery named after a survivor of the holocaust named Leibowitz trying to preserve remnants of past knowledge for a brighter future. The book is never clear on who or what exactly Saint Leibowitz was. Clues are given such as finding his workbox with a grocery list and electronic repair equipment. Was he a scientist or an appliance repairman? You're never really sure since the author, wisely, never tells us. The only recurring character (other than the dead Leibowitz) is a wandering Jew who turns out to be that Lazarus who was raised from the dead and told to wait until Christ came again in some non-biblical legends. This character calls Leibowitz one of his people, though the basis for this is never made clear (could it just be based on the name?). This would be ironic because a Catholic monastery is based on this St. Leibowitz. At any rate, this Leibowitz seems to have tried to save lost knowledge at a time when the remaining people on earth were intent on destroying all such knowledge and anyone who was an intellectual or scientist was killed. From these vague origins, a monastery in the deserts of the Southwest, somewhere near Utah, becomes established based on trying to carry out Leibowitz's mission.One of Miller's plot devices is being vague. Like mumbled dialogue or poor lighting in a movie, this leaves the reader with a sense of confusion, unease and wonderment that adds to the depth of the exposition. There is no neat wrapping-up of events and the author never explicitly states what he is trying to tell us. Another device is the Catholic hierarchy and teachings in the book. This is an important part of the book, but in spite of what anti-relgious reviewers rant about, this does not detract from the book but adds to it. There is also a lot of un-translated Latin. If you attended catechism (Catholic lay education), you would recognize much, but even so, you will still need a Latin dictionary or Google unless your Latin is better than mine. Still another device is the humor, much of which is quite dark. There is a surprising amount of humor in this book about a post-holocaust world.The first novella is set 600 years in the future - in a kind of Dark Age where mutants roam the earth and there are no modern inventions. The monks of the monastery struggle to compile knowledge and store it - they really don't know much at all. For example, the main character in this part of the book, Brother Francis, spends his life illuminating a copy of a mundane wiring diagram, not realizing that this particular relic really has no utility. This book brings to mind the Irish monasteries of the Middle ages that copied and saved knowledge from the Romans and Greeks even though no new studies were done. This would place Miller ahead of his time since this is a fairly new theme.The second novella is set in a renaissance where the world has begun to rebuild and a scholar from a new power-center comes to the Abbey and reviews the records kept from the last millenium. The theme of this section concerns government and secular knowledge and power versus individualism and spirituality.The last novella portrays another advanced civilization - so advanced they even have space exploration, though this is never of major importance other than a place for refugees to flee to. Again, Miller was ahead of his time because all they really had were a few satellites at the time Miller wrote this book. I personally found this last section the most haunting. A major part of this book is spent on euthanasia and suicide with the head of the Abbey trying to teach one person at a time that life is too valuable to waste or end prematurely even if one is suffering.As a physician I see suffering 20 to 40 times a day. It always seems to surprise many of my patients, but all of us suffer and all of us will die. (Except for me, of course.) There is a modern-day malaise that exists in so many of my patients that wasn't there only a few years ago. And the only people who really avoid it are the spiritual - not necessarily the religious - but the spiritual. So many people with suffering that is really minor when compared to the suffering of those who lived in the past with death, disease and pestilence being the rule rather than the exception like today. A minor arthritis brings despair, oxycontin addiction, and a wish for socialism where all the patient's neighbors should be forced to fund every possible medical desire of the patient. These patients seem so alone, even as they lash out and make everyone around them, even their loved ones, miserable. And they frequently become suicidal. And for these reasons, I found the last part of this book haunting as the poor Priest struggles desperately to prevent people from using a government-sponsored euthanasia/suicide center.We all suffer and we all die. Some suffer and die early and some late. My patients who have lost loved ones seem to suffer more than those dying of cancer. This theodicy, the vindication of God and the reason for suffering and pain, is at the root of this last novella. The author does not give an answer to this most basic question, but only lots of food for thought.Overall 5 stars because of the quality of the theme, the humorous almost whimsical happenings in the midst of such tragic occurrences, and the imagination shown by this author. The only negatives would be too much un-translated Latin, an expectation of understanding the Catholic hierarchy, and occasional slow parts. Vincet Veritas, MEB","Commonly acclaimed as one of greatest SF novels ever written, 'A Canticle for Leibowitz' does not disappoint. It weaves an utterly compelling vision of the rebuilding of society after nuclear holocaust consumes the Earth, and the struggle of a religious sect formed around the memorabilia of an obscure 20th century engineer named Leibowitz to keep the past alive while trying to keep society from repeating the same mistakes.The book is divided into three parts, each separated by the centuries that swirl around The Brothers of St. Leibowitz as they watch the world go on from the seclusion of an Abby in the western US. The book is steeped in religious iconography, meticulous in its accuracy but not at all overwhelming. And unlike most of the other 'classic' SF novels, the prose shines with intelligence and the plot is as relevant as it was when first published almost 40 years ago.One possible flaw may be that the monks are so secluded that not much of the surrounding society is really dealt with on anything but a vague level. The Leibowitz Abby is the real location of all three parts. But details of the events outside the walls do make their presence known, and you get immersed so totally into the Order that by the last page, you'll feel like one of the boys. This book will truly have you cloistering yourself away, turning the pages like a real zealot. Forget the Celestine Prophecies. Follow the sacred shopping list!","What an amazing story this is! Other reviewers have discussed the plot, characters, and setting, so I will bypass all that. A few other things then:First, if you are Catholic and grew up before the Second Vatican Council, when everything was still in Latin, you're really going to feel at home here. If not, most of the Latin can be figured out from the context of the story.Second, apart from a magnificent sci-fi story, there are some larger issues worth considering: The relationship of science and technology to religion; the reaction of the masses to scientific disaster; the sanctity of human life; finding holiness in secular activities; the old tomater woman and the need to forgive God (that one set me back on my heels!); Rachel, innocence, and redemption; the Church as the vehicle for continuing Divine Truth and human civilization; the question of history as cyclic or linear.Third, Babylon 5 fans will want to watch out for some Leibowitz' references, such as G'Kar's eyeball, and the Rangers.Of all the fiction books I have enjoyed, sci-fi or otherwise, &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; is my very favorite and I have read it many, many times.","I've waited some time before I wrote this review on A Canticle to Leibowitz because it had taken me away from daily life so much I was unsure I would find the words to explain my experience.Wat impressed me most was the medievalism of the atmosphere during the dark ages that the Simpletons reign, and the pursuit of knowledge is known to be the main cause of human destruction, therefore never to be allowed to recure. The few people who resist that, join (out of faith) the Catholic order of Leibowitz, and try to preserve every scrap of paper from before the Simplification, even though context is missing, and most of the time they do not have a clue as to what they are copying through the ages. There is a nice little subtheme concerning an electronic wiring schema that is transmutated into a wonderous religious icon.Also impressive is the fine character exploration, with moving and humorous aspects, and details that help better understand the predicament and the superstitions of the literate but otherwise (in our present sense of the word) uneducated monks in a grim world that has been destructed centuries ago, and will not be restored anytime soon.Matching this world, it is not a fast paced book. But because of the well developed world, atmosphere and characters it works itself into your system inevitably. It changes the way you perceive your everyday life. And if you have any beliefs in the 'Progress of the World' or 'Growth of Mankind' this book will subtely alter that, persuading you gently to rethink the possibilities.After all these years this book is very much alive, and it definitely will remain so for the decades to come. It is a treat, don't miss it.","I read &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; as a 12-year old and recently re-read it at age 30+. It speaks to me even more fully than before. What a great book - the author examines the deep questions about What is Human, Are We Doomed to Repeat History, Can Man Overcome His Base Nature, etc. Then there is the historical parallel of the monasteries keeping the flame of learning alive during the New Dark Ages. (Interesting: apparently the author was present in WWII during the bombing of Monte Cassino Abbey, that center of learning - one wonders how much that affected this novel.) Buy this book and read it. You will not be disappointed. I read it 20 years ago and remembered it (and remembered it well!) all that time.","A fascinating book, A Canticle for Leibowitz is both a rich treasure of fine writing and a difficult assignment: in many ways, as a conventional novel, and even as a science fiction one, it fails on many levels.But isn't that the case for many great works of literature (and almost all good science fiction): the real stuff eschews formula, defies convention, evades compartmentalisation - it succeeds despite itself. And so, Walter Miller's great novel is uneven, ignores conventions and defies genres.It starts as a low, ticklish farce: in a post-apocalyptic wilderness a credulous novice monk stumbles upon some papers, including an old shopping list, in the rubble of a bombed out building. Being credulous, he proceeds to venerate them as the sacred relics of the long dead, and martyred, founder of his order. This martyr, we less-credulous readers quickly deduce, was an apparently irreligious Jewish scientist (his name, Isaac Leibowitz, being the dead giveaway) of the late Twentieth Century, alive just prior to the \"Flame Deluge\" (yet another genre, by the way, that this novel fits rather uncomfortably within is \"post apocalyptic fiction\") and dead not long after it.Six hundred years on, we learn that Leibowitz is in the process of being beatified by the order to which that hapless novice belonged (and the novice is now himself venerated) as a Catholic saint!Thus, low farce gives way to arch and sophisticated irony - of all people it is the monks who keep alive the spark of secular 20th century technology, though only through their uncomprehending worship of the \"memorabilia\" they've collected.Irony then in turn elides into a thoughtful and articulate meditation on religion, science, the tension and interdependence between them and ultimately their mutual inability, jointly or severally, to vouchsafe human frailty. Through the three parts of Miller's book the eternal wheel spins: the post-deluge dark age segues into a re-enlightenment, and in the last part the world careers inevitably back into oblivion.That Miller achieves all this - heavy stuff, after all - with so light a touch is quite an achievement. Nevertheless, there is an unevenness of style: The airily comic disposition of the first act is sharply curtailed in the second and third which, in the main are more solemnly written.In some ways the book has not aged well: most obviously in its (for 1959, quite understandable) fixation with the human race's inevitable nuclear self-determination (wittily and piously rendered by the monks as *diluvium ignis* - literally, the deluge of fire). Nowadays - how fickle we are! - nuclear cataclysm seems a quaint fear.On the other hand, the maturity with which Miller confronts the argument between the rational and the spiritual is sorely lacking these days (as, this very week, even dear old Stephen Hawking wades ill-advisedly into the Science vs. God debate, demonstrating no more eptitude than has any other recent scientists who've strayed from their stock material.)A Canticle for Leibowitz' tripartite structure, threaded together only by the ghost of Isaac Leibowitz and the apparition of the Wandering Jew, makes for a challenge, as none of the other characters exist beyond any one of the three acts. Seeing as the first black mark on the horizon - and the first black mark on the first page - was the Jew, I was disappointed to see him go missing in action as the book reached its inevitable conclusion. Instead of that bookend, we were left in the hands of an under-described and un-anticipated character to round the epic out.Indeed, Miller seems to have distracted himself at the death with a side-bar debate on euthanasia and suffering which didn't really figure, or connect much with, the rest of the narrative. Clearly, though, it was something the Roman Catholic Miller himself wrestled with mightily; he did eventually committed suicide many years later.For all that there were, in the middle stanza, some beautiful set pieces, and throughout the book is beautifully written too, which mean that for all its stylistic and structural oddities, A Canticle For Leibowitz thoroughly earns its contemporary classic status.Olly Buxton","I read this in high school and thought it might come across as a dated Cold War relic. It was anything but. The prose is thoughtful and clear. Miller's powers of description seem to drop one into the center of his nightmarish landscape. This is much more than an apocalypse novel. It is a hard look at the cyclical nature of human civilization and thought. Neither liberal nor conservative in its world view; yet it shows how both points of view contribute to the ultimate and complete destruction of mankind. The strangest element for me was that of undying hope, which was so clearly and painfully articulated at the end of the story.","This book is sheer delight, start to finish. If you like sci-fi with some real science behind it, paired with a sense of humor and with a generous dash of social commentary added, this is for you.I am in the process of ploughing through innumerable pages of sci-fi as I create a hard-core scientific-cum-lit. course at college level. This book delighted me on all counts. The writing is superb--not true for all sci-fi, sadly-- the characters well developed, the ending a delight.Heartily recommended!","Imagine a Benedictine monastary, monks going through their daily rituals, preserving and reproducing holy documents without understanding them or why they're holy for hundreds of years through the dark ages. Now imagine that same monastary in some future time, some future dark age after the fall of all those things we believe make us a civilization. That's the basic theme of Canticle for Liebowitz.As the churches of past times strove to have their Saints and holy artifacts recognized by the Church, so they do in Canticle. It's a good yarn, an intertaining one, an absorbing one. I'm not certain why this book isn't among those listed as 'classics', reviewed by hundreds of reader-fans. I do know I loved it when I first read it several decades ago and I've loved it every time I've read it since.I see in the editorial review that the book had a sequel I'd never heard of. I'm going to try to chase it down. Meanwhile, I recommend you get yourself a copy of this one and begin the sustained process of enjoying it occasionally for as long as you have eyesight and enough light to read by.","Canticle for Lebowitz is a story that will appeal to all types of readers: science fiction readerers because of its speculative aspects as well as fantasy readers due to its projection of people into a strange (but all too possible) world.This novel does a great job of describing how certain human organizations (religion, in particular) could survive apocalypse and become the vessel of knowledge into a future age--not unlike the function of the Middle Age monasteries preserved Classical knowledge. It also provides a very believable account of how people might perceive technologies that have become incomprehensible. For example, one of the characters marvels over why ancient people put metal bars into stone (it is rebar reinforced concrete). It shows us how even things that we perceive as mundane in the modern world could take on a mystical nature to those who lack understanding.For me, the best of this book was the first two thirds. These are the parts where the writing really shines and the you get a sense of how humanity could endure and rediscover science through a neo-dark age. The last part is very good as well, but I think the authors voice begins to creep into the story and the characters, and events unfold more for the benefit of the point he's trying to make more than any other factor.","600 years after the nuclear apocalypse, Brother Francis of the Albertian Order of Leibowitz (AOL) is performing his Lenten fast in the desert of Utah. During his fast, he sees a man wandering through the desert. This man leads Brother Francis to a hidden cave that contains warnings about the Fallout (a creature he would never like to encounter) and also some documents from the Blessed Leibowitz. He brings them to the attention of his abbot, who contacts New Rome withthe hopes that this may finally bring about the canonization of Leibowitz.Jump ahead another 600 years. Leibowtiz has become a saint, and thanks to the efforts of the AOL, many of his documents have been faithfully copied and recopied. Brother Kornhoer decides to take one of the documents, a &quot;blueprint&quot; as it is called, and creates an arc lamp for the first time. Meanwhile, Thon Thaddeo, a scholar, needs to visit the abbey to peruse the Memorabilia of Leibowitz and the time before the Deluge and the Simplification. The abbot is unnerved when he discovers that the thon's companions are sketching the abbey as a possible military stronghold.1800 years have passed since the Saint Leibowitz perished after the Deluge. Humankind is almost back to where it was with computers, cars that drive themselves and even space travel and colonization of other planets. the new abbot of the AOL, fearing the latest news of global discord and a possible nuclear war, assembles a small team to take the Memorabilia and other documents of the Deluge and the Simplification to Centarus, out in space.This is a fascinating novel following the monks of the Albertian Order of Leibowitz, who are the safeguards of knowledge concerning the first nuclear war. It spans 1800 years and during that time, mankind goes from almost complete disappearance to a renaissance. But have they learned from the mistakes of the past?The novel is filled with very rich descriptions of the new world in each of the three book sections: going from the post-apocalyptic to the desert-like conditions of the far distant future. Also, enough locations have similar names to giv ehe reader a certain familiarity. For example, much of the story takes place in the states of Utah and Texarkana. Already, the reader knows that they are in the former United States and in which area. Another intriguing feature of this book is te positive light in which religion is portrayed. The monks maintain the history and try to learn from it, to pass along that information. It's the world around them that maligns and misuses it.This is an entertaining and intellectual novel that deserves it place as one of the classics of science fiction.","I thought the book raised some good points. One, that humans are sinful creatures. Miller points out that man sees his mistakes from history but tends to repeat them. Towards the end of the book, man starts another nuclear war despite knowledge of the effects of the first one. Another interesting point was to see how the Catholic Church preserved itself throughout the hundreds of years that the book takes place. The church even sent clergy to space. I would recommend the book if you like SF. It is unique in that it involves the church in the future.","'A Canticle for Leibowitz' is the story of a Catholic Monastary in the Utah desert after a Nuclear Holocaust. The story spans one thousand years and deals with the monks' attempts to preserve human knowledge against the barbarous dark age that had decended upon the Earth. This is one of those rare novels that combines biting satire with a wonderful story and rich characters. There are a few times when the story tends to get bogged down, but these lulls are more than made up for by genuine thrilling moments and a very satisfying ending. Religion, philosiphy, and humor illustrate this wonderful novel of mankind searching for collective redemption and wondering at just what cost salvation will come.","Honestly, the cover terrified me a little bit but since this book is a required component of a Post-Apocalyptic Literature class, I had to read it--and I fell completely in love with it. I became totally engrossed in the plot. The provacativeness of Miller's commentary on technology, society, and religion adds a completely new perspective to social ideologies. I definitely recommend this book to anyone wanting a book with the tone of an epic adventure, religious connotations, post-apocalyptic themes, and an incredible narrative and perspective on the end of the world.","A Canticle for Leibowitz was written in the shadow of the Cold War, and it's easy to be thankful that we managed not to destroy ourselves in a nuclear holocaust, but the deeper questions about the way we use knowledge and the dangers of science misapplied are important and vital. Miller puts together a riveting story about the cyclical nature of human history and the tension between faith and reason (or church and state if you prefer, although there's much more at stake than that). We are taken on a trek through the centuries as man recovers from a nuclear holocaust, the Church is left for centuries as the last guardians of human knowledge, and eventually civilization is rebuilt only to collapse again in a second nuclear war.Throughout, we bear witness to the folly not of man's quest for knowledge, but of man's quest for knowledge without the moral compass necessary to guide that quest. For centuries, the abbey of the monks of St. Leibowitz (a scientist, and then martyr, who founded the order to protect and perpetuate science and knowledge through the post-apocalyptic dark age) is the last home to the books of the devastated civilization, and it becomes a metaphor for the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. It's the knowledge contained in the books that dooms mankind to repeatedly destroy itself, and failure to eat of that fruit could save us all. But it's also more complicated than that. There is never any question that the preservation of the books is a noble calling, so it becomes even more imperative that man learn to use that knowledge wisely. Reason may provide what salvation we can hope to find in life, but it may also destroy us.The only character to reappear throughout every age is the Wandering Jew, cursed to keep searching for the Second Coming. Interestingly enough, he never finds Jesus. We are left to wonder at the end if he will ever find peace, although the closing scene offers some hope that he will. There is an interesting scene in the beginning in which he is mistaken for Leibowitz, and another scene later in which he refers to Leibowitz as a former kinsman, and of course we are left to consider that Leibowitz - a Jew - has become one of the most important saints in a new Catholic rebirth.The very last scene of this book is the one I find most complex. I think you could level a complain that Miller simply resorts to a (more or less) literal deus ex machina, but I also think (given the rest of this incredibly intricate book) that that would be a disservice to the author. The restoration of innocence comes from a deeply unlikely place, and the narrative arc for this character raises far more issues than it solves. At the risk of ruining one of the best puzzles Miller has to offer, though, I will say no more.Except this: read this book. It is one of the finest works of the last half century, and it is one of the finest pieces of science fiction ever put to paper.","Most reviews for this book are way too serious. Science vs. religion in light of a nuclear apocalypse. Did anyone read this book for pleasure and humor? After all, the synopsis of the books reads:\"By the time of the 32rd century, the atomic Flame Deluge was over. The earth was dead. All knowledge was gone. In a hellish, barren desert, a humble monk unearths a fragile link to 20th century civilizations. A handwritten document from the Blessed Saint Leibowitz that reads: pound pastrami, can kraut, six bagels-bring home for Emma.\"I read this book for humor and for silly perspectives. The monks, while literate, copy every scrap of paper they find and keep it in their vault. Almost everything is worthless, like the shopping list, yet they pointlessly carry on copying. It's ridiculous, it's funny. At the same time, they idolize a man named Leibowitz for reasons which are unclear. We only know we designed circuitry, for which they have a schematic for, and that he \"performed\" a few miracles. Seems ridiculous, again, and fun to read. The silly perspectives from the monks greatly contrasts the darky, more sinister death and disease.All in all, a wholly satisfying book with refreshing twist of simple minds, petty goals and a sinister contrast.","Centuries after the Flame Deluge, a monastery in what used to be the United States of America's desert southwest awaits canonization of its beatified patron, the Blessed Martyr Leibowitz. Brother Francis, a novice enduring the solitude of his required Lenten fast, encounters a mysterious traveler who first tempts him with bread and cheese and then reveals to him a long-buried fallout shelter. The shelter contains relics of the Blessed Martyr, including a shopping list for pastrami, kraut, and bagels. Will this be the evidence that results, at last, in New Rome's acknowledgment of the Blessed Leibowitz's sainthood?That's the premise of FIAT HOMO, the first of three novellas in this book. In the second installment, more centuries have passed. The Abbey of St. Leibowitz and its memorabilia are still there, and still playing a crucial role as Humans slowly regain the technology lost in the Flame Deluge. In the third and last installment, the Abbey is once again central as another Deluge threatens to engulf the still only partly recuperated planet. In each novella, the Roman Catholic Church - pre-Vatican II, since Miller published this work in 1959 - provides the one source of moral certainty for what's left of Humankind. Resuming its task from medieval Europe, the Church's monks gather and preserve the fragmented written records of an earlier civilization brought down by a different sort of barbarians. They copy and recopy, painstakingly and by hand, information that they no longer comprehend, with faith that one day Humanity will reclaim its meaning. The two-edged sword of knowledge provides one of the book's central themes. Another is the demanding nature of faith, as personified by Roman Catholicism, and its on-going tension against the absolutes of science. Is the conflict between the two really that of irreconcilable belief systems, or something else that we Humans can't quite grasp? Meanwhile, the predators lurk and wait to clean up the debris (including that which used to be Human) after each disaster. Vultures that \"lovingly feed\" their young, marginally Human mutants called \"Pope's children\" because only the Church's influence guarantees their right to exist, sharks that can swim deep to escape the Deluge that comes in seemingly inevitable cycles...the predators, at least, are eternal.It's no wonder this book is still in print, almost 50 years after its first publication. It asks timeless questions, and refuses to provide easy answers. Yet for all its apparent cynicism, the Human spirit's resilience lies at its heart; and in that resilience, and in Humankind's endless drive to learn and to discover, may lie...salvation? Or at least, hope for another chance.","This book is on every serious list of best science fiction novels ever written. After reading this book I can assure you that its status is well deserved. Readers looking for aliens with giant laser beams fighting an intergalactic war for the ULTIMO device should not read this book. However, readers who understand that true classics leave the reader contemplating the true nature of man will enjoy this very much.Some people seem to have a problem with the amount of \"religion\" in this novel. I personally did not think this book was preachy at all. However, the ULTIMO beam crowd may not be able to handle it.","Wow. I just finished reading Miller's \"Canticle for Leibowitz\", and the first thing that comes to mind is that it is as relevent today as it was when it was first written in 1955 and '56. Don't be put off by the beginning, which at first may seem somewhat obscure. Nor should you allow the religious themes to be a distraction--this book clearly wasn't written as a diatribe for one belief system or against another. Miller uses religious and cultural allegories with which he is familiar. It would be difficult however, not to see the greater parallel with consideration for humanity's future in this well written book. Keep in mind that this was written during the height of the cold war, when it was normal to practice weekly or monthly duck-&-cover and fallout shelter evacuation drills at work, at school, in public in the United States (and elsewhere, I'd guess).Imagine an Earth not only post-nuclear apocalypse, but about 600 years down the road, after a complete cultural meltdown. No books, no schools, no motor-cars, not a single luxury (sorry). A Catholic monastary becomes a major source of preserved knowledge, taking its name from a former scientist of the nuclear age who repented his part in the destruction of Earth and encouraged the preservation of remaining knowledge with the hope that humanity could do better. Maybe it's religion's own penence for past eras of book burning and opression, but these dedicated monks are in it to preserve knowledge regardless of whether it agrees with their beliefs or not, dedicating their existence to the preservation of written knowledge the way bootleggers dedicated their lives to the production and transport of alcohol in the U.S. when it was prohibited. Hence the term Booklegger (I love it!).Just when you come to know a generation of monks, time moves on. Don't be disappointed, the next generation (monks and all!) is as fascinating as that which preceeded it. It wasn't difficult to recognize human elements of behavior, or to appreciate his diversity among characters. The development of character and plot are both excellent. There are 3 major time periods, each highlighting a different period in this new humanity's development. Some things are familiar, some not surprising, and a few are...unusual.One may take from this book any number of thoughts. The positives and negatives of religion, philosophy, art, politics and humanity in general are all present here. Like other memorable works of fiction, \"Canticle\" offers, to a degree, what the reader is willing to consider based upon that reader's knowledge. I believe I found the story all the more profound with the recently re-awakened concerns about nuclear power (and weapons) in our world. I came away from this book with a deep appreciation for what we do have in our world today, and a strong and sincere hope that we are wise enough to hold on to it and make it a better and safer place for our children. Read Walter M. Miller Jr's book and see what you think. And thanks, Dad, for recommending the book!","This is an amazing book. It's well written and poignant, telling the story of the danger of nuclear war. The book is prophetic and suspenseful, while also humorous in some parts. The author knows a great deal about the Catholic church and human nature. The last part, although powerful, is a bit preachy, but it's still a wonderful read. Highly recommended.","The horrific Flame Deluge has come and gone, and in the broken world that remains, a small order of monks collect and protect what remains of worldly knowledge at a remote abbey in the Utah desert. Spanning three millennium, the magnitude of this tale is nothing short of stunning. The story and the writing are both very well done, and all of the characters were vibrant. In many ways, the book reminded me of Catch-22; it is spiced with the same humor and wrenchingly tragic moments. The message I gleaned was that ultimately, Man is incapable (or unwilling) to learn from his mistakes. Though labeled science-fiction, there were several strong fantasy elements strewn throughout, which I enjoyed wholeheartedly. In my book, A Canticle for Leibowitz fully deserves its classic status.","One of the earlier, and still the best, post-nuclear-holocaust novels around. Walter Miller treated the concept in a broad historical view, breaking the story into three parts at successive intervals of 600 years after the \"Flame Deluge\" (nuclear war) which presumably occurs in the late 20th or early 21st century. All three focus on the perspective of a new monastic order which emerges in its aftermath, dedicated to the preservation of scientific and technical literature preserved by their founder, an engineer later known as Saint Leibowitz.To quickly summarize: part 1 is in the depths of a new dark age, begun by the widespread rejection of technology and learning following the holocaust. The monks, isolated in the North American desert, illuminate manuscripts based on ancient circuit diagrams and fearfully unearth a fallout shelter. Part 2 sees a second renaissance beginning amid warring city-states and nomadic raiders, with a gifted would-be scientist struggling to retrieve knowledge from the monastery's memorabilia. In part 3, as far from today as today is from the time of Hadrian, mankind has climbed back to and exceeded the heights of technology from which it fell. But in a supermodern age of robot traffic and interstellar colonization - and reinvented nuclear weapons - nations still vie with each other just as they always have. Is the only lesson of history to be that we never learn anything from history?The religious framework is the chief continuity between the three periods, and gives a real sense of history - putting the far imagined future into a format with which one can identify is no small achievement for the author. Characters, though seeming somewhat po-faced, do come through and are more than two-dimensional. What is best, though, is the subtle detail of settings and circumstances which makes it thoroughly believable. The shift between different historical mindsets and perspectives is well-acomplished. My only criticism is that some pseudo-Scriptural passages require a Latin dictionary.Miller can hardly be blamed for not fully realising the severe environmental consequences of a global nuclear exchange, such as the nuclear winter - he was writing before the relevant studies had been made.Though not the longest novel of its kind around, quality is certainly evident over quantity. Anyone who enjoys intelligent and serious speculation should give this book a chance.","With all the recent talk of potential nuclear terrorist attacks and the current threat of nuclear war between India and Pakistan, A Canticle for Leibowitz is as fresh and meaningful today as it was when it was first published in 1959.Readers may, at first, be surprised by how Catholic this novel is. It follows the Albertian Order of Leibowitz - a future religious order of bookleggers and memorizers who have been entrusted with the safekeeping of history in their monastery.Set 2000 years into the future, the book examines what remains after the human race virtually destroys itself through nuclear war, and the gradual rebuilding of society brought again to the brink of nuclear war in the far distant future.The novel is both terrifying and fascinating. One comes away from the book recognizing the eternal nature of the Church, and the role of monastics to safeguard doctrine.","Walter M.Miller Jr. offers us a look into the years of a post-apocolypic world run by gangs and highwaymen. The work begins in an almost medevial time, with the clergy protecting the pre- deluge spoils of Rome with a fervor. The day to day machinations of these poor acolytes with their dedications is to look into the past instead of the future. The appearance of the strange &quot;Benjamin&quot; heralds a journey into that future that none knows or would care to see. Walter M. Miller Jr. handles this tale with such aplomb that we are led through hundreds of years of time and changing circumstance with a smooth, unveiled cadence that lulls the reader into a calm look into a history that never was-until the last chapters where we realize that technology has been reborn in its most monsterous form-and that it's all about to happen again. Hence the title for my humble take on a CANTICLE FOR LEIBOWITZ.","I do not wish to add more substantial comments to the already long list of reviewers: this a classic, powerful, masterpiece of literature. It is about the interplay of political and religious power, and of science and ethics, posed in a very intense manner, particularly in the last chapter. I almost cried and some scenes haunted my sleep for some days, like the abbot's tomcat, refusing to die. I wish only to post a word of warning for readers whose first language is not english, like myself: it is not easy reading, both in terms of the vocabulary and the usage of the language. However, it is absolutely worth the effort as the novel is guaranteed to stir up your system of beliefs in the subject.","Canticle impressed me a great deal. It's one of those books that remains with you long after you've finished the last page. It really got me thinking - I even went on a sci-fi message board to read other readers' impressions of the novel. I suggest that future readers search on the internet for some kind of study guide. I found a site that translated the latin phrases and it deepened my appreciation for the novel. I think it would be a study in frustration to read the novel without an understanding of the latin phrases.","In Chapter 4, Miller talks about Brother Francis' recognition of &quot;an intermediate twilight zone&quot; which included &quot;whatever he could see but could not understand.&quot; Considering that the book was published in 1959, but excerpts were published as early as 1955, is it possible that Serling got the title for his television series from Miller? If you would like to respond, please e-mail.","This certainly was an interesting book. Touchingly strange and I don't care to read it again.","This is a book that has a decent premise hidden somewhere under the layers of yawn-inducing detail. For the amount of pages this book contains, almost nothing happens. This isn't necessarily a fault, since plot is not necessary as long as the ideas and detail are still intriguing. But alas, this book falls short in all of these except for a spattering of comical details. I kept reading because I thought that, it being the classic it is considered to be, it HAD to get better. Sadly it didn't, and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.","I've read hundreds of SciFi novels, and rarely give a book five stars - but here is one that deserves it. Written about a post-apocalyptic world, it is basically three books in one, with each taking place about 500 years apart, and starting about 500 years after the near-destruction of mankind.Without giving anything away, the early Fallout Shelter encounter is fantastic, and a great start-off to this wonderful, quick-reading, and decent-sized book. There are lots of interesting characters, and while not action-packed, there is always something interesting going on to keep you turning the pages to see what will happen next.Very impressed that the advanced spaceflight predicted by Miller in 1959 avoided the use of the dead planets Venus and Mars (many writers made the mistake, as late as the 60's, that there was life on these planets, or that they could be easily colonized).This book will not appeal to those not interested in reading some occasional passages in Latin (and even a few Hebrew phrases), or to those having an aversion to a book with a strong religious theme... Indeed, I think it exactly because of these two factors that the book has not become a popular classic. Having said that, I wouldn't let the \"religious content\" bother open-minded individuals - I'm pretty much an agnostic (albiet right-leaning), and I find the introspections into the monks' Second Dark Age lives more than interesting in the context of the book.","I purchased this book on the many five star recommendations that I read, only to be disappointed.Between the overly verbose conversations and droll tedium there were parts where the story progressed. The continuity between the ages and church vs. state dilemmas are interesting, but you really have to dig through the fluff for it.Unlike some of the other 1950-60's books I have read that stood up (i.e. Heinlein's and Aasimov's books), this one did not stand up to the ages well - and I'm not just talking about the use of Latin.This story could be half as long and accomplish just as much, but it was written in a time when literature was ornately over-worded (i.e. Lord of the Rings, Atlas Shrugged, etc.) so I feel this story fit the generation from whence it came. By today's standards though, it's a bit of a tired slog :(","This novel is timeless! Whether we are examining the supposed eras of recovery from nuclear holocaust, the reformation of oppressive armed combatants, the redeployment of nuclear destruction or our present lives in modern society, the author has a single clear message; The Church hierarchy continues to play its fiddles while Rome is in flames around them. Novella #1 shows the monks saving totally useless 'holy writings' and spending centuries recopying documents that they are totally ignorant of. Novella #2 shows the Church, at all costs, aligning itself with the most powerful political and warring tribe that they can link themselves with. This is in spite of the lack of a common morality. And Novella #3 shows the naivety of them rocketing these 'holy writings' into outer space in order to 'save' the structure and basis for the Church proper for future other-worldly populations.The author cleverly took three different future eras of mankind and examined them through the eyes of Church and its administration. He showed the useless continuation of church rituals that were based of Liebowitz mythology, displayed that the prayers of even the highest church official went unanswered, showed the utter fear that engrossed church officials had when their imminent death was faced and revealed the fractured church hierarchy that was built fully on power and control and lacked any public significance. The most telling actions of the Church, however, were revealed in not what they did, but in what they didn't do! All around them during these three eras was a society that seemed to be moving in a direction that would lead to the eventual re-destruction of the world. And what did the Church do in the interim? Did they make any attempt to educate or warn the public of where their actions may lead? Did they lead protests or sit-ins against the errant political systems? No! All they did was to constantly repeat their useless and mundane religious rituals and concern themselves with only their own organization and continued pious identity. They had little or no concern for the lay public with whom they were 'led' to serve. While some readers will complain of the mundaneness of the religious activities that appear throughout this novel, it is done in a purposeful manner. Boring, inane, and repetitive activity IS the function of the Church as they define themselves to be. The author clearly needs to show this.This novel clearly shows the universality of these dynamics in today's conservative and fundamentalistic driven world. While society is making vain attempts to evolve from where we are, immovable mythological anchors are holding us back. Religious exclusivity, homophobia, the undermining of women's rights and the ignoration of the most helpless among us are the banners under which present religions (both East and West) are walking under.I clearly advise any one who is interested in reading an author who created a universal dystopic novel many decades ago that remains fresh and appropriate to read this excellent presentation.","If a man were only to write one novel in his lifetime, there are very few that could top this. This is a very disturbing, funny, and angry piece of writing. It takes place somewhere in the Utah high desert in the aftermath of a nuclear war. The abbey in the Utah desert preserves what is left of the \"pre-deluge\" knowledge of mankind and the technological secrets that led to the apocalypse of a Nuclear War. This is not only great science fiction, it is great modern literature. The storyline is easy to follow in itself but there are symbols and allegories lurking just underneath the surface of the prose and descriptive narratives that bring the reader back again to study this book. There is a lot of Latin and the tradition of the Catholic church as a refuge for knowledge is part of the book's central theme. What lies beneath is a morality play; the medieval mentality that technology and knowledge are some how dangerous secrets reemerges in the aftermath of the apocalypse. \"Lucifer\" will rise again-\"lucifer\" being technology-a kind of Frankenstein's monster.The book moves through time and starts in the darkness of the post-apocalypse. A young initiate to the Utah Abbey is spending a hermitage in the desert and finds, through the help of a wandering pilgrim, an old fallout shelter. Inside the shelter he finds some notes that were written by a Jewish Engineer (the mythical founder of the Abbey) who was part of the military industrial complex. His shopping list from his wife \"Pound pastrami, can of kraut, six bagels--bring home for Emma,\" becomes a kind of secret, cryptic document and his engineering scribbles become an ancient, secret tome. There is a kind of dark humor here that shouldn't escape the reader. Censorship and suppression of knowledge by the church is a central theme and it is very important to grasp some of the significance of this when reading this novel for the first time.As the novel jumps through time, there is theme throughout of the circularity of man's fate in the world. Through his discoveries and technological gains, mankind creates the seeds for his own destruction. This book is a profound meditation on the dark ages and the idea that scientific knowledge can be dangerous is the central theme. It is best for the reader to familiarize his or herself with some Latin phrases and it is good to read this book with a dictionary nearby. Underneath all of the prose are hidden messages and underlying thematic currents that are masterfully conceptualized and presented.This was the author's only novel during his life time and it is an expansion of some of his short stories that he published in the Sci-Fi Zines' of the 50's. This is definitely a period piece and hearkens back to the cold war and the threat of nuclear war which hovered over that generation. It strikes a chord for me in that when I was living through the end of the cold war, I was convinced that the end of western civilization was an inevitability. I started reading \"The Road\" and it led me back to this novel which I had read in my college days. This is a book that should be visited again and again. Within its pages lies a wealth of knowledge, incredible symbolism and allegory and it is an angry, profound piece of post-apocalyptic writing. It stands on its own with novels such as the Beach & the Road. I recommend it for all readers who are interested in this literary genre.","I really liked the idea of this book--of an inescapable destiny for mankind. However, I found the development of theme and plot too drawn out. The entire story should have ended with the launch of the starship. The entire point of euthanasia the monk picket line was unnecessary and had nothing to do with the overall plot.I was incredibly disappointed with the lack of explanation of the millenia old man. Who or what was he trying to find?It was worth reading to get a feel of Miller's proposed cycle of humanity. Just do not expect everything to be wrapped up in a nice little package.","Americans seem to have a big problem reading European languages, but Liebowitz ('Leebowitz'), which I frequently read in essays about this book is a huge mistake, only surpassed by the guy who did it the other way around, and invented the \"Weiner Schnitzel\" meaning that Wine(=Wein in german) has something to do with it or, even worse, crying (Weinen=Whineing). Fact is that the Wiener Schnitzel was invented in Vienna, or Wien as they say in Austria. Mistakes like this can cost you dear when visiting an other country! You might end up eating a baked football you ordered.\"Liebowitz\" fortunately has no special meaning, but I wonder about people who write a serious essay about a book without the decency to read and write the title correctly...Enough said about cultural differences between actual living people, let's move on to the book. There are in my eyes three good books written which combine both religion and serious science fiction, and apart from \"A Case of Conscience\" by James Blish and \"Deus Irae\" by Philip K. Dick and Roger Zelazny this is the other one. Other writers may have tried to combine these subjects, but after reading some 4000 books I can assure you: no one came even close. One might even argue that the Dick/Zelazny was more or less a copy of this book, but I leave that to you, the reader.Walter M. Miller recently wrote a sequel to this book as well, Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman","How often do you see the headline above? I'm guessing not often. Several years ago, the public radio station where I lived had a live actor version this book. I was so intrigued, and figuring that the stereotype of the book being better than the movie/tv show/etc would hold up, I went and hurriedly got a copy. So slowly paced is the action, so uninteresting are the characters that this is another book I just couldn't bring myself to finish.","Plot Kernel - Told in three timeframes from the viewpoint of Catholic monks: (1) Centuries in the past, there had been a nuclear war. Now scientific and historical ignorance is universal; only a few salvaged incomplete manuscripts of the past remain, kept in the care of a Catholic order of monks who are dedicated to their preservation but have no understanding of their meaning. (2) Further Centuries later, rudimentary scientific principles are only just becoming understood. Tensions arise among the monks in regard to these rediscoveries. (3) Further Centuries beyond, the old pre-nuclear-war world has been rebuilt, along with space travel. Nuclear war erupts.","Stop wasting your time reading reviews - read the book instead!!","Thankfully, I borrowed this book from the library rather than buying it. The plot idea is quite interesting, if hardly novel even for its own day. But the writing is quite clumsy, and the theology is increasingly ham-fisted. The book has three parts, set several hundred years apart, each further in the future. The first two are relatively restrained and readable, but the last section quickly heads into hectoring, moralizing, and self-flagellation that can only be taken as the apocalyptic vision of a guilt-ridden Catholic, which I assume the author was.","Always listed as a &#34;must read&#34; this book is as good as is all the recommended books coming from the government schools. It's mish mash! The writing is circular, therefore vague. That's why so many &#34;reviewers&#34; like it--who can pin down the story? Read it if you want to put another &#34;notch&#34; in your list of important books you've read.","I started the book and was instantly appaled. It was incredibly slow but I thought &quot;Give it a few chapters, it'll get better.&quot; But no! The only reason I read the entire thing, was for an ISU. Although I have to admit, there were a couple good spots, maybe two per part, but other than that, it was no good. I would not recommend this book.","Well it won Hugo so what else should I say?It is a awesome book which in way reflects the state of some sciences today such asArcheologyAnthropologyPhysicsI should say the church too but i have seen the church specially catholic talking about UFOs and hence i think they are following the maxim \"If you cant bit them join them\" see you cant burn people on today... so if some one says \"Hey i saw a UFO\" the priest just winks an eye..and so and so..We are currently experiencing a DARK AGE though many think this is an age of Elightment... couldnt be more wrong...","i have been reading sci fi for about 35 years . i think my first read was star beast by heinlein. as the years have passed i have found that i tend to be drawn to the \"classics\" in sci-fi, at least stuff written prior to the 80's with thAt in mind i thought i would read canticle, heard much about it , just never picked it up. it was a struggle to stay interested in the storyline. i guess i was expecting something more entertaining, there are several good meaty ideas brought up during the read but i felt the book could have either been done with about half as many pages as it is or else add something more to the story line. in a nutshell, boringly long stretches of blah blah ba blah blah. i'm glad i read it but i had to work hard to suck the juice out of this book. it most definately was not a \"page turner\" i kept falling asleep trying to get thru it","I finished Walter Miller's A CANTICLE FOR LEIBOWITZ shorty after reading Cormac McCarthy's THE ROAD and it proves just how far-ranging the bleak genre known as \"dystopia\" can be. In fact, unlike McCarthy's stark and simple narrative, the complicated CANTICLE can be as mirthful as it is bleak, as Miller wisely remembers the humanity in humankind even while indicting said humanity for its insistence on not learning history's lessons. Thus, while news of impending (yet again) nuclear holocaust hangs over the characters, we're still treated to dialogue that is rich in gallows humor (a quaint term, considering how \"far\" mankind has come from the one-at-a-time inefficiencies of a noose).Divided into three linked novellas, CANTICLE provides an opening background story of the bumbling but beloved monk, Brother Francis, and his discovery of the underground bomb shelter that contains the remains and the writings of the eponymous Leibowitz. \"Civilization\" (which will forever be in quotes once you read this book!) has been set back by nuclear destruction long ago when Leibowitz lived, and the records and blueprints excavated from the shelter hint at \"progress\" (another suspect word!) that mankind can make once more, if only he can rethink what was once already thought up and perhaps treat the danger that is knowledge with greater care.Which brings us to the second novella -- an interesting battle of wits in a politically-charged world (long after the death of Section One's Brother Francis) that pits the current abbott of the Leibowetz Abbey against a learned man who is hot on the trail of the ancient paper's darker secrets. Readers will be intrigued by Abbott Paulo's attempts to both protect and share St. Leibowitz's legacy when a scholar from a rising and murderous politician comes to visit. The pas de deux, often unspoken and more often still requiring inference to appreciate, is Miller at his best.Finally, in the shortest and perhaps least satisfying section, another abbott must do battle with sectarian doctors and politicians who challenge his faith and his abbey's history in the name of \"humanity.\" Doctor Cors, for instance, advocates mercy killings of terminally-ill victims of radioactive poisoning (the book has come full circle since Leibowitz's day), but Abbott Zerchi opposes this because euthanasia is not God's will.The book ends with this religious question as its chief focus, which is my only quibble as I would have preferred something closer to the bone -- namely, the theme of man's insatiable need to destroy and maim himself in the name of power. In short, I expected and would have felt a greater sense of completeness from a denouement centering on the question of innate evil, which lurks over the book to the point that Miller's dark humor becomes a lifesaver for the reader. Instead, Miller serves up innate innocence, just when you least expect it. Disturbing and a bit off-putting, the ending is nevertheless provocative and worthy of examination.Overall, I was impressed with CANTICLE's ambition, scope, and depth. It deserves its 1961 Hugo Award for Best Novel (I wonder if JFK read it before the Cuban Missile Crisis?) and even though the writing and the profuse Latin might give younger readers pause, mature readers who appreciate dystopian issues, history, and the philosophical dance of good and evil will find solace even in the dark brightness that is nuclear doom. A thinker's book, then, and highly recommended.","Without doubt, this was the late Walter M. Miller Jr.'s finest work. It was rejected by Galaxy Science Fiction as potentially blaphemous to the Roman Catholic Church, and accepted by Catholic editor Tony Boucher for The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction as praiseworthy and respectful. I agree with the latter opinion. Serious collectors of science fiction should have a copy of A Canticle for Leibowitz on their bookshelves.","This book was obviously born during the cold war. For those of you who are too young to remember, the cold war was a period of time where jackasses in washington and jackasses in moscow allegedly had their fingers poised over a big red button intent on sending us, express delivery, to our respective makers. It sounds silly now, but many of us went to sleep wondering if there would be a planet when we woke up, and this inspired in some of us some profound insights -- people like Walter Miller, Jr. especially.Very few books written in the cold war context seem like anything more than dark, absurd fairy tales or space operas today, but Canticle stands out as perhaps one of the greatest novels ever written -- undoutbedly one of hte greatest pieces of science fiction. Science fiction here is stagework, the story is a human story, following the lives of members of an abbey in the desert of the American west that happens to be one of the world's most important repositories of human knowledge.The book lines up adversaries and lets them play along a timeline that stretches for generations and raises questions about how much we actually learn from those that came before us. It's worth pointing out that the full richness and detail doesn't really register until your 3rd reading of the book.You will not regret purchasing this book -- you will, however, regret not having purchased it sooner.",". . .with those who consider &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; as the single greatest Science Fiction novel ever written.Imagine a world, devastated by nuclear holocaust. Imagine such a world further devastated by a &quot;Simplification&quot; in which all traces of learning are eradicated. The only vestige of civilization to survive is the Church. In the desert, a group of monks spend their entire lives trying to save, reconstruct, and restore knowledge to the world -- but to what end?Filled with humor, pathos, faith, and hope, this book transcends a categorical description.Take and read. You will not regret it.Very Highly Recommended.","An unbelievably good book. I can't believe it's actually out of print. Buy it used or check it out from the library.","I won't explain what I mean by 'tragic irony', as it would reveal the latter part of the novel. Perhaps I can say that it's ironic given the author's death.I read 'CFL' when I was 21, and was blown away. I read it age 45 and was similarly blown.If anything, it reminds me of Russell Hoban's 'Riddley Walker' (early 80's). Both are brilliantly inventive post-apocalyptic novels. Hoban is more secular; Miller is more religious, but ultimately neither gets in the way of a phenomenal story.I enjoy the conceit that, in a distant future, dark-age religion is the bastion of enlightenment. A conflicted POV, and I'm sure Walter was conflicted, too.I'm sorry; I've been cryptic. If you enjoy magnificent, epic science fiction, and have not read this, you're like a classical music fan who hasn't heard Beethoven's Violin Concerto.It's a tortured, visionary epic.","I doubt this is THE first post-apocalyptic novel, but it's up there. I bet it was a great read in 1959. Lot's of new ideas, philosophically. The book is divided into three separate stories: (a) post apocalypse, (b) rebuilding society, and (c) pre-apocalypse #2.After the first story, I was ready to declare this book the Lord of the Rings of the post-apocalypse genre. I really enjoyed it. The best of the three books, it described a world, where man new nothing of technology, even when staring it in the face.The second story sucked. I thought it was a waste. It talks of war between nations, but you never get to know the warring nations. There are no emotional ties to the new characters and countries to help you understand who is who. They might as well be called team a, team b, and team c. Those cold descriptions would mean more and help me better identify who the hell he was talking about.Another side point. I thought the use of latin throughout the novel was way overdone. I speak French fairly well, so I muddled through it fairly easily, but for those who don't it might prove frustrating. However, don't let it bother you, because what was said in latin was unimportant. So, really this is just a critique for any of you who might write in the future. Just leave stuff like that out of the book. We don't care if you have command of some ancient language. We're not impressed.Finally, story three is the crux of the message which is basically this: \"Mankind is retarded\" and \"Mankind is repetitive\" We are stupid and we will always repeat the same mistakes over and over again. I liked the message and generally agree with the philosophical overtones in the book.If I had read this in one of my literature classes in school, I would give this book an \"A\". It would have been one of the more interesting novels that we studies. AND, it would have lent itself well to some very interesting classroom discussions. But, I didn't read it for school, I read it for fun. And, therefore, I just give it a \"C\" or something along those lines.If you're looking for post-apocalyptic books, I much preferred \"The Road\". If you want \"old\" sci-fi, try Asimov first.Cheers.","A truly classic novel is one that reveals deeper layers every time it is read. Walter Miller's A Canticle for Leibowitz is one of the all-time classics of science fiction, and if it weren't such a Catholic book, would undoubtedly be rated as highly in literature as 1984 and Brave New World, though some reviewers rate it that highly anyway. Miller's book, a collection of three novelettes, is actually deeper than either of those distopian visions, possibly even surpassing C.S. Lewis's space trilogy in terms of character development, solid theology, realistic vision, and mystical insight.Written as the cold war was heating up, Walter Miller chronicled a three-part history of one abbey on the edge of the Utah desert, starting from two centuries after a nuclear holocaust. The first part, Fiat Homo (\"And He created Man\"), occurs during the second Dark Ages, and involves the beatification of Isaac Leibowitz, a former weapons engineer who founded an order of monks to preserve the fragmentary knowledge that survived the nuclear war. During this time, life in the abbey reflects in loving detail the Medieval mindset that values eternity above all else. Fiat Lux (\"Let there be Light\") is set during the second Renaissance a few hundred years later, in which the world discovers science and international politics. Finally in Fiat Voluntas Tua (\"Thy Will be Done\"), events occurring in a second modern age impact the monks and nuns in ways similar to how the world affects us today.The first layer of Canticle mesmerized me with its development of saints. This is especially well done in the first part -- Miller beautifully portrays his protagonists as unpretentious and earnest souls who were simply trying to do the best they could with the limited gifts that God gave them. Later generations often revered them, as the ordinary events in their lives mythical proportions. I really liked the ambiguity with which Miller surrounded most of the miracles he recounted -- just as in real life, miracles do not convert those who have refused to believe, while for those with faith, miracles are unnecessary for belief. Miller's portrayal of the unfolding of history is wonderful, and I never saw such a powerful anti-war retelling of WW III until I saw the playground scene in Terminator II.A second layer of meaning can be found in the theological issues underlying the entire book. The conflict between science and religion provides much of the tension in the second Renaissance -- as it did in the (real) first one. But theological issues become most obvious in the last section, in which the Church battles the heresies of modernism and euthanasia -- as it does today. What is amazing is how accurately Miller portrayed the roots of the pro-euthaniasia groups, calling them the world's oldest and greatest heresies: that pain is the worst evil, and that society determines right and wrong. Miller's predictions about social issues are no different than those made by many popes in the Twentieth century, so perhaps his success in predicting them should not be surprising. Predictions aside, only C.S. Lewis and Peter Kreeft have been able to weave the practical consequences of theological issues into stories as well as Miller did.The mystical third layer is usually impenetrable to the logical and engineering geeks (like me) that normally read many science fiction books. Obviously, Miller looks at suffering and death very differently than secular writers do -- as a Catholic, how could he do otherwise? But the last time I reread Canticle, what really floored me was his vision of the Immaculate Conception. Mysteries are unfathomable by nature, but sometimes it possible to catch a glimpse beyond the veil. At such times, I can understand why after seeing a vision of heaven, Thomas Aquinas put down his pen and never wrote again -- declaring that all he had ever written was straw. It is absolutely true. I owe Miller a deep debt of gratitude for the glimpse he gave me (though I haven't quite laid down my pen yet :-) ).The only possible drawback of Canticle is that it was written before Vatican II, and Miller did not foresee the practical disappearance of Latin as the linga franca of the Church.[...]Miller treated the Catholic Church with affection in Canticle, though not without criticism, alluding to Church politics and theological hair-splitting. His increasing disenchantment with the Church became obvious in his sequel, St. Leibowitz and the Horse Woman, which unfortunately does not even come close to his other work. Some of his short stories are as good as Canticle (especially \"Gray Benediction\"), so I was really hoping for a masterpiece. Unfortunately, his \"sequel\", set soon after the second section of Canticle, is a bitter story of political machination, wasted love, and confused theology. The protagonist is a monk who is not well suited for monastic life, so he ends up involved in the tumultuous events surrounding a succession of the Papacy. Meanwhile, he falls in love with a mysterious woman, adding further conflict and doubt to his already troubled faith. Many of the same themes appear as in Canticle -- especially the nature of Christian faith in a very human world full of conflict. However unlike Canticle, the sequel is more graphic in its portrayal of sexuality and violence, and refuses to answer any of the deep questions of faith posed to the characters. That bothered me the most, since he had done such a masterful job of doing so in Canticle. The character development in the sequel is probably better than most science fiction (with the exception of Donaldson's The Real Story), but I was *very* disappointed.As book-reviewer Paul Ziring put it, \"Perhaps an author only gets one such inspiration as Canticle per lifetime\". That may be true, but like Aquinas' straw, such an inspiration sheds light for generations.(This review originally published in Credo, January 11, 1999)","Comparing the United States to the Roman Empire seems to be a fashionable thing to do lately. And the argument is certainly not without merit. As the only superpower left its natural to make judgments based on the worlds great empires and to ask if we are making the same mistakes that caused their downfalls. The real question, of course, is whether we can learn from history in order to avoid those same mistakes.Which is just another way to say that I recently read A Canticle for Leibowitz by Walter Miller, Jr. Published in 1960, the book may be best described as a work of \"Catholic science fiction.\" It follows the travails of a monastery in a post-apocalyptic world where, following a massive nuclear war, humanity turns against intellectuals and learning in a great \"Simplification.\" Books are burned, universities torn down and the general populace intentionally becomes illiterate in the hopes that another \"Flame Deluge\" may be averted. The monks of the Albertian Order of Leibowitz (ironically, and unintentionally, abbreviated to AOL) have been charged with protecting what writings they are able to smuggle into their great collection (the \"Memorabilia\") in the hope that humanity might one day be ready to accept them again.The book is divided into three sections, each separated by 600 years. The first deals with a young postulant's discovery of relics of Blessed Leibowitz, whose cause for canonization has been opened. The second chronicles the arrival at the monastery of Thon Taddeo, the age's greatest secular thinker, and the world's re-discovery of the treasures hidden there. In the last part humanity is once again threatened by the re-development of nuclear weapons and the Church must decide how best to preserve the world's knowledge and ensure the survival of future generations.One of Miller's main themes is the cyclical nature of history: in forgetting its own past, the world inadvertently makes its second annihilation possible. Miller makes a fairly explicit comparison between ignorance and violence on the one hand and knowledge and peace on the other. The tribal factions of the outside world are constantly at odds, fighting over territory, food and other resources. They are unable to work together and, as a result, can build nothing of lasting value.Yet there is still hope in the form of community. By maintaining their connection to the past -- by remembering who they are and passing on that knowledge to future generations -- the monks are able to keep their charge for over 1200 years while, all around them, empires rise, reign and fall. It is the thankless dedication of generations of monks that allows humanity to pull itself from a second Dark Age.The book also highlights the perennial struggle between science's pursuit of fact, the state's pursuit of power and faith's search for truth. This is especially evident in the second part, during which Thon Thaddeo is at odds with the Order over access to the Memorabilia (he wants to relocate the archive to make them more readily accessible to other scientists) and in the third part in which the state sanctions euthanasia camps for radiation victims. How the monks deal with these threats to their mission says a great deal about how and why the Church pursues knowledge (as opposed to science and the state).Although it met with mixed reaction upon its release, A Canticle for Leibowitz went on to win a Hugo Award and is now considered a modern classic in science fiction. I highly recommend it to any fan of the genre or anyone interested in the mission of the Church, even in the most trying of times.","Since many reviewers -some far more capable than I- have already fleshed out many of the nuances of this work, let me present some simple pro's and con's, and you can do the \"moral algebra,\" as Benjamin Franklin called it:First, potential weaknesses:~This novel is light on character development. Those of you who need complex and well developed characters might want to move on. Miller lingers on a few central characters for several chapters and then jumps forward another 600 years into the future twice, introducing a new cast of characters each time. The only recurring character is a mysterious and eccentric Jewish hermit, who appears in each of the three time periods of this book. One character I did find memorable was the \"Poet,\" who was rather funny and well developed.~Miller throws around A LOT of Latin phrases in this book. This might be tedious and annoying to some. It was a bit tedious to me at times, but I really like Latin, so it was bonus to me.~Some people have had an almost allergic reaction to the \"religiosity\" of this novel. True, the novel is heavily effused with the theology and culture of monastic Catholicism, but Miller is NOT trying to win converts.~Miller's words for some devices are just silly, i.e. \"thingumbobs, doohickii.\" I suppose Miller could have used these silly descriptors as a way of expressing the ignorance of the monks.~I can't put my finger on it, but for some reason the storyline can drag on a bit and become boring. This may be due to the absence of truly developed characters. It may also be the locale, which is usually at a monastery. The locale in of itself may not be boring, but the heavy reliance on this scene probably led to the feeling of monotony.Possible strengths:~On the other hand, monotony can be the hallmark of monastic life, and so as boring as it might be, the repetitious and monotonous accounts of life at the abbey do convey as sense of what it would be like to live in such a place.~Miller examines issues/concepts that I found to be quite intriguing: Euthanasia, debate over the preservation or transmission of knowledge, how knowledge changes, evolves, is forgotten, and in some cases, distorted over the course of history, how legends and saints are born, religious concerns over what is \"sacred\" and \"secular\" knowledge, debate over the compatibility or incompatibility between science and religion, and humanity's tendency to create a cyclical pattern in history. All of these issues are examined through the prism of Catholicism and in some, though not all cases, they are examined through a prism of secularism. You might be disappointed with Miller's conclusion on euthanasia.~This book is essentially about \"big\" ideas and how they fare over long passages of time. In this sense, this piece of fiction might be considered \"epic.\" For me, this was one of the main reasons this book received four stars. There are thousands of science fiction novels, but only a fraction of these devote their energies to the contemplation of historical and philosophical questions, and even fewer provide such a unique setting in time and space.~The ending, though sad and somewhat odd (I never fully grasped what Miller was trying to say through Rachel, perhaps how the inhuman can be more human than us?), offers a faint glimmer of hope, for what is an otherwise dim view of humanity. Depending on your presuppositions the conclusion will be cynically delicious or dismal.Conclusion: You might be bored at times, but if you are interested in a sci-fi narrative that explores the issues I outlined above, I think it might be worth your time to push through the dry patches of this text.","This is a book with its own legend. Written near the height of the cold war, published two years after Sputnik, Miller's genre-bending classic of speculative fiction (a newer, more reverent term for science fiction and other imaginings of the future) is a well-written, carefully crafted warning of a future we may think we have now escaped.If you were born after 1980, A Canticle for Leibowitz may lack for you some of the vivid, personal terror readers who knew life lived each day under the threat of global nuclear war will remember. Fear of terrorism, global warming and ecological disaster may have to some extent replaced the dread of being incinerated in a mushroom cloud, but as clear and present as those danger are, they menace with a future dystopia that will come upon us gradually (if they finally do), and we remain able to change & reverse those events & their consequences, even at their worst. Not so in those gray days of 'SALT' and detente. No warnings, no time to act, and nowhere to hide even for the richest few. All, and nothing; and in less than an hour.I first read A Canticle for Leibowitz in the summer of 1982, on the recommendation of a high school classmate with whom I had attended the million-plus person June 12th Nuclear Freeze Rally in Central Park (still the largest gathering ever in NYC, 2nd largest ever on Earth). I have such vivid memories of that day, almost dead-center in a crowd of over a million, and though I don't find references to it elsewhere, I am certain that Orson Welles quoted from A Canticle for Leibowitz when he addressed the crowd. That was how the subject came up: I asked my friend if he knew the book, and he recommended it enthusiastically. He was right.The book captures well the dread we all felt then, seven years (when I first read this in 1982) before the fall of the Berlin Wall and nine before the collapse of the Soviet Union. At the time, for myself and many others, the end was inevitable and nigh. Miller's prose had the blessed effect of offering a sort of consolation & hope, while being funny and very ironic. Reading 'Canticle' was a way of escaping the reality of 1982 while confronting it, sideways. Well-written as a piece of prose fiction, at the level of Arthur C. Clarke, Ursula LeGuin, & Ray Bradbury, with portions of poetic narrative beyond them, and wickedly funny, laugh out loud passages in every chapter, A Canticle for Leibowitz is still highly relevant as a piece of social commentary. The threat of world-wide instantaneous annihilation may be gone, but other threats and challenges remain.Maybe foremost among these is the role of technology in our culture, as both the source of our troubles and, at least partially, the solution to them. Fossil fuels, pollution & waste, pharmaceuticals, genetics & biotechnology, the internet, wireless phones/data links, GMO food products, pandemic disease accelerated by air travel & resistance to antibiotics, these are our daily anxiety now. Religion in general is more at the center of our national attention than it was in the late 50's, especially the misrepresentation, misreading, & mis-translation (accidental or willful) of religious texts (be it the Koran or the Bible), and extreme, exclusive, mean-spirited doctrines east & west. A Canticle for Leibowitz's impact and import is not altered by which monster be the agent of our doom. A dystopic future where we are all shorn of our technological creature comforts, the population is decimated, history is lost, and daily life is a struggle even for the most fortunate, is not less likely than it was in 1959 or 1982. And we are not even really free of the nuclear threat. We do perhaps have some little bit more control over our fates, individual & collective, though it may not always seem so amid the wash of constant bombardment of scary news via satellite TV and 20 megabit internet. I find 'Canticle' to be somewhat an antidote for that, giving perspective and understanding of crisis, its aftermath, and what is lasting & valuable. Put another way, this is a book with a very high signal-to-noise ratio.You might be forgiven for reading this review and thinking that this book is no fun. Granted, a grim subject. More well-meaning, stupid people in positions of power and influence. A uncertain outcome and no hero to save the day or sudden miraculous change of fortune. It is a serious read, but it is also fun, and VERY funny (and very often so), compelling, human, and finally re-affirming of what is good in humans and their civilization.Strongly recommended, and I predict that whether your bent is scifi, literary, or casual as a reader, you will keep and remember this book for a long time.","I treasure this book.I don't recall how many copiesI've purchased over the years...all lent out andlikewise loved.I believe it to be ,with The Lord of the Rings,one ofthe two great books of the past one hundred years.","Originally written in the late 1950s, Walter M. Miller Jr.'s most famous work is still an enjoyable read in my mind. The author skillfully wove together a character driven story of the interplays between faith, technology, and pride. \"A Canticle for Liebowitz\" combines darkness and ironic humor in a way which takes advantage of both without overplaying either. Likewise the novel's treatment of faith and science is generally very well set up by Miller.The plot is divided into three main parts:I. Set several centuries after a twentieth century nuclear war, a Catholic monk in training discovers potentially important documents in an abandoned fallout shelter in the deserts of Utah. Part I is essentially the story of the preservation of the past that successfully manages to merge dark ages/medieval imagery with the genre of post-apocalyptic science fiction.II. Set roughly six centuries or so later, Part II focuses on a time period rather reminisent of the Age of Reason in Europe (the weapons technology appears roughly at 1600s-1700s level). The ruthless monarch of Texarkana has become a major power on a scene divided between a number of other states (eg. the Empire of Denver), nomadic plains peoples almost certainly meant to resemble the Plains tribes of the American West, and the Papacy in New Rome. One of the main conflicts in Part II is not political however, it is the growing clash between religion and secular science including over how to interpret the generation of Liebowitz (a twentieth century scientist). There is also some conflict between fundamentalist minded Catholics and more scientific Catholics within the abbey.III. Set roughly six centuries after Part II, Part III tells the story of the possibly final generation of humans on earth. Atomic weapons have once again been invented and humanity has advanced in technology to the point where colonies are being started in other solar systems. On earth, the Atlantic Confederacy and its Asiatic nemesis are moving to the brink of a war that threatens once again to destroy human civilization and perhaps even more completely (at least on Earth) than the last one. Part III deals with very serious issues ranging from euthanasia to nuclear war to the definition of being human. Faith and society clash as the clock ticks down towards the endgame which seems so inevitable. I personally wander whether Miller had read \"On the Beach\" as the topic of euthanasia after a nuclear assault comes up in this novel as well (Miller seems to take a differeing view from Shute).Overall, \"A Canticle for Liebowitz\" combines excellent penmanship with interesting storylines. While parts may be slightly dated considering when it was written, the overall work holds up quite nicely. I highly recommend it.","A major classic of science fiction, with additional reasons to read it. A future history, post-nuclear apocalypse. How does one preserve knowledge, rebuild society, prevent or prepare fort the next round? The viewpoint is from a Catholic Monastery, which creates a second area of interest. In increasing my understanding of some traditions of the Church that I've rarely seen explicated in conventional forms, this rivals Graham Greene's book The Power and The Glory - a fictional history set in the Mexican Revolution, which science fiction fans probably haven't read but ought to.","This book is very unusual, in that it is both a post-apocalyptic, and a Roman Catholic work of fiction. Although it gets off to a slow and somewhat stilted beginning, I think that if you \"hang in there\" for a little while you will come to enjoy it as much as I did. In fact, it has become one of my all time favorite works of fiction, to be treasured and read over and over again.I especially enjoyed the Latin and Hebrew references, which challenged my translation skills, and being something of a diletante scholar,I found this both enjoyable and rewarding.Additionally, this book is chocked full of pithy and insightful statements, as well as anthropological and historical insights. For example:\" ...this knowledge was empty of content, for subject matter long since gone. STILL, such knowledge had a symcolic structure that was peculiar to itself, and at least the symbol interplay could be observed. To observe the way a knowledge system is knit together is to learn at least a minimum knowledge-of-knowledge, until someday-someday, or some century-an Integrator would come; and things would be fitted together again.\" (p. 65)This statement is practically a formula for studying culture from a French structuralist anthropologetic perspective formulated by Claude Levi Strauss. In case you would like to delve further into these topics, I would recommend reading Levi Straussian literature, or Robin Leach's commentaries on Levi Strauss, as well as the work of Clifford Geertz. If this analysis peaks your interest, you can pursue it further by reading any of the following books offered by Amazon.com:The Interpretation Of Cultures (Basic Books Classics)Structural AnthropologyMyth and Meaning: Cracking the Code of CultureCulture and Communication: The Logic by which Symbols Are Connected. An Introduction to the Use of Structuralist Analysis in Social Anthropology (Themes in the Social Sciences)The author also touches on the process of the \"illumination\" of manuscripts, another particular, historical interest of mine.(p.77-79)Check these Amazon products for further information:Konsthistorisk Tiudskrift Studies of the Illumination of Medieval Manuscripts Art Review Volume XXII, 1953The Depiction of Angels and Devils in Medieval French Manuscript Illumination (Studies in French Civilization)Finally, I would like to close with yet another favorite quotation from the book:\"My execrable vanity is like that of the fable cat who studied ornithology m\"Lord...For as the cat was called by nature to be an ornithhophage, so was Francis called by his own nature hungrily to devour such knowledge as could be taught in those days...\" (p.54)I think you get my point! A book to be savored-like intellectual white chocolate.","I would have to rate this book as one of my favorites. If you're looking for a chilling story that will stay with you, then this is a good book. It is remarkably easy to read, yet unlike most modern &quot;literature&quot;, the story has depth.&quot;Liebowitz&quot; is divided into three separate parts, with the first and the last being able to stand alone, yet when put together compliment each other. The second part, on the other hand, needs the other two chapters.I first read this book for my Sophmore English class in High School. I just recently read it again. In the years that I matured, the meaning of the story changed greatly.I would recomend this book to anyone, young or old, who wants to read a wonderful piece of literature, or just wants a good story.","This book is a true classic. It presents a plot that we've all heard before: What if Nuclear Warfare actually occurred? It seems like a boring idea, but Walter M. Miller, Jr. makes this book extremely intriguing. The ignorance of the characters and their society, is so REAL, that I actually found myself believing this story. The story specifically revolves around a single monastary that is attempting to preserve the boundless knowledge of society's predecessors, but the tribal groups strongly oppose this, being taught that intelligence leads to nothing but destruction. Although I am not Catholic and know nothing of the Catholic faith, I did not have any trouble undertanding this book, which is good. I recommend this riveting and eye-opening novel to anyone wanting to read GREAT science fiction.","I have never taken the time to write a review for Amazon, but I had to take the time for this one. This is my number one, all-time favorite book. It is so profound, showing how man just simply doesn't learn from history. My only complaint is that the title is quite hard to remember! Someone asks me what my favorite book is, I always think of this one, but I have trouble recalling the &quot;Leibowitz&quot; part of the title!","The Canticle for Leibowitz is one of the best novels overall I have read to date. The novel is developing after the Nuclear War, where the monks of Order of Leibowitz are trying to preserve and understand the knowledge of the past. The book is divided in three parts, each of them with about 500 years difference. The plot is unbeleivable, the characters are very well developed. I think, there is not a page in the book that can be omited. The novel makes you think of what we have now and just take it for granted and then somebody is going to screw up and all you have tresured and possessed in your life, all you dreams and ambitions and plans are Gone in the blink of an eye. And then when you try to rebuid and get back to the level of civilization we have now, what are the chances that the history will not repeat itself. You do not need to be an expert or read any previous science fiction books to read and understand this novel. This book could have as easily been in the Fiction Section.","It has been suggested that A Canticle for Leibowitz is the greatest science fiction novel ever written. This is probably true - although the book is far broader and deeper than mere science fiction. This book is a must-read, even if one dislikes science fiction as a genre (I'm very picky myself). It is one of the few books of its type which incorporates religious faith at all - much less as a significant aspect of the story.I can't say enough about this book -- but I fear to say too much.Blessings.","I read this book quickly on an overnight flight to Europe. I found the description of the book on the back as well as on the website to be a bit misleading. It's not so much about the discovery of Leibowitz's artifacts as it is about history repeating itself. ...the story is split into 3 parts. Part 1 takes place when society is recovering from a nuclear war &amp; is generally at peace. Part 2 takes place when man is beginning to become bellicose &amp; fight amongst himself again. Part 3 is a repeat of the age when nuclear war was about to break out. The book contained a lot of religious stuff...I particularly thought the 2nd head that grew on the woman at the very end (I won't spoil it by giving the identity) was an amazing climax. I'm not sure if the theme was that despite the best efforts of religion society will still find ways to destroy itself. The theme of history repeating itself is a major part of the book. As a final comment I agree with another reviewer in being amazed that this book was published over 40 years ago. This book is typically listed as a top 100 scifi classic (that's how I found it) and I think it deserves that ranking. If you like scifi then give it a shot.","Wow! That's all I can say. Many people say &quot;Fiat Homo&quot; is the best piece of the book--wrong. &quot;Fiat Voluntas Tua&quot; is the real reason to buy the book.Fiat Homo takes place 600 years after the Flame Deluge, a mass-extinction-causing nuclear war. Note the lack of any advancements at all. Compare this to the period of time directly after the fall of Rome.Fiat Lux takes place 1200 years after the nuclear war. Its a period of enlightenment, thus, &quot;Let there be light.&quot; Compare this to the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance.Fiat Voluntas Tua takes place about 2000-2500 years after the war. It is an advanced society, more advanced so than today. Compare this part to present day, keeping in mind small terrorist countries all have nuclear weaponry at present. The threat of nuclear war is stronger today than in the 1950's, 60's, 70's, or 80's.Miller does a fabulous job. It's impossible to put the book down at some parts.Enjoy!","Whew boy. Yes this puppy came out in about 1959. Before Zelanzy's Damnation Alley, before a lot of Harlan Ellison's stuff, before the first Dune even, there was Canticle. 1st let me say the edition I read years ago had an introduction by Norman Spinrad which contained many spoilers (gave away parts of the plot) so if the edition you buy has this intro, you may want to skip it.This is also one of the most cerebral of the genre. The book takes place in the future after Nuclear Holocaust. It deals with an order of future monks in the American Southwest as they try to sort out elements of the ancient past (our era) amidst the backdrop of changing survival politics across several generations.One of the things I found interesting about it was how it dealt with the archetypical mutants. Unlike most stories, it has a general moral sense of resposibility towards them-- at least the monks do. The church orders mutants to be taken care of until they reach adulthood. The church also shows concern for other survivors throughout the book-- which causes some points of antagonism.Like other commentators, I note that organized religion is portrayed in this book as a little misguided, but generally well-meaning.It may be a little dull reading for some, since much of the background has been presented many times in movies, but there is also a lot that is still refreshing today.","Nuclear war is a topic that countless writers have depicted in science fiction. The severity and grimness varies widely when they imagine the consequences that follow. Either the war is so destructive all life is wiped out, or mankind is plunged into the depths of savagery, or the destruction is only light and life goes on.As far as I know, Walter M. Miller is the only writer to imagine a nuclear holocaust happening twice. Covering a period of eighteen centuries, \"A Canticle For Leibowitz\" shows how we fail to learn from the past and how we make the same mistakes over and over again.Miller imagines the nuclear holocaust (The Flame Deluge) destroying civilization and putting the survivors into an age of ignorance, brought about by The Simplification. This phase lasts 600 years. In that time monks in a monastery have devoted their lives to preserving scraps of the old scientific knowledge, which survived the murderous rampage of the mobs in the early years after the holocaust.As more centuries pass, the inventions of the past are gradually rediscovered until, by the final third of the book, nuclear technology has reappeared, threatening to destroy civilization once again.While \"A Canticle For Leibowitz\" is bleak, it also has a humorous side. This is one of the best-known books of the genre, and, just like events repeating themselves in Miller's story, the premise has been imitated many times by other writers.Like the interpretations of how Atlantis sank, every writer has their own idea of how the nuclear holocaust will turn out, and how destructive its effects will be. If nuclear war is something we're doomed to repeat, perhaps every author of the topic is right with their description. Naturally, there's only one way to find out. But we don't really want to know which authors got it right, do we?","Back in the mid-sixties Time magazine had an article which discussed the &quot;legitimization&quot; of science fiction in American Literature as taught in University throughout the United States. singled out were Arthur C Clarkes &quot;Childhood's End&quot;, Issac Asimov's &quot;Foundation Trilogy&quot;, and the classic novels from H.G. Wells and Jules Verne. Particular attention was paid to &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; as &quot;a work of literary genius&quot;. The article described the book as &quot;rare&quot; (1967) and thriving in &quot;hand me down&quot; volumes. It did, in truth, take me some time to find a copy of the book and I must say this is the best work of &quot;science&quot; fiction, indeed any fiction, I have ever read. I have purchased and reread the book a half dozen times over the last thirty years and all those copies are in that hand-me-down mill somewhere now.","This is one of the best sci-fi books i've ever read it has everything that great sci-fi needs, depth, philosophical musings and epic scale. The plot follows the fall, rise and fall again of human civilization after a nuclear apocalypse. An order of Catholic monks attempts to keep learning and civilization alive through the post apocalyptic dark ages. The dark ages give way to advanced and more secular civilization and inevitably the self inflicted apocalypse of man occurs again. This book makes you think like all the best sci-fi and has serious layers. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to think about the big civilizational issues on an epochal leval.","For a book that is so broad in its scope, it is difficult to write a succinct review of \"A Canticle for Leibowitz\". Particularly when the personable demons of the author are weighed, the book seems more remarkable.Set in a post-apocolyptic world, the chain of events is set into action with the accidental discovery of artifacts from the hand of St. Leibowitz. More than any character, the book is centered around these and other artifacts. With the \"Simplification\" that followed nuclear annihilation that took place around the 1960's, technology and knowledge has been rejected. This discovery creates a spark.The chronology follows the monk of a Utah abbey for between six to seven hundred years. From the depths of the simplification, the monks spearhead a new enlightenment. The monks have kept many of the relics of the past including technological advances of the past. But with this new enlightenment, man falls into the same pattern to which it succumbed previously.In the novel nothing is inherently evil, but becomes foul in the hands of man. As the author was exploring his faith from a Catholic point of view, the story explores religious and sociological issues and their justifications. Because the author has such a broad scope, it may be difficult to digest these concepts to their full benefit. Even so, this is a remarkable book.","Need I say more? I could, but I can't because I'm speechless after finishing it, after finally \"getting it\" -- what the author had been saying throughout the story and how skillfully he did that. This novel is a work of art on too many levels to discuss here. It's stunning, intelligent, original, unexpected, mystical, even humorous at times. It's been called a masterpiece because that's exactly what it is. Ironically, the last Act of this tragic three-act story (consisting of three stories/novelettes that were put together into one novel)is not in the book. It takes place years later, when after decades of being a reclusive and suffering from PTSD (from WWII, during which he bombed a monastery in Italy, an event that traumatized him to the point of inspiring him to write this amazing story), Miller commits suicide. This one goes in my personal list of best fiction novels of all time.","The forward of this book is brilliant, because it set you up for a critical look at the book through the looking glass of what is literature. Some will say the difference between fiction and literature is if the subject changes your life, then it is literature. Well it has only been one day since I finished Canticle for Leibowitz and I can tell that it will be with me for a long time to come.I always like a good post apocalyptic dystopia, and this proved to satisfy beyond expectations. This easy to read script forced me to pull out the dictionary a few times, but not to the extent to make it seem haughty or overly high brow, which often turns me off.Miller starts the story off a half millennium after a nuclear holocaust and takes the reader on a religious and often satirical look at human nature that is common in what is considered dark ages. Miller pokes fun at why man may consciously attempt to stay \"in brutal/harsh\" times known to simpler dark ages.Miller takes the reader forward in time as man again embraces technology and how man decides to destroy himself as an attack on God. He makes clear his struggle with several Catholic themes such as suicide and euthanasia.In the end you will look at man in a whole new way, and ponder why we establish the means to kill billions at the push of a few buttons. Do we all have a part of ourselves that struggles with suicide or a longing for a simpler life that must have been true in the Garden of Eden; do we hate God, and therefore ourselves because of this? Will we destroy ourselves, then rebuild and do it all over again and again? Miller forces you to look inside for the answers to such questions.","I first read this book 45 years ago. I bought a new copy and read it again. There is a fine line between Sci-Fi and Literary Fiction. I am no literary expert, but this Sci-Fi classic story really is literary fiction. This is a well written story of a post-apocalyptic and dystopian future world.It starts out in a post-apocalyptic nuclear winter future \"middle ages\" in a monastery that is preserving science instead of religion and continues until the world is rebuilt. But no - we always find a way to destroy ourselves again. I liked the technique the author used by applying \"cycles\" to the telling of the story. This book really makes you reflect on the stupidity of mankind. Reading it again as an adult, you appreciate it more what the author is trying to say. How we destroy our societies - rebuild and - destroy it again.It is still in the top 100 of all time science fiction listings. I recommend this book for a person who likes literary fiction, but never really read a science fiction book before."],

      "reviews.text":["I read every review on Amazon-the one's that loved Lucifer's Hammer and the ones who hated the book. But nothing prepared me for the true disaster. No, not the comet hitting the earth, rather the disaster of really bad writing. Some reviewers prepared me for slow action during the first part of the novel. But slow is not the word. The story moved along at the pace of a snail that is walking in it's sleep. My eyes kept trying to close from boredom. I can't even put together a well laid out review because I am already bored again. The conversations amongst the characters were so over the top as to be parodies. I thought I was reading a script for a daytime soap. If it were possible to have one wish, I would ask for the time back I wasted reading this book. UUGGHH","I found this to be a tedious read with shallow cardboard characters. Definitely not on par with Niven's other works (Tales of Known Space series.) If you want an entertaining and thought-provoking post-apocalyptic novel, try Alas Babylon.","I bought this book interested in reading about how people would react in a post-apocalyptic world. Instead I read a soap opera. As one reviewer wrote, the first 200 pages are spent introducing the characters and what a boring 200 pages they are. Unfortunately, it doesn't get much better from there. Instead of outlining how resourceful some of the characters are in order to survive, the authors are preoccupied with race and sex (more characters than you can believe are more worried about sex than where they are going to get their next meal). If you would like to read a good post-apocalypse book take a look at Alas, Babylon. A little dated (cold war) but a much better read than this.","There is a lot to like about this book; it's a smart treatment of the subject matter. I found it entertaining at the beginning, though my ability to care about the characters or even the fate of the earth eroded to nothing by the end.Racism and sexism can be portrayed without implying that the reader should agree with racist and sexist attitudes. However, I'm afraid nothing in this narrative actually suggests that one should regard either its vile depiction of black people or its characters' paternalist attitudes with a critical eye.Also, the characters reinvent feudalism/monarchy without any apparent regret or even self-awareness, so the message seems to be that preserving democracy is not important to saving civilization.If you must pay money for it, get a used copy, and be prepared to hold your nose.","Seriously. First it is so incredibly dated. But I can only fault myself for that as I didn't check the publication date and thought it was a fairly recent book. The worst type of being dated. It was dated in the '70s. Other than that it is INCREDIBLY BORING. Just incredibly boring. It really just became a scan read. But to back up my poor review I will just put down one plot hole. The writer's description of the damage of the comet hit was just too much. NOTHING would have survived that. Than add 50 nuclear weapons fired at China by Russia and then 50 or so nuclear weapons fired at Russia from China. I'm just getting angry writing this review...that's how horrible an disappointing this book was.","Lucifer's Hammer covers the months surrounding a comet hitting earth and the aftermath. The story is rich with characters - too many characters actucally. I had trouble keeping track of all of them and what role they played in the story.My largest complaint is actually more mundane, its the dated feel of the book. Lucifer's Hammer was published in the 1970s and it feels like a 1970 book with 1970s mentality. I can excuse the occasionally dated reference, but the characters and the story feel dated. I especially found the way it dealt with race to be a little old school - and not in a good way.As far as end-of-the-world stories go, this is a okay book. It doesn't skimp on the details.","Gosh, I do ADORE these end-of-the-world tales. They are the ideal \"pick-me-up\" for a prosaic existence.If you don't possess the intestinal fortitude to take a pill and drown drown DROWN in the aftermath of a day littered with self-doubt and turmoil, read \"Lucifer's Hammer\" and just about any other apocalyptic/post-apocalyptic fiction on which you can get your hands. There's a pile accumulating in my bedroom. I have not yet encountered a \"stinker\". I hope that I never run out of titles in this genre because the catastrophic glee that I derive from the pages really keeps me breathing at a regular rhythm.Gee...kind of reminds you of that fifth-season Twilight Zone episode, \"Ninety Years Without Slumbering\", doesn't it...??","I dont know if this is a case of art imitateing life, but one of this novels central ideas, is that 'nuclear saves the world'. The very idea that a nuclear plants staff would stick around in earthquake prone california to rescue a Nuke-plant(that no longer even has a grid to conect to) during the worst disaster in 65 million years would be laughable if not for recent events in Japan. As much as I enjoy most of the works of these two otherwise fine writers, the novels Nukes=good, enviromentalists=insane lunatics message is one that is a little hard to swallow. Neither author could be called stupid by any stretch, but Lucifers hammer ' not-so-covert message' makes me wonder. This alone, makes it hard to recommend this book for anyone but a Tea-party zombie or american republican. If you think Left behind or Atlas Shrugged is great art, you might enjoy this novels not so subtle Pro-nuclear, anti-enviromental message. Otherwise, there are far better post-apoc books out there.","Written back in 1977, this book was all of he '70's disaster movies wrapped into one long and boring novel. The only thing missing was OJ Simpson in a security guard uniform! It was a struggle just trying to get past the first 200 pages or so, that's how long it took the authors to introduce all of the characters in this book. When the comet hit it didn't get any better....only worse! After suffering through a little more than half way through this slow paced disaster I just skimmed ahead and finally put it down for good. If your looking for a good post apocalyptic book pass this one up.","You know a book is bad when EVERYONE in your book club, regardless of political, spiritual or social background unanimously hated it! (With the exception of the person who picked the book, who is now believed to have some mental defect). The only positive thing we could agree on was that the \"concept\" was good... but that was it. It had waaaaay to many characters, the writing was confusing, no doubt due to the fact that there are 2 authors, most of the storylines are completely ridiculous, and by the end you wish everyone had just died upon impact. No one was worthy of survival.The story takes place right where I live, so from a personal perspective I could appreciate the location, I knew where the towns and freeways were, but beyond that I have nothing but contempt for this book. It is now just hours of my life I will never get back.","Of all the asteroid-destroys-civilization epics penned since this one--whether or not they were filmed--none is better.","I thought the book was absolutly amazing! Once you get past the first hundred pages or so, Lucifer's Hammer picks up and doesn't stop until the last page. It will not dissapoint!","Good character development with several different story lines. If you don't mind historically dated material (pre-the fall of the Soviet Union and the advent of the Space Shuttle)... still timely and plausable story of the effects of a major comet strike on the earth and civilization.","I read this back in '77 in paperback and only recently acquired a Hardcover copy. Movies and TV shows from 'Armageddon','Deep Impact', 'The Postman' and TV's latest 'Jericho' all tip their hat to this novel written 30 years ago!Larry Niven is known for 'mining out the entire vein' of ideas and implications of his subject matter. Teamed with Dr. Pournelle it is even more comprehensive. A comet is discovered and as it approaches people as myriad and diverse ranging from: Street thugs, Astronauts hoping for a ride/slot on the next Mission, A Banker who is dreading overages he cannot explain to his Bank, to a Mailman who in view of the End of the World far beyond his Oath decides 'It's optional. I think I'll deliver the mail.'It is a long and rich read that starts slow but must do so to weave all these stories and people together. In one scene a JPL 'Rocket Scientist' spends the first day after the comet strikes saving and protecting hundreds of books he knows will be needed to rebuild. I challenge the reader to not speculate on what they would save as he forges out amongst a Post-Comet world with a copy of 'How Things Work Vol II' as proof of his worth IF he can find a haven of saftey.It will make you look at your Kitchen food supply and gas tank and wonder..'How long could I survive?' and 'What is going to kill me?' Tetanus from a rusty nail or cannibals when the food is gone? It spans the planet and it all works.Being from 1977 some parts will seem dated such as: 'One thing after Hammer strike was Womens' LIB ended in milliseconds' till you recall the IRS agent on TV's 'Jericho' realize the uselessness of her job and just how far away that Mocha-Latte from Starbucks is!Read it and you'll know the screenwriters of the works cited above have already!None better!","I first read this novel back in the 1980s and thought it was great. Gave it another look recently and came up with a different view. Although this is a solid novel, it does have problems.The story is fairly simple. It recounts numerous people and their efforts to survive in Southern California after the Earth is struck by a comet. Over time, the story focuses on two groups. One is a farming community that has set up a feudal system under the control of a US Senator. The other group is a cannibal army made up of army mutineers, thieves that escaped the drowning of Los Angeles and unfortunates who were captured and brought into the fold. This band is jointly lead by an army sergeant, a former black panther and a televangelist. You could imagine what occurs with these bands of survivors.Larry Niven is a master of hard science fiction. He does not disapoint us here. His description of the comet are excellent and he describes the impact wonderfully. The portraits of the characters were also very compelling in the lead up to impact and the period just after impact as they try to survive. Two story lines I greatly greatly enojoyed were the scene with the surfers trying to ride out a tsunami and the banker fretting over embezzling money just before impact. Wonderful additions!There are also weak points too. Niven and Pournelle like to put lots of characters into their stories. Its easy to loose track of the less important characters. Another issue I had with the novel was it fell behind the times technology wise. I also thought the authors had civilization break down waaaay too fast. As best I can tell, the cannibals start eating people about a week after impact. Dont believe it. Still, these are not the worst problems in my opinion.The worst to me is I beleive the authors focus on the wrong groups. While the cannibals are utterly repulsive, the feudalists are not much better. I could not work up any sympathy for a group that so callously threw people out in the cold if they were deemed useless. In fact, I found my self hoping the cannibals would overrun them and eat them. The two bands I found most intriguing were the nuke plant group and the boy scouts who go wild. While the power plant people get some attention, you see nothing of the \"Lord of the Flys\" style scout troop. Too bad.....","Like many folks out there, I got this one for a rainy day; y'know, just for emergencies when there is nothing else to do. I'd heard some good things about this one, and some bad ones too (especially from my African-American friends), so it sat aside my bed table. While recovering from a recent illness, I decided to start the book. That was on a Friday; it was another NINE days before I finished it! But that's a good thing. Though a tad on the long side (Clancy's 'The Sum of All Fears' is even longer), it was interesting nonetheless. Starting with the plush California life, this story inches along for the first 250+ pages. Then the disaster hits you . . . WHAM!!! I died, figuritively, while reading the riot scene in downtown LA. And then there was the tidal wave; let me tell you, I was doin' some praying for these folks! The scope on which this book enthralls the reader is both huge and tiny; while the international comet strikes destroy the world economy, the authors managed to keep the focus on the Californian people and their fight for survival. To see Senator Jellison emerge as such a leader was relieving (good lord, the rest of the world leaders ALL manage to die, and he is somehow filled with common sense that no one else possesses). The portrayal of black characters is ethnically offensive, but this is a book that takes place (REMEMBER!) in the 1970's. The Black Liberation Movement and similar type groups were everywhere, and to the Caucasion communities they assumed this was the life of African-Americans (THANK GOD we know better now!). Gritty, Gorey, and most of all Hauntingly REALISTIC, I highly recommend this book! It is worth the sluggish beggining, the racial offensiveness, and even cannibalism!","I read this book many many years ago and loved it. Recently I read another book of the end-of-the-world genre and wished I could remember the name of this book. Luckily I've got good search skills and rediscovered it online. It is every bit as good as I remember. Must read.","This has got to be THE end of the world story! Don't let the length turn you off, it'll be done before you are ready for it. The story is of a meteor (Deep Impact-style) that is found in outer space by a novice stargazer, and it is up in the air about whether or not it will actually collide with Earth, excuse the hideous pun. The twists in the story keep the reader guessing about the outcome of the comits path, and the distruction it will cause if it does hit our planet. Life-like outcomes of the inevitable lend the story a pleasing and horrifing reality that shocks the reader. A definite MUST READ!!","Picture the movie Armageddon set in the 70's. But instead of blowing the asteroid (comet in the book) up, it hits. The desription of the devestation of southern California is obviously well thought out and described. Also the authors do a good job with what would happen to people immediately after the destruction of civilization. (grouping together, canibalism etc.) I wish more was written about what happens in other parts of the country and world though, the entire book is set in California. If you liked Swan Song by Robert McCammon (McGammon?) Or The Stand you will probably like this book.","All in all, this is a very entertaining book! I don't know why more sci-fi books like this aren't written (I , for one, am sick of all the &quot;alien -monsters-are- going-to-get-us&quot; sci-fi drivel). If any other readers know of similar books to this one, please write a review on this book and mention them. Thanks.","I read the reviews of this book prior to buying it. It has been reviewed so much that I won't go into the details of the book. However, I want to say that the first 350 pages (the book is 600+ pages) of this book were tedious in character building. I had to gloss over a lot of none essential dribble that was so annoying. The book could have been condensed down to a total of 400 pages. Better books to read would be \"Patriots, Surviving the Coming Collapse\" or \"One Second After.\" Both of those books have their flaws but were page burners and recommended!","Given their attachment to the Reagan administration, I suppose I should not be surprised to learn that N&P are conservatives. But it was a bit disconcerting to read about the evils of hippiedom n a sci-fi work. Indeed, given the obvious fear of black gangsters and white [addicts], and the heroic actions of boy scouts and rugged individualist Senators, this book can easily be seen as a reactionary screed against the excesses of the sixties. The misogynistic clich&eacute;s about how women must retreat to the kitchen when the times get really tough are expected. Still, the macho posturing is par for the course in this field, and does not mar the work over much. The story is quite entertaining, one would hardly think that the tail of a rock hitting the earth would be engaging, but N&P are nothing if not master story tellers. In the pre-apocalypse the characters drive the book, in the post apocalypse it's the story of their fates. Either way, it's an engaging page-turner. Almost any N&P work is worth the price of admission, but this one is a bargain at twice the price. They should make a mini series out of it.","I've been familiar with the title of this book since it first came out in 1977 but only got around to reading it in 2012, when I read it on Kindle.I love apocalyptic stories, but this one left me cold. The writing is bland and the characters never engaged me. I made it to the 63% mark (through the first three of the four \"books\" in the novel) and finally decided that I just didn't care enough to wade through another 200+ pages. When I realized that it really didn't matter to me who lived or died, I decided to quit.The prose is serviceable and there's lots of science. It's nice to find science in science fiction. Maybe in 1977 the idea of something from outer space smashing into the Earth and ending civilization was fresh enough to carry the book, but these days, when you can turn on the TV nearly any day of the week and find a \"documentary\" about killer asteroids or somesuch, concept alone isn't enough. We need some of that other writerly stuff, like good prose and intriguing characters, which Lucifer's Hammer sadly lacks.","tedious start. i think they were trying to show that s.f. could be literature.","I am a huge fan of other apocalyptic fiction such as \"On the Beach\" and \"Alas, Babylon\" and this one is right up there with them. The details are extraordinary, the plotting tight. I am, however, confused about when \"liberals\" became the ones burning books when the few times in my life I've actually heard of it happening it's always been Bible-thumping right wing conservatives. Consider this liberal a fan and the so-called racism did not bother me in the slightest. A great book.","Lucifer's Hammer starts out exceedingly slow, then picks up about 160 pages in. The point of impact is quite climatic, and afterwards, the story plummets into obvious boredom. There are characters brought to life, but dead-ended in terrible fashion (such as the pyschotic rapist). Further, basing the entire story in the state of California seemed to limit the scope of the tale. Scientists speculate California would be the first to go in such an event......lackluster prose, too many characters, not enough fear painted into the book. Much of it seemed to upbeat, when it should actually be a tragic novel. I was entertained, but not blown away. This novel was popular, I presume, because it was one of the first of its kind. Credit to both authors, who are known to be clever writers. The price is quite low, so if you wish for a form of escapism, then take the time to read it. Apocalyptic and Post-Apocalyptic novels are hard to write, and this one just missed the train. But again, not to sound too harsh, the book was entertaining and awe-inspiring at times.","Tedious read, felt like work actually finishing this book.Slightly better than working however...Book was written in the 70's and has some interesting ideas on surviving. And does make one wonder what the US would be like if Kalifornia was underwater after a meteor strike","This is a good book but he concentrates mainly on people who survived the impact, not going into too much detail about the actual event.","With all the farmers and survival types, nobody had a portable gasoline generator to provide electricity?zdaytripper@hotmail.com","I REAK THIS BOOK AT IT'S FIRST RELEASE. AND A COUPLE OF TIME SINCE. WITH THE COMET/ ASTEROID CRAZE NONE HAVE COME CLOSE WITH STORYLINE, BELIEVABLITY, AND SHEER HUMAN SUSPENCE. READ IT YOU WILL LOVE IT. (JUST GET PAST THE OUTDATED SCIENCE)","This book is one of my favorite apocalypse books (second to One Second After). It wasn't really a problem for me, but pointed out by friends who I suggested this book to, was that it is a slow start to the &#34;adventure&#34; and the characters are not very well developed. You just don't feel bad for that many of them. Not like in One Second After. Still, very entertaining read.","My mom re-reads this book at least once a year. Her copy fell apart so I bought her a new one. I've read it twice myself. Great book. I love the disaster genre.","Too many characters introduced in the beginning were hard to keep track of. The actual catastrophe took a bit too long buillding up.","I have read Larry Niven's books since I was a kid. (72now). After I got into the book a ways I realized it was heading to the place where I grew up. I grew up right there, where the story comes together. It is fun to read a book, where you know every road, creek, boulder and store.","A book you can read and reread. Still fun to read. Very few do end of the world this well","I have read other books by this author and enjoyed them, so I thought I would try this novel.This book is shorter than most of the others and a little dated with space shuttle references in the future tense,Still a good overall read.","I am rereading this book and enjoying it all over again.Really makes you think about what you would do to survive.","I read this years ago and was drawn back. Amazing how dated Science Fiction can become in a relatively short time.","I first read a battered copy of this book years ago, and I was fascinated by it then. Having the opportunity to put it on my Kindle was a chance I couldn't pass up, and I'm glad I'm didn't. It's STILL a great book, telling tales of bravery and cowardice, kindness and cruelty, and the human need to keep on living despite horrific, post apopylyptic conditions. Highly recommended!","Ever wonder what it would be like?Ever wonder just what California in the 70's was like?Get through the first 100 pages (it is the backround you need) and read away. Well developed characters, and mostly realistic scenarios.","This was one of the best books I have ever read. I enjoyed it so much that I kept the paperback version. A book has to really warrant it to gain that distinction. I reread it acouple years later and the only reason I am writting this review is because I suggested it to a friend and couldn't remember who wrote it. To remember a books title almost some 15 years after you read it the first time is something. I have only read two other author's books over again. One was Stephen Kings &quot;The Stand&quot; and the other was David Eddings series &quot;The Belgarath Series&quot; and &quot;The Mallorean Series&quot;.","I have had the book since it was published. My copy is well-thumbed and growing quite mangy with age and reading. I don't know how many times I have read it ,but it must be at least 6.My personal opinion is that this book is one of the superlatives of the genre. It can be slow reading, but I never had trouble reading it from cover to cover.Those who think the book is racist would call \"Robinson Crusoe\" by Defoe racist and for the same reason. If a person of color is presented in an unflattering light or a position of servitude, the book is racist. This \"racist\" book took the characters from the times. We did not have the influx of Mexicans then that we have now. (If that is racist, I don't care) There were no barrios. Had the book been written now, I am sure the villanous gang would have included Hispanics as well as the white and black characters. These were vile people regardless of race, which was mixed.If you spend your life looking for insult, you are going to find it. I am very, very tired of hearing the term \"racist\". It never once occurred to me about this book. If you think the book is \"racist\", I suggest you find something sanitized, like the new version of \"Huckleberry Finn\" to read so you do not have to wallow in your victimhood.","The first 130 pages deal with getting to know the large cast of characters before TSHTF. You get to see the disaster from the point of view of about a dozen people, most of whom I could care less about. It's overkill in every sense, a total collapse of everything but somehow crazy evil people survive with enough excess energy and high-functioningness to wage complex forms of war. It doesn't ring true at several levels.The best part of the story had to do with how they dealt with refugees and trying to husband scarce resources. There was some vaguely interesting stuff about how to defend a stronghold, and a Deux Ex Machina point of view of Astronauts (Gods!) that seemed unnecessary. At 629 pages it really should have contained two or three novels, only one of which would have been worth the read.There were a few snippets of how to prepare, including one warning that store clerks were paying attention to WHO prepared so they could go boost your supplies when TSHTF. Another interesting thing was how little people were enjoined to prepare for an imminent disaster. No evacuations, no contingency planning, it was as if everyone in New Orleans were told to come out to the beach to watch Hurricane Katrina coming in because it would be exciting to watch. Sadly, that part rang true. Don't expect Leaders to tell you when you should Get Out Of Dodge.Although the disaster wasn't particularly dated, being geologic in nature, there were some pretty weird things going on in this novel including a lot of crowing about the instant death of the Feminist Movement and some male-fantasy versions of the breakdown of family. In short, women get to be a commodity for tending the ill, feeding the hungry and providing a moist vagina. Having been a young woman in 1977, I'd say this story said more about Larry Niven than it did about 1977.","Just finished Lucifer'Hammer, and I am generally underwhelmed.The premise is a good one, civilization is destroyed by a comet impact, and I suspect that most readers picked this book up because they are fans of post-apocalyptic fiction.Unfortunately, the book is very poorly paced. The first half the book describes characters BEFORE the comet strikes, and that portion of the book is somewhat tedious.The action and pace pick up quickly once the comet strikes, the narratives that follow are good and very enjoyable. However just when the book reaches it's climax, the second half of a major conflict that the book has been building up to is completely glossed over, and the results of the climax aren't even narrated, just referred to in a rushed closing chapter, I found this utterly maddening!A good editor would have tightened up and shortened the beginning of the book, thus allowing the story, and it's climax, to be told in more detail. It's almost like the editors decided three quarters through writing \"uh oh, this book is getting too long, time to wrap it up, no time to describe the climactic ending, we'll just tell them what happened in the last chapter\".This is a shame because I completely enjoyed the second half of the book, it just should have gone on for about four or five extra chapters towards the end.I don't blame the authors, I have no doubt that they could have really finished the book with style, but I suspect their editors intervened disastrously.","I read this book years ago. I can't understand the \"rave\" reviews. I know you have to build up your characters and all but 250 pages to even spot the doom coming? Then all the apocalyptic stuff finally occurs, but by then I was too bored to care.","One of the classics in the \"doomsday\" genre and should not be overlooked or underestimated. Little slow out of the gate, much like S. King, setting up the plot, story lines, and characters but once you get passed that you are hooked. Much like the EMP genre, this \"doom from space\" novel brings to life characters fighting to survive in a post-event world where not much works immediately afterwards, chaos reigns, some good go bad, the bad are even worse, but civilized and determined survivors find the will to fight fight fight their way to rebuilding civilization. Page turner and well written account of doom, chaos, the ugly (very) and good side of humanity! Highly Recommended!!!","I picked up \"Lucifer's Hammer\" after being told it is considered one of the big names in post-apocalyptic fiction. This book was on a list that included \"Alas, Babylon\" and \"The Road\", two books I thoroughly enjoyed. This book is about a comet that collides with earth, causing widespread destruction and the demise of modern human civilization. While it has elements that make for an interesting read, overall this book was largely boring and suffered from being marketed wrong.Based on the product description from Amazon, it would appear that this book is several hundred pages that detail the appearance of the comet, its eventual impact, and the aftermath. This is partially true, but each section does not get an equal share of the book. The comet strikes at nearly halfway through, leaving the first several hundred pages being left to excessive description of society following the comet's first appearance in space. When it does strike, things get interesting for about a hundred pages, as the authors do a good job telling the reader the global destruction caused by the comet (e.g. most of the U.S. is under water, Russia fires nukes at China to overthrow their government and get to the \"warmer climate, etc.) The aftermath, however, lacks any pronounced storyline. Like I said, I feel that this book was marketed wrong, as the Amazon description makes it sound like detail is given heavily to the survivors \"fighting to survive in a new world\". More or less, the only story is the survivors attempting to prove themselves worthy to get into a fortified ranch and then fighting against one group of cannibals. This becomes a very dry read, especially when the authors provide several dozen characters to follow and elaborate on each storyline. Honestly, after about the 5th character, I was tired of hearing how so-in-so made their way across the barren landscape.In short, this book is okay, but not great. I don't know why so many people consider it one of the best post-apocalyptic fiction stories out there, as I feel better ones are available (see Cormac McCarthy's \"The Road\"). For someone intent on reading this work, I would recommend visiting the library or buying it used.","Plot Kernel - In California, a massive comet is discovered by a wealthy amateur astronomer. A TV news documentary, sponsored by the man who discovered the comet, is made of the discovery. Although the comet will pass near the Earth it does not seem that it will strike; but there are doubts. For some people, this event portends the end of the world. As the comet approaches, we follow the documentary maker, the amateur astronomer, an influential Senator, the women in their lives, and others, including a U.S./Russian team sent to the space station to retrieve data from the oncoming comet. As the comet nears, it splits and impacts the planet with devastating effect, creating earthquakes and tsunamis in California, and equivalent havoc worldwide. Those people that can, head for high ground. Civilization has collapsed. The social constraints and protections of law are gone.Note: The science fiction writers, Niven and Pournelle, are not interested in the gritty details of day to day survival in a post-apocalyptic, non-technological world, and are more concerned with setting up the disaster, showing some of the terrestrial and social effects, and then positioning their main characters so that as the novel works towards its resolution they can begin to recover the world they've lost; and for them, the means to that end is electricity. \"We can rebuild a civilization if we have electricity.\" (p 528)This novel is often mentioned as one of the best books in the genre of end-of-the-world fiction. This is not, however, a story of hardcore survivalists, prepared and equipped years ahead for disaster, and triumphing in the aftermath. It is a story about everyone else. What is portrayed in the book is the panic and confusion during the collapse of civilization, the rapid descent into distrust and selfish barbarism that follows, the tribalism that can arise, and the difficulties in finding and keeping food, shelter and water. What we see through the struggles of the characters is the importance during extreme civil disorder to be wary and to protect and defend ourselves from the unrestrained desires, compulsions and needs of others.","A very good 'end of the world' novel. In this case the cause is a comet which hits the earth, causing massive tsunamis, earthquakes, and huuricanes. The comet also will change the earth's climate, causing a new ice-age.The book concentrates on a number of disparate individuals from southern California, before and after the disaster. Fortunately pockets of order do survive, but will they be able survive roving gangs, and the coming winter? Much of the compelling storytelling comes from examining how different people cope when civilization collapses and anarchy rules. Depressing reading when one realises how fragile our modern world is and how easily humanity can descend back into barbarism.","I remember reading this book when it was new back in the 70's. Now adays the book is somewhat dated, but still a great book to read regardless.If you are looking for a modern version of this book, you may want to read 'Earth the New Frontier' by Adam Celaya. This is a brand new EOW (end of world) book that will truly grab you by the brain and hold on. I was just blown away by this book. My wife said that Earth the New Frontier scared her real bad. Awesome book!","This is a great book people. If you're looking for something different, something that after you've read it your world and values change for a week or two, this is that book. We've all seen the 90's asteroid, end of the world movies and how they are somewhat lacking in taste and depth. Well, don't expect anything but the best from this work. This pair of authors carefully put together a tapestry of lives that run together to form a complete world. The tattered remains after civilization is ended is deeply described and how those lives cling to the tatters in hope of a new beginning.We should never lose hope.","WOW!!! I just finished Lucifer's Hammer and it was a ride. The first 100 pages were a bit slow, but they were needed to develop the characters that Niven and Pournelle created. After page 100, though, things really take off. I was reading into the wee hours of the morning, covering 100+ pages every night. By the end of the novel, the only word that is necessary is masterpiece.","Although published in 1977, this book continues to be one of my favorites.A great sci-fi suspense thriller. From the initial sighting of a new comet, speculation grows as to whether or not the comet will strike the earth. The characters are well presented and you easily follow their actions and reactions to this catastrophic event. You will quickly become involved with the characters as Tim Hamner, who first sights the comet, fights to stay alive after being blamed for the terrible things that are sure to happen if the comet hits earth. Amidst the turmoil there is a wonderful story of love, death, relationships and ultimate human survival instinct that you will enjoy.Every time I want to relax and enjoy a good thriller- sci-fi survival story I pull out my tattered copy of Lucifer's Hammer. When ever I see a copy in the store, I quickly purchase it, just to have a new copy around. I have given this book as gifts to many family members and friends.I just wish that Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle would write a sequel just to let us know how these characters are progressing in their quest to rebuild the world","First, ignore the buffoonish, elitist reviews about racism. These are the result of political profiling by liberals who are frustrated by their inability to burn books. It's a free country- if you don't like a book, don't read it.As for this book, it is fine depiction of a bolt from the blue and how America might react. Accurate? Who knows? That's the point of fiction. Don't get tangled up in junk science details- just read the story.There are certain books that fall into the \"cannot put down\" category. This is one.","The best end-of-the-world book I have ever read! This is one of those books that I re-read every few years and even though it now seems a bit dated (it was published in 1977), it still gives me goosebumps when the Hammer falls! The authors really did their homework when they researched the \"what if\" possibilities included in this book. After reading this book you will be heading for the nearest Army Surplus store for survival supplies!","Larry Niven (\"Ringworld\") and Jerry Pournelle's \"Lucifer's Hammer\" is probably the granddaddy of the Comet/Asteroid impact novels. It debuted in the late 1970s, and, like other reviewers have commented, it is rather dated because of it. It still makes a darn fine read, and Niven's skill at storytelling more than make up for the novel's faults.An arrogant scientist discovers a comet heading towards Earth. A concerned Senator manages to make it into his ranch in the hills above his Los Angeles constituency before it happens. From there, he and his friends attempt to rebuild civilization, employing everything from Mustard gas to nuclear power along the way. The \"bad guys\" are some hoods from, well, `da `hood, who join forces with some National Guard renegades and form a cannibalistic army. It's a showdown of apocalyptic proportions (well, not really) that determines the fate of the world - or, at least, Hollywood.Yeah, it may take itself a little too seriously, but Niven and Pournelle know how to tell a good story. These days, the disaster and post-apocalyptic genre is filled with such books, but \"Lucifer's Hammer\" did the Deep Impact thing first. Prose isn't perfect, but dialogue flows easily; like the more recent \"The Rift,\" \"Lucifer's Hammer\" is a monster of a book, but doesn't take long to breeze through at all. It isn't perfect, but it's one of the best. Check it out for good adventure, survivalist know-how, and a perfect example of how to do post-apocalyptic fiction.","Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle have their own style of writing and it seems most people either love it or hate it. If you've ever read one of their several books you know what I mean. They're adult books, sexual liaisons, extramarital affairs are rampant throughout. They also write for the time that the novel was written in. They'll write about the Pep Boys store on the corner, actual street layouts in LA, DC, etc, what is in fashion in clothing, food, style, etc for that season. You can almost see the cheese fondue on the table, the bearskin rug in front of the fireplace, and the faux brick wall covering. For that reason the setting in their books are more appreciable when read when published and give it a dated feel when read years or even decades later. However, this should not put you off from reading them and that's most true for Lucifer's Hammer published in 1977. This book is the best account I've seen written or movie viewed of the scenario of effects of a large asteroid/meteor/comet striking the earth. And this includes the movie Deep Impact, which had a nice visual of a tidal wave knocking over the buildings in New York City. However, unlike that movies' rip-off ending which only showed the US Capitol being rebuilt in the aftermath because they ran out of money or something, the book goes into considerable detail of the future events afterwards. And what a bleak future it is. It is a terrifying account of the effects and it is made all the more significant, that unlike alien contact which who knows when it will occur, a significant sized asteroid has struck the earth and could possibly again.After reading the obliteration of large parts of the planet and accounts of the aftermath you will want to stock up on water, canned goods, make plans in-case-of-emergency. Which is a good idea anyway if living in earthquake prone areas or really anywhere. NASA satellite data of the Boxers Day 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami showed open sea waves traveling from the epicenter at jet aircraft speeds, that's 600 mph or 1000 km/hr! And that tsunami would be trivial compared to what would have after a large asteroid strike in the ocean. With the surface of the earth 70% water, an ocean strike has a significant possibility of occurring. People practically cringe and duck under the table at the mere mention of nuclear power (no doubt fueled by the news media), but several years ago the news mentioned a tsunami was heading towards Southern California and people flocked to the beach to see it. At least that attitude should have changed and will change more after reading this novel. Another powerful aspect about the book is that when finally civilization has a chance to be maintained, when apocalyptic groups/gangs have been neutralized, there's one last powerful, dark-ages, threat to civilization mob/gang/group remaining. And instead of what was done about the Soviet Union/Russia after the defeat of Germany in World War II: `oh everyone is tired of war, look at this happy sailor tipping and kissing this girl on the streets of Paris that's on the cover of Life magazine, oh maybe we can just ignore them, oh so what about what they're doing/torturing/killing to people, it's not us', civilization in the book recognizes the threat, realize that albeit how tired they are this is their last, best chance to do something about it, pull themselves up by the bootstraps, and confronts it. That's a subtly that can be easily missed, but a powerful one for those that know some world history about WWII and it's aftermath. For these reasons Lucifer's Hammer is well worth reading.","I grew up in the 70s, and the book pretty much nails the culture back then. The reviewers crying racism are laughable.I've probably read this book about 10 times over the years. A really great read.","I first read this book back in 1983, after its second release. At the time, I remember being greatly affected by the premise of a giant comet striking the earth and putting the earth back into an ice age. At the time, it caused me to question our obsession with technology and the uselessness of all our advances in the face of an event that all but wipes out our species.(And this was before cell phones, the FAX machines, computer/telephones, and email) I found myself asking what I would take if I had only a week or a month to prepare for the end of civilization. But that was 1983. I am a reader. I read book after book and have for most of my 68 years. Hundreds of books ago, I read this book. I have now reread it, and I must say that this book has stayed with me longer than some much more \"literary\" books I have read. I have never forgotten it, and athough it is not considered a literary masterpiece, it has certainly made a lasting impression on me. It is the best end-of-the-world story I have ever read, hands down. It is impossible to put down, and it stays with you for many, many years. That's why I give it five stars. I feel duty-bound to do so.","Niven and Pournelle wrote a fantastic dystopia that kept you turning the pages. This one has to be one of my favorite books ever! Even though it took awhile to really kick into the full action I enjoyed it from cover to cover. I really enjoyed reading about the end of the world due to a comet strike. I've been reading various dystopia lately and each one gives a very similar outcome, but this one leaves you with how much man will sacrifice to save what is thought to be the last electric plant on earth.This book goes into great detail on how one would continue in a world that has become savage and without law. They go beyond why some turn quickly to cannibalism, and others enjoy the benefits of effective organization and write a story that could be a how to guide to life after a disaster. One thing I thought was smart is the fact that one man buried books wrapped in several layers of plastic, and they proved vital to rebuilding. Can you imagine trying to rebuild a society that has been ruined. Very few of us know how much of our technology works, only how to use it. This book makes me want to preserve a couple of \"how things work\" books.The action throughout is enough to keep you turning the pages, but what make this one so great is how it ends.","Once again, Niven and Pournelle demonstrate their irresponsible environmental policies. After Earth is nearly destroyed, what's the most important thing a man can do? Why fighting to save your local nuclear power plant, of course!I wouldn't mind these guys espousing dangerous politics, but do they have to make everyone who disagrees with them out to be a dunderheard? Or a cannibal?Well, this book isn't ALL bad. The middle third is mildly entertaining. You can skip the whole first third where they try to make you care about their uninteresting characters and jump right to when the asteroid hits. The Escape From LA part is sort of fun if you're from southern California. Otherwise there are probably too many in-jokes for most people. And the last third is almost unreadable as it descends rapidly into Political Dogma With A Big Agenda. Niven is at his best when he's writing about other worlds. Pournelle is at his best when he's writing about LANs and disk drives. Put these guys together and it's right wing tripe.","This is the only book I've ever physically thrown in the trash. It does my heart good thinking of the maggots, worms, and infectious bacteria eating this book in the landfill right now. This, and I didn't even make it to the racist part.It's unbelievable this has a four and a half star average. Am I the only person who doesn't like being patronized by a writer? Or in this case, two writers? It took two writers to come up with something this offensively bad. Am I the only person with intelligence high enough that it is capable of being insulted? I don't even have a private education, and still I am stunned at how pedestrian, contrived, pandering, thin, one-dimensional, and stupid this excrement really is.This book would have made a great satire of the genre. It would have been great if it was making fun of itself. In fact, it's so bad that I can't bring myself to discount that possibility entirely. But at the end of the day, these writers were actually serious.I like a disaster flick/book as much as the next guy. I took a guilty delight in Deep Impact. And Armageddon made Deep Impact look like the English Patient. At least the makers of Armageddon never intended to make a good movie. They intended to make a lot of money. I can respect that. The best I can do is give the writers of Lucifer's Hammer the benefit of the doubt and assume that they never intended to write a decent book. If that's the case, they succeeded spectacularly.I read as far into this book as I could stand, and I thought, as long as there are people who create material like this, and actually think they're doing something good, and as long as there are people who love it and give it five star reviews, oh please God, please send a real comet into planet earth and put us out of our misery.","I suppose it says something about America that a bookas blatantly racist as this one can be enjoyed byall these reviewers (with only a few exceptions), andthe racism ignored! Blacks portrayed as cannibals,and forced into slavery? What's &quot;uplifting&quot;about that?","This will be short and to the point.I read this about the time those other two asteroid / comet meets Earth movies were out. They both ended the same way, the rock misses the Earth, and everybody cheers. That is not what happens in Lucifer's Hammer. This time, the comet hits our little planet by page 100. This book is about what happens afterward. How could society crumble and come apart at the seams? How could you survive in this world? The book can be disturbing in places, but it will compel you to keep reading. When I read it, I could not put it down. I still think about this book 14 years after reading it. I look forward to re-reading it sometime soon.","Fantastic glimpse into the dark side of humanity in a post apocalyptic world. I read this book originally 25 years ago and recalled it fondly enough to download it again on my Kindle. Reading it again with the experience of witnessing the LA riots and the hell that was the Katrina disaster I saw the book in an entirely different light. 25 years ago I read the book as pure science fiction and an enjoyable read, I now see it as a not so farfetched expose on the inhumanity that can and does occur in the absence of the rule of law in any disaster situation much less an apocalypse.The book is dated in terminology and the societal prejudices of the 1970's and is a bit slow getting going as the authors introduce the reader to a rather large cast of characters leading up to \"Hammer Fall\". But from there on it's a roller-coaster ride.","I obtained Lucifer's Hammer as a reference book for personal emergency preparedness. The book was written in the 1970s. The storyline is about a comet that impacts earth and the immediate aftermath. I'll give a short review since so many others have already contributed.The good: the book covers many aspects of emergency preparedness in a fairly realistic manner. The book especially does a good job exploring the human mental and emotional consequences during and after a major disaster. Another aspect that gets explored in detail is the aftermath- rioting, looting, anarchy, starvation, rebuilding, etc.The bad: the authors have a bad habit of adding and removing characters into and out of the story without any warning or follow up. This results in a somewhat chaotic flow of characters throughout the story. Also, some of the jargon is so outdated as to be comical in places.The \"ugly\": the book does have a fair amount of immorality contained within the story- drinking, drugs, sleeping around, etc. While it neither adds nor detracts from the book, readers beware.Overall, I am glad that I purchased the book. It does help a person consider many different aspects of personal emergency preparedness.","This is an excellent book overall. The only negative is that it took a good 200 pages to really get into it - that is one slow start. I first read it many years ago, and decided to re-read it - something I seldomly do. Anybody interested in end the world scenarios should read this classic.","I really enjoyed this book. This is a very good book for those that enjoy \"end of civilization\" books. A must add to your collection.","I read this 15 years or so ago. I love the \"End of the world\" genre, but many books (like The Stand) focus more on the characters and gloss over the practical aspects (\"where are we going to get water? power? food? How will we defend ourselves). This book does the best job on the practical details of how the survivors survive. Everything from how (some) people prepare to who they and others build a post-apocalypse survival.","When Niven and Pournelle team up to write a book, the results are always excellent. This is no exception. It's one of the best written post apocalyptic books ever written.","A great read with deep, realistic and characters who are well developed and do noyt appear tpo be page fillers. A great story and many sub plots and story lines.","A gripping story, though you could be forgiven for being annoyed at the presence of some of the minor characters - it's hard not to say \"wait, who the heck is Colleen\" at some point.The accusations of racism I saw on other reviews surprise me. There are bigoted white characters and bigoted black characters. There are white heroes and black heroes (well, one black hero) as well, and none of the bigots are heroes.I was not alive during the 70s so I can't speak to the accuracy of the race relations depicted but I didn't see anything indicating racism on the part of the author.","This book is by far my favorite contemporary novel. It's a classic and a metaphor for what we are going through now. All the main characters of our contemporary drama are here...environmentalists, feminists, techno geeks etc. It's way ahead of it's time and was written at the beginning of this present era. It's true the novel starts slow because of introducing the characters, but even that is enjoyable if you read it again and I've read it five times. My favorite scene is the surfers catching the tidal wave off Santa Monica. What a hoot!","Just finished reading Lucifer's Hammer and was pretty impressed. I have read The Stand & Swan Song a couple of times each and this was a nice departure from the mystical/magical aspect of those two books. There were some slow spots, but never more than a page or two. The comment about constantly having to check the character guide in the front of the book was spot on! But, most books require me to go back and reread a section to figure out the character, but with the guide, I could easily reference the character and figure out who they were just by their description. That really showed to me just how much the authors developed each character! It took me about 3 weeks to finish the book (slow bedtime reader). Now, I just need to find some more post-apocalyptic books of this caliber. Highly recommend!!!","Alright, admittedly it has been a long time since I read the thing, but I really didn't think it was all that bad. In fact, when I read it, I actually thought it was pretty good... maybe it's due for a re-read from a new and older perspective.","I first read this when I was in 5th or 6th grade...in the 70's. I still re-read it at least every few years and it is still my favorite end of the world book ever. While some of the plots and descriptions of the world have become outdated, they rang true at the time. When given the chance I tracked Mr. Pournelle and Mr. Niven down and got a signed copy. To this day Mr. Pournelle is my favorite all time SF author. If you haven't read his books you are missing one of the Icons of the artform.","This is without a doubt one of the best books that I've ever read and makes me very thankful that Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, who are very good authors in their own right, joined forces to become a force to be reckoned with anyone in terms of character creations, spinning a good yarn and making it very real. I read this book shortly after it was published, and more than 20 years later, it's still one of my favorites. The authors do a great job of capturing people, their hopes and their fears realized as the comet approaches and their reactions and deeds in the aftermath. For a great ``end-of-the-world'' book with wonderful imagery that can really evoke the amazing pictures in one's mind's-eye...this is NOT to be missed. Read it now.","This is one of my all-time favorite books. Engaging characters, interesting scenario. What would YOU try to salvage? How would you survive the collapse of society? Wish this was available in hardcover - my paperback copy has been read &amp; re-read!","I dont read many books twice or more, maybe 5 out of the hundreds i've read. Lucifer's Hammer i've read 3 times over the years and will read again. It's a great story, a little slow to start but after it get's cranking it stays cranking. End of world buffs will love it. This book and &quot;The Stand&quot; are my all time favorites.","When these two writers get together you can bet your bottom dollar that the book will be a non stop read.Don't pass this one up!","This book is one of my all-time favorites. I have read it so many times that I have destroyed 2 copies and am now purchasing my third! I have always thought it would make an excellent movie....much better than any other comet or asteroid-hitting-the-earth movie that anybody else has ever made! The way it is written could easily translate into a screenplay....but I would rather see it as a TV mini-series so that they would not have to leave out or change any of it. Movie-makers have a tendancy to do that with large novels. Like the way that they mutilated Battlefield Earth!!!!! Steven Kings &quot;The Stand&quot; came out rather well in the TV version, split into three episodes. So if any script writers or movie directors are reading this....take a hint! This would be FANTASTIC if it is done properly. And there is room in the cast of characters for a great list of stars to take part! If I was a screenwriter I would do it up just for fun and send it in to TBS or TNT....I seriously recommend this novel! It is totally believable as an &quot;end of world&quot; type story...lots of action, intrique and adventure, horror, space, romance, hard choices and even a little humor ....The human spirit comes shining through in the aftermath in both good and bad ways. It is a struggle for survival....will it be all for one or one for all or every man for himself? Will some of civilization survive or will the remnants of mankind sink into the depths of the darkest of dark ages? The Comet impact is only the beginning of this thriller!A MUST-READ!","Niven and Pournelle have written, in my view, the best 'End of the World' story ever written. The plot, impact by comet, is utterly believable because it is so heavily based on science. It has characters which are not mere cardboard cut-outs but people whose fate you care deeply about. The story moves at a fast pace, never dull or boring. A wonderful book. One read of this and you will start storing survival rations. My copy, which I bought in 1978, is now falling to pieces. I have read it so many times that I am now having to order a new copy. If you only read one book in your life, this is the one. A must!","One of the better science fiction (or mainstream, for that matter) books ever written-- most definately the best &quot;disaster&quot; story other than The Stand, but obviously in a different catergory anyhow. Niven and Pournell's only problem is an insufficient grasp of the geography and peoples of California's Sierra Foothills.","This book was awesome, it was written over 30 years ago and those of us that remember the political and social actualities will be reminded of them. It is not only entertaining and captivating but at times hard to put down. This is part of a growing genre of apocalyptic scenarios, that with December 21, 2012 approaching is sure to captivate imaginations everywhere. I have wondered about the possibility of this scenario and the use of real scientific data and facts to a blend of amazing imagery brings the results to life in my mind's eye. If you want a great read this is it, not for the immature or faint of brutal reality.","Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven are among the best technical writers in the U.S. Add to that a vivid imagination, and headlines ripped from yesterday's newspapers (it was written several decades ago, after all)and you have a recipe for an exciting book and enough plot developments to keep you thinking, \"Would it really be like that?\"Rather than deal with the whole issue of nuclear disaster (except as a minor plot point without the usual cliches), the authors' disaster of choice is a flying asteroid. In the most realistic part of the book, they have scientists and news broadcasters minimizing the possiblility of a disaster, not because of villainy, but because they were calculating the odds the rock would hit the earth and at the same time trying not to \"panic\" the population. A tall order.But in the end, none of that mattered in the face of the near-total destruction which ensued. It's not clear whether the rock actually hit the earth or just got so close it might as well have. The aftermath is almost a second book. Some readers took it as a manual for preparing for any disaster. \"Ah, ha! I should take care to stock this, and not worry about that.\" The whole mood and all the action completely changed, but the characters' personalities stayed consistent in the face of many extreme, but mostly believable, events. \"Yes, he would have acted like that.\"The book was exciting, kept my interest in spite of its length, and left me with much to ponder. Would it really be like that? If not, how WOULD it be? Would people's reactions be different in different states? How would Texans have dealt with this, for example, compared to Utahns, rather than Californians?Finally, my highest accolade. When I finished reading the book, I mailed it to my son, who first turned me on to those authors years ago. Thanks, son!","This is a great book about servival after a asteroid hits the earth causing fires and tsunamis, and then everyone deceides that they need to nuke everyone else just to make sure not only mankind is destroyed but also mother earth. The people coalece around to seperate leaders . One a government official and the second a doomsday preacher, as the servivors try to get to high ground the good guys are heading for the last form of government left in the U S and the bad guys are coalecing around the preacher. There is food shortages, no power, and to make things a little more interesting there are cannibals to contend with. A great read for disaster addicts as it is something that could actually happen.","Niven and Pournell team up again to write a contemporary work that is lessscience fiction than it is disaster novel. The world is struck by a comet,and that is when the real fun begins. People either join the barbarians orthe forces to rebuild civilization. Memorable characters in a greatsetting, and in my opinion the best of the many large object hits the Earthnovels out there. It made the best seller list, but would be a great bookeven if it didn't. Well worth a look.","The biggest things that stood out to me were that there were too many characters (a few only introduced for a chapter or two) and then were never heard from again. I understand why they were put in the book but since the beginning of the book dragged on and on it made it that much worse. There are a few spelling and grammar mistakes but it isn't too bad.Character development was pretty good. The plot was well thought out and their weren't any holes that I could think of. I liked the story line but didn't really get engaged in the book till the end. There was just not alot of action in the first 1/3 of the book. And for that I would say its good, but not great.","Dated? Maybe. Racist? Nah.Probably my second favorite Apocalyptic novel, (after The Stand). It provides a few more gray shades in a familiar palette of Good and Evil B&W.; The thrills and chills still stand up though and there are some high tension pages that rival the best of the breed. A must for any fan of the genre.","\"Lucifer's Hammer\" is one of my favorite post-apocalyptic books and usually read it once every other year or so. The social aspects and technology portrayed in the story are certainly dated some 35 years after this was first published, but the story still holds up and is a very entertaining read for fans of the genre.No spoilers from me: The story centers (mostly) on a wealthy amateur astronomer named Tim Hamner who is \"lucky\" enough to be the co-finder of a previously unknown comet. As the comet becomes better studied, it quickly becomes known that is will at least be visible from earth and Tim gains some interest from the media, which dubs the comet \"The Hammer\". The writing style took a bit to get used to, as the character coverage changes between chapters, but did find it be a an interesting way to weave the individual stories together as the book moved along. I also found the interaction between characters to be the most realistically portrayed, which is likely a result of the excellent character development in a book this big.I still enjoy this one every time I pick it up!Highly Recommended!CFH","Tim Hamner is a wealthy heir to the family's business and an amateur astronomer. He discovers a new comet simultaneously with a young boy named Gavin Brown also discovers it. The comet is named Hamner-Brown and a space mission is launched to study the comet. Tim Hamner is asked to sponsor a TV documentary about the new comet that is to pass very closely to the earth.Suddenly when more accurate fight path calculations are done by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and they pinpoint that the comet will strike the earth. The comet, now named \"The Hammer\" breaks into multiple pieces and hammers into continents and oceans across the globe.Earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and direct strikes onto large cities wipe out a massive portion of the world's population and the governments of the world collapse in chaos. Tim and many others sensing the pending apocalypse try to escape deeper into the USA to escape the cataclysmic destruction, the resulting riots and fighting over the needs of daily survival....This is one of the best apocalyptic Sci-Fi books ever written and it won the Hugo award as the Best Novel in 1978. I read this book in 1977 and repurchased it to reread it on my Kindle Fire. This book is well written and once you start reading it you cannot put it down. The description of the events following the comet strike is done in detail and everything from the tsunami to the climate effects of the damage is realistic and frightening.People bond together for good or bad and a war begins for survival. Will civilization restart or is it going into a death spiral back to the dark ages and beyond? You will be pulled into the character's lives and their struggles to simply survive. You have to read the book to find out and it is a great book that I recommend to you. If you like Sci-Fi then this is a must read book!","This WAS the book that first got me into science fiction, and over 30 years later, it is a lover affair that has stood the test of time. The book does start off somewhat slowly, as some of the earlier reviews noted, but like a rock rolling down a hill, it picks up momentum as the story goes. I particularly loved the descriptions of the physical effects on Earth of the meteor striking the planet, and wished that there had been a little bit more detail about that. However, my only real complaint was that there was no sequel--I would love to have learned what happened \"after the ending\"!","Lucifer's Hammer was written by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle in the late 1970s. The story follows the discovery of a new comet named Hamner-Brown, later named Lucifer's Hammer, as it unexpectedly slams into the earth causing widespread devastation and destruction. The book introduces a number of interesting characters and follows their lives pre and post-disaster. The scope of the disaster in this story is incredible as the impact from the comet causes tsunamis, earthquakes and volcanoes all over the planet. A lot of the most interesting parts of Lucifer's Hammer take place in the post-comet world. The authors really push the limits in their exploration of the ways in which knowledge and science could be used to even the odds for survivors in a post-apocalyptic scenario. Survivors use some rather unique methods to defend themselves from the ruthless-raider-cannibal types. It is doubtful that the authors would be permitted to describe some of their unorthodox defensive measures if the book was released today. Lucifer's Hammer is different from other apocalypse-themed books as it doesn't demonize technology and science as is often the case with many other fictional works in this genre. Instead, the authors explore how knowledge, science and technology could be utilized to recover from an apocalyptic disaster. Overall, I would recommend Lucifer's Hammer for its unique perspective and for its pure entertainment value.","Take yourself on a time warp back to the days of Apollo-Soyuz and enjoy this epic tale of what might happen if a shattered comet hit Earth with the mother of all shotgun blasts. For a movie to be made from it now, they would have to switch to Shuttle-Mir and leave out the parts about unknown technology relating to women Cosmonauts. The Astro/Cosmo-nauts would also have the choice of returning either in the shuttle or soyuz. Everything else could stay the same.","Great read! It really makes you stop and think about what to hold on to at the &quot;end of the world&quot;, where an error in judgement can cost you your life once society has broken down to the basic instincts of kill or be killed.","&quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; is not only the best 'disaster' novel I've ever read, it also forced me to take a long hard look at some of the things we take for granted in our daily life. Read it - you'll be impressed.","The comet hits the Earth, but that is only the beginning---the best part of the book is what comes after. It comes pretty close to describing what the aftermath of an earth shattering event might be. A lot is crammed in there, and you get the impression that the authors could have gone on much longer, but they had to stop it somewhere. The best part of reading the book is realizing how many things we have today that we take for granted.","If you are a fan of hard science fiction, the novel is not that good. As in Asimov's long version of Nightfall, it should have stopped after Earth was impacted. Thereafter, the novel is good as an &quot;End of the Word&quot; story. Interesting social and philosophical implications.The plot regarding defensive countermeasures is really poor. Mankind is better prepared than that to do something against an incoming asteroid or comet. If you like the hard stuff, you better read Clarke's &quot;The Hammer of God&quot; or Benford's &quot;Shiva Descending&quot;","The first book I read by these authors and the best so far. It kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time. It protrays an unusual view on how society would run if a major disaster occured. While reading, I found myself gripping the book so tight my knuckles began to ache. It was exciting and suspenseful all the way through. You're put into the story and feel the urgency of certain situations. I'd recommend this book to anyone with a taste for adventure and suspense. I'm now addicted to the books that Niven and Pournelle write together. I almost guarentee that you will be to when you read this book","A long time ago (1964 in fact) Brian Aldiss began an introduction to an anthology with the sentence: \"The images are what attract me in science fiction, even more than the surprises and the ideas and the crazy plots.\" That sentence has apparently stuck in my brain for over 40 years, because it came romping back into my mind as I read \"Lucifer's Hammer\".There is so much wrong with this book. For a start, there are far too many characters - the \"Dramatis Personae\" lists 46, and there must be at least another 46 minor characters not mentioned. The writing is often uninspired, and the first third of the book is little more than waffle and soap opera.But I believe it is worth wading through all this for the magnificent images of the comet splitting into fragments and smashing the Earth, seen both from space and from the ground: the fireballs shooting down from the sky, the glowing craters of the land strikes and the huge holes bored through the seas, the vaporisation of millions of tons of ocean, the tectonic shuddering of the battered planet in response to the assault, the sudden creation of new waterways, the unremitting warm salt rain, and the efforts - mostly futile but occasionally successful - of the tiny inhabitants to escape the titanic forces raging around them. I don't know how accurate the predictions are, but I suspect they are about as good as we are likely to get. I have read a few books about the end, or near-end, of the world, but none of them brings it to life as this one does.And the second half of the book, although it too contains quite a bit of soap opera and cliche, raises some important questions about what our priorities could and should be if we ever experience such a catastrophe - not that I agree with all the answers Niven and Pournelle offer; but they do at least deal with important issues that perhaps should concern all of us, at least for the time it takes to read a book.","My mom put me onto this book a few years back. I decided to read the book after mom told me how wonderful it was and how much it had made her think. I read the book(which happened to be published the year I was born), and found the story very interesting, but the understanding of science was a little bit quaint. They were still arguing about whether the moon landing was a good idea or not. The story, a meteor hitting the Earth and \"ending the world\" was very good, and I believe, well thought out.","I'd seen this book mentioned many many times in multiple literature message boards on the internet and finally got around to reading it. I had expected it to be much better than it actually was, but all in all it just kind of blended in with the usual stack of random paperbacks I pick up regularly from the used book stores.As mentioned many MANY times here, it starts off very slowly and introduces so many characters that they have a character list in the beginning to help keep track of them all. I had worried that I'd flounder through the book being unable to keep track of who's who, but when the action starts this becomes a little bit easier.The race issue served a strangely prominent role and I can see why people here have been calling racism on this book. One black man is a racist political leader who also robs liquor stores and murders people before anyone even knows the comet is coming. He has to put his foot down to keep his crew of black burglars from immediately consuming drugs that they find. The other main black character keeps being put in circumstances that remind everyone that he is The First Black Man in Space. To be honest with you, I was only a toddler in the 70's and I get the feeling that this book may just be portraying the racial tones of the era during which it was written, but they are strangely out of place for someone just reading the book in 2010.My other issue is with the title itself. I feel like it was only called Lucifer's Hammer because that title was slightly inflammatory. The phrase itself was only used once in the entire book - \"Hammerfall\" would have been much more appropriate in my opinion.It was worth a read, but it's not a book that I'll be keeping around in case I want to read it again. Used Book Store, here I come again.","When a novel from the 1970s is reprinted and gets positive reviews thirty years later, you know you have something good on your hands.In some respects, the book is a little dated. What's a TravelAll? A Tensor lamp? These are questions Google will help you answer.However, the core of the book is timeless. The story is well-rendered. In many ways, this book is like seeing every disaster movie from the 70s crammed together. The first 150 pages build suspense, and you'll be glad you read them once the action happens.The authors have a great philosophy behind the book, which is part of the reason the book still reads well. If it was simply The End Of The World, there are dozens of other books which cover that and have not been reprinted. The authors use the end of the world to say something meaningful about human nature and our relationship to reality.In short, this book is worth the money and time you'll invest. Highly recommended.","What if civilization were destroyed by a comet?Humankind has been essentially modern, physically, for 100,000 years, so who's to say there have not been many ages of civilization in the past, each completely destroyed by a comet impact? Perhaps such events could have been the origin of the fear and superstition with which comets were regarded by our ancestors.These are typical of the thoughts that keep me awake at night, since reading this book. It's compellingly written, with the transitional breakdown of all orderly society described in heartbreaking detail.In response to the reviewer who objected to the idea of the nuclear power plant being revived, when there must have been umpteen coal-fired plants around that were presumably less hazardous, the explanation is simple. The coal plants need ontinuous inflows of coal, requiring roads, trucks, trains, and transport fuel. A nuclear plant can probably store years worth of fuel onsite at any given time.","Of all the book dealing with &quot;THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT&quot; These guys have hit upon the formula that give hope a say in the mix. Robert R. McCammon's &quot; SWAN SONG &quot; (an antecedent work) Draws upon &quot;LUCIFERS HAMMER&quot; and the King Work &quot; THE STAND&quot; heavily. But first there was this. I love McCammon's book, and King's; but the best , first groundwork was laid in the chapter and verse of &quot; LUCIFERS HAMMER.&quot; The development of character is complete...brilliant.. The scenario is developed with an eye towards the ultimate conclusion. There is not a word wasted nor a picture left incomplete. As I read works of literature I often wonder who the writer knew or met and admired (or not) to draw his characters upon. More so here than most. The Science may not be flawless, there are gaps in rudimentary cosmology and physics- but fiction, science or otherwise - requires of the reader a &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot;. This is a worthwhile read if only to see where the &quot;Apocolypse Genre&quot; began. I would much rather read &quot;LUCIFER'S HAMMER&quot; than watch &quot;THE STAND&quot; on television...shudder..... I had rather read &quot;LUCIFER'S HAMMER&quot; than read &quot;THE STAND&quot;. And the hell of it is I like &quot;THE STAND&quot;. I hope you will read this book and the other book(s) mentioned herein,. not because one leads to the other... but because they DON'T.","I've yet to find a better story of a cataclysm for sheer suspense, realism and accuracy of vision ... (and yes, I have read \"The Stand\"; no contest.) This book is so well written I would recommend it as a fun survival guide, should that comet presently headed near Earth get a little too close for comfort. The characters are sharp, real, and interesting. The writing is detailed, sharp, and the incidents the authors choose to show us are unforgettable (picture a surfer riding the ultimate tidal wave, rushing into the city to bury it, up comes a building ... what a way to go!) The radical post-apocalypse bands and their cannibalistic rituals make for some of the most disturbing and chilling reading you will find.This is sci-fi at its finest.","This is the second most important book I've ever read, and I've read it 8 times. It isn't about survivalism, it isn't about racism (absurd assertion make by bigots who haven't read it), and it isn't a political commentary on the 70's. It is about stark reality and what is important if the delusions of political correctness,quotas, and journalistic provarication are [taken] away.The comet is just a metaphor for a slate wiped clean, by whatever means. It says most gangs are black or hispanic and most farmers are white.That is not racism it's reality. And only woman have babies too. Sorry, that's just the way it is.BUT, this book debunks every stereotype. There are blacks, women, whites, hippies(it was written in the 70's)... every kind of person, as heros as well. The heros are the people who value education, self reliance, forethought, and above all, an open and flexible mind. The villains are the lazy, the users, and the unmotivated.The messages of this book is that some people are better than others, but it is up to the individual, himself, whether he is on the top or the bottom. Self respect, hard work, and education may, in the final outcome, mean everything.","After seeing the movie &quot;Deep Impact&quot; on TV recently, I decided to re-read an old favourite: &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. And while &quot;Deep Impact&quot; was certainly a better effort than the simultaneously released &quot;Armageddon&quot;, &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; was so much better again.The book describes the discovery of a new meteorite by a millionaire astronomer, Timothy Hamner. Its orbit is calculated to bring it very close to Earth and speculation starts that it might actually hit. The authors vividly describe two sets of events with a very different timescale: the gradual changing of the meteorite's orbit over a period of millions of years, and the very rapid change in human society from almost universal indifference to total obsession with this particular meteorite.A joint US-USSR Spacelab mission is launched (the book is from 1978) to monitor and record the passing of the meteorite. When the meteorite hits Earth in a series of strikes ranging from the Mediterranean to the eastern Pacific, the crew is left stranded in space.The book gives a brilliant and well-founded description of events following the meteor strikes: the giant tsunamis, the earth quakes and volcano eruptions, the mud rain, the onset of an Ice Age. It describes even better man's reaction to these events, told through a multitude of short tales. The story of a young surfer who decided to ride a tsunami created a picture that I found indelible.The book then focuses on a number of survivors in California, gradually coalescing into three main groups: a community in a valley trying to re-establish an agricultural society; a band of society's outcasts led by a preacher who urges the destruction of all things technical; and the construction and operation personnel of a nuclear reactor that has withstood the strike impacts. The authors are very good in their portrayal of the initial panic and &quot;everyone for themselves&quot; mentality, followed by a need to restore some form of order in a world that has changed beyond imagining. Amongst all of this there are snippets of information on what is happening around the globe, showing the fragility of our civilisation to an event of this nature. And somewhere in all of that, the crew of Spacelab makes it back to Earth.The book starts slowly because it introduces such a large number of characters who later are woven together in a quite intricate plot. The book falls into the category of &quot;natural disaster science fiction&quot;, but is much better than the average offering in this genre, not because it so well represents the technical issues about a meteor strike, but because it meets the definition of good literature: it tells us a little bit more about ourselves. Niven and Pournelle have collaborated on a number of good books (&quot;The mote in God's eye&quot; is recommended as a sample of well thought-out classic SF), but in my opinion this is their best.I found myself wondering why Hollywood had not used this book instead of the &quot;Deep Impact&quot; script. I suppose that like &quot;Lord of the Ring&quot; it would need a highly motivated director and producer to bring this to the screen, and compressing it into the usual three hours or less could be quite difficult. But it could be sooo good, if done well.","You can bet that there's gonna be some fantastic science, and some really well-thought out plot, and a whole lot of exposition to explain it to everyone just a bit more than is absolutely necessary, and characters that are essentially cardboard cutouts with little signs around their necks saying, &quot;Useless Hot Chick&quot;, &quot;High-minded scientist,&quot; &quot;Practical Scientist,&quot; and so forth.Please understand that this isn't really the genre that I'm used to. I don't read hard SF very often, and to me character is a bit more important. I WAS impressed by the science in the story, but I wanted more characterization that some cliched lines about how the reporter's wife was useless and so it's okay that he slept with someone else. I'd consider it sexist, but the characterizations are soft all around. It's just that the female stereotypes are more obnoxious. It would have been nice to have a female scientist.","I originally read this in 1985; started it on a Friday evening and read until about 2:00am, put it down to sleep, picked it back up at first light and finished the book by a little after noon. I hadn't been or looked outside since starting the book and when I opened the door it actually startled me that the sun was shining, the birds were singing and all was well with the world. I'll never forget that moment. This is an extremely well written and very believable story. I agree with the need to keep refering back to the character guide in the front for a while (as the story unfolds), but once it starts rolling this is a page-turner! I liked it so much I've ordered a new copy here in 2006 to reread and then give to friends (I gave my original copy away for the same reason).Bottom line: Two ever growing groups of people reacting to a near-end-of-the-world experience in exactly opposite ways. Which group would you end up in?","This book rates among the best along with The Stand, Swan Song and Year Zero. Incredible characters, superb writing about a comet falling on Earth and what happens afterwards. The characters are so good, you care about everything they do. This book is worth getting. It will change the way you think about what's out there in the sky and what trully values in life.","This is a great book people. If you're looking for something different, something that after you've read it your world and values change for a week or two, this is that book. We've all seen the 90's asteroid, end of the world movies and how they are somewhat lacking in taste and depth. Well, don't expect anything but the best from this work. This pair of authors carefully put together a tapestry of lives that run together to form a complete world. The tattered remains after civilization is ended is deeply described and how those lives cling to the tatters in hope of a new beginning.We should never lose hope.","WOW!!! I just finished Lucifer's Hammer and it was a ride. The first 100 pages were a bit slow, but they were needed to develop the characters that Niven and Pournelle created. After page 100, though, things really take off. I was reading into the wee hours of the morning, covering 100+ pages every night. By the end of the novel, the only word that is necessary is masterpiece.","I first read this \"end of the world\" book while on Cold War submarine duty 30 years ago. I read a LOT then, and recall this as one of the most addictive, \"can't wait to get back to it\" novels of the lot. It is long, and is a believable tale of the world after a comet collides with it. Shocking, scary, realistic. The authors thought this out carefully. Granted, it's dated, with a 70's aura to it.I would weigh in on this matter of racism/stereotyping charges that pop up here and there in these Amazon reviews. Being over 30 years old, the setting is modern, but not \"post-modern\" enough to fully embrace our current politically correct idiocy. For instance, the black LA gang cannibalism practices as presented in the story. I suppose if it was written today, due to the demographic shift, they would have been Hispanic cannibals. Had this California based tale been centered in the upper midwest, the cannibals would have been blond haired Protestant dairy farmers. There are people groups everywhere. I see no problem with this book as written.And again . . . considering the slight dating of this tale. Yes, it has a 70's aura. But also recall that following this global scale disaster, all of our computer toys would become trash . . . so this story is not really so dated after all. 2007, 1975, 1875, whatever. Mankind returns to the basics.A long but very satisfying read. Both entertaining and thought-provoking. I have obtained another copy and plan to read it again. Recommended reading and a 5 star tale.","I would certainly encourage anyone to read this, the best of all the \"disaster\" books. I read it in the late 70's and loved it and reading it again was even more of a pleasure the 2nd time. This book is frightening.....and FUN!","First off, certain &quot;idealistic&quot; folk proclaim this book racist. It is not, these are the same people who call Huck Finn racist, the uninformed and confused. In fact, the books greatest hero is an african american man. Groups of people will stick together during tragedy for survival, that happens here: valley locals, farmers, scientists and yes even a group of black people. Quotas go out the window when a sandwich is worth more than you.This book was thought out in every way you could imagine and the authors have created a very realistic scenario. The new dark age won't be pretty and here it's given to you straight , right down to the last sewage saving detail. A great book about our fragile world, the shortcomings and strengths of what we've created.I give it a 92%, becuase the first 150 pages were slow and name ridden, and because I didn't want it to end! A fiction and sci-fi must.","This book deserves 10 Stars. The characters are realistic, believeable, credible, and if my one- line summary was meant to read like a sensational tabloid headline, good. I grabbed your attention. Lucifer's Hammer is about a comet that's on a collision course with Earth. What happens in the ensuing three days, shows the best and worst of us. There's Johnny, an astronaut who's carrying on an affair with more than one woman, (very 70s. This was, after all, written before AIDS.) One of whom is Maureen--the daughter of a U.S. Senator from California. There are also a host of supporting characters. The main character, Tim Hamner, is an amateur astronomer who co- discovered the Hamner-Brown Comet. Remember four years ago when the Shoemaker-Levy Comet slammed into Jupiter? What if it had slammed into Earth instead? Don't think it can't happen, America. An asteroid with a diameter of 6 miles slammed into Earth 65 million years ago and made the dinosaurs extinct. The question is: Are we next? Maybe we are. Ninety years ago, what might have been a comet, slammed into Siberia near the town of Tunguska.","This was an interesting book. It was written quite a few years ago and so some of the things that happen in the book are quite outdated. That doesn't take too much away from the book go. It's an interesting read. As one of the other reviewers stated, it is very slow initially as the author does introduce the characters in depth.As far as the accusations of racism, I certainly did not get a feel that this book was a racist book. Again, there is a huge difference between stereotyping and racism.I think the take away message of this book is to be prepared.","Larry Niven's and Jerry Pournelle's novel \"Lucifer's Hammer\" is a very good, realistic portrayal of a comet strike on Earth in the late 1970s. The book focuses on a few groups of people in southern California in the San Joaquin Valley. The book is similar to the 1998 movie \"Deep Impact,\" although that movie was based on an Arthur C. Clarke book.The book is slow to start as the authors spend a lot of the early book on character development. The incoming comet serves as background, as some of the characters are involved in the discovery of the comet. However, while no one knows that the comet is going to hit Earth, a slow sense of doom and apocalypse slowly grips the people.Even once the comet hits no one really knows what is happening. Earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and then days and weeks of torrential rain affect the survivors. Since the novel's focus remains on the characters in southern California, the details of what happens to the rest of the world aren't really known.The novel is a gritty, realistic page-turner. The authors do an excellent job showing what happens to people as the veneer of civilization is ripped away, but it ends with a group of survivors who have figured out a way to continue their lives.","When bored millionaire Tim Hamner discovers a new comet, he's excited to finally accomplish something without the help of his family. Harvey Randall, who's producing a TV documentary about the comet, expects his show to be wildly popular. And the American and Russian astronauts who are chosen to study the comet are proud to be chosen for such an important international mission.All the experts said there was no way the Hamner comet would hit the Earth. But there are always plenty of people who are ready to panic -- the type who start hoarding guns, ammo, and canned food. Then there are the types who are ready to prey on the panicky folks -- doomsday cults declaring it's the end of the world, or burglars waiting for the rich people to flee their expensive homes. When the comet does hit the earth, all those weirdos and the normal folks who are left must figure out how to survive on a destroyed planet. Faced with the stress of just trying to stay alive, will they become selfish and greedy, or will they work together to try to recreate their lost civilization?Lucifer's Hammer is an exciting post-apocalyptic story first published in 1977. It takes a while for the comet to hit as Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle introduce us to a large cast of characters -- Tim Hamner and his girlfriend who doesn't want to marry him because she has career ambitions; Harvey Randall and his dumb wife who prepared for the end of the world by stocking her freezer and packing nail polish; a senator and his beautiful daughter; a sociopath who's stalking a young woman; a man who runs a nuclear power plant; two Russian astronauts and two American astronauts. And there are others. Though none of these characters are particularly interesting or likable, Niven and Pournelle do a good job showing us how the possibility that the world is ending affects each of them in different ways.Once the comet finally hit, I was riveted. The action never let up. Natural disasters, the threat of world war, the fast decay of civilization -- it all seemed so frighteningly possible. The catastrophe affected characters differently, seeming to strip off all the \"civilization\" they pad themselves with -- the way they want to be perceived by others -- and revealing the essence of who they really are. In Niven and Pournelle's version of the end of the world as we know it, most humans immediately become selfish and cruel, unwilling to share food or shelter, and ready to kill those who may have something they want. Perhaps I have too much faith in humanity, but I had a hard time believing that we'd so quickly stop grieving and so quickly start turning on each other. Maybe I'm just nave, but I'd like to think that, for most of us, such a huge tragedy would bring out empathetic cooperation rather than egocentric competition.The authors do, however, make a good case for situational ethics, especially when dealing with such issues as biological warfare and slavery. As one character puts it, \"A civilization has the ethics it can afford.\" Even if I found it hard to believe, it did make me think about how our ethical standards might depend on the condition of our society, and it made me appreciate the society I live in.Written by two middle-aged white men in the 1970's Lucifer's Hammer has some distasteful depictions of women and blacks. I suspect that the authors would say \"but one of our astronauts is a woman and another is a black man!\" and indeed they were probably the two most admirable characters in the book, but that wasn't quite enough to make up for the ugly bits, especially the gang of black \"brothers\" who were the villains of the story.I listened to Brilliance Audio's version which is almost 25 hours long and is read by Marc Vietor who was excellent, as he always is. Though I have some complaints, the basic truth is that I was caught up in the exciting story and would recommend this audio version of Lucifer's Hammer to anyone who enjoys post-apocalyptic disaster stories.The gigantic comet had slammed into Earth, forging earthquakes a thousand times too powerful to measure on the Richter scale, tidal waves thousands of feet high. Cities were turned into oceans; oceans turned into steam. It was the beginning of a new Ice Age and the end of civilization. But for the terrified men and women chance had saved, it was also the dawn of a new struggle for survival-a struggle more dangerous and challenging than any they had ever known....","I read this the first time so many years ago, that I do have to admit I had forgotten so much about the many side stories and characters. Why that should take away from a novel for some readers is beyond me, but everyone has their favorites. I would only say, so many stories in books and movies these days are so pat. I always tease my wife for rushing through her novels, and she's always teasing me for insisting on reading every ... single ... word, and doing so at a pace I think the author may appreciate. If a book's an easy read, I'll motor through it in a couple hours, but a more dense novel filled with beautiful writing, well, I'll happily go at a tortoise's pace.I bring this up to say, this novel stuck with me for so many years for a reason. Why let yourself get frustrated if the author chooses to take his time? I read this as a child and over the years have loved apocalyptic stories. Some of the more recent blockbuster movies in the genre have greatly disappointed. Lucifer's Hammer was brilliant in that it showed how so many outstanding plans, crafted by sharp people, dedicated to detail, can all fall to, well, you'll see. The guy made homemade beef jerky, stocked his jeep with all the necessary gear, and backup gear of the most important stuff, and was absolutely prepared for the coming disaster...;-)","I had to look up Lucifer's Hammer by Larry Niven after talking to my sister recently about who did you want to hang with when the apocalypse arrives. The concept of this book is what do people do to prepare for the destruction of the world, and what happens when all restraints of civilization are removed.After reading this book, my best friend and I have had an ongoing joke since 1985 about men we know with survival skills (as opposed to our husbands/boyfriends) and would we want to join their tribe after the arrival of the apocalypse. I also think about what would I contribute? Another thought born of this book is who of my friends would survive - I have some good friends that are fun and smart, but could they survive without a Latte or lemon in their water? Then there is the idea of if you only had two days and an entire library, what would you preserve? If you had to survive in dystopia, what tools would you need that could be carried in a small pack?Anyway, its been 23 years since I read the book and I still carry elements of it in my head. I think I will go put some food by.","Despite it's age, Niven's Lucifer's Hammer holds it's own. It presents an excellent telling of what could be the end of the world, and is very realistic about how people would respond while still telling a compelling story of survival.I listened to the audiobook and while the quality of the narration was not an issue, it was not as animated as other audiobooks I have listened to recently.Worth the read or listen if you are an SF fan or survivalist. Makes me want to stockpile food and safety equipment.","+AH4-So far, this my favorite book written by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. I think the story is very clever and intense. If you think there are too many characters to keep up with, look in the very beginning--the authors write a description of each major character. The next book I'm going to read is The Mote In God's Eye (be sure to read this one too).+AH4-","I first read this as a high school sophmore back in the 70s and just recently picked it up again. I remember as a kid being capitvated by the scenario and found it still held the same energy for me 20 years later. The first 400 pages; &quot;The Anvil&quot;, &quot;The Hammer&quot; and &quot;The Quick and The Dead&quot; contain great plot and character development. The final section, &quot;After Doomsday&quot;, drags a bit as plot twists are telegraphed and a bit cliched. Still, LH remains one of the most intelligent apocalypse books I've read.","I don't remember where I got this book at. Once I picked it up, it was like an addiction. Every chance I got I was back reading it. I've read this three times cover to cover. It will make you look up and wonder.","Overall this is a great book, though provoking for all the reasons the other reviewers site. The authors paint a very vivid picture of a post-cataclysmic society. Unfortunately, there are some very stereotypical and shallow characters throughout the book. The dated picture painted of African-Americans felt most objectionable to me. Additionally, a group of boy-scouts camped out in the Grapevine having any orgy with a local girlscout troop only several weeks after the impact was a bit much to believe. Unfortunately, these few examples are not the only occurance of this kind of shallow and unbelievable character development. Oh, and, *everyone* will be having sex if society crumbles, with multiple partners. There is a general 70s mentallity to this book that interferes with the suspension of disbelief.","Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle do an excellent job convincing the reader that a comet could hit the earth. Instead of sticking to a disaster formula, however, the authors create intruiging characters whom you come to care about. The only problem: there is no sequel. Though the novel ends on a high note, it would be more enjoyable if the saga continued.","This is a *great* book! I recommend it to everyone I know. Lucifer's Hammer is a very realistic portrayal of what *could* happen and, don't forget, what *has* happened before... Only this time it's not the dinosaurs that are in danger... I first read it years ago as a child, and finished re-reading it recently. I can only hope that the two movies coming out on this very subject are able to captivate and intrigue your imagination even half as much as this literary work will! READ THIS BOOK!","It is unfortunate that a novel of with such tremendous potential winds up being an overly long, often confusing piece of science fiction. In the case of &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot;, there are simply too many people and too much story to keep up with.The premise is interesting enough...a newly discovered comet on a collision course with Earth. This in and of itself made me pick up the book initially. But the sheer number of characters and various subplots doomed this story. The fact that it is over 600 pages, in small type, doesn't help, either.Still, for the hard-core science-fiction fan, &quot;Lucifier's Hammer&quot; may be worth the purchase, simply because of its historical value and significance.","The authors really out did themselves with this book about various people from different parts of the world who survive the destruction of civilization and struggle to rebuild. The fight against the anti-technology cannibals is an interesting and all to plausible plot twist.Even though the book is out dated (it includes a Apollo mission) it is still a great read that makes you think about whether you would be among the survivors.","A story of normal, everyday people from different walks of life, attempting to survive the virtual destruction of the world. Not only does this book entertain as few others do, but it gives insight into your own mind. How would you survive the end of the world? Could you make the same tough decisions? Are you prepared for the Hammer to fall? I've lent this book to many friends, and nobody can read it only once, and nobody can read it without wondering... Amazing, compelling book that should be in every bookshelf in the world.","I wish I had never read this book just so I could read it again for the first time. I reread Lucifer's Hammer several times each year. I recommend it to my students. I snatch copies from the shelves of used book stores to give to people. Even after (migawd, can it have been 20 years) I still love to read this book. Either Niven or Pournelle by himself is readable. Together they weave an engrossing story around believable and sympathetic characters.","Want a book to drag you down? This is it. An apocalypse that man is powerless to prevent. This is a story of a comet striking earth and the aftermath for humanity. It starts well in advance with the discovery of the Hamner-Brown comet. Sometimes the timing is a little suspect. I mean the government is able to throw together a mission to space that is a joint mission with the Russians in only a couple of months.Overall, It was a great read and was exciting from start to finish. Good luck to the human race.","Interesting topic and characters - left me wanting more at the end. Throughly enjoyed my time with this great book.","Good read, belivable characters. How both individuals and groups of people cope when a comet hits the earth and causes huge tsunamis.","Thumbs up! This is a great novel about the end of civilization (most of society gets destroyed by a comet), and how people react and cope after the fact. The characters and plot are engaging. The book is impossible to put down. There is also a charming 1970s flavor to it all :)","I won't spoil the tale, so I'll only say that this is one of the best apocalypse novels that I have read- only surpased by Jeff Long's \"Year Zero.\" Despite the 600+ pages, most of which were pre-comet fall filler information, the post-event action was intense enough to make up for this. Impatient readers like myself are encouraged not to give up on the novel until you've read at least the first 250 pages - it takes off after that. You can't go wrong with this story.","While a little dated in 2009, this book remains my all time favorite end of the world book. The attention to detail is just enough to make it interesting without being \"I'm so technically cool.\" How many people know that HP and Texas Instrumenst used two differnet operating systems in their pocket calculators? The story is well laid out and moves along. Give this book a try and \"Ringworld\" will be next.","Not a quick read but a good, solid one. Book is over 600 pages. I really enjoyed it. Felt like two different books. What would happen if we thought a comet was coming close vs. what would happen after it hit us. I would bet this account would be pretty close. Quite a few characters to keep up with and you kind of lose track of a few of them as the story goes on (Harry the Postman for instance). Speaking of Harry, he sure sounds like the same character as \"Harry Red\" from their book \"Footfall.\" By comparison, I enjoyed this one more than \"Footfall.\" If you are looking for an end of the world type book and have not read \"I am legend,\" check that one out first as it is a incredible, quick read and then move here to \"Lucifer's Hammer.\"","The big Hollywood movies based on objects hitting the Earth are not nearly as well thought out as this book. LH gives good treatment to the thought processes of people both before and after the impact, and gives a realistic depiction of what people would probably do in the days following this disaster. LH does hard science and soft science equally well and ties all the storylines together at the end in a tidy fashion. I have been aware of this book for years, but did not buy it because movie treatment of this topic had been so weak. I finally picked the book up after Amazon adjusted my recommendations based on my purchase of \"I am Legend,\" another book better than any movie using it as a base. I give LH the maximum rating because it doesn't pull punches when it comes to the tough choices people would have to make in the scenarios set forth.","I LOVED this book! I was so sucked in I was having dreams about it! Classic disaster/reconstruction book. If you like books about the end of the world, this is about as good as it gets!","This is one of the best books I've ever read. I can't believe it hasn't been made into a movie.","This was a slow read but enjoyable all the way through. A very gritty view of the end of days","This is a easy read after a few pages slow start. Once it gets going it is fun and scary. If you are familar with Southern California and the Southern San Joquin Valley you will reconize almost all places. It ends a little faster then I would have liked and about the way I guessed but for a mind relaxing read this is it.","this book is timeless, I read it thirty years ago and reread it again because I was so much impressed the first time.","I just loved this story. It survives the test of time. If you're a fan of the genre, this book is simply a must read.","I first read this book thirty years ago -- I just re-read it and was overwhelmed. The story, the characters, the philosophy, the science, the politics, the drama --- all first rate. I highly recommend this book even if you never read sci-fi at all.","This book has been around for quite a while and I have read it probably more than ten times. Each time I have found something new to be amazed at. Each time I have enjoyed the characterization to the point you are truly invested in getting Dr. Forrester to the Stronghold in time, celebrating Tim and Eileen's victories over the circumstances and even recognizing the personality type of Al Hardy!Do I truly believe that a meteor is going to \"take out\" society? Probably not - it could but it is not high on my on probability list. However it could be a result of an earthquake as well \"The Big One\" which no one seems to be paying attention to right now.If you never read an \"End Of The World As We Know It\" book - read this! You'll enjoy the book and might actually learn something along the way!","Lucifer's Hammer is all about a meteor strike near Los Angeles. Everyone heads to the hills--and one of the hills they are headed to is the same small town in the foothills where I live today. It was so much fun to read about places that I know--though some things have changed since this book was written.I'm sure if the real thing happened, people would act very much like they do in this book.For those of you who love thrillers that are actually possible, then you should read Lucifer's Hammer.","A great story about a comet hitting the earth. I read this many years ago and loved it. This is a new copy. I read the cover off the old one.","best apocalypse setting with intellegent story line had me watching for the signs and planning for it!! totally readable and believable !!","Having read \"Lucifer's Hammer\" several times since originally purchased in '77-'78 timeframe,I was discouraged to find my copy in such terrible condition.Therein lies the beauty of E-books...I was able to purchase a \"new\" copy which will last a very long time, probably longer than I will.Enjoyed re-reading it on my Kindle and have started going back into the library of my memory to download other old favorites.Tom H","I am in awe. After being away from this book for a couple of years I decided to reread it on the recommendation of a friend who is a Y2K expert. He recommends this book as a primer in what could (he believes will) happen come 1/1/00. Even though it is set in LA and the surrounding area it gives me enough background so that I could have walked the trails that the charectars did. I recommend this book to any reader of any genre to get an idea of what can/will be happening in a little over a year from now (as of this writing). I agree with another reviewer, Larry and Jerry, tell us how the new world turns out!!","I am truly without speech. 5 stars isn't good enough to describe this book, and I'm certain I can't do it justice with my own words either. Just read it.","Well this sci-fi novel stacks up like so:Plot - averageBackground research - above averageCharacterization - below averageOverall - decidedly averageAfter many pages of buildup during which scientists track a new comet's progress through the inner Solar System, the comet eventually fragments and several of the pieces collide with planet Earth at thousands of miles an hour, sending civilization into the next dark age. I won't describe here exactly what happens when the comet hits, since that's probably the best part of the book. The rest of the novel is about how various groups deal with the aftermath and attempt to rebuild.Other reviewers have complained of the long buildup and the many plot threads introduced during that phase. Personally I didn't mind it much, because it contained just enough space science to keep me interested. I did not, however, gain any sort of empathy or fondness for any of the characters during this buildup phase. They were just so wooden and uninteresting. To me this is what causes the book to take a sharp downward turn in the second half. At least in the first half we have the big apocalyptic hammer strike to look forward to. But the second half became a fairly mediocre adventure / survival type story involving a bunch of characters I never really cared much for. Yeah there's some politics, some sex, some drama, whatever. It's not particularly well done. If I recall correctly, the authors are scientists. Well, they should just focus on the science since that's what they're good at. Better than attempting these unconvincing forays into other areas.We have several plot threads that ultimately converge into just two: the good guys and the bad guys. The good guys are making a genuine effort at establishing a new community with rules and assigned duties. The bad guys see the disintegration of law & order as an opportunity for taking everything they can acquire, regardless of who's killed to get it. Also, they have resorted to cannibilism and feed on their enemies' bodies because it makes for an easy food supply.I'm trying to remember what made me buy this book several years ago. I buy most books on referrals from friends or Amazon reviews. At the time I remember that I was passionately into amateur astronomy and was snapping up space-related books left, right, and center. Also, the great number of glowing reviews (which I don't think this book deserves) probably swayed me.I'm tempted to recommend that you stop reading after the comet hits and you witness the damage it causes. That part's probably fairly realistic and all I have to say is I sure hope a comet never hits us anytime soon. Anyway, after that point in the book there's nothing more than bog standard pulp sci-fi fare to read for 300 pages. Actually it's not really even sci-fi after that point, it's more like an adventure novel. And not a great one at that.","Thanks for wearing your sign, I'll know to ignore your opinion on anything else.This is a great story, thought provoking, a good entertaining adventure, maybe even a survival guide for the coming dark ages regardless which socialist senator 'wins' the Survivor: White House edition.Racism... hmpf. Dumba$$.","Ok, so this book is pretty \"ok\" overall. It's about a giant rock hitting the earth and the Armageddon aftereffects that follow this catastrophe. I have no problem with that. Good premise. And the author does a decent job setting up the action, characters, conflict, etc. Therein lies the problem; by halfway through the book, the rock has still not hit the Earth. It's like Niven was terrified of being faced with the prospect of actually writing about what happens once the asteroid hits. So, he prolongs the extinction event to a point past which I could honestly read. I hit mid-book (and this is not a thin book), and I had to put the book down. Now, had the characters or action taking place before the impact event been especially compelling, I definitely would have kept reading. But honestly the writing up until page 200+ is just so-so.Read this book if you have a predilection to extinction event nihilism and a high tolerance for mediocre writing. Otherwise, your time is better spent elsewhere.","now i own the very first relise of this book, its all torn and shreaded. but its still the best book i've ever read. i've read this book over 7 times now and i'm keep on reading it over and over because it never gets old. now the begining is really slow and theres lots of kinda neadless stuff in it, people they show you who just die, and other who start out small and end up main people. But this book makes you think about what would you do? would you run from it if you didn'r know it was comeing? what or who would you take? the world ends in a flash, and million maybe even billions die, and even more after that. the one thing i find extreamly funny is how it ends.","The book starts out with a million different plots so I lost interest before page 40. It's on the book shelf until I decide that I want to finish it.","[...]Lucifer's Hammer presents a complex story with enough characters to fill a two-page Dramatis Personae and numerous subplots to extend through 640 pages.The main plot is dominated by five characters: Harvey Randall, a producer-director of television shorts; Senator Arthur Jellison, a U.S. Senator who also owns a large ranch in the Sierra foothills, Colonel John Baker, a USAF astronaut who has been to the moon, and Dr. Daniel Forrester, a scientist from the Cal Tech Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Entrepreneur and amateur astronomer, Tim Hamner (spelling correct), and another discover a new comet approaching earth's orbit. Hamner hires Randle to make a short about the comet. Randall interviews Forester for the short. Forester describes the comet and it's near earth orbit. Randall then drives to Jellison's ranch to interview the Senator, but the Senator has been delayed. Randall spends the day hiking with Jellison's mature daughter Maureen whom he had previously found very attractive, and they end up in each other's arms. They both treat this as a one-time event because he is married and she is in a relationship with astronaut Baker.As time passes, it becomes increasingly clear that the comet will come extremely close to the earth. A joint US-Russian spaceflight is launched to ascertain the nature of the comet and its precise trajectory. Baker is chosen as one of the US astronauts. The expedition finds that the comet is a cluster of icy material and rock that will strike the earth in many places.The population panics. Religious zealots gather followers. Russian and China wage nuclear war on each other. The comet strikes with enormous devastation.By various means, Randall, Forrester, and Baker make their way to the refuge of Jellison's ranch. Under the Senator's leadership, the refugees, and local ranchers and villagers organize to define and defend their territory, scavenge critical supplies and prepare for winter.The ranchers learn that a marauding paramilitary band of anti-technology religious zealots is heading in their direction and that the band intends to destroy the ranch and a nearby nuclear power plant that has just become operational. Needless to say, a struggle ensues.My only criticism of this wonderfully entertaining novel is its complexity. But that's okay: it caused me to read it three times. Too bad the movie hinted at by reviewers was either not made or never reached theatres near me.Glen E. Books, Author of The Sky Between Two Worlds.","This the 7th time I have red this book because earth will some day experience a super catastrophe and this book helps me keep a plan b perspective. However this is the first time to read it on my kindle fire. As a retired Christian Missionary I have personally met canibals, ben stranded thousands of miles from home with only $.47, had hookworm and malaria and knew personally friends and family who were in the Nazi death camps. Lucifer's Hammer is second only to the Bible on my repeat reading list. It could happen next week, or this afternoon.","The 2 stars are solely for the bits in italics and the part where the comet actually hit. The rest of book was shallow and episodic. Without giving away details of the plot (for anyone who wishes to read it), I'll simply say that the tale would have benefited from fewer characters and a simplified plot. There were too many elements in the post-comet strike world which prevented the author from deepening the characters of the people involved. I was quickly bored, and it became matter of will to finish it.","The premise was interesting, and reminded me of the movies Armaggedon and Deep Impact, because they are very much alike. After the comet fell, however, I disliked the story so much I just looked up a summary on the Internet and I won't be finishing it.","Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle have combined to create a real winner. For once, the blasted thing hits! How many tales have we read about close calls, altered calls, mistaken calls, meteors that broke apart, that barely hit, etc. No, this is a real winner - both the rock and the book.The first 40% or so of the book is pre-hit with a long buildup in excitement and all the requisite &quot;it won't ever hit&quot; bull. We know, of course, that is does and when it happens, things are never the same. The criminal element has a field day but the good people of Earth join forces and fight back. All of God's chillin are involved - Americans, Russians, whites, blacks, cops, farmers. All united against the New Brotherhood, a band of religious nuts who think God wants folks to live like cavemen. The Brotherhood boys are caricatures who scream just the sort of things people who don't go to church think people of that ilk scream. In the end the good guys plan to win the power plant while out in space another asteroid is beginning its long path.","I am very glad I read these reviews before I bought this book because I know I would have given up in about 50-60 pages. It is so tedious and so boring the author really must have had to work at it. I actually placed a marker at 200 pages so I could encourage myself that I didn't have that far to go. I am proud to say that I made it, so now I'm ready to actually enjoy the book! I probably have no business rating it yet, but I'll come back after I'm done and update the review.Okay, I've finished the book and it's actually much better than I rated it when I began. I'll have to rewrite the review because it will not let me update the star-rating, to which I now give the book 4 stars. I just encourage you all to keep on reading past that 200-page mark, 'cause it does get fascinating, trust me and the thousands of other folks who have read and loved this book!","Meteors, asteroids, what else can you hit the earth with and write a book about it? How about a comet? Yep, that is what has been done here. Apart from sounding cooler, you get the usual nastiness and struggles as those alive in the aftermath have to deal with trying to stay alive.New power structures, violence and eating take up a lot of the time.","Once the hammer begins to fall (around page 170), the plot, sociology, and science become interesting. However, this interest does not sustain, especially through the poorly written pages. The characters are flat, difficult to decipher, and terribly written. The novel is an exceptionally slow read due to the wooden dialogue and disjointed characters and action sequences. The concept and science in the story are bafflingly believable, though.","I had read several of the reviews here on Amazon before picking up this volume to read. After all, Lucifer's Hammer is also listed widely as one of the seminal works of the \"doomsday\" style of science fiction.I am so very surprised that so many people loved this book and completely ignored (or were completely unaware of) how badly it was written. Don't the poorly crafted sentences and the absolutely abominable dialog offend anybody? Have we really fallen that far in educational awareness that nobody even notices how bad this particular piece of writing is? This is truly one of the most clumsy and juvenile attempts at story construction that I have ever waded through.Interestingly, I have just read Brin's \"The Postman\" which was also a poorly written work and, ironically, another of the giants in the doomsday genre. And after getting through that I didn't think science fiction writing could be worse. But folks, here it is.I can cite so many examples, but I will throw out just a few as a warning to those of you who appreciate erudite writing and therefore may wish to avoid this exercise in grammar school prose.First and foremost, the overbearing insistence by the authors to show their familiarity with the Los Angeles area and its denizens is trite, hokey and downright embarrassing. I can't really explain this further as it is a fuzzy concept to convey. But trust me, it gets really old, really fast hearing about how this particular street curves into this other particular street, how one main character lives on Beverly Glen just north of Cielo Drive where Charles Manson committed his heinous crime (was this reference necessary?), and how the main character randomly runs into a \"local celebrity from Toluca Lake who had a ski-nose\". The reference should have been \"ski slope nose\", by the way (Bob Hope, for those of you who need the hint). Etcetera ad infinitum. It's tiresome!I can overlook all of the dated references, chauvinistic viewpoints and racial stereotypes based on the era that the story was written. However, a skilled and forward thinking author could have sidestepped a lot of this malarky and not had to contend with such critical comments as those presented here by me. There are thousands and thousands of other fictional works from that era that still read as fresh today as they did then. Or at least not so overtly dated as this work. Pursuant to the aforementioned, it was difficult for me to get past the author's barely cognoscente knowledge of the television production business. I believe that if an author is going to portray an aspect of something in their writing that they are not intimately familiar with, then they need to go spend a few months in somebody else's shoes so that they know what they are talking about; the proper lingo, the appropriate equipment utilized, etc. Tom Wolfe is good at this. Even Dan Brown is good at this for god's sake (a sad comparison, but by design). Pournelle and Niven haven't a clue about television production -- even 1970's era production. And yes, before you get all excited, I live, breath and work in the Los Angeles television business. I am as good an expert as any in this judgement.The dialog throughout is just atrocious to the extreme. Nobody talks like this. Nobody even talked like this in the seventies. And furthermore, if I ever again have to read the word, \"Say\" as the word at the beginning of a dialog sentence, I will throw the book out the window. I can't remember the exact passage that tic'd me off, but here is a made-up example: \"Say, would you be available for a date tonight?\" Nobody uses the word \"Say\" like that, except in Bogart movies. This book is full of similar annoyances that I can't directly recall at the moment. But this made up assumption of how people talk in the real world by two authors who apparently didn't get out of their writing dens very often becomes so jarring after awhile that I actually got angry. The dialog is miserable with three exclamation points.All that being said, I had the same overall feeling that I had when I read The Postman. I liked the general plot idea. I just wish that someone else had authored it and made it readable.And my final observation. I now know that my ten year-old son can have a career as a best selling author right now based on the acceptance level of all of these apparently illiterate reviewers. Three cheers to J.K. Rowling who apparently realized this as well. You just don't have to be able to write anymore in order to get published and make lots of money.This book is a trite piece of writing, folks. Believe it.","I'm not thrilled with this book. It sounds like the script for a mindless blockbuster movie with no philosophical depth. Most of the \"heroes\" are simply people who luck out, find a way to survive, and are too greedy to share it with anybody else, who get cast as \"the villains\". And it's hilarious that damage to the coasts is equated with the end of civilization; don't they realize that most of the U.S. (the \"flyover states\") would still be there? The only really impressive scene is the one with the honest jail warden who realizes that his prisoners are helpless and has to decide on his own which ones deserve freedom or death.","I expected great things from this book; however, it's pretty dated. Don't expect much. this might have been original back in the day, but not any more.","This book's style follows the formula of those 70's cast-of-thousands disaster movies. If you can handle that, you'll enjoy this book just fine.You know you're in for a long read when the authors introduce the character list, which takes up two pages. And it's an interesting list that can't be fully relied upon. Many characters are introduced and disappear before we ever get to know them. Other characters not mentioned in the list arrive late in the story and become major personalities. In the end, there were so many I simply couldn't keep many of them straight.While following the path of a comet is interesting and it certainly takes some time to set up numerous characters and their repsective lives, still it's more than 200 pages until comet impact, which is what the book's really about. That's a long time to wait for action. That said, once things get rolling it's an interesting story. Yes, there's a hint of racism but no more than was generally prevalent in the mid-70's; yes, there's a certain tone that implies only men are supposed to be heroes, but the view of women in the story merely reflects the views of society back then.I found it hard to get too emotionally invested in too many of the characters only because there were simply so many. And while the interludes following the comet's lonely journey toward destruction were interesting, I found it difficult at times to follow what are clearly astronomical descriptions, with which I was unfamiliar.Lucifer's Hammer is an entertaining read, but it's a long one. It offers some nice storylines and characters, but none drew me in so deeply that I felt as though I cared too much by the end.If apocalyptic fiction is your thing and you haven't done so already, check out Swan Song. It's a terrific read with memorable characters and great story.","I have never been able to swallow &quot;apocalyptic&quot; science fiction because it all suffers from the same affliction: the only way for the author to build suspense or brisk pacing is to twist the plot into pretzel logic.I tried to suspend my disbelief, but the premise of this story drops off into absurdity. For the events in this book to take place, we must believe that, in the event of a catastrophic impact:1. Millions will have the foresight to seek high ground, but our elected leaders will not.2. The authorities will not take the possibility of an impact seriously, will not even make preparations for it, have no disaster management or recovery plan, and are incapable of developing or implementing such a plan after the fact.3. A fragile nuclear power plant will survive an apocalyptic catastrophe intact and be worth saving, but far simpler, more numerous, and more robust coal fuelled power plants will all be utterly destroyed and not worth the effort of salvaging.4. Human knowledge, custom, institutions and social cohesion are so fragile, that they will utterly disintegrate at the first major shock.5. The honour, training, discipline and practically unlimited resources of the military machine are so tenuous that it will unravel into assassination, desertion and feudal fiefdom at the first opportunity.6. Cannibalism is such a societal taboo that those who engage in it, even in extremis, are marked and shunned for life.I could go on with episode after episode of such silliness. Additionally, such elements of interest as exist are overwhelmed by the writers' insufferable moralizing. The authors have a political agenda and do not hesitate to flog it. And, as the book's detractors have elsewhere noted, it's about as politically sensitive as Jean Marie Le Pen. Even if we make allowances for its time (1977), race is portrayed with an absurdity that defies description. The authors are by turns condescending and disdainful, disingenuous and stereotyping: Howard Stern in blackface.If you are only looking for an apocalyptic adventure story, this book manages to deliver the goods, though barely and only under considerable strain. Against this, it is filled with inconsistency, absurdity and delusional flights of fancy, managing to be both childish and mean spirited. If you believe science fiction to be something more than third rate adventure stories, if you think it serves a higher calling and should reach for profounder truths, then this book is a failure.","I gave this novel one star for the science. The science in it actually deserves 5 stars. It's sad that it's such an evil book for the descriptions of the comet slowly approaching across the eons is are wonderful and the outline of the story would be perfectly okay, except that it is permeated by an almost unbelievable level of ugly racism. I don't normally call books evil but the degree of racism in this story is evil because it is throughout the book. It's very sad, really and also frightening. I doubt the authors ever considered for a moment the ugly stereotyping every time a token member of another race shows up. In the same way, it's a little dismaying to see so many readers giving rave reviews to this book without even mentioning the racism. It is why this kind of novel is truly evil in its effect. Because it's a good old-fashioned riproaring adventure story with exceptionally well-done scientific explanations, readers can get involved in the story and ignore the offensive elements and the result is desensitization to an issue that should never be ignored.","65 pages into this book and nothing has happened. The author has included WAY too many characters, many of whom have similar names, not to mention their long, tedious back stories. This is one book that, despite my sincere effort to finish, forced me to abandon it due to extreme boredom.","This book is an egregious oversimplification of the nature of man's reaction to crisis. I imagine that the authors followed the arch-conservative viewpoint of human nature, and the need for adherence to the concepts of Social Darwinism, to appeal to the limited intellectual abilities of the books intended audience. If this were the only science fiction genre work that I had ever experienced, I would be forced to conclude that Science fiction writers use the genre as a crutch to shore up an otherwise debilitating lack of literary talent. Fortunately I have experienced the use of science fiction as a platform for social commentary in such oulets as The Twilight Zone and Star Trek. This book does the genre a grave disservice by resorting to simple minded generalizations about human society.***Addendum - yes I made an error regarding the chronology of this book and King's \"The Stand\" - however - some of the replies to this review illustrate my point cogently in that they used the \"gotcha\" of that error to dismiss the underlying message - mainly that this book appeals to some of the biases present in our culture as a plot element. The concept is similar to that used by reality TV programs where people are attracted to tune in so as to watch the humiliation of others.","No matter what accolades you may throw at Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, whether individually or as a team, they don't apply to Lucifer's Hammer. The book was a crashing bore, an umpteenth rehash of an extremely tired motif, and--a la Stephen King (and I don't mean so flatteringly)--an evident attempt to kill as many trees and expend as much ink as possible. We get well past page 300 before the first hint of significant sci-fi action (as opposed to random sex and violence) crops up. I lost interest shortly thereafter: I believe that 375 pages or so are more than enough to invest in a quest for something to merit further reading. Nope. Pass on this clinker.","This book can basically be divided into three parts. Number 1: The comet is coming! The comet is coming! Maybe it will miss! Number 2: Comet hits. This is where the book picks up slightly, but then...Number 3: Civilization is destroyed, black people are made to sound evil.I found this book boring for two-thirds, and pretty unbelievable in many areas (It's the end of the world, hurrah! No more taxes! Also 'We have to rebuild society, but let's talk about this fine piece of CRYSTAL first.') Try for a better Doomsday novel.","Lucifer's Hammer begins as an entertaining book -The parts about the comet striking the earth,and how almost everything is wiped out holdsthe reader's attention - But then, what towe get? A group of black people who aredepicted as CANNIBALS...- and led by a deranged whiteman, at that! Even here, black people can't acton their own! Not only that, by the end ofthe book, they end up being forced into slaveryand beaten into submission by some sadisticRussian character - and this is something Ishould accept? - As a black reader, I foundthis grossly offensive - no matter how inter-esting the rest of the book might me. thesesections of it make the entire thing unaccept-able (By the way, it was years ago when I firstread this book, and I can still remember howoffensive it was, and still is!)","I thought I would love Lucifer's Hammer, but I was very disappointed. I loved Footfall so I thought I would like this as well. I gave up on it after 300 pages.It was boring to me. It seemed like scenes dragged out forever, and even the comet hitting seemed boring. I found myself not caring what happened to any of the characters. They just seemed to wooden for me.I cant recommend Lucifer's Hammer. It was a big bore to me.","This is movie of the week, soap opera, bestseller schlock written by plodding, prosaic hacks for zombie readers who want to read about what they already know.Every character, every scene, every word of dialog in this glop of schmaltz you've seen before. Nothing here will surprise you or shock you with freshness or originality. That's why it's popular.That so many recognize it for what it is encourages me.If you do want to read sci fi that is apocalyptic, fresh, shocking and inspiring of awe, read thisHer Smoke Rose Up Foreverby James Tiptree.","Lucifer's Hammer is full of stereotypical characters, superficial dialogue, dated references and a meandering plot. Readers must plow through 150 pages of this tripe before the comet hits Earth while trying to keep track of literally dozens of minor characters' names and sub plots that Niven introduces every few pages. Post comet story telling is no better. I found myself never able to empathize with the characters' plights since none of them are believable. Do yourself and your wallet a favor - don't buy Lucifer's Hammer.","I read this quite a few years ago, skimmed Fallen Angel, and began to wonder, which one's family had been killed by environmentalists?Really, in both books evil environmentalists are out to destroy society, in this book, using cannabalism to bind people together and bend them to their will. Who new recycling was the gateway behavior for cannabalism?!?I give it a 'meh', if you want to read it, find it used in paperback for a buck, or check your local library.","A true classic. This has been a favorite of mine for many years and reads as good now as it did then.","I can see why everyone keeps recommending this book. I really enjoyed it, one of the better apocalyptic sci-fi books I've read in a while.","The writing team of Nivin-Pournelle is one of the best! This book, tho fiction, is well researched and told in a way that makes putting this book down difficult. It has to rank up there among my top 10 favorite books.","The book is well researched with few stretches of imagination. The book was quite hard to put down. It certainly revealed how civilization could revert to a 'war lord' status. Worthwhile reading.","For the majority of the book this is a thrilling post apocalyptic survival story that really draws you into the events occurring and the plight of the characters, who are largely helpless to protect themselves against the new environment caused by the catastrophe that is the center of the book.However, the book suffers from one major flaw, the ending is essentially nonexistent and a jarring contrast from the usual exhaustive detail shown by the author on just about everything else.In short this is an almost excellent book that suffers from a weak ending.","When I've read a book before, and still can't put it down, and am sorry it's over after reading the last page, that must mean I really, really liked it. And I did.","An excellent book, like most Niven-Pournelle efforts. A well written and plausible look at the world after the end of the world. A little dated, but still a very good read. This pair also wrote many more good books together.","One of the best apocalyptic novels of the 70's, this is where the end of the world genre of movies back then got there inspiration. A gripping read from beginning to ending. The movie Deep Impact would have been better if they had used this as their source material.","Niven and Pournelle are two of my favorites. I was looking for their book Footfall, and i came across Lucifer's Hammer, and cannot believe i had not read it before. Superior writing, story, and characters.","I believe this is one of the most diverse looks at human nature in a survival situation I have ever read. It looks at several different people from different backgrounds and followes them through a natural disaster. They act, react, and interact in ways that are believable and given the part of the country and circumstances, very probable.There's action, adventure, humor, romance, tragedy, real science and just a great time from start to finish.I read it when it first came out and when I saw it for my Kindal I couldn.t resist reading it again.Highly recommend","This is one great book, It actually had 3 parts, The discovery of the comet, what happens when it hit and how the world survives. A very good read tha tsi hard to put down, one of my top 5 SF books that has hard science in it, no fantasy","This is an excellent view of how frail modern society is. A comet comes near enough to the earth so that several large fragments stike with a hammer blow. The resulting chaos and fall of modern society into a feudal life is both realistic and riviting. I found this worth rereading several times over the years and each time, I see something new. I would highly recommend this book not only to science-fiction fans, but to anyone who has an interest in the interation and relationship of man to his technology and how that affects his lifestyle. .Richard Blanco","Taking place in the LA area (as well as earth and space),this book takes you on the ride of your life.An amateur astronomer discovers a comet that just happensto be heading towards earth. No one believes it's goingto hit the earth but as the odds go from billions to oneagainst to millions to one against to thousands and so on,people become unnerved. And so starts the fun.If you like action and can handle civilization crumbling,you'll love this! One of the best books I've ever read.I heard that they were going to write a sequel.But, I haven't been able to find it.Jerry? Larry?","Overall I enjoyed this book. It is clearly impeccably researched from a science point of view and as the impact of the comet approaches it became impossible to put down. The actual comet impact itself, the apex of the action in the novel, does not disappoint and is explained and described in satisfying detail. The book gives a great description of what a comet strike would do to the Earth and it's climate and environment. I enjoyed that the book didn't end with the comet strike but continued the story through the immediate aftermath and into the rebuilding of society.What the book is not so good at is explaining the social affect of complete breakdown would have. A huge chunk of the start of the book is spent introducing character after character after character until I completely lost track. It seems like the book tries to paint such a broad canvas of people that they left a lot of the characters unfinished or just abandoned them completely. For example after the impact the son of Harvey, the main character is camping in a forest, so he sets off to find him with a woman whose son and husband are on the camping trip. That's their motivation for action in the book and yet when, against all realistic odds, they find out where their families are and get to within a few miles of them they just seem to sort of forget about them and they're never mentioned again. Harvey drops by the camp for 5 minutes and decides they're fine without him and the woman, despite making a permanent home just down the road, never even visits her son and husband and just makes some one-line comment about how they don't need a divorce in post-comet California.The charismatic NASA scientist who dominates the first part of the book just leaps in his car and heads off into the distance at one point and is never seen or heard from again. Maybe the writers were trying to mimic the kind of social loose end you'd get in a comet-related apocalypse but it feels more like they had too many characters to seem them all through to a conclusion. Then there's the postman, and the surfer, Mark's survivalist friend, the suicidal camp leader, the rapist, his victim and the police officer. People who just pop up and then disappear.Then there are the parts that are just absurdly improbable. As the USA's second biggest city goes up in flames and rioting, Tim and Eileen just happen to run into each other in the middle of nowhere. Then there's the Senator's ubiquitous ranch. It must cover 75% of California. Dan escapes Nasa and wanders through the wilderness until he arrives at the Senator's ranch. Tim and Eileen zoom about looking for safety before realising- the Senator's ranch is dead ahead! Harvey goes to rescue his kid then decides not to bother and is wondering what to do when he realises...the Senator's ranch is just around the corner! The astronauts come down from orbit more or less onto the Senator's front yard. From orbit. And when they're taken to the Senator's ranch the lead US astronaut is especially pleased because the senator's daughter is his girlfriend anyway! Mind you half of the US seems to have had some action with the Senator's daughter, which is usually described with a paragraph of cringe-worthy prose.For all of that the book is an entertaining read and will stay with you after you put it down. The narrative is strained in parts but my overall feeling was that the writers were trying to paint a realistic picture of what this type of disaster might look like, and the story line and character development were secondary to that aim.","The heart of the story is great: global catastrophe caused by meteor strikes. Unfortunately the story takes a long time to build, as well as introduces far too many characters via uninteresting short stories which makes them very forgettable. Flipping back through after finishing, I remembered there's a guide at the beginning putting names to \"roles\" that would have come in helpful more than a few times throughout just to keep them all straight.Some of the stories are gripping and draw you in to the story, others feel dull and do little other than increase the page count. All in all a decent read if you don't mind having to sift through to find the great parts.","Looking for a rousing post-apocalyptic yarn (I'm a sucker for that end of the world fiction jazz), I stumbled across various reviews of Lucifer's Hammer here on good ol' Amazon. A majority recommended it so why not give it a shot?Like most who have reviewed Lucifer's Hammer, the first quarter of the book drags slightly. I attribute it to the fact that I was just impatient and doggonit, let's see that comet hit already! But I have to say that as the comet drew closer to earth, I found myself glued to the book, waiting...anticipating. And when it hit, I wasn't disappointed. The book picks up steam after that and sends you on a rollercoaster. The highlight for me was the mailman and his little adventure. Out of all the characters and sub-plots throughout, this was the one I related to the most and \"made\" the book for me.I'm not going to pretend that I'm some scholar looking for how dated the text is or the other numerous morale ambiguities that litter the story. I found myself giggling at several reviews which suggested that the authors are sexist, racist, or were other varying unflattering terms. The fact of the matter is, when civilization dies, everything that was is no more. There is no more women's lib, racial equality, or democracy. There is only the will to survive.My complaints are few. The ending seems rushed and a major plot point was glossed over in only a few pages. I felt extremely disappointed that the authors didn't feel that certain point needed an adequate dramatic resolution. Several random characters that could have been interesting protags or antags were killed or never heard from again. In fact some of them seemed more interesting that the characters that actually lived.All in all, a good read and I couldn't put the book down from the moment the comet actually hit.","Apopcalyptic-fiction books seem to take on a familiar pattern. Threat to Earth emerges, four to six people come out of the woodwork to deal with it somehow, some of them have sex with each other or someone else. The disaster strikes, and a boatload of people die. Some of the four-to-six lead characters are involved in picking up the pieces. The National Guard is co-opted by savages and ends up imposing some sort of martial law or military regime. And so on.All this is found in \"Lucifer's Hammer.\" But while the formula is trite and hackneyed in other works, Niven and Pournelle make it work. They breathe life into their characters that's sadly lacking elsewhere. One feels the tension and anguish surely experienced by the characters -- and indeed by the rest of the world -- as the comet draws nearer and nearer, subjecting humanity to sure doom.The authors even manage to inject some humor into a deadly serious topic -- for instance, letting some stoned California surfers ride their last wave, the biggest one in history, formed by the collision of part of the comet with the Pacific Ocean.This book's sheer scope, and the magnitude of the disaster imparted, can be overwhelming at times. I first read it at the beach one summer; I still recall lying on the sand, watching the tide come in and washing the sand from my feet, thinking \"it just doesn't matter ... we humans don't matter; we're so insignificantly powerless against something like that.\"This, perhaps, is the most important part of \"Lucifer's Hammer\" -- gaining an understanding about how vulnerable humanity is to a mass disaster. As Robert Heinlein wrote, \"The Earth is just too small and fragile a basket for the human race to keep all its eggs in.\" Ironically, and not surprisingly, the authors reproduce this quote in the book's frontispiece.Yes, the book is dated. It didn't age well with the passing of the years; one can't help but envision the characters wearing polyester leisure suits with big pointy collars and driving huge Cadillac Eldorados which get 10 miles to the gallon. But that's mostly irrelevant. Imagine a 1970s-era human race being destroyed if you need to.The point is that \"Lucifer's Hammer\" provides the most gripping portrait yet of what a mass calamity would do to the planet -- but it also shows how man can endure almost any tragedy.","Very well written, full of suspense.This book is one of the best in the apocalyptic genre, along with John Cristopher's No Blade of Grass, which dealt with a world destroyed by a grass disease which killed grains as well as grass and left a world in starvation. It mainly dealt with the reactions of people to the disaster, which included the failure of law and order.Another fine one was Alas Babylon, by Pat Frank, which dealt with the reactions of the people in a small Florida town following a destructive atomic war.And of course, there was On the Beach by Nevil Shute, which also dealt with a post atomic war world and an American submarine crew stranded in Australia, where the physical effects of the radiation in the northern hemisphere was delayed by coriolis force.In this book, the world-destroying catastrophe was a huge comet which struck the earth, resulting in total destruction of much of the world through tsunamis, earthquakes, torrential salt rains, and the resulting loss of millions of lives and of all government, national state and local, and hence of all governmental controls and functions. Impotent police, firemen, and elected functionaries; everything and everyone whose function was to maintain order are gone or reduced to non-entities.Money is worthless, food and other essentials like clothes and gasoline are scarce and generally go to the strongest or the best armed. Cannibalism takes over in many places. There is no electric power, and candlelight replaces it for lighting.The book deals with the lives, before and after, of several people, from a country mailman to a U.S. senator, and of course the astronomers, astronauts and others who were intimately involved as well as vignettes of secondary characters as the story develops.The character development is excellent, and the book absolutely captured me. It is no wonder that it sold over a million copies.Joseph Pierre","Altho' I originally read this book back in 1986 , it has lost none of it's appeal to an old SciFi junkie like myself! Yeah , I know that the first part of the story is a little slow...but it really picks up just as the &quot;hammer&quot; is about to strike the Earth and everybody tries to &quot;head for the hills&quot;.The riots and traffic jams in L.A. seemed to mirror reality pretty well. I don't call the book &quot;racist&quot; since the authors' intent was in several ways predictive of actual events that actually transpired later (but for different causes).Remember, folks , that this is a work of FICTION. One of the precepts drummed into my thick head in my college English and various literature classes is that fiction often is a window into the world as perceived by the author!When the book was written , the times were pretty turbulent in Southern California. One could perhaps infer that the book was a societal warning. In the end , mankind manages to survive in spite of food shortages , a war with the cannibal army (reinforced with the National Guard!). The final few pages are perhaps a little &quot;trite&quot; about trying to restart a nuclear power plant and return the power grid.This is a SciFi classic regardless of a few warts. It really is a fun read. It may scare the stuffings out of you , but it also may make you think about the truly fragile nature of our society and how thin is the veneer of man's behavior towards his fellow man.Even tho't is now a little dated , I recommend it highly even for younger readers. It never becomes as sleazy as some of Harry Turtledove's more recent opuses. A solid 4 stars.","This classic is very well-written and starts off quite strongly, but it gets increasingly ridiculous towards the end. Between the immediate return to feudalism, the religious fanatic cannibals,and the 'necessity' of saving a nuclear power plant that would not have been able to keep running anyway, it was terribly over-done. This book also has a helping of Niven's usual sexism, but it is not anywhere near as present as it is in some of his other books. There is also a racist undertone throughout the text (the cannibals are all black).","The two authors of this book were well ahead of Hollywood's apocalyptic endeavors with this classic. I found the characters to be well developed and the action non-stop, once you get into it. Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle take care to spend the first section of the book carefully detailing characters and relationships before enacting Doomsday upon them. The time they do spend on the beginning is not wasted as the bond you build with them from the start helps to root your excitement in their escaping the comet's fury.I think that they have, fairly accurately, detailed how humanity society would splinter under the duress of such an ordeal. How some would try with all their might to hang onto what they've been living with and create their own small society and others would abandon their humanity resulting in chaotic murder, unremorseful theft and cannibalism.Overall, I couldn't put this book down. And of course, it being about Doomsday and the destruction and triumph of the human spirit didn't hurt either.","For some reason, I (as well as other sci-fi fans) have an affinity for end-of-the-world type sci-fi stories, after all, what could be more dramatic than the whole world coming to an end? The subject also seems to draw some of the field's best writers, perhaps because what could give you more power as a writer than creating universal conflagration, and blowing up the earth itself?This theme has been the subject of movies from the 50's through the 70's as well as things like Twilight Zone and Outer Limits episodes, not to mention the two recent Hollywood blockbusters with the asteroid strikes.When I was a kid, I read Phillip Wylie's When World's Collide, which was made into a classic 50's movie, and After World's Collide, both great examples of the genre. Then there were the nuclear holocaust-type novels, exemplied by Neville Shute's On the Beach and Stephen Minot's Chill of Dusk. Finally, there are the ones where deadly viruses or other microbes get out of control, such as in Stanislaw Lem's Memoirs Found in a Bathtub and George R. Stewart's Earth Abides, Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain, and so on. So if you enjoyed Lucifer's Hammer, you might also enjoy these books too.Lucifer's Hammer is probably the greatest example of this important category of sci-fi tale. So if you have an interest in this sort of story, this is no better place to start than with this book.","Yeah, I know what you're thinking. &quot;Another 'comet or asteroid threatens to hit the Earth story&quot;. True, but this one's different: it actually hits. And once it does, the suspense starts. Lucifer's Hammer is one good yarn, not only because of the suspense, but because of the believable characters and situations. True, it is science fiction (sort of), but the science (which there is actually little of, and not all of it flawless) takes an extreme backseat to the story itself. You don't have to be an SF fan to like Lucifer's Hammer. There are a lot of stories (not to mention movies) that have this same premise, but none are as good.","How to say it without gushing? This story is simply outstanding. The character portrayals, and development, are excellent; the societal predictions absolutely, frighteningly, believable. Better by far than &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot;, in addition to being terrific SF this counts as the best 'end of the world' story I've ever read. I've read it so many times the original copy wore out.","This book starts out a little slow, but then it gets exciting. It's a little hard at first to keep track of all the characters,(the book skips between them so much), but after the comet hits, the characters are divided into 2 main groups, and it stops skipping around. I think that the authors acurately predicted the reaction of humanity before and after a cataclysmic event. The latter half of the book is absolutely riveting; I literally could not put the book down for three hours!","Lucifer's Hammer by Larry NivenIn my quest for all things apocalyptic my Google searches gave me a few lists of best Apocalypse books of all times -- LUCIFER'S HAMMER was 9 times out of 10 on those lists. While I can't say that this would be on my top ten list, the book was quite epic, though it's length did a number on me.First published in 1977, LUCIFER'S HAMMER is the story of a comet and the almost total destruction of Earth. The novel covers a broad range of characters, their lives before \"Hammer Fall\" and then subsequently after. The beginning parts of the novel is a coverage of the discovery of the comet by millionaire Tim Hamner and the coverage of the comet by documentary filmmaker Harvey Randall. The general population is of an opinion that the comet will not hit the Earth and that they will just be treated to a glorious show, much like Hailey's comet. Yet, as the comet nears Earth astronomer's start revising \"impact\" ratios and million to one odds start turning into one hundred to one. As these ratios are reduced the general population is not prepared when the comet does strike and it is mass hysteria when it hits. Earthquakes, tidal waves and even nuclear explosions riddle the Earth and the survivors are left with little. A new world emerges from the destruction but it is not one for the weak.Definitely an epic apocalypse tale, LUCIFER'S HAMMER covers all the bases for an end-of-world novel, there is murder, mayhem, sex, stealing, cannibalism and rape. LUCIFER'S HAMMER does not paint a pretty or hopeful picture. Survivor's band together to use one another, not to lend helping hands. This is another one that is not for the feint of heart. Everything is clearly described, not embellished or romantically portrayed. The one fault of this book I found was that it was just so very long. The comet doesn't hit until nearly the middle of the book and by then you are rather fed up with these spoiled and pampered people that you just want the comet to hit and hopefully knock some sense into them. Which of course it does. What I did find was remarkable was the intense explanation of events that would happen after the comet hit which is congruent with Niven's usual style of scientifically explaining things. Though when you do get into these broad reaching and expansive science fiction novels you tend to lose contact with your characters, so I didn't really connect with any of them, yet much like an omnipotent narrator you sort of feel an overall pity for these creatures. Sort of like if you were reading a historical account, instead of a novel. Harvey Randall and Tim Hammner did stand out a bit, but I found they weren't that likable of characters so I wasn't as emotional with their journeys.Out of all of them I thought the astronauts were the best narrative, but their decision to land in California was off track a bit. Moved the plot along - but of all the destinations? I also found the 70s setting very interesting, it's fun to read novels of this era, just to see how far we have come in just 30 years.Overall a great and entertaining read. If you are interested in apocalypse type scenarios you should give this a try.RecommendationsAdults only there are a lot of mature topics touched upon, sex, rape, violence, murder...you name it. Recommended for fans of science fiction, Larry Niven fans should enjoy and if you liked books like The Stand by Stephen King.","\"Hamner-Brown\", the comet, sped toward Earth and was supposed to pass by as close as 1000 Kilometers. Instead it hit the Earth in pieces blowing the Richter scale right off the graph. It was a disaster of Biblical proportions. The people who survived the impact did so because they had the instinct to live. With all manufacturing at a sudden halt, no electricity, no communication, no gasoline, etc, those with guns are the ones with power. Those with power are both good and evil. With a new ice-age coming on, the people need more than just hope and faith to live. They need works!This is the best book I've read in a while. The only criticism I have is as much for myself as it is for the book. I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters because they were so many and somewhat complex. Niven and Pournelle considered lots of things I wouldn't have thought of that would occur in a massive disaster. It made me want to update my food storage, and hone my archery skills. It also gave me pause to consider what I think is worth fighting for... my family?... my freedom?... my friends?... electricity?... a can of soup? How do I want to live, and how to I want to die?All in all a fantastic book!","Loved this book. In fact, this is the 3rd time that I have bought it as everyone who borrows it keeps it for their own library. The plot line falls under the \"what if\" catagory. Suppose a giant comet hits the earth, what skills will suddenly become essential? It is a captivating read from beginning to end.","LUCIFER'S HAMMER, by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, is a thoughtful, thought-provoking end-of-the-world disaster novel. It is billed as a science fiction novel, and, to date, I have always considered it to be science fiction - after all, this thrilling novel intricately describes the days leading up to and following the impact of a comet on the surface of the Earth. However, after further ruminations, I realize that this book is more of an apocalypse, action-suspense novel, which happens to contain hard, factual science. The science here is not the basis of the story, but rather the setting for this inspiring book.In LUCIFER'S HAMMER, a new comet has been discovered. It is big, it will be visible from Earth, and it will be spectacular. There is much excitement about this discovery, but as it comes closer and closer, the chances continue to increase that it will actually hit our planet. Of course, the worst happens, and because the comet has calved (split into many pieces), the Earth is not impacted once, but multiple times. Monstrous tidal waves, immeasurable earthquakes, extremely flooding, uncountable hurricanes, violent volcanoes, a drop in world temperature, and more rain than imaginable follow suit, killing billions and destroying civilization. There is no electricity, no food, no clean water, no gasoline - no safety. The remaining humans barely survive and live in abject terror, some turning to violence, murder, cult-like religious fervor, and even cannibalism. The very act of living becomes nothing more than pure, simple survival. But what is the price of that survival? Is mere survival enough? Or can civilization be saved?I have read LUCIFER'S HAMMER a number of times; it is one of my favorites, and it is always a very exciting read. My heart pounds, full of tension, worry, and fear, and the need to keep reading, keep turning the pages. This is a very \"atmospheric\" book, meaning, everything feels very real and very possible as you read. Several times, I have had to look out the window to be sure I could still see the sun, and that the world was not trapped in unending rain. At the same time, my brain is also very involved in the story, as the science is valid, the plot is plausible, and the outcome very, very possible. This book makes you believe that this could happen, in both your mind and your soul. IMHO, Niven and Pournelle have written a frighteningly realistic vision of what could happen in the event of a world-wide cataclysm. Heinlein was right - the Earth IS too fragile a basket to keep all of humanity in. We NEED to get to the stars. It may be the only way to keep the human race alive for the long haul.Science fiction or disaster thriller, LUCIFER'S HAMMER is a smart, engrossing novel. It provides endless food for thought, and leaves you feeling, perhaps, a little less secure about this fragile planet we live on. Which just proves what really good writing can do. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","This book, this story, is a gift. It has so many strengths from concept, to character development, to execution. I have read it numerous times since its publication and it never seems dated. The characters internal and external struggles were finely honed.I will admit this book, as much as any I have read, has given me a bit more of a survivalist mentality and a desire to be more autonomous, independent, versatile, and knowledgeable. I don't imagine those are bad things!If civilization collapsed today, what would it mean to the average Joe? Just how dependent are we on technology, public services, industry, modern medicine, and commerce? These questions are all vividly addressed in entertaining, horrifying, and memorable events, while offering hope.Fine details of the book come back pleasurably even several years after my last reading, like the return of an old friend.Thanks again, Larry and Jerry. Five stars.The Postman (Bantam Classics), by David Brin, is almost Lucifer's Hammer's equal. Far richer and better than the movie.","This is a remarkable post-apocalyptic novel written in 1977 by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. It certainly challenges the 1957 novel, On the Beach by Nevil Shute. The only difference is that Earth is destroyed by a comet in this book, not by a nuclear war as in Shute's book. Although Niven does have Russia and China exchanging warheads after the comet hits Earth. The other disparity is that mankind attempts a rebound of civilization versus the suicidal ending of On the Beach. Anyhow, this was a very enjoyable novel that precedes all the current \" end of the world \" disaster books and movies. Which novel is better is a matter of conjecture.Once again Niven has a Dramatis personae in his book, which means...\" Hello to numerous characters\"! Wow! How about at least ten main characters and dozens of side characters, all fully developed. It means you, as the reader, will really care what happens to these people; good, or bad. That is a talent of Niven's that I've noticed in his other novels. The only flaw is with his Dr. Charles Sharps character,the Science and Project Director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratories. After the Hammer falls, he disappears from the story and never returns.I wonder if that was done on purpose, or a faux pas.The story starts with Tim Hamner, a amateur astronomer, along with a similar sighting from a youngster named Brown, discovers a comet heading towards Earth. The odds of this Hamner- Brown Comet hitting Earth are millions to one. Harvey Randall, a Documentary Producer for NBS television decides to do a TV series on this event. The comet's name gets changed to Lucifer's Hammer by Johnny Carson on the Tonight Show. The U.S. and Russia send four astronauts in orbit to study the comet. The U.S. Senator Arthur Jellison, the man behind the space program, retreats to his California ranch. As the comet rounds the Sun, and approaches Earth, the unthinkable happens... it calves, changes course and strikes Earth in many places!The rest of the novel deals with the catastrophic events that happen after the strike, man's reaction, and ultimately man's survival. There is so much happening that you really have to read this great book yourself. All of the human elements pertaining to survival are completely believable. And kudos to Larry Niven for keeping the technical stuff out of the book and just tell the story. I don't remember what man's attitude was when the Kohoutek Comet passed Earth in 1973, but one would hope it will not be as cavalier as Lucifer's Hammer was, if another stray comet approaches Earth.","At first, I was a little worried about reading Lucifers Hammer, expecting it to be somewhat outdated and too long. I was mistaken. While it did take me a while to get into it (it's a very long book with a very slow start), I eventually got the hang of the story and couldn't put it down.The story reminded me of Deep Impact mixed with Armageddon. I really enjoyed it, found the characters to be believable, and the decisions being made were very interesting and thought provoking. I would recommend it, but not as good as my favorite post-apocalyptic novel- \"One Second After.\"","A comet hits the Earth, bringing an end to human civilization. A handful of survivors struggle to recreate human society.This is one of the best post-apocaliptic novels ever written. It's dark, gritty and believable. The characters face real problems, are confronted with real moral questions, and have to make painful decisions.(Scale: * - unreadable, couldn't finish. ** - bad or very bad, but readable. *** - honest solid work, value for money. **** - very good in its genre. ***** - timeless masterpiece.)","This book is nothing sort of \"Brilliant\"! The book has been sitting on my bookshelf for over 10 years and my husband has been urging me to read it! I am so glad I finally got to read this tale! Sure it's dated, it refers to the \"Apollo Space craft\" and \"home computers\" are considered a novelty and the way people's hair styles and dress are described it's definitely from the '70. But no one can argue that the THEMES in this novel are what make this book a classic! At first I wasn't sure because the authors take a lot of time to establish the characters and relationships. It doesn't just jump in to the action. You aren't going to be reading the book version of the movie \"Armageddon\" (thank goodness!). But, the pay off of really knowing the characters is sooo worth it! I actually found myself catching my breath during some of the narration! This book really had me thinking for weeks after reading!!!! If you've been putting off getting this book DON'T!","I'd like to start the review repeating what many reviewers have already stated: The first couple hundred pages or so is quite boring at times and tedious developing characters. This alone almost made me not finish the book. I powered through and just as I almost dropped the book entirely; I suddenly became interested enough probably around page number 270.Others have pointed out that the time this book was written makes it outdated. That really only held true of vehicle models for me and was not that big of a turn off in the least.Some of the characters really did not do it for me and the writers, at times; seemed to jump around a lot going back and forth in story lines with all of them. Some of the characters I could care less about. I developed a strong liking for Harvey Randall for some reason, even though he was portrayed (IMO) as kind of guiltless. I could identify with his struggles. Other characters stood as well.It was a little strange in the direction used for some of the characters. But I do think they understand that things would be chaotic like they portrayed and much of people's ethics and morals would go out of the window during a disaster.A few people seemed put off by the racial tone in the novel. It did not bother me and certainly was not a problem. Here is a clue: Racism exists! In 1977 it was probably more open than it is now since everything is so PC now. There are people that point that the authors must be racist because of this. Only the writers know for sure.There were times reading this book I drifted and when things went bad it was in a weak fashion instead of explosive nature. The book seemed to drudge on at times and other times I was really wanting to see what would happen next.Finally, I was not quite satisfied with the ending. For me it was kind of a let down. If the book would have not wasted so much with too many characters and there was a little more human feel to them, I would have given this book 5 stars. So it does get a solid 4 stars because there were a lot of things I did enjoy about this book.One thing is for sure, the book will not please everyone.","Lucifer's Hammer is one of the finest \"post disaster\" novels I have ever read. If you've ever wondered what could happen after a disaster that removes most of the population and all of the services that were there prior to the disaster, then this is the book. Who survives? How do people survive (those that do), and how does one survive without food, electricity, transportation, Government services (no police or emergency help), and many other things. How does one start at a beginning? This book tells you how some people did, and the problems they had getting it done. I had to recently buy another copy since my original book wore out and fell apartLucifer's Hammer. This book should have been made into a movie. In today's world, this book could be a \"how to\" manual.Niven and Pournelle certainly created a masterpiece.Lou Plank","Most stories about an asteroid headed toward earth end when it gets there. That is just the start of the story and what comes after is what makes this such an interesting book.","Before there were all those 1990s disaster movies, there was Lucifer's Hammer. I don't know if this novel pioneered the subgenre of epic novels with massively large casts of characters and plots that were bigger than any one character, but Lucifer's Hammer does it better than any I've read or seen.Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle are the ultimate sci-fi tag-team. Niven handles the science, Pournelle handles the realistic characters, and the result is greater than the sum of its parts. Lucifer's Hammer is positively brimming with realistic people and situations; if you showed me videos of Earth's actual reaction to a comet impact, I'd probably believe Lucifer's Hammer instead. Assisting in this sense of realism are two things - the uncompromising harshness of the plot, and the compromised personalities of each and every one of the characters. There are no pure good guys here, and no pure bad guys, and no one catches a break. The story is brutal, unforgiving, and terrifying - a tale of normal everyday men and women pushed to the absolute limit.My one quibble with the book is its annoying late-70s Reaganite politics. The part where an engineer dismisses ozone depletion with a wave of his hand looks a bit ludicrous in light of more recent events. And it's a bit tiring to hear how much hippies are wimps and nuclear power is Teh Awesome. But this is a minor thing. All in all, if you read one disaster novel in your life, read Lucifer's Hammer.","Before Armegeddon or Deep Impact or even Meteor, there was:\"Lucifers Hammer\". Written in the mid seventies this classic doomsday novel is a treat for any fan of the genre. Well written with an excellent plot-line and wonderful characters it will keep you turning the pages from beginning to end.","I have read this book several times and seem to get something more out of it each reading. Though fictional, it gives an accurate and chilling rendition of what could (and someday may) actually happen, in the event our planet is struct by some large comet or asteroid.For to be accurate, one would need to consider every conceivable type of disaster ... firestorms, floods, tidal waves, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, tornados, etc.Perhaps an eventual ice age.And, of course, the loss of the many common household items we take for granted, with the demise of sophisticated manufacturing.It may be impractical to attempt capturing the story in a movie version. Too much would need to be cut.However, it has great potential for a TV series.","Incredible plot line with a very non typical result. Storyshows that man can and will overcome obstacles in our way but can andwill resort to our very primitive state also","I first picked up a copy of &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; in 1979 on the advice of a friend. Once I started this novel I could not put it down. The character development was superb and the story line awesome. I can't add much to what the other reviewers have written except to say this is a truly amazing work originaly written at a time well before the current comet/asteroid/disaster craze of movies. This book is definately a must read.","&quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; s the greatest end-of-the-world novel ever written. Nothing else can compare to its epic scale, gripping narrative, and utter realism. Only the phenomenal new mainstream novel THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, has stirred my emotions and left me as thoughtful as LUCIFER'S HAMMER.","&quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; delivers on everything most &quot;apocalpyse tales&quot; promise, and offers a wonderful deal of realism to boot. No angels or demons are requried here, just the courge and failings of the human race.Niven and Pournelle truly capture the characters they create, each one unique and believable. The actions of these characters drive the story to logical, and sometimes tragically inevitable, conclusions.Possibly the only drawback comes from one or two improbable coincidences, but these can be forgiven in such a masterwork.","The book is amazing. I have read it at least 8 times, and have passed it along to all of my friends, and no one has been disappointed. A story that actually has character development, and a good plot. None of those comet movies can compare.","What can I say that hasn't already been said? I loved this book, the character development and description of the destroyed world is amazing. The only problem with this book, and it's not the author's problem, is that it's a bit dated. Many times while I was reading it I had to stop and remind myself what the world was like when this book was written. If one can get pass the predijuces and the low-tech, out-dated science, one will find this book is excellent and worth reading.","When I read this book all I could think was I want more. I wanted to see it in movie form and see the characters three dimensional. My family pased it around so often it self destructed.a great vacation book since you don't want to put it down.","Please disreagard my second review of &quot;Lucifer's Hammer.&quot; I thought my first hadn't been published.","For those of us who have not experienced total chaos from disaster, this is a must read. In 1999, we are faced with any number of possible scenarios which could put us in global unrest; this is a book that allows us to grasp the possible situations that could arise: physical, moral, and psychological. If you think, as I do, that a total breakdown in society as we know it can happen, READ THIS.","A great book, it ranks right up there with The Stand and Alas Babylo","I have enjoyed this book for a number of years, which is why I bought it, yet again. I always seem to give away my favorites, but this one, on my kindle will stay with me.","I read this back when it was new, no idea when but it was when I was young. It was my intro to \"end of the world\" fiction. This and The Stand are what I judge apocalyptic fiction on, few have ever come close. Read it and enjoy a good story.I just went and looked up the original year of release, 1977. It still stands the test of tme. I may read it again!","I first read this book in the early 90's. I liked it so much that I bought this book for my 24 year old son. It is doomsday fiction at it's best. I feel this book should be taught in high school literary class.","Just finished reading Lucifer's Hammer last night. By far, one of my favorite books I have ever read. It takes a bit to get into since they spend a long time building up the characters. However, once disaster strikes, I couldn't put the book down. I would highly recommend this to any fan of the genre. I have read numerous PA books including The Stand, One Second After, and Alas, Babylon and this may very well be my favorite yet. Highly recommend!!","Once in a while I re-read the classic \"End of the World\" SciFi novels. This one is among the best. The imagery is something that has stuck with me for many many years. Compelling, horrifying, will bring at least one tear to your eye.","Fans of Post-apocalyptic fiction will not want to miss this one. The book gets off to a slow start building up to the catastrophe, but the action is nonstop once it gets started and hard to put down. The book is somewhat dated. Technology and cultural attitudes have changed tremendously since this book was written, but this really has no bearing on the dark side of human nature in the face of lawlessness which is the story being told here. I enjoyed the book and recommend it to all fans of the PA genre.","I read this book when it first came out back in 1985. It was good then and it is still goodalmost 30 years later. The only other book that comes close would be Stephen King's \"Stand\".Its a well written,rip roaring, read that is hard to put down.Phil","Loved the book and is a great read that you wont be able to put down.Only bad point I would say is that through out the book, you feel that the author wasnt rushing and really immersing you in the situation... This slowly changes towards the end... other than that, really highly reccomended","Fun book, for those of us who like end-of-civilization/dystopian/survivalist stories (Mad Max, The Stand, etc.) The authors write a fairly convincing tome, and how people solve the basic human-needs problems.","What a fantastic book. I enjoyed the characters and the plot line. Very believable and a must read. The only bad thing I can say about it was there wasn't a sequel to this book. I sure would have like to have follow these characters and story further.","I've read this book at least 3 times in the last 10 years. I keep coming back because I am interested in the science of this type of disaster. Read *Uriel's Machine*, by Knight and Lomas if you want real accounts and historical proof of what happens when a comet impacts the earth. This story is very good, the plot is complete, but the limitations are in what your mind can fill in. It is a PLEASURE reading material and some would do much to remember that. Serious books get the type of review criticism that others here seem to forget. This is a huge seller, and the main reason is it is a page turner. All of the other reviews good and bad FINISHED the book, so it must be at least worth that. Take a shot and read this one.","This has to be one of the 4 or 5 best books I have ever read. I am a weather hobbyist, and I found the comet's meteorological impact very plausible. The word pictures were also brilliant, especially the sky on the night before impact, and the weather changes soon after. The image of &quot;two shadows, one moving&quot; is one of my alltime most memorable. But this book is so much more than just good sci-fi! The character depiction is very good, and the fears and even hopes of impact for the various individuals, are the beating heart of this story. One superb instance of this is the scout leader about to face serious legal difficulties, so he plans to &quot;accidentally&quot; fall to his death while leading the scouts on a mountain trail; the comet could literally give him a new lease on life. Another great study is the interaction of the American and Soviet astronauts on a joint mission in space, and the fears and suspicions they hold toward each others' nations. I don't want to spoil the experience for new readers, so I had better stop even though there is so much more. If a person has a decent imagination, he or she will find this story's images will outdazzle the special effects of any movie.","Forget about the movies Armageddon or Deep Impact. This book explores the what if's of an asteroid hitting the Earth like no other end of the world epic.It explores the results of such a disaster and its effects on your friends, neighbors, your community, the climtate, the breakdown of civilization and rule of law, how the survivors of such a disaster are taken care of and fed when the govt. is gone ect..The book was written in the late 70's but it is still very contemporary and makes most other disaster epics and movies seem shallow in comparison....","This book had a lot going for it. Niven and Pournelle, with m,uch scientific experience, have created a very realistic story. Calling it sc-fi would almost be a stretch, since it could really happen. The characters were very complex and memorable. The aftermath of it all, however, seems to be smaller in scope when compared with the destruction area of the book. When this aftermath begins, the books does begin to drag later on. After 640 pages, though, I was glad I read it","Like an old movie that's still good to watch, Lucifer's Hammer is a great portrayal of our society gone to hell in a handbasket following the impact of a comet against the earth. Really suspenseful, very rewarding, very entertaining.","A sequel would be great, but that's unlikely at this point. Either way, this was a well researched and executed novel that I enjoyed very much.","One of the better end of the world books out there. Entralling. A real page turner. I would definitely recommend reading it.","This is not a zombie book, but there are some surprises in it. I have always loved this book and read my paperback to shreds.If you like end of world scenario books, this is a must read. It drags in some places, but you quickly slide past them and get right back into the heart of the book.","Even though this was written almost 35 years ago, it still is very plausible. It was good thing I read it over a holiday weekend; I couldn't put it down.","&#34;A human turns into a beast in three weeks of hard work, cold, starvation and beating.&#34;-Varlam ShalamovShalamov had some very interesting observations about &#34;humanity&#34; and how ethical and noble man is when faced with life and death adversity. Lucifer's Hammer is an excellent fictional account of what we might expect if &#34;humanity&#34; were suddenly thrust into a life or death, day to day struggle to survive, hungry, cold and under constant threat of predation from those stronger or simply desperate. It was laughable reading some reviews suggesting this book to be racist, when in fact, it was quite the opposite. I wonder what those reviewers made of the black astronaut who ended up making perhaps the most profound and significant contribution at the end...I won't spoil it for those who have yet to read the book.Buy the book, read it, then look up Varlam Shalamov and give some thought as to the extraordinary fragility of our current civilization, and just how thin a veneer it really is...","Niven and Pournelle are two of my favorite science fiction writers This book is one of the reasons. I have read it at least a dozen times.Lucifer's Hammer is a real-page turner! The story is engaging, chilling and VERY believable, both because of its here-and-now setting and because the authors based it on some pretty impressive research. The characters are three-dimensional and seem to come alive before your eyes. If you want to experience the heights and depths the human animal is capable of reaching, it's right here.READ THIS BOOK! If you do, you won't just read it once, but again and again. It's that good.","This book is like a hard-hitting, non-supernatural version of Stephen King's &quot;The Stand.&quot; In it, the authors begin with the question &quot;what if the Earth were hit by a fairly large comet?&quot; What would happen? The strike portrayed here is somewhere between the Tunguska, Siberia meteor strike of 1908, and the K-t boundary disaster that probably is responsible for wiping out the dinosaurs. It is nearer in severity to the dinosaur-extinguishing event, but not AS bad. Still, the disaster portrayed here is awful enough to completely destroy Europe, the Eastern Seaboard of the U.S., coastlines worldwide, and much of the rest of the world.The authors clearly spent some serious time thinking about all the possible ramifications of this catastrophe. This book goes a long way beyond the stereotypical apocalypse scenario of &quot;Well, we stocked the bomb shelter with enough canned goods to last for decades, but -- who was supposed to pack the can opener?!? We forgot!! Oh noooo!&quot; Niven and Pournelle painstakingly gamed out military, agricultural, social, psychological, and medical issues, among other problems. It's all realistic, too. Beyond the horror implicit in the basic premise, no extraneous horrific elements (such as Randall Flagg from &quot;The Stand&quot;) are brought in. They aren't needed.A lot of people have commented that there is some serious racism in here. They may be correct, but I'm not sure. I think it's important to be cautious about accusing someone of racism. There is a group of people who turn to ritualized cannibalism after the comet hits, when they are on the verge of famine, and many members of this group are African-american. Not all of them, however -- there was also a battalion of soldiers, of mixed race, who were part of that group. In fact, the guy that incites them to cannibalism is supposed to be white, I think. It seems to me that the authors just wanted to have a group of people who went crazy, and turned to cannibalism. There were two groups the authors used for this dramatic purpose, and one of the groups happened to be radical black urban guerillas -- don't forget, this was written in the mid-70s. It seemed to me that they could just have easily have used any other fringe group -- take your pick. Also, don't forget, there are several sympathetic black characters among the &quot;good guys.&quot;My favorite part is the section where Dan Forester, the astrophysicist, tries to decide what books he should try to save, books with which to rebuild civilization. Think about that! What a conundrum. I would give a lot to have been a fly on the wall during the conversations between Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven that gave rise to this book. Just terrific, tremendous stuff. Two thumbs up.","Still one of the best Sci-Fi/Adventure stories around. Well written. If you're into giant rocks hitting the Earth, this is the book for you! I only wish it was longer, or a sequel was made. Gripping, read it one sitting type book.","I have read Lucifer's Hammer 6 times. Soon to be 7. Every time it grabs me and doesn't let go. The characters are so real you feel you are looking over thier shoulders. It is &quot;Simply the Best&quot; book on the end of the world by far, from the tidal waves to the cannibalism. This story gives you a true idea what events might happen if such a catastrophy were to occur","Yep, this book is actually a thoughtful (and scientifically researched) examination of what &quot;the end of the world&quot; might cause. There were some extraneous characters and the ruminations of the survivors sometimes ran a bit long (as does the book--640 pages), but overall this was a very engaging read. I'm not quite sure why some reviewers thought the depiction of cannibalism in this book was so graphic or so disturbing. In my opinion, it was neither. Cannibalism is a real phenomenon, and the description of the &quot;ritual&quot; was far from horrific.","read this title when first published(1977?). Ahead of its time. Pre Alverez acceptance. Very influential in my life. These things do happen.Has not been bettered but copied (kinda) by two feature films.Must read for people enjoying solid scientific &quot;threat&quot; issues-ask the dinsaurs.Also good cold war 80's stuff on survivalism. I was one (a survivalist) and this book was almost a textbook.I wish I could read it again for the first time.Colfran Australia (no co-incidence)","If you like to think of what would happen if a comet hit the earth you need to read this book. The story's characters are placed into situations that seem very real. This is a great book!","Lucifer's Hammer is easily the best disaster book I've ever read, and I've read every one I could get my hands on. This is one I read once a year. It is thrilling, uplifting, and not p.c., and it has one of the most exciting premises I've ever read.","The only book I have ever read more than twice. I have acually read it 5 times. Just tough out the character development in the begining and then hold on to your hat!","These two authors have changed the rules of our civilization and threatened the human existance. We then see how the human spirit can prevail under new rules and conditions. My favorite book of all time.","This was a great book. You can certainly identify with the characters and the author does a great job building up to it. The only negative I had was that it jumped forward a bit between chapters, which is fine, but maybe a date at the beginning of the chapter to help the reader understand.I absolutely LOVE how the author portrayed the general population's denial of the looming events.Great read, highly recommend.","A well written story, with enough scientific background, to convince you this kind of disaster could happen, and how modern humans would handle such an event. The pacing of the story and the tension were perfect, as far as I was concerned. Read this in paperback years ago, but lost my copy. The title came to my attention recently and I just had to get it downloaded to my Kindle. eh","The author starts by painstakingly developing characters and setting the scene, but the diligent reader is well rewarded for working through. An excellent and entertaining story about the fight for survival.","I read this back in the 70's and wanted to share the book with my husband. I know he will enjoy it as much as I did.","If you've not yet encountered Jerry Pournelle's writing you're in for a real treat. Although he goes out of his way to verifiy the &#34;science&#34; of the story, his characters are well developed and the storyline is first rate. You will finish off the &#34;book&#34; in record time...","A comet hits the Earth. Sorry to spoil that part of the story but it takes about 50% of this forced march of a story to get there and some people might drop out of the column from exhaustion or boredom before they get there. I really wanted to like this book. Truly I did. And while the end of the story made some of the pain getting there worthwhile, it wasn't good enough to justify some of the unnecessary fluff and subplots that really bloat this story.The first half of the story builds and builds (and builds and builds) until the climactic event is a lot less impressive than it could be because you've known for ~75 pages exactly when it is going to happen. This is unfortunate because all the dragging out hinders what would otherwise be a good beginning. The story is a little dated, but that is to be expected and I can't hold that against the author or the story.The post-event half of the book is OK. More dragging and more bloating until you finally make it to a pretty good ending. The last 50 pages of this book are a great ride.Specific Complaints (minor spoilers)Apparently you are required to comment on the controversy surrounding race and the portrayal of African-Americans in the book. I wouldn't go so far as to say that there was blatant racism in the book, but if it were written today I do think a lot of the situations would've been treated differently concerning the African-American characters, specifically the army.I actually had a bigger problem with the pseudo sexual predator Scout Master. I felt like that was an aspect of the story that could have been left out as it didn't add anything to the plot and felt more like a band aid when the authors realized that they forgot to rectify the scout's subplot. It is unfortunate they decided to go this route. Others may disagree as is their right.","If you love post-apocalyptic fiction you will love this story. Not the best story/writing of all time, but quite decent. Holds your attention once the disaster starts taking place.","I read this a looooong time ago and remember rereading a few times. After watching Doomsday Preppers on TV recently, I remembered this book as something I enjoyed and that it was about Doomsday. After a very slow beginning, it got good when they realized what might happen was going to happen. The preppers should look into some of the ways the characters prepped. It had some good ideas. The story is entertaining however it is dated. It seems now, to be a little racist, but that may be just the way it was back in the 70s. I give it 3 stars.","I read this book about 25 years ago. Scared me to death. Even after all these years I could never forget about it, so I sought and found it on Amazon. Yeah!!!! The book arrived well within the purchase date and in exceptional order for a book written in 1977. I was impressed.","I like Niven's vision where some people actually have plans for surviving an apocalypse, and he details how it might actually work. I also think he presents a more hopeful picture of survivors of a catastrophe than many do. Not everyone wants to see the complete collapse of the civiized world, but some think it is worth trying to hold onto.","I finally got turned onto Larry Niven a couple of years ago with Ringworld. Since then, the staff at the local library has started rolling their eyes when I step up to the checkout desk.Lucifer's Hammer is definitely the best of the lot so far. Niven and Pournelle have put together a fantastic mix of science and speculation, building the book to a conclusion that truly brough tears to my eyes. The optimism throughout the story is astounding--despite everything, there is an undercurrent of hope that I like to think would be present in such a situation. Definitely an amazing read, and far and away the best disaster-related story I've seen.","I have terribly mixed feelings about Lucifer's Hammer. On the one hand, it is a pretty good book, especially by 1990s SF standards. On the other hand, it was the first big, thick, mainstream, third-person, subplotted SF novel to really make an impact in the market. So to speak. (The Mote in God's Eye was more of a conventional SF novel.) With this book, Niven and Pournelle single-handedly (or would that be &quot;four-handedly&quot;) fused the suspense and SF genres and, well, kind of made SF what it is today. Which, in my opinion, is less than what it was 20 years ago.","This is the kind of unpretentious trash I love! Fun and diverting, it is swell story telling after a hard day. I really enjoyed the surfer's ride on the monsterous tidal wave through the skyscrapers of downtown L.A. How Southern Cal! The apocalypse can be a hoot if you are young enough to enjoy!","When I first read this book nearly 25 years ago, I thought it was not only the best Sci-Fi book I had ever read, but the best book period. A quarter of a century later, I still have not read anything that would change my opinion. A diverse cast of characters is developed in enough depth to become truly interesting. Best of all, the science is spot-on. There are no embarassing gaffes (like seeing Alpha Centauri from the northern hemisphere) and the characters' reactions to the events surrounding them is not only believable but probable. Every time I re-read this book, I get a knot in my stomach from the tension that escalates continuously right to the end of the book.","An end of world book can be a struggle because inevidably the main character becomes the disaster itself (in this case the comet) and the supporting characters are literally everyone else. This book is no exception. There are LOTS of supporting characters. So many in fact that it is amazing any of them find any development time at all. The tension does indeed mount as the book goes on but the first 100 pages are quite painful to read relieved only with the excellent technical explanation of comets. The few pages preceeding the disaster and following the disaster are the best moments in the book. The utter chaos and death toll are compelling and frightening and the use of weather for dramatic tension really draws you right into the book. Niven really knows how to exploit the situations at hand. It's as good as it gets. The last half of the book is really an examination comparing enlightenment (John Lockman and others) thinking to religious thinking. Frankly both sides don't show too many admirable traits but frankly the religious side is presented in the harshest light possible. The author also argues, through his characters, that civilization as we know it where relative safetly and stablity is taken for granted, has been achieved through technology and NOT religion which the author argues brings more chaos than it solves. However your point of view I'm sure the author hopes that through this book you'll think about those issues.My largest complaint is the use of too many characters. There is just not enough time to really develop them leaving too many feeling very one dimensional and therefore uninteresting. The other is the pace. This is mainly due to so many characters that in an effort to cover them all it can seem like an endless exercise in getting to know the over 40 characters, many of which simply supply the body count.Overall, it made me think about things and that alone makes it worth reading. Just don't expect to be finished with it in less than a week.","Long before I read \"Lucifer's Hammer\", I watched the made-for-TV movie \"A Fire in the Sky\", which starred Richard Crenna as an astronomer who correctly warns people that a small comet will destroy Phoenix, Arizona, and the theatrical release \"Meteor\", starring Sean Connery as a scientist drawn back into the fold at NASA to help stop a huge chunk of a shattered asteroid from hitting Earth.The subject matter of \"Lucifer's Hammer\" - fragments of a comet striking Earth and throwing civilization into chaos - is indeed compelling. But the execution of the story itself lacks. The story was actually dated when I first read it back in 1992, and the political and racial elements of the story are even more dated now. But what kills \"Lucifer's Hammer\" is that the 600-plus pages are simply a slog to get through. Misogyny and racism are actually side issues here, but they're issues nonetheless. Just trying to get through all the character development, who likes who and who hates who is enough to require endurance training.This book really did inspire me to write a novel of my own about a cosmic-impact disaster. And in writing it, I realize the issues that authors like John Baxter (\"The Hermes Fall\"), Arthur C. Clarke (\"The Hammer of God\") and the team of Niven and Pournelle ran into - it's hard to write a good novel about something that very few people have ever experienced first-hand. Whereas both \"Warday\" and \"Alas, Babylon\" have concrete experience of the effects of nuclear war behind them and are outstanding in their own right, \"Lucifer's Hammer\" and novels of its ilk are inherently handicapped because to my knowledge, there's no one alive now who has even seen an actual cosmic strike. Even knowing that, though, a book half the length with fewer characters could've told this story more effectively. As it is, I'd recommend \"Lucifer's Hammer\" only to those who are serious fans of the cosmic-impact subgenre, and only then to those who cannot actually write something better.","This book is an acknowledged work in the genre but, like movies such as The Omega Man or Towering Inferno, what was once cutting edge is now showing its age and comes across as a bit tame. References to 'latest' technology such as a calculator, or tapes for audio really date the imagery for me, and this is compounded by hackneyed 70s phrases such as 'honky' and 'pigs', but maybe I'm being picky (and yes, I am from that era myself). The story itself holds up in terms of its relevance, but for a long book in the hands of 2 very accomplished story tellers, not a lot actually happens.They manage to avoid any major battle scenes which could have been the fantastic climax to the book instead lameley opting to tell us about the results of the 2 big conflicts - the battle at the nuclear plant and the fight for the hills near the Senator's place. I thought it was a bit of a weak ending to a fairly long buildup. Another issue for me was that they seemed to just let some characters drift off - the boy scouts (which I thought could have made for a great angle if further explored), the cop, the telescope killer (no idea why he was introduced at all, only to then be killed) and I thought the handling of the astronauts' roles once they got back was a bit soft. It also suffers in terms of just being a bit too conservative with its subject matter and again, this is a result of the period in which it was written; it just needed some more ooomph.The thing I guess for me is that having seen this book on multiple top 10 lists best-ever lists for the post-apocalyptic genre, I was somewhat disappointed that it just wasn't a better book; it was perhaps just built up too much. Just OK, by no means a classic for me.","Good Book however it is extremly slow in getting to the true story line. The first 100 pages are nothing but background.","this book has some unpleasant racist undertones, but it was written by two white guys in L.A. after the Watts riots, so there you go. otherwise lucifer's hammer is a powerful and gripping disaster epic. there's a great cast of characters. the details, politics and action are realistic and gritty.","This is a pretty good book, though I found it a little preachy. The disaster itself is, unlike most science fiction disasters, actually possible (just ask the dinosaurs). And if a giant comet did hit the Earth, it would pretty much cause a breakdown of civilization. The only problem I had with Lucifer's Hammer was the sense I got that the authors actually were enjoying the whole thing, since it gave them a chance to kill off characters based on kinds of people they don't really like. It was a little cold-blooded, for example, when the survivors who have technology are eagerly turning away survivors who are simply struggling to survive. Realistic? Maybe. But it hardly made the major characters in this book sympathetic, and I would have enjoyed the book more if the authors had spent more time on the overwhelming emotional shock of having the world come to an end, instead of just how exciting it would be.","Good apocalypse story. I would not have minded a bit more shooting. I reread this book every twenty years or so.","I gave this one star just because you can not give zero stars.the writing is stunted and changes tense on the fly. Sometimes you can not tell the author has changed who is speaking or thinking. I had too many times where I had to re-read several sentences to figure out who was saying what about whom. 85 pages in and it still had nothing to keep me reading. I gave up. Money in the toilet!","I kept waiting for the book to get going after 150 pages I gave up. An over abundence of charater developement that seems trivial.","I read this book back when it was new, then picked it up again last month (I ran out of books to read!) and read it all over again. I have to say, I was more impressed with it the first time I read it. Nowadays, it's terribly dated and plods along at a snails pace. Still, back in the day it was riveting new material. I read a similar book recently that uses the same 'meteors smash into earth' theme, but with a bit faster pace, Earth the new frontier, and it reminded me a lot of Lucifer's hammer.","As \"end of the world\" books go, this one is not really up to snuff. (pun intended) The characters are not very engaging or sympathetic and it takes WAY too long for the set-up. Apparently, the idea was to use the first half of the book to give the characters enough back story to make them seem real so the reader would identify more with them when the disaster finally struck. This could have been achieved in about half the pages the writers took to do it, and probably been more interesting for it.My other main criticism is that, with all the brilliant scientists on the planet, there wasn't one of them who could determine with any degree of certainty if the asteroid would even strike the Earth. In the 70's when this novel was set, it was possible to project the path of a celestial body with a great degree of accuracy. Even hundreds of years ago, astronomers were charting the heavens with a fair amount of precision. Why couldn't these guys?A far better written, and more interesting, treatment of this subject is Arthur C Clarke's similarly titled \"The Hammer of God\". Clarke's work also has the added benefit of being much shorter so it doesn't wear out its welcome the way \"Lucifer's Hammer\" does.","The book itself is great, I have read it before. But the actual book is a mess. Every time I turn the page it falls off in my hand. I have a &quot;bookfull&quot; of loose pages!!","Part way through this book, there's a gruesome description of the murder/mutilation of a young woman that really made me sick. I literally threw the book in the trash and haven't read another Niven/Pournelle book since. My loss, I suppose, because I really enjoyed their stories, but enough is enough.Don't know if they ever fit into this story anything about humans having sex with aliens. That seems to crop up in a number of their collaborations. I wonder why.Anyway, I'm not squeamish, but there's enough graphic violence on the evening news. I don't need to read it in my recreational reading. For what it's worth, I had to put down Michener's The Source for the same reason: too much violence, and victimization of women at the hands of men.","I am an avid fiction reader. I enjoy character development as much as the action and storyline of a novel. I'm not easily confused or dissuaded from completing a book. However, this book had nothing going for it. It took me four tries to get through this thing. I started it three different times before I could get past page 12. And I only finished it because I was determined to find something good in it - which I didn't.There were so many people in no particular order with no particular relationship with one another. It seemed as if the authors were trying to write a book with the most characters ever written into a single story. I just read the last editorial of this book, and I have to agree completely.The characters were completely one-dimensial, and not one of them captured my interest. It was hard to follow the authors' direction. I often went back a few pages to see if I'd missed something.The only redeeming quality of this novel is that I may have actually learned something about space.Otherwise, don't waste your time.","Off to the minority I go: Lucifer's Hammer is a disappointment. I won't call out anything about racist undertones, because I don't think those claims are valid, but I will go along with previous claims about Niven and Pournelle's characters being shallow. It's really hard to really bond with any of them: Hamner's conceited, Harvey's depressing, Maureen's a walking soap opera, Hardy's a tool, and Nassor is totally unlikable. I found myself not caring if anyone lived or died...As for the plot and praise for the novel being the best end-of-the-world story ever, I ask why...a comet hit the earth, and people tried to survive. What's new or original? Although the authors sure couldn't cover every single issue that would face a society after an apocalyptic event like a comet, they seemed to focus only on what comes on the top of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, ignoring the issues that make us human and would no doubt fester throughout human societies despite destruction of social order: marriage, religion, entertainment, etc.And the climax...oh, the climax. Wow, a war. I've never read about battlefield conflict before! What exactly makes this story any more interesting than your conventional war story? In my mind, nothing. Armies fight, one wins, it tastes the fruits of victory. In this case...electricity! What were Niven and Pournelle thinking with such a banal ending? 600 pages, and we get quick talk of power lines.Disappointing. Sorry.","After I finished this book, I went through every existing posting. Evidently only a few people sufficiently motivated to write a review read the same version as me. I cannot recall picking up a book with greater anticipation and subsequently experiencing greater disappointment than in this case. While LUCIFER'S HAMMER might be the precursor to the apocalyptic suspenseful sci-fi novel genre, it is also a dismal representation of bigoted values.I have few issues with an author asking me to suspend dis-belief. As a generality, I expect infusion of his personal viewpoint. I have no objection to insertion of social commentary, sometimes even when that commentary is misplaced within the context of a given milieu. In this instance, Niven and Pournelle have crossed the line, which is unfortunate because their vision of the cataclysmic ecological events experienced after the comet's impact is riveting, as is their speculative view of the ramifications across existing societal systems. LUCIFER'S HAMMER is less science and more fiction although their descriptives of the cosmological effects were plausible enough for me.It's the fiction I have problems with. Like so many others, I labored through the first 100 pages (closer to 150) while the authors' set the groundwork for the inevitable collision and introduced the core component of predominantly one-dimensional characters. From the appearance of the first ethnic character, I was astounded and later depressed by the totally prejudical portrayals. The resurrected society with only a few non-caucasians Niven and Pournelle envision is worthy of a William Pierce or David Duke. Other than some ambiguity regarding the eventual assistance of a tribe of Native Americans, non-caucasian ethnic groups were uniformly presented in uncomplimentary terms, including only perfunctorily positive treatment of presumptively heroic ethnic protagonists.This isn't about multiculturalism or political correctness. I am not opposed to adverse portrayals of SOME ethnic characters. Let's face it, somebody has to be the antagonist. Initially, I attempted to rationalize their treatment of ethnics - and women - in the context of the era in which the book was written. However, as I worked my way through chapter after chapter, it became an inescapable conclusion, the authors either harbored deep-rooted animus or inexcusable ignorance... or both. Within space constraints here, it would be impossible to reiterate most of the multitudinous examples. In some instances, the authors were subtle such as the Chinese preemptive attack on the Soviet Union, or the Arab Bloc attack on Israel, or stereotypical descriptives of Asians (orientals in the book). Yet, it is with Blacks where their antipathy is most prevalent. Blacks are universally portrayed as militant, unintelligent, diffident, feral, barbarian, cannibalistic, incompetent, sexually obsessed...or assimilated. On at least two occasions, it was implied a Black's leadership skills evolved from his \"mixed blood.\" The preceding allusions are in no way all encompassing, they fail to scratch the surface of the included vituperatives.The ironic part is, I liked the story. I thought it was an outstanding work of science fiction. However the critical mass of bigoted thought makes this book hard to recommend.","This is an excellent novel. Very tense for most of the book. I guess there was controversy over racism and sexism, but I don't see it. One of the characters is a street thug, and the role of women post-apocalypse is one of the plot points that will make you think. The ending seems a little too pat and coincidental, but that does not diminish an excellent sci-fi novel and a must read.","Read this a long time ago. Still have the hardcopy somewhere. Better than the more recent movies of this end of the world nature. The Kindle is a less bulky platform.","I've read this book 3 or 4 times since it came out. An excellent read, and a fascinating take on recovering from ultimate disaster. Yes, some environment info is a bit dated (it's the 70s), but not the tragedy or struggle to survive. Always one of my favorites.","I read this book when it first came out and I just finished reading it for the third time. It was as good as ever. A little dated because of certain references, but the scenarios are believable all except for one, but you will know that one if you read it. This is still one of the best apocalyptic books on the market.....in my opinion.","When I first read this book about 30 years ago, I was mesmerized by the description of the comet forming in the far reaches of space, being affected by a \"dark\" sun that passed by every 100 million years or so, and finally being stopped in its tracks by a final encounter with this sun, which put it at the mercy of Sol's gravity, eventually drawing it into our Sun's solar system where it wreaked the havoc described in the rest of the book. And I was enthralled by the stories of ordinary people struggling to survive in the aftermath of the comet's impact. Realistic accounts of people searching for lost loved ones, searching desperately for food, trying to find places where they could rest, regroup, and avoid or overcome the inevitable evils (and there were plenty) that such a cataclysmic event would spawn. No Bruce Willis or Sly Stallone riding to the rescue in this one; it's real people struggling against real odds, with no miraculous interventions by superstars or supergods.I read it again on Kindle this year, and was just as thrilled by it as when I first read it. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the slow start introducing all the characters that will become important later in the book. Thirty years ago this didn't bother me, but now, since I knew what was to come, I was overly anxious to get into the meat of the story. Highly recommended.","The following of so many different characters as the story played out made for a great read. And even when you thought you knew everyone, someone else was mixed in. Makes you wonder how you yourself would react in the same situation.","Lucifer's Hammer is a great and easy apocalyptic read. Kind of sorry it was set in the 70s, but once the comet hits, does it really matter? Do yourself a favor though and start reading at around 25% or skip ahead liberally when you feel boredom induced sleep encroaching. The book is over 600 pages long so you still get your money's worth, but you don't have to suffer through the interminable back stories of every character that makes even a passing appearance. Once hammer falls, it starts rocking. Good stuff.","I loved this book the first time I read it, thought it had real importance. Now, not so much.It isn't the ideas or the plot, those are acceptable. The writing is just not good enough and I have been a fan of Niven and Pournelle from the first I read them.I'm afraid to re-read any of their other SF, perhaps better to leave my youthful past pleasure as it was. Maybe like seeing an old flame and they are fat and ugly.","Lucifer's Hammer, though an old publication, is worth reading again ( time number 4 for me ) as we approach the end of 2012. An excellent evaluation of human kind, it's a shame there were no facebooks, twitters or other social media when it was written.edoran","I actually picked up Lucifer's Hammer a few years ago, but never made it past the first ~100 pages. Amazon sent me a recommendation for it, so I decided to give it another go. I've always enjoyed THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT (TEOTWAWKI)fiction, whether it's zombies, aliens, comets, nuclear war, electromagnetic pulse, sun spots, solar flares, economic collapse, etc. Written in 1977, Lucifer's Hammer is timeless and will go down in history as one of the best \"end of world\" stories.While the first 100~200 pages are slow going, it is critical to set the conditions and character development, once the HAMMER falls, it is almost impossible to put down, by now you've formed a bond with the characters and want to know if they survive...","Wonderful. Deep. A read that commands your attention and examines what the human race would do when faced with catastrophe.","This book takes a while to get started, but once it does you can't put it down. This story is one you will remember for the rest of your life.","Couldn't put it down. It's a necessity for any prepper. Although there is a pattern emerging. Disaster followed by a war.","This is one of the books I read over and over. Had to have it on my e-reader! The best!","This apocalyptic story is the best I have read. Fast paced, great imagery and enough scientific facts to make it feel real. Loved how well the characters were developed; had me trying to figure out which one I might have been in such a world. Wish there were more books of this genre that were so captivating. It is in my top ten list of great books to spend time rereading.'","This is an older book, but it holds up amazingly - the writing is solid, and the story is riveting. It's a chilling reminder of how close we are a return to dark times...","I've read a lot of books in this genre, once Second After, 299 Days, Patriots, Truth's Blood, etc., but this book tops them all. If you enjoy the genre, buy it.","I have owned this book before and have read it already. let girlfriend borrow it. she is gone and so is my book. used amazon to replace most important loss. dont want the girl back.","Thought the premise was quite interesting. The first third of the book describing the run up to realization that the comet was going to hit was pretty compelling. However after that I thought the story lagged. I found the character development and writing just so so. All in all an average sci fi effort.","An old book about the end of the world. It is somewhat dated as to the technology, but the story is excellent. Has a lot of characters that all pull together in the end","&quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; is the most realistic 'end of the world as we know it' story that I've ever read. It you find this book 'grusome' or 'offensive', you'd better pull your head out of the sand and hope you don't live to see our world in REAL trouble!","I realy enjoy the reading of this book. It is not often that one reads a book that is food for thought and fun at the same time. Most of the &quot;armagedon&quot; type of books axploit the post-tragedy meihem with all it's harrowing details, yet this is not the case. I found the cannibal ritual rather interesting as a way to for ever brand the new initiates so as to leave them no where else to go. The plot would profit if the author would have elaborated more on the post-hit rather that on the pre-hit, but in essense is a great book.","This is a superb novel about a comet striking the earth, thereby destroying modern civilization. The physical as well as the psychological events surrounding the impact of the comet seem well-researched and accurate. This only adds to the drama of the story and the awe the reader feels as events unfold. There are a few too many characters, and parts of the ending seem contrived, but this is a must-read for science fiction lovers.","I usally dont become this affected by a book especially a sci-fi book. This book almost made me stock pile under my house. It really gives a realistic veiw of how mankind reacts and so called social norms go out the window. For being a action book it really involves you in the characters lives.","There are many end of the world books, often using a well-aimed comet or asteroid to do the job (even authors such as Dennis Wheatley have written books of this genre). This is by far the best of the offerings that I have encountered. It has authentic detail and a very realistic scenario for the use of the technology then available (alte '70s or very early '80s).The characters are believable, the plot plausible and the novel really stands the test of time. What I like is the development and the realism... this is what an impact would really be like. Perhaps it should be required reading for some world leaders before it's too late.The most curious aspect of all is the way that reality caught up with the book. The discovery of Comet Hamner-Brown bears some astonishing similarities with the discovery (and discoverers) of Comet Hale-Bopp - a fact which amuses Alan Hale and Tom Bopp!","A great read. Similar in style to the writing of Stephen King from the perspective of intertwining many characters from diverse backgrounds into the plot.It really made me think about survival should an event of this magnitude occur. It is a fine end of the world story, again, similar to The Stand, by Stephen King.","When I first read LH I was still with the government and involved in contributing to what passes for our government's emergency action plan. Since no one individual can imagine all possible scenarios, it is a good idea to get the benefit of someone else's thinking. That's why many of us read books like LH and Alas Babylon - - to get the value of other's ideas of what MIGHT happen and how people MIGHT react. From this standpoint I give the book a 10. It makes you think and gives you a scenario within which to organize those thoughts. Are you prepared? If not, why not? What do you do to become more prepared. I suspect that the trauma associated with the El Nino storms this year might have been mitigated if more people had looked at possible worst case scenarios and prepared for them. If you plan to start some study along this line, don't neglect the many factual books out there from histories such as The 900 Days (the siege of Leningrad)and/or the myriad publications dealing with specific hazards such as hurricane, earthquake and other mass disasters. Our society is more fragile than most believe. It does NOT stretch the imagination to envision something similar to the plot of LH.","This book is fascinating, starting with action and excitement, and wrapping up with enough force to make you shiver. Mr. Niven's &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; not only envisions how mankind would exist if we lost everything, it also describes the character of mankind itself, from the thief to the monarch, and how they would react to a global emergency. &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; also describes how mankind not only needs the human touch, but the human organization. When governments are lost, groups band together to form their own governments. The first time I read this book, I couldn't put it down. This made for a late night. The second time I read it, I couldn't put it down AGAIN, which made my boss extremely upset. But it was worth it just to read this book","I never read books more than once, but I have read &quot;Lucifer&quot; three times. A riveting story of the end of civilization as we know it, due to a comet's impact with the earth. The story of a group of very few survivors in Southern California... how they stay alive and try to rebuild a normal life. Great characters and plot. Exciting, suspenseful, with a satisfying ending. My highest recommendation. You don't have to be a science fiction fan to love this book","This book is a wonderful, starkly realistic portrait of the end of civilization as we know it. Niven and Pournelle paint vivid pictures of multiple mega-tidal waves and constant hurricanes as fragments of a massive comet slam into the Earth. The survivors gather in a feeble attempt to stay alive as cannibles, thieves, robbers, religious fanatics, and murders roam the mountains after most of California is washed away. Niven and Pournelle have a knack for making their stories chillingly real. This book is not a noble account of humanity helping each other, but a gritty story about how they would act","I have read other books about survival after a catastrophe, but this one I didn't like too much. They needed to have more tell and less show, more politics and less sex/relationships, more guts and gore and less character development. Suffice to say, this wasn't The Stand, wasn't One Second After, wasn't even The Patriot which manages to have a fascinating story in spite of it reading like Popular Mechanics.One more thing, the reviewers who complained about racism are wrong. The topic of race was handled fairly because it showed that racism can and does exist from ghetto blacks against whites, and from some whites against blacks. The Stronghold itself wasn't racist and nobody was kept out due to race.","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. There are a lot of characters and it took about 100 pages to set them up...but the rest of the book is a thrillride. Very fun and interesting.The biggest negative for me was the character names. Two major characters named Harvey and Hardy, and a minor character named Harry. Two females named Eileen and Maureen. Confusing at times.","we had read this book a long time ago. It sticks in your mind because of it's ruthless truthfullness - people are animals when frightened. The book makes you scared for our race. this is not a hollywood soft pedal book.","A chilling tale of a possible future. If you like disaster epics this one is definitetly for you.","Smog, Pong, PoseidenAdventure/ToweringInferno/Earthquake/Jaws, Johnny Carson, Oldsmobile Toronado, CB Radio, Ralph Nader, Star Trek reruns, post-Vietnam, gas lines, pull-tabs on beer cans...This is a Disaster Story told from a pre-Internet mindset. If you want to know what the mid-70's mindset was, then read the first half of this book... maybe not for the story (which is outdated), but for the perspective on the 70's. It was the last days before the Microprocessor really began changing the cultural landscape at an exponential pace... in a few years there would bloom in rapid succession SpaceInvaders/PacMan, Apple II, \"The IBM PC Clone\", cheap air travel for the masses, and \"The Internet\". Tri-Network TELEVISION still ruled the roost, and Carter hadn't yet destroyed the USA's military and pride, as well as Iran's Shah, and run inflation up to 21% (all setting the stage for the USA to be proud of an Olympic HOCKEY team, and for Reagan to get in, free the hostages, and then destroy the USSR). It was the last days of a \"certain naivete\"... CANNON was off the air - DALLAS was debuting... Chrysler and the rest of Detroit were now producing nothing but garbage... for better or worse, \"Muscle Cars\" and the \"Kawasaki Triple\" were finished, and all cars would get FuelInjection/CatalyticConverters - and LA smog would start vastly improving... Saturday Night Fever and this book mark the boundary between two eras.The intertwining story, which contains loads of deeply-explored characters, is written in mature Heinlein form, and reminds me a lot of STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND from the early 60's (with a little bit less sex and violence thank goodness).I don't really consider this book \"SciFi\", as there is not much effort to \"predict the future\"... save for the fact that the authors play around a bit with what \"might have been\" if the lingering Apollo/Space Shuttle controversy of the time had been allowed to become a competition. I found the earlier parts of the book to be so out of date, that it was best read like it was an \"Alternate History\" novel. But, once you get to the second half of the book, the disaster hits, and mankind is thrown back to the stoneage (with pockets of technology and history surviving), the book becomes something totally different, and the 2nd part is really a classic.One other thing that strikes me is that in today's era of runaway political correctness, this book would never be able to be published in its current form. OJ Simpsonesque characters simply \"aren't guilty\" in today's world, and inner-city gangland antics can't be written about - only \"sung about\" by the self-same \"gangsters\" - in that sense, this book offers a refreshing insight into reality and escape from today's madenning PC disreality. While the 70's were naive in certain technological and political senses, they were more REAL than today's PC run amok.","Okay, I will admit that I almost did not finish the book. I felt that the beginning was somewhat dry. Then...BAM...the Hammer hits and the book becomes so good that I don't want to set it down at all. I really do not understand the racist comments about the book. White people were the ones being eaten and called \"honkies\". Who knows what would really happen in this kind of scenario? It does make you think though. All in all, an excellent book and I can't wait to read Footfall.","First of all, what a title... WHAT A BOOK! The first book I can ever remember reading that made me sit down after the last page and say, \"damn. What just happened here.\" I even got a group discussion started at work, asking others what they would do if presented with the same situation. We all agreed that what happened in the book is probably very consistent with how society would react under similar or same circumstances, which is scary. I only hope we never find out. Let's just say, I've since packed a knapsack and chosen a secluded mountain hideaway for me and my family, just in case that day ever comes.","Long before I saw Deep Impact, I read this masterpiece by Larry Niven and Jerry Puornelle. As good as that movie was, this book was at least 10 times better!This is one of the best end of civilization books I have ever read (better than When Worlds Collide and Earth Abides). Shows how some people will turn into savages while others will try to keep the society going. So realistic, you feel that it actually happened.","When these two writers get together you can bet your bottom dollar that the book will be a non stop read.Don't pass this one up!","Larry Niven hit the nail on the head, with his story of the gargantuan comet that throws Earth, and society into chaos. The story development (including the character introductions and the unfolding set-up to the novel) was the perfect length, without throwing the comet into the story too early. The authors' depictions of the post- apocalyptic gangs which came to be were stunning, and brutally real, without any cowardly censorship, or gentle twists. Overall, the struggle to survive was effective as a steady clincher, but too often, I found the &quot;non- stop action and suspense&quot; lacking, when, at times, too many pages were devoted to boring descriptions and interpretations. However, these instances were far and few- between, and overall, this novel was an interesting look at what human nature can be reduced to, in the most horrible of circumstances.","Great disaster book with correct science. Unfortunately, the book perpetuates typical racial stereotypes - a few superhero blacks, with most blacks portrayed as drug addicts, cannibalistic, incompetents. Niven and Purnelle's final vision is one in which there are hardly any blacks, no hispanics, no asians and no indians. . His finally world is one in which white Americans continue to dominate the United States.","This is a very boring book. Can't remember reading anything this boring! I bought the kindle version, and instead of reading a sample, I just purchased based on great ratings/reviews. What a mistake. The characters were flat and lifeless, and I felt nothing and cared nothing for them. The world they live in is described in sketchy, minimal terms, and again, I felt nothing and did not care for it. The first part of the book had pages and pages of talk of the comet, thoughts from those who discovered the commet, interviews about the comet, dicussions about who's going to maybe, perhaps, try to investigate the commet . . . blah, blah, blah. The rest of the book was no better. It did not seem at all like a story to be, just one long slog of political/social/(fill in blank) commentary. There are good ways of doing such commentary, and this is by far not even close to it. The dialogue was brutally idiotic and the relationships were unbelievable. As with other Niven books, I found the female characters to be infuriating for the most part, stilted and weak, and no, I did not find the female main characters to be a strength of any kind. Just because a writer gives a character a main role, and says they are strong, does not meant hey are. I expected a novel with a world to get immersed in, science to be enthralled in, and characters to believe in, and what I got was a choppy, disjointed, boring documentory. With the excellent reviews, I expected much, much more. This book was recommended as a terrific post apocolyptic novel, and I just love post apocolyptic stories - eat them up! If I had read the sample, I NEVER would have purchased. The beginging was representative of the whole book - slow, confusing, poorly written and dull.","Well, I guess I am the only one who did not care for this book but I was strangely dissatisfied when I finished reading it.First of all, I found the characters as written to be one-dimensional and shallow. In the end, I frankly didn't care if any of them lived or died.Also, I kept waiting for a serious treatment of what life would be like for those left behind in a disaster like this but what I got was a soap opera. I kept wondering, how are they going to ensure that they have a safe, clean water supply. This was taken care of by one of the characters saying &quot;At least we have plenty of water.&quot; Whew.....that problem is solved. Okay, then I thought, what about sanitary needs. This is glossed over as well by another character saying &quot;Thank goodness the plumbing works.&quot; Oh please.Then, I thought, okay, what about the social problems that would arise for the few women left behind with all those men. Again, not addressed. If anybody seriously thinks that the traditional boundaries of marriage would be respected in this situation, they are sadly mistaken. Women would be looked upon simply as breeding stock and would be pursued endlessly. It would be a nightmare existence for the women.I guess I expected this to be a different kind of book but I simply cannot recommend it for anybody interested in a serious study of survival.","This book tackles the end of the world and the aftermath, which is a breakdown revealing human dualities: rich/poor, black/white, Communists/capitalists, media magnates and farmers. It is an excellent story, once it gets going after 150 pages of the most brain-damagingly slow and pointless and poorly written dreck I've encountered. Once these authors (finally) get into the tale, it becomes an analysis of civilization through both how it breaks apart, and how it is put back together. People have said this book is harsh on Russians and others, but I think the authors were trying for realism; because they're awkward, inefficient, clumsy writers I'm sure they botched that too. Most people will skim over half of this 640-page behemoth because, in competent hands, it would be one-third the size and about five times more interesting. Science fiction writers are known more for the \"science\" than \"fiction,\" and this book, unfortunately, proves that adage. However, the underlying story and what these authors have attempted is intriguing, and has more to do with the lives we live now than some future apocalyptic scenario.","Just finished reading Lucifer's Hammer by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. I rarely read fiction, never read \"best-seller\" fiction, and cannot remember the last time I read fiction of this ilk (maybe back in the early 80? - Stephen King's Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption which was tremendously better than Lucifer's Hammer(LH), but I digress). Since this was published in 1977, it is hardly a current best seller, but according to the cover of the paperback edition I have, \"over a million copies have been sold.\" That is impressive.I read this for several reasons: My brother asked me to and after seeing what he and others said about it, I wanted to read it, and I had the time to read it (considering it was just shy of 700 pages, some commitment was required).I learned several things reading this novel:1. I do not enjoy fiction of this nature. In my teen years I used to read science fiction, but this is not science fiction in any sense that I remember it.2. The book was about 300 pages too long.3. The plot lines in the book were completely predictable, almost from the opening chapter.4. There were two philosophical observations in the book I appreciated - more on this later.5. I have no plans to read any more fiction any time soon, unless it is literature or a classic.I admit, I am an elitist when it comes to fiction. I say this as a matter of personal taste and not from a position of snobbery or a feeling of superiority. To me, the simple fact is, most fiction is meaningless pablum, not any more intellectually challenging than a soap opera or prime time drama on television. It's function is merely to entertain, to stimulate sensually, etc. This book is no different. There are no memorable lines in LH, no memorable characters, nothing that challenges one's view of the world, and nothing that deserves emulation.While some people may sit around and worry about what they would do if a comet struck Earth, it is not a subject with which I am particularly concerned. Yes, it is possible, maybe even probable, that a comet could strike us. There are other possible \"end of the world\" scenarios - devasting earthquakes, nuclear holocaust, chemical weapons, etc. but these are not the stuff, in and of themselves, that lead to good fiction.There are two things about the book I liked. First, people did not change. Those who survived by their wits, their intelligence before Hammerfall did so afterwards. Those who were oppotunistic remained so. Those who were evil before were evil afterwards. The only exception to this was Armitage. I call this an exception because the book indicates he was a decent man with a good message prior to the comet, but somehow morphed into a raving lunatic afterwards. This may have been some attack on religion in general by the authors, or it may have been to provide some entertainment element to the story. In either case it comes across as intellectually trite. Armitage adds nothing to the story.The second thing I liked was how quickly people realized how the power structures before the comet meant nothing after the comet. I think this occured more quickly in the book than it would in real life, but this thought process is absolutely correct. Amazingly, this occurs (albeit on a much smaller and more laconic scale) everyday. Circumstances change radically, thus the currency of power changes. The nature of people do not change, but the things that make them powerful do. I thought the authors did a good job of portraying this.There are some elements in the book that I found superflous (i.e. 300 pages not needed). The first half was too long. The story of the cop and the sexual predator was fluff. The boyscout story was not needed. The banker wanting to kill himself was not needed. (There is more but thankfully I have forgotten the details).I cannot recommend this book. I do not like the foul language. The moral behavior of some the characters is left unjudged and occur without consequences. There is no \"message\" to the book that I could discern other than \"brains beat brawn in the long run\" - hardly a revelation. Finally, I found the book derivative of good fiction - Lord of the Flies by William Golding comes to mind - but this is not surprising considering the paucity of originality demonstrated by the authors.One final thought. These are my biased and subjective impressions of this book. If you read this book and enjoyed it - great! This only proves that we have differing tastes and nothing else","WAY too outdated. The book is all 70's, and glorifies sex. The characters are believable, I suppose, but half of them die anyway. Starts out boring, then finally gets a heartbeat, but then you have to cover it with a sheet. Unrealistic after the comet's impact.Some people thought 'Deep Impact' was a bad movie because it stayed directly within the United States. 'Lucifer's Hammer' doesn't take a step beyond Los Angeles, except when telling of space scenes or the comet's destruction.Don't buy this book. There are better ones.","Senselessly gory, unrealistic timeline and overall WAY overrated. if you are trapped in a hurricane or something and this is around, it is worth a trun thru. But don't go out of your way to get it.I am a fan of this genre of book, but was very disappointed in the story. It just wasn't any good. Like a flat coke. Alas Babylon is a lot better.","Having enjoyed books by Larry Niven in the past and after reading a number of positive reviews, I was fairly certain Lucifer's Hammer would be a page turner. Unfortunately I found it to be a tremendous disappointment. The book follows the stories of several characters before, during, and after a large comet causes major devastation to the Earth and its populace--roughly covering a two year time span.There are several problems with the book, the first being that it's incredibly dated. Published in the late 70s, the story contains far too many references to the politics, attitudes, and pop culture of the decade. Understandably some of this is unavoidable, but many references could and should have been avoided to keep the book at least somewhat fresh. Also, the language used to discuss science and technology as well as dialog between characters is so incredibly dumbed down that I doubt a third grader would find the story a challenging read.One of the most frustrating and annoying problems with the book is the introduction of some potentially fascinating topics such as race relations, morality, and changes in marriage practices and mate selection in a post-apocalyptic world that either never quite get off the ground or go in very bizarre and unbelievable directions. While I don't know if this is actually the case, I can understand how many people think the authors are racist because the depiction of various ethnic groups is quite stereotypical from a 'white-conservative' perspective.In my opinion, the protagonists are all weak characters and major concerns seem to revolve around sex, crushes, and who likes who. There are a couple of interesting characters that seem to have some depth and interesting motivations, but unfortunately they have minor roles. Also, in a book like this I would expect a certain amount of grieving for lost loved ones bordering on heart wrenching, but while there is a considerable amount of death, for the most part the characters seem ambivalent about it. I will admit that I like the direction the authors took with the comet itself in that they made it more of a character in the story rather than just an incident.The last two chapters were downright insulting to the intelligence of the reader. It felt as if Niven and Pournelle grew bored with their own story and decided to downgrade one of the major plots to something of little importance for no apparent reason other than to reach a quick conclusion.I am very surprised the book received so many good reviews. With respect to books with post-apocalyptic themes, I've foundWarday,The Stand, andSwan Songto be far superior in both writing style and character development. However, if you decide to read Lucifer's Hammer, I recommend checking it out at your local library.","Generally I like post-apocalyptic novels but this book embodies everything I hate about 70s science fiction. Misogynistic towards women, racist towards blacks, irritating macho theme where it's \"every man for himself\" and \"save what women you can\" after a comet strikes the earth. The women are mostly portrayed as sexual objects in this novel with very little in the way of their own character development or volition. In addition to the post-apocalyptic world being written in an extremely trite way, the novel makes it worse by telling the story using 5 main characters so that we are constantly jumping back and forth between viewpoints every 10 pages. I slogged it out for some 360 pages before I put it down in disgust and frustration.The story line is exactly what you've seen in many other post-apocalyptic novels: rugged individuals struggling for food along the roads fleeing from disaster, small communities valiantly banding together to defend themselves, etc. The trite plot isn't fatal in and of itself, but the writing is not particularly interesting and moves grindingly slowly due to the frequent viewpoint shifts between the five protagonists. The science about how comets work and plugs for the space program are not bad, but feel very dated. Overall not an interesting read and the prejudiced attitudes in the novel turned me off. I gave up at the point where the farming community begins to pull together and starts to discuss how they need to keep out the hordes that will be coming from LA, in particular the \"N*\" from there. All eyes then turn towards the two lone black farmers living in town, but as those two are shrinking down in their chairs in the church the community decides that those two \"will be alright\". Just... terrible.","The first half of this book was interesting. I have no problem with depictions of black people as criminals. As a matter of fact, the plan to loot Beverly Hills made sense. Why rob poor people? I was actually looking forward to seeing the details of the heist and how well the black gang would cope after all heck broke loose.It was not to be.So in times of trouble ALL black people turn cannibal in a heartbeat? The people who defend this piece of garbage really make me wonder if we read the same book. In the second part the black shuttle commander lands with his crew, sees black people toiling in the fields and white people standing around armed to the teeth. Well, of course the blacks had to be treated that way. It's for their own good. The shuttle commander is told that the good white folks will have to keep an eye on him, never mind that he had absolutely nothing to do with what went on after the Hammer hit. It's quite obvious that the general consensus is because he's black he might get the sudden urge for the other white meat (and I don't mean pork).Gee, Niven and Pournelle, stereotype much?That kind of mindset was ugly back in the 70s and even today still hasn't gotten any prettier. This has got to be one of the sneakiest anti-black books I've ever read. Ever wonder why a movie was never made of this so-called classic? I guess the Klan couldn't come up with the money for the special effects.","I read this book when it first came out, and loved it so much I gave it to my father to read, who was a little puzzled about what was going on. Larry Niven's view of who will live and who will die after the Big One (whatever that Big One might be) presented several ideas that had never occured to me. For instance, the big strong men die soon - the small brainy guys make it (I wonder if Larry is big strong or small brainy). While everyone is trying to save canned goods, some clever folk fill \"the blue van\" with black pepper and liquours, cinnamon and stockings, and the main characters dream of finding the van from then on. I learned from this what to grab when the Big One comes for real. I am haunted by two very touching images from these pages. Two characters start throwing books into Zip-lock bags, to save for the future, and have to choose what books to save. And one of the brainiest survivors has diabetes, and can't save himself.One of the most charming aspects of this long long book when I first read it was its use of pop culture, referents to what I felt only we, the hippest of the young, knew. These referents were very current and of the moment when the book was written. Thus they are tremendously dated now. So that's too bad. But otherwise, Niven gives us plenty of specific things to do to prepare, and lets the good guys win, thus helping us feel that certainly we'll be clever enough to make it. I always find that soothing in a post-apocalyptic novel.","We've heard it all before: a killer comet is on the way and the Earth is doomed. A scenario with dozens of variations in books and movies, and we are still a sucker for them. While the book starts off rather tediously with prolonged introductions to all major, many minor, and a hanful of incidental characters, stick with it and you won't be disappointed.The comet, called \"the Hammer\"(a pun on the discovering astronomer's name, \"Hamner\"), is the catalyst that gets this story going, because it is really a story of survival, and one of the better post-apocolyptic stories I've yet encountered. Once the comet is prepared to strike, the action gets rolling and never stops. Our various heroes and heroines struggle against the odds to escape flooding coastlines, battle through unspeakable conditions, and make their ways to shelter. In a location of soldity and relative safety, scores of survivors, over a period of perhaps a year or so, learn that all civilization is based on food, shelter, and safety. They form a new government that is in fact the oldest kind, and eke out a successful community. The survivors must deal with treacherous weather, the horrors around them, death, and even madmen and cannibals before it is all over, leaving them a contented, flourishing community not unlike pre-Roman Europe.Along the way, you find characters, as always, to like or dislike. (My personal favorite being Harry the intrepid Mailman). If I could find any real faults with this epic book, I would first say that it is much too short. Just as the story was really going from exciting and fascinating to something you wanted to read more about, it ended. What a TV series this might have made - and still could make.","My second read of the book twenty five years later reminded me again of the quality of both the story and the writing. It leaves one wondering what would really happen after a major natural disaster, large act of terrorism or even an major attack by another nation.The rapid decline of law and order and civil behavior is not stuff of racial bias but rather documented (thankfully on a much smaller scale) in the riots in LA, near breakdown of civil order after earthquakes in both Northern and Southern California and the events of Katrina.Twenty five years of history only made the story more believable. If written today it might well be inner city Hispanics banding together. Regardless of race we have become a society where an overwhelming percentage of people are not intellectually or physically prepared to deal with a world even temporarily without Starbucks and 7-11.As others have noted the story starts slow, like building the foundation of a building it only seems that nothing is happening. The foundation serves the rest of the story well and early patience is well rewarded.The struggles, the characters and the reemergence of civil structure adds depth to the story.Highly recommended.","For over 40 years I have read fiction, biographies, travelogues, etc. - nearly every type of literature. Lucifer's Hammer remains the best single book fiction novel I have ever read. It's not what I would consider pure science fiction - with an \"alternate reality\" factor of a Well World or even a Star Trek - it's more along the lines of a Tom Clancy novel where everything is generally plausible, but then has the characters react to a fictional event. Science is a huge part of the novel and done exceedingly well (\"sundae\") - but isn't the critical factor of the novel - this is much more of a character development effort.The best way to read the novel, as with Tom Clancy, is to continuously ask yourself, \"what would I do?\" While the protagonists may not do what you would do, the continual re-examination of the current situation based on what did happen is a great intellectual exercise by itself. Simply put, this novel makes you think. December 31, 1999 did make me think about Lucifer's Hammer - as did September 11. Any book that makes you examine yourself, your priorities, and your moral relevance - regardless of the actual plot - is the mark of an excellent work of literature.Dated? Sure - but if that's what's holding you back, then don't read Gateway, The Andromeda Strain, or other fantastic novels that use some general timeframe as their basis.By the way, if you're wondering what I think the best multiple book fiction work is - it's the Well World series by Jack L. Chalkner. Weigh that against what I've written above.","In Lucifer's Hammer, authors Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle team up once again to define humanity under pressure.The Hamner-Brown comet is co-discovered by Tim Hamner, a millionaire amateur astronomer. When the comet seems like it may hit Earth, it is dubbed \"The Hammer.\" But the chances are slim, so slim, that it will actually hit.Then it strikes. And civilization as we recognize it changes.This story follows Tim Hamner and others as they escape Los Angeles and find \"safety\" in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. In such a catastrophe, which elements of civilization persist, and which elements disappear?Each chapter begins, in italics, with either an overview of the comet and its path, or a physical description of Earth's oceans, lands, and climate trembling under the blow.I must admit that I felt a bit uncomfortable with the authors' decision to make the majority of the \"bad guys\" black and the majority of the \"good guys\" white. I suspect, if it was written today, that Niven and Pournelle would have made some alterations to the racial mixtures of all groups. The relative absence of Hispanics in a book centered on Southern California is noticeable!I've read this book maybe 4 times. The harrowing escape from LA following \"Hammerfall\", the \"reaction\" of Earth to the strike, the development of an alternative civilization, and the battle for the power plant are all thrilling and interesting components to this story.","Every summer I put on my reading list a book that I read back in my college days. I first encountered Lucifer's Hammer in 1981 and the second time around I found it just a engaging as I remember from all those years ago.First off, if you are the overly sensitive political correct type, you'll probably find something on these pages to express mock outrage. Too bad, for you'll miss a great story. There are a number of stereotypical characters here, pretty much every main character exhibits outrageous behavior somewhere during this tale.And why not? It's The End OF The World and people are grappling with new realities. In Lucifer's Hammer, it is human storytelling of how they adapt that sets this book apart and makes it one of the great disaster novels of all time.Others have commented that the first 100 pages or so are slow. I believe this is a function of comparison....that the later part of the book is so griping that it makes the first part appear slow. However, on it's own I found the introduction of the characters and the build up to Hammerfall to be interesting as people wake up to the crisis they could face.For all their later prodigious output, Niven and Pournelle were never able craft such an engaging tale as Lucifers Hammer.","Wealthy amateur astronomer Tim Hamner discovers a new comet, which he dubbs Hamner-Brown. Discovery of the comet spawns a television series about comets, which, combined with the exhortations of an evangelist, fuel global fears about a comet strike. However, JPL calculates an orbit that has it passing near, but missing Earth. A Californian senator seizes the opportunity for publicity to loudly support a joint manned American/Russian spaceflight to study the comet, nicknamed \"The Hammer\" by the media.JPL's scientists are shocked to learn that outgassing from the comet has misled their instruments, and \"The Hammer\" is, after all, on a collision course with Earth. The comet breaks into smaller pieces as it enters the atmosphere, and several worldwide strikes trigger massive tidal waves, earthquakes, and volcanoes. Devastation reigns all over the planet. Following the strike, survivors must endure weeks of rain that causes worldwide flooding, overwhelming dams and levees everywhere. Survivors must also endure cannabalistic zealots that have banded together under the aforementioned evangelist and a heavily armed militia that is fighting for world domination.Great reading from beginning to end - good luck getting a good night's sleep until you've finished it.","This book tells the tale of how events might unfold after a catastrophic comet impact takes place. While saddled with some standard clichees of the genre (such as two-dimensional characters), it does contain a fascinating view of what life on Earth might be like after such an event. Originally published in 1977, much of the technological trappings are dated, but it's still a well-written page turner of a story.Some of the discussion of race in this book is definitely pre-PC, and left me a bit taken aback, but overall it's a worthwhile read for fans of sci-fi genre fiction.","The authors start out with multiple threads and by late in the book has woven them together into a single plotline. The best part of the book are the occaisional bits of humor. I did feel some empathy for the male and female leads and in any book I read, this is a good sign.","I love books and movies about the end of the world, I don't know why but I do. &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle tell about a comet heading for earth. The authors give us characters from every different social group and how the diaster effect them. The books is dated in some parts the reader is easiler able to over look this. The only reason that it didn't get five stars from me is the ending could have been a little stronger. But overall still a great book.","There have been so many reviews accusing this book of being racist that I guess I'll have to address that issue before I can even talk about my opinion of the book. What a lot of people don't seem to realize these days is that there's a differnce between portraying racism (e.g. in a novel) and actually supporting racism. In my opinion Niven and Pournelle weren't trying to stereotype blacks or make any kind of political statement, they were simply depicting something that could likely take place. It's not all that far fetched to believe that an inner city LA gang of African-Americans would band together after an apocalypse and might hook up with a radical fanaticist army promising them power, plenty to eat, and no racial barriers. And they weren't the only ones doing this. As I remember, they weren't even the ones who started the cannibalism. That was an army platoon mainly composed of white guys who did that, and forced everyone else to come on board or else starve or be killed. As I see it Niven and Pournelle gave a fairly accurate depiction of race relations as they stood in 1970. If I thought they were deliberately targeting one group or another and trying to negatively stereotype them, I could just as easily complain that this book is biased against Christians since it displayed the leader of the cannibals as an insane preacher. But I don't complain because I know they weren't trying to take potshots at Christianity, they were merely portraying what could happen, same as they were portraying what could happen to an inner city gang after the end of the world.That being said. I do think that this book was one of the best end of the world stories I have read yet. It is riveting and you won't be able to put it down after the Hammer actually falls. In these kinds of stories I always like best the parts about what kind of society would develop after the apocalypse, and I thought this portrayal was very accurate. The cannibalism (far from being a racist device against blacks) is probably an accurate picture of what some people will be forced to when all the food is wiped out. And the new feudal system which quickly develops is almost certainly the way things would have to be structured for survival and protection, in the early days at least.I would give one warning. The book is not at all interesting until about 100 to 150 pages into it. It moves very, very slowly at first as the authors introduce each of numerous character in depth. You will probably need to use the character list in the front of the book just to keep everyone straight at first. I almost gave up on the book at first, but trust me, every character is important and will figure into the story at some later point. This can be a clue to the plot if, when you're being introduced to a character in the beginning, you think about how they might figure in later. At any rate, the action greatly picks up and doesn't let up from the moment the comet hits till the end of the book.If you're a fan of apocalyptic fiction this is a must read. It's a classic in the genre on the same level as &quot;On the Beach&quot; or &quot;A Canticle for Liebowitz&quot;.","I just finished &quot;Lucifer's Hammer,&quot; and, well, I'm impressed! Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle have done a wonderful job in weaving a tale of excitement, fear, devastation, fear, desperation, and hope. This is 5-star sci-fi all the way!If all you read is the first 100 pages, however, you probably won't agree with that. You see, the first part of the book is a bit slow in getting moving, but that's because the authors introduce a whole string of characters that interact with one another as the story and the action unfolds. And once the action starts, it doesn't stop. In fact, it makes you want to store some food, some water, some other things...and get ready for what COULD happen.As I started reading this book I thought to myself, this book has many similarities with the movie &quot;Deep Impact.&quot; Was I ever wrong with that assumption! This book goes way beyond &quot;Deep Impact.&quot; It goes beyond it in that this book is not so much about events surrounding a comet-earth collision as it is about the aftermath, and how people do or do not cope with that kind of calamity.Imagine this...world-wide cataclysmic events wipe out the major governments on the planet -- national, state, and local governments collapse, and people are left to fend for themselves. What will they do for food, shelter, personal safety, information, etc.? It's a whole new ballgame out there! The kinds of challenges described in the book bring out the best in some people, the worst in others, and trapped in the middle of everything that's happening are the characters you'll come to know quite well.The characters are, for the most part, believable, the plot development is rivetting, and the conclusion is satisfying.Do good guys always finish first? Do they even survive? Read &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; and find out -- if you dare...The authors really did their homework on this one.5+ stars all the way for feasible, believable sci-fi.Good luck out there...Alan Holyoak","Stephen King's 'The Stand' was virus, Robert R. McCammon's 'Swan Song' was nuclear, Thomas Disch's 'The Genocides' was alien plant growth, Walter J. Williams 'The Rift' was earthquake; and 'Lucifer's Hammer' is annihilation by comet. Each of these books are 'must have's' for fans of Apocalypse Fiction.The major protagonist is Tim Hamner, a rich-boy with nothing to do but indulge his fascination with the stars. Hamner, along with a young boy named Gavin Brown from Iowa, discover a comet heading towards earth. The comet, Hamner-Brown, soon becomes known as The Hammer, as scientists plot its course closer and closer to Earth's orbit.Hamner makes acquaintance with Harvey Randall, a news reporter who wants to make a documentary series on the comet. Joining with them is Dr. Charles Sharps from the Jet Propulsion Laboratories, Senator Arthur Jellison and his daughter Maureen, Dr. Dan Forrester, an astronomy Phd and computer programmer, a team of astronauts, and a dedicated postal worker named Harry Newcombe.The story centers around Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley, after pieces of the \"calved\" comet hit all across the world, causing first earthquakes and then a massive tidal wave to hit the Los Angeles basin. Senators, rich men, thieves and killers are suddenly made equal in the wake of Mother Nature. Rich and poor take on a whole new meaning in a society that suddenly has different values and different needs.Senator Jellison owns a ranch in the foothills of the Sierras, and along with his neighbor George Christopher begins to form an aftermath society bent on survival at all costs.The good points of 'Lucifer's Hammer' are the characters, the topography staying fairly true to form, the realism of many of the needs and behaviors of an abandoned society (especially the herding behavior) and the many points of view from all the different types of survivors.The bad points would be some flat spots in the prose, some outdated notions (since the book was written in 1977) and too many circumstantial meetings.All in all, this is a great book, and again, a must have for any fans of Apocalypse Fiction. Enjoy!","This novel will be a tough one for faith-based people. The comet that destroys the earth is a starkly \"random\" event. One more orbit, one less piece of debris, and we could have had a miss. I enjoyed the science aspects of the book, which is unusual for me. Almost all the astronomy is clearly presented and easy to understand.\"Lucifer's Hammer\" is the first apocalyptic novel I have read that takes up famine as a major factor in surviving. It is explained convincingly and is horrific in its implications. The general behavior of the survivors (poor) seemed much more realistic to me than the God-like heroism in most such novels. Cannibalism would not be unusual at all, but it would probably be done in a clandestine way, everybody's \"dirty little secret,\" not an article of faith, as depicted in the book. The horrendous geographical upheavals-earthquakes, tidal waves, and volcanic eruptions are handled expertly and realistically.The start was slow and the setting of characters was haphazard. There were too many, and the similarity in names was confusing: Hardy, Harry, Harvey-and the two major females Maureen and Eileen-give me a break here! Some reviewers have painted the authors as racist, particularly objecting to a black leader flaunting cannibalism and discussions of \"slaves\" in the new world order. No one black, white, yellow or brown behaved with complete honor or integrity. It is realistic to imply that no one performs well when they are terrified, whatever their racial makeup. A good point was made when one character vehemently objected to the use of the word \"slave,\" but agreed that \"prisoners of war\" would have no rights and would have to undertake the most menial and disagreeable tasks. Ah, what a difference a \"word\" makes!The paperback copy I purchased (new) fell apart, so I now have a collection of unbound pages. Most irritating. I found the writing somewhat uneven, often the case where there are collaborators, rather than one author. Overall, \"Lucifer's Hammer\" is a rewarding read, clear in its intent, and often thought provoking.","I'm 52 and I first started reading this book in 1984. Since that time I have re-read it many times. when ever I find a friend who hasn't read it I'd buy a copy at a used paperback store and give the copy to them. Lately I have been unable to find it anywhere. Now to see that it has been re-released I will be buying 2 copies, one to loan, and one to keep. This is the best &quot;end-of-civilization&quot; book ever written. It should be a primer for anyone trying to write anything called &quot;Comet&quot; or &quot;Impact&quot;.Keep in mind, for those of you who haven't had the pleasure of reading this book yet, there are a lot of players in the drama and it takes a while to introduce them all. So give the book time. When it takes off though make sure you don't have any plans because you won't be able to put the book down. I mean really!Enjoy it. Read it again and again. It only gets better with time!","This is a monstrous, massive novel about what happens when a comet slams into the earth. About 17 years ago I was saying to someone that I thought Stephen King's THE STAND was the best end-of-the-world book I'd ever read and then was recommended LUCIFER'S HAMMER. They weren't kidding. This book has some of the most jaw-droppingly awesome descriptions of worldwide destruction ever committed to paper. After watching the Boxing Day Tsunami wipe out 250,000 people and after witnessing the Drowning of New Orleans it is impossible to read this book without thinking of those recent disasters.LUCIFER'S HAMMER is filled with memorable characters and an epic scale of destruction and struggle. It ranks among the top 3 epic post-apocalyptic novels alongside THE STAND and SWAN SONG. It has everything; its like the Mother of ALL Disaster stories wrapped around a war/adventure/struggle for survival tale with an army of cannibals as the last major villains. How can you beat that? Unlike THE STAND and SWAN SONG there are no fantastical elements to LUCIFER'S HAMMER, just dirty, savage fighting for the scarcest of resources.","I first read Larry Niven's and Jerry Pournelle's apocalyptic novel &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; when it was released in 1977. Raised on the popular disaster movies from this period (which undoubtedly inspired this book), I remembered thinking this epic novel would make a fantastic movie. I had the good fortune of re-reading this book again recently after many years and was pleasantly surprised, if not haunted, by how accurately the end of the world was portrayed. History, in many ways, has eeriely mirrored &quot;Lucifer's Hammer.&quot; From the Rodney King/LA riots to David Koresh to the 911 terrorist bombings, Niven and Pournelle have done an extraordinary job in creating an account of what just might happen if modern society was confronted with a complete end-of-the-world scenario. This book, while dated in many ways, has withstood the test of time.A comet is discovered and as it comes closer to earth, it becomes apparent it may strike our planet. An American/Russian joint expedition is quickly sent into space so the comet can be studied as it passes. The first third of &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; introduces 20-plus protagonists, developing their characters prior to the disaster. All of these characters have similar traits in that they cannot imagine the comet will hit the earth, but they make rudimentary preparations just in case. When the comet does indeed hit the earth in multiple places, causing gigantic tidal waves, earthquakes and destruction, &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; follows these characters' lives as they attempt to survive in a society without law enforcement, without electricity, without adequate food. Some of the most exciting passages deals with the comet strike, witnessed from multiple angles though most memorably from the joint American/Russian spacecraft. The stunned astronauts shockingly view the disaster, the growing cloud cover, the tidal waves and a nuclear war which erupts between China and Russia.As pandemonium strikes, these characters do whatever they can to survive. Cars are stolen, people are shot, and everyone scrambles for high ground as the tidal waves and rain drown everything in sight. The final third of the book deals with the pockets of civilization that slowly form. Small strongholds are built, roving groups resort to cannibalism, everyone looking for safety and food. Like castles in the Middle Ages, these groups form warrior-like bonds, with leaders forced to make tough decisions, fighting off stragglers and armies.Much of the criticism of &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; has dealt with its portrayal of black people, most notably that of Alim Nassor. A former Black Panther and a full-time thief, he gathers his friends together after the comet strike, adorned in a full-length mink coat, spouting ghetto slang and doing whatever he can to survive. He bonds with a band of cannibals, eventually led by a Jim Jones-like quack. They begin sweeping the countryside, raiding, looting and murdering. Granted, it's a bit uncomfortable reading these passages, as society has not only become a huge race war, but a class war. The stronghold they eventually lay siege to is made up almost entirely of caucasin residents, educated, wealthy and determined to survive.When attempting to understand human culture, all one has to do is view a normal high school cafeteria. The pockets are abundantly clear as people bond by class, by status, by culture and by race. If earth was faced with the kind of disaster so realistically portrayed in &quot;Lucifer's Hammer,&quot; undoubtedly pockets of survivors would form in such a fashion. When there is no food, people will begin to kill for it. The groups they bond with would be people of similar race, similar class and similar status. In today's politically-correct society, it is uncomfortable reading a book like &quot;Lucifer's Hammer.&quot; But there is not a doubt in my mind the wars which take place in this book would indeed happen.A scary, fascinating work, &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; has remained in print for many years because of its uncomfortable realism. It is not a perfect work, with stilted dialogue and a few too many characters introduced and in many ways forgotten, but it is one of the finest of the apocalyptic genre.","Have to join the group of voices here stating that this is an excellent &quot;end-of-the-world&quot; tale. The characters are fairly well developed and the action is well paced. I especially liked the chapter of &quot;snapshots&quot; of what happened when the comet hit and the italized asides throughout the book that described geographical and political results of the impact. These details are what draws one into the story and helps you visualize the magnitude and scope of such a disaster. (While not profound, I first read this book when I was in high school and one of the images that had stuck in my mind for over 20 years was that of Gil trying to ride out the tidal wave that hit Los Angeles.) In fact it was that tease of a memory that made me look in the bookstores for Lucifer's Hammer so I could re-read it again. I would have rated the book 5 stars exept for the last 3 pages. It really feels like after building up to a climax that Niven and Pournelle had never really agreed on who was going to write the conclusion.....and the book ends quite abruptly with a really unsatisfactory summary. I would have preferred that they added an additional 50 pages to flesh out was what discussed in these 3 pages (......maybe some year a sequel?) All in all, despite my personal complaint about the ending, a good read that I would highly recommend.","Maybe it was seeing the compelling original cover art for Stephen King's \"The Stand\" in my parent's book collection when I was five. Maybe it was the siren tests of the local fire station that I somehow always associated with nuclear war. Maybe it was all those old rusty yellow signs I saw on buildings in NYC, with the radiation symbol and one word \"Shelter\". Maybe it was even watching Jan-Michael Vincent and George Peppard ham around my TV screen in \"Damnation Alley\". Maybe it was all those reasons, but growing up I always had a fascination with \"End of the World\" stories. For years, I have read \"The Stand\" again and again. I bought World War III novels right and left, reading them all. I have watched classics like \"The Road Warrior\" and \"The Day After\" and bad ones like \"The Ultimate Warrior\" and \"Ravengers\". Hell, I've even made up a couple of listmania lists on the topic, and it was in researching them that I came across \"Lucifer's Hammer\".How I managed to miss this book for all these years is quite beyond me. The book, though, is a pleasant discovery and a complete revelation. Written by science fiction greats Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, it is a fantastic and fantastically ambitious novel about (obviously enough, if you haven't been skimming this review) the end of the world. More than that, it is a page turner, possessing that magical \"je ne sais pas\" quality that makes bands into legends, actors into stars, and books into pop culture. As surely as a John Grisham novel or Tom Clancy techno-thriller, \"Lucifer's Hammer\" compels the reader onward, heedless of time, hunger, or any constraint that would dare suggest putting down the book.The \"Hammer\" is a comet, delivering the one type of cataclysmic destruction we could reasonably expect to face in our lives. A key trick to the novel is the sense of inexorable, unavoidable doom. Up to the strike (and even beyond), there are a number of comet asides, passages that describe the roiling journey of the comet to its date with destiny and beyond. While man built the pyramids, invented the Printing Press, fought World Wars, the comet in its various stages of travel is described, rendering puny and insignificant that which we call our history. When the \"Hammer\" falls, no detail is spared in portraying the full scope of the horror unfolding.I've always felt \"end of the world\" fiction has fascinated the general population for a couple of reasons. We certainly live in an age where it could happen in an instant, but also because (like a moth to a flame) we are curiously drawn to something so vast and alien, it is beyond our ability to grasp. These works offer us a small glimpse and insight into the concept of \"global holocaust\". In this respect, \"Lucifer's Hammer\" is truly one of the giants in this genre. It is bleaker than Stephen King's \"The Stand\", which had at least the assurance that God did exist, but \"Lucifer's Hammer\" is not without its version of hope either. Faced with annihilation, Niven and Pournelle have a complete cast of fleshed-out and well-written characters whose triumphs and defeats we don't just experience, we feel. There is no promise of victory or survival for these characters, but we empathize with their struggle to not simply pass on without a fight.\"Lucifer's Hammer\" hits home as a believable work of what might be, and as a meticulously crafted piece of writing. It is well worth a purchase for science fiction and general fiction readers alike.","I read this book in the late seventy's and am still impressed with the writer's and recommend it frequently. I do remember plodding through the first 100 or so pages, but it is well worth the effort to be introduced the various players you will become intimate with later.The society that developes after the \"hammer\" hits is very realistic (scary!) and may give you pause as to the profession you have chosen.I will be reading this again soon just to refresh my memory.","It took me a good while to kick-start this book. I started it and went very slowly. There were a lot of characters and the story was not very clear. I almost gave up on it...The nice surprise came in Chapter 2. All the events described when and after the comet falls were fully absorbing. This book is great entertaining. Its a little outdated (written in the 70s) but it does not matter. Just be patient and \"ride\" the first couple of hundred pages.","This book is by far one of my favorite books that I've ever read. I have read many reviews that complain about the &quot;slow&quot; start to the book. Personally I found that the pace in the first third of the book was perfect. To many books that I've read start out with a bang and never let up. This book refreshingly develops the characters and situations surronding them to an extent that few other books do. By the time that &quot;Hot Fudge Tuesdae&quot; (the impact of a massive comet) arives, the authors have developed the characters to such an extent that their reactions to the events caused by HammerFall illustrate the changes in the way people must now live much more effectively than if the characters hadn't been developed to such a degree.I'm not going to give the ending away, but it is also one of the top endings of any book I've read. It's not a cookie cutter ending that leaves nothing left to ponder. Instead it leaves the reader with much to think about even after they have finished the book.I would strongly recomend this book to anyone who enjoys doomsday or classic sci-fi novels, as well as those who haven't been much exposed to these genres. After you finish reading it, you'll want to start at the begining and read it again (as I did).","I first read this book in 1986, and I'm glad to see it still in print, because I want to re-visit it some 16 years later. It is a true classic-not just your run of the mill sci-fi or fiction. This book has an element of realism to it and is absolutely one of the finest pieces of writing in its genre that I have come across.I first learned of it when reading some material from the &quot;survivalist movement&quot;...people who continuously prepare for a societal breakdown. _Lucifer's Hammer_ was highly recommended as one of the most realistic novels available which would illustrate and drive home the realities of a potential worldwide disaster which would uproot life on the planet. I found it to be true; the authors did their homework. It was fun to think about during the Y2k scare/hoax!In a moment, all rights to private property are gone. What was &quot;yours&quot; one hour ago, now belongs to the first and strongest band of warlords who stake it. I will never forget the band of suburban Boy Scouts who were in the mountains on a camp-out, and their transformation within days from boys to men; roving warriors under the leadership of their scoutmaster.In later years, &quot;Deep Impact&quot; came to the theatres, and seemed to pick up in the spirit of &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot;, in exploring the &quot;impact&quot; of a worldwide disaster.LH is a modern classic. I can't wait to read it again. I still get goose-bumps when I think about those chapter introductions in the beginning giving a graphic description of the &quot;maelstrom&quot; heading toward earth.","When you read this awesome end-of-the-world thriller, you will wonder about how accurate(or farfetched) the movies DEEP IMPACT and ARMAGEDDON(and a few lesser chronic efforts like METEORITES) were. One scientific fact(or rather, speculation) that both movies missed was that if a comet impacted in the ocean as happens in the book, it will rain for months. And the disasters that follow the impact are impressively portrayed here! When a comet is spotted nearing Earth's orbit, the scientists have only a short time to warn the world. Mankind naturally misunderstands. Timothy Hammer is the astronomer who spots the Hammer comet first and its - trajectory, Consequently, NASA launches a spacelab into orbit called the Hammerlab. Post-impact - the combined US-Soviet Hammerlab mission is stranded in space(remember this was written in 1978), survivors form into groups and a feudal system takes precedence in California. The world's geography is affected severely - small snippets tell of the devastation wreaked. I won't say anymore, but that why oh why didn't Hollywood film this book instead of making the other two(plus) movies? This is way more accurate(or rather, best speculative) in its portrayal of man under threat of the end of the world. If you enjoy this, also check out Niven and Pournelle's FOOTFALL.","After watching Deep Impact and Armageddon I was throughly disappointed with how Hollywood portrayed what would happen if doomsday was approaching. I recently read &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; and I will have to say that this is one of the best books i've read in years. The characters are believable and you get the impression that you are actually there with them. The novel rivals Stephen King's &quot;The Stand&quot; and the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series of books that portray the end of the world. I highly recommend this novel.","This book deserves its place with Stephen King's &quot;The Stand&quot; and Robert R. McCammon's &quot;Swan Song&quot; as one of the best pieces of end-of-the-world fiction released in the last quarter century. Authors Niven and Pournelle develop some interesting and sympathetic characters and them pit them against an earth shattering disaster. The scenes of the comet striking the earth are worth the price alone. If the movie &quot;Armageddon&quot; had had one-tenth of the imagination shown here, it would have been one great film indeed.","This book is a masterpiece! It makes all other 'end of the world' senario books look cliche'. This book is brilliantly done, and captivating. A must for anyone who seeks benchmarks in modern literature. You will never forget this one.","I have read (and owned) this book at least five times over the years and find it realistic and insightful. I believe it is so realistic that no one will ever make a movie of it due to the political remifica- tions of todays reciepients of &quot;War On Poverty&quot; government largess becoming tomarrows looters and cannibals. Charalton Heston would have to play the Senator.","I read this book probably 20 years ago (before itwas reissued) and it's still my favorite book","Yes, it is \"another\" end of the world scenario books.But it is one, that so many other authors should have taken notes on.Excellent premise, strong/HUGE cast of characters.Several different viewpoints from characters who come from multiple walks of life.","Lucifer's Hammer has been compared to &quot;The Stand&quot; and I compare it somewhat with Robert McGammon's &quot;Swan&quot;. I say &quot;somewhat&quot; as Lucifer's Hammer hasn't the Bibical conotations as the &quot;The Stand&quot; and &quot;Swan&quot;. The beginning is a little slow, but good things should be taken from the start and slowly build up to the pre-splash down. The &quot;Stronghold&quot; is a possibility. While on vacation a few years ago we detoured through the mountains and flats of California near Portersville-great! My wife and I have read -Hammer at least six times and it gets better every time. The life situations that are presented are real-Armies of refugees, Scout camp, helping and fighting, even the mailman was as real as you are. On par with &quot;Earth Abides&quot; if not surpassing that great story.","I read this book probably 10 years ago and it is still fresh in my mind as a book to suggest for others who like a little adventure in their reading. An idea not as far fetched as some would like to believe, it reminds you just how fragile our lives are on this little rock floating around a sun out in space with so much whirling debris. Niven and Pournelle provide us with another thrilling read into dangerous possibilities and how humanity is most likely going to react to it. Strikingly real in its characterizations.","Lucifer's Hammer was a good book, but it starts out too slow for me. The first 100 pages or so are boring.I have not read many of his books but the ones I have read were better than this one. Still, you should read Lucifer's Hammer, it makes you wonder.","I agree that this is the best book of all time. This in spite of the fact that it would at first seem to have two strikes against it: first, all the major characters come from the decadent, anything-goes culture of 1970s California; second, it is a disaster novel, which puts it in a genre which has been mined to death. It gets both of these strikes commuted to balls and hits a grand slam to win the world series. Harry Randall, Tim Hamner, and Maureen Jellison, oversexed decadent slobs that they are, seem positively heroic, ESPECIALLY because of where they came from. The disaster novel theme is turned on its head, as the authors show beyond a doubt that with the help of technology, we can not only survive but TRANSCEND a comet's collision with earth. You'll be turning pages frantically all the way up to an ending guaranteed to bring tears to your eyes. Also, I appreciate the fact that Niven and Pournelle put in an epilogue to show the readers what became of the characters' final decision. I sincerely hope that this story will join the ranks of Hamlet and A Tale of Two Cities as one of the all-time classics of literature.","The first part of this novel is riveting and realistic. After seeing both Armageddon and Deep Impact, all I could do was compare them to Lucifer's Hammer--and both came up woefully short. Women's roles suffer a bit from the '70's perspective, but this is still a gripping story which deserves wider readership.","I have read this book at least 4 times. I recently watched Deep Impact and compared it to the memory of Lucifer's Hammer. Deep Impact came up short. The description of the decay of society, and the evil lurking beneath the surface of many weak individuals is insightful. Ask yourself the question, &quot;What would you do, if you didn't think you would ever have to pay society's consequence?&quot; I believe there are many who only obey the law out of fear of the consequences, far more than those who break the law. Witness the riots in LA after the King trials. Hammer brings it all into perspective. I loaned my copy out and never got it back. Will read it again soon.","This book is &quot;Armageddon&quot; and &quot;Deep Impact&quot; and &quot;The Postman&quot; all rolled into one, written years before any of the others. I was surprised that &quot;The Postman&quot; didn't list Lucifer's Hammer as the novel it was based upon. However, LH is so much more that any of the movies. Social commentary about the dregs of our society turns some liberal stomachs but rings true. Gripping page-turner that will challenge your ability to read a BIG book in one sitting, but you will WANT to.","Far better than the summer movie offerings, &quot;Armageddon&quot; or &quot;Deep Impact,&quot; the novel is a readable story with a raft of characters. The standard &quot;good vs. evil&quot; battle at the end leaves a bit left to be desired. The best writing surrounds the post-impact mess. For fans of the apocalyptic genre, one could do much worse.","i believe this book deserves at least 6 stars I it is a perfect ten it has everything you could want in a book I cant even begin to describe it all I can say is it was ecellent","A bit disappointing for me to read. The overall scenario is great, no doubt but...the characters are only so so and the believability is spoiled by some pretty improbable coincidences.This book is based on the thesis that in a real crisis democratic governments do not work good enough and that people seek refuge in governments by force or by faith. In other words democracy is useless in a crisis. Hmm... maybe there is a point.All in all not a really bad book but it lacks in cohesion in the last chapters somewhat.","I think this was an excellent look at a post-apocalyptic world. I can see influence here for many works that came later, including The Postman. Dated technology but it does not change the story much and it has aged remarkably well, which is the hallmark of great SciFi. I think the female characters are not very well developed, as I saw also in their other team-ups, but it is a minor issue and SciFi from this era was more idea driven than character driven.","The story was kind of a bummer, but I guess there's no real way to depict an event like this without kind of being a bummer. I would recommend this book if you liked Patriots or One Second After.","I read this book and The Hermes Fall a very long time ago. Neither could ever been considered literary brilliance but for some reason both had an impact on me and I will never forget them. The idea of an enormous disaster befalling our way of life ... and \"who\" would survive the apocolypse intrigued me. If the subject also perks your interest - read the reviews by \"real\" reviewers and see if you can find the books.","Apocalyptic fiction is a favorite genre of mine so the discovery of seventies doomsday novel, Lucifer's Hammer was a surprising find and a fascinating read. This story, of a comet striking the earth, is one of the best of this genre, its premise centers around an apocalypse that mankind is powerless to prevent and the aftermath for humanity.The center of the action is in Los Angeles, as well as earth and space. An amateur astronomer discovers a comet that just happens to be heading towards earth. No one believes it's going to hit the earth but as the odds starts to narrow towards the inevitable catastrophe, the populace becomes unnerved. This book really takes the reader on one exhilarating ride.Lucifer's Hammer is a look at not only how mankind might organize and exist if we lost our material comforts but it also delves into the basic character of humans during a global emergency.","Its a good book. If you are a Post Apocalyptic fan it is required reading. It is one of the 20ish PA books that form the core of the PA genre. Look through the discussion boards on PA books and you'll see Lucifer's Hammer is always there.Spoiler Alert:All while I was reading it I kept thinking that it was a cross between The Road, One Second After and Earth Abides. The author many times speaks of banning people to \"the road\" from the Stronghold. I have to think the this could be where The Road author got his title.","Can be a little tough to follow with a lot of characters but the story is entertaining.","Lucifer's Hammer is one of the most realistic end of the world survival books I've read. I tried several others and none rang true. I could see everything unfolding in a real world disaster just the way it did in Lucifer's Hammer.People splitting into two groups: the rebuilders and the takers with a whole lot more of the takers. For me it wasn't about a comet hitting the earth, it was about how people reacted once civilization collapsed. What do you do when there's no more money, grocery stores, electricity, etc?How do you protect yourself when the government collapses? What do you eat when there's nothing to eat? (You don't wanna know...)","Once read you may agree that this has influenced quite a few of the disaster and apocalyptic novels since its publication (The Stand, Swan Song, World Made by Hand) but without any supernatural aspects. The authors keep a large cast of characters moving with clarity and interest. Some good 1970's references like \"honkies\" and telegrams take one back. Overall an enjoyable and well-researched read.","This is by far my favorite book. I had to purchase a hardcover edition for my bookcase.","One of the most well known apocalyptic fiction books.A little slow in the beginning before the comet hits but really picks up during and after the comet strike.It appears the authors must have done their research as several real survival books are mentioned within.I would point out several key scenes in the book that I liked but I do not wish to spoil anything.Well worth reading on many levels."],

      "reviews.text":["2.5 stars. I really wanted to like this novel; it's in the Masterwork series, I enjoyed the Sci-fi mini-series they made a few years ago of the same title, and I love the post-apocalyptic genre. However, this book really disappointed me for a couple reasons.Wyndham is unnecessarily long-winded. This is often a criticism heard from young people today w/ respect to older works. It often engenders a feeling that these young people are too impatient to enjoy these classic pieces. I am not young and I have enjoyed classic sci-fi for my entire life. However, Wyndham is tedious and bland to the point that he ruins whatever tension or drama may have existed in his story. This may be due to Wyndham's lot in life as a British author and a reflection of the times, but I have never felt that his contemporaries' stories bogged down quite like Triffids. The attention paid to innocuous dialogs and trivial details slowed this book down and made me feel like I was following someone around as they got fitted for a custom-made pair of socks, rather than reading about someone coping w/ a global extinction event.Secondly, where are the titular characters the Triffids?? A more accurate title for this novel would be \"Grocery Shopping at the End of the World and the Minor Inconvenience of the Triffids.\" Wyndham does a superb job during the first 40 pages of describing the Triffid's origin and their modern uses, pre-catastrophe. This was my favorite part of the book. However, for the next 200 pages the Triffids make only brief appearances and are ancillary to the main plot. Additionally, there is no drama in the main character's clashes w/ the Triffids. Wyndham's writing style reduces the interactions w/ the Triffids to \"Oh look, a Triffid, well I'll go get my shotgun and blow it's sting off. Then we can get back to talking about groceries.\" Only in the last 20 pages of the book do the Triffids rise up as a menace that can't be ignored. However, even then Wyndham deals w/ the encroachment of the Triffids in such an off-hand manner that I was totally turned off w/ how he handled them.The plot of this book was incredibly imaginative and I love the allegory. I'm thankful to Wyndham for his contribution to the genre, but I can't bring myself to recommend this book on its own merits. I would recommend reading it simply to appreciate how its ideas shaped other works.","I can't understand why this book is on so many \"best SF novels\" lists and so highly rated by other reviewers here. This is not a bad book - the writing is uniformly readable and artistic in spots, and I didn't find it objectionable to read through to the end - it's just that I would never encourage anyone to read it instead of many, many other SF novels. The premise might have seemed compelling in the paranoia-stricken 1950s, but now it seems anachronistic and underdeveloped. Multiple bogeys, the hero and his heroine fighting the good fight against them. In places the musings on the loneliness of the survivor are interesting - particular given the British perspective, with the thought that Americans were somewhat born from the longing for this loneliness, while those that stayed in Europe feared it. Otherwise I found the characters to be near-wooden and unbelievable. A child's parents disappear and her little brother is killed before her eyes, leaving her alone - she has a cry before bedtime and is fine from then on. Please.ReadThe Road (Movie Tie-in Edition 2009) (Vintage International)and leave this one.","An important book from the 1950's, one that I remember affecting me strongly as a teenager. Well worth a read now although a bit stuffy by modern standards.","There's one point that other reviewers have missed.The author represents the traditional left-wing viewpoint quite well. On the surface, he is all bluster about the wickedness of profits, etc. but if you read the book carefully, you will notice that everyone who survives unblinded is middle-class. The workers need looking after by a paternalist dictatorship.Otherwise, I agree with the consensus or other reviewers. It's a great SF read.","It's British sci-fi from 1952, at the threshold of our era of fear of nuclear warfare, biological terrorism, and ecological catastrophe, all of which author John Wyndham foresaw with plegmatic prescience. The tale begins with a global disaster, in which the vast majority of humans and quadrupeds are blinded by atmospheric luminescence, eventually revealed to be the result of a 'mistake' in the Reaganesque orbiting of defensive/offensive weaponry. Right on the heels of one man-made disaster of space weaponry, another strikes in the form of a plague caused by an orbited laboratory virus. Most uncanny and horrifying of all, scientists in the USSR have developed a plant that can walk, hear, communicate vaguely with others of its kind, and kill with venom delivered by a lashing tentacle. It turns out to have great commercial value, as long as it remains under control (Aha! Greed as the root of all catastrophe!), but once it gets loose, as the Brits would say, it's a bl**dy ugly customer.The recognition that such perceptions of humanity's self-caused plight were possible in 1952 constitutes the main reason wny anyone might want to read \"The Day of the Triffids\" in 2009. The writing style is thin, the character development is podgy at best, the action is deftly limited to an intensity that wouldn't upset a nanny reading to a toddler, and the inevitable romantic involvement is prudish even by recrudescent Victorian norms. This is not one of the literary masterpieces of science-fiction, not equal to Wells or Stapledon in intrinsic interest, certainly not on a par with Karel Capek's \"War of the Newts\", another tale of inter-species armageddon. But it's not a bad quick read on a long flight.","I'm not so much for long narratives, and this book is one of them.The story is about the aftermath of meteor showers as a lot have thought them to be. Almost all people went blind except for a few. Recovery was initiated by small groups, but the triffids, plants who seem to have a mind of their own slowed the process. The story mentioned 6 years since the tragic circumstances started. Even after this time, triffids were still abounding, and man was still fighting to eradicate them. That's where it ended, with a few words to give some glimpse of hope into the future.For all it's long narratives, I was still left wanting at the end. The chaos was still there, albeit an organized chaos. Nothing has changed except that there were now more people (babies conceived and born after the tragedy). The struggle to fight off the triffids was still there. I believe the lesson that the author wanted his readers to take is that man will fight to survive, and to go on living, he'll make do with what's available for him. The lesson can be gleamed from the story alright, it just wasn't much of a reading pleasure for me.","In my opinion this book isn't quite in the same league as Alas, Babylon, On The Beach, A Canticle for Leibowitz, or Earth Abides, but it is very good and belongs in the pantheon of classic science fiction literature.Some have pointed out the dated feel and attitudes of the book, but I don't mind those qualities. I enjoy getting a window into the sensibilities of the world before I knew it. The premise of the story isn't a problem for me either, even considering the idea of walking, thinking, communicating, killer sunflower plants chasing around a population of blind people. If I have a complaint, it's a mild one: I sometimes wished the author would have been more concise in his writing... some sections were a bit long-winded. Perhaps it was a function of his British station and the period in which the book was written that Wyndham used so much exposition. Still, it's a minor criticism and it didn't affect the flow of the story or my opinion of the book overall.","Over a week passed since I got a message that the books had been sent. I emailed an inquiry, but got no answer. After I received the books, I realized they came from overseas. If I had known this I would have been more patient. This information should be made more clear.The books were in excellent condition and made good gifts.","The book is fantastic and I have recommended it to many people.However, I always tell them to avoid reading the back cover or introduction of this particular edition. Both the introduction and back cover contain spoilers, especially the introduction. I understand that I may be more sensitive to spoilers than some people, but the level of give-away in the introduction is mind-blowing. The entire book is summarized and all the twists are given away.Introductions like this should be considered literary crimes.Nonetheless, the book is wonderful. You should read it - but if you're buying this edition of the title as a gift, find a different edition or insert a note to avoid the introduction and back cover copy until after the book has been read.","Interesting read. Old SF novel that talks about the fears of the time (apocalypse from space). Story is told well but I felt the reaction of the blind people was a little unrealistic in that they were more non-functionally depressed than they were hysterical. The triffids were interesting creatures that were never really explained to my satisfaction.","This is a terrific book, much unlike the 1960's film of the same name. Aside from the triffids, the novel and the film are actually quite dissimilar. My issue is with the RosettaBooks version - I don't know if it's just a Kindle problem (I read mine on a Fire) or if it goes for the print version as well, but my E-book was loaded with misspellings and missing punctuation. It was more a nuisance than anything else, but it's hard to believe that an editor okay'd this for publication. That said, it was still a very enjoyable read. My first Wyndham novel but certainly not my last!","A good book with much food for thought. Tightly plotted and well-written. The proper English was a bit clunky for me and lacked the dry humor of other British sci-fi authors, but overall, I can see why it's a sci-fi classic.","My favorite Wyndham books are The Kraken and The Midwich Cookoos (also known as children of the Damned). This is a really great book.","i was pleasantly surprised by this book. i normally dont like \"old\" books as in books written before the 80s. no offense to them, just usually not into the writing style and even though they were the originals, alot of their ideas are now cliche. but this book, was awesome. sure the dialogue was alittle formal at times but i the author managed to not make it corny w the smart killer plants. definately recommend to all post-apoc fans. it will keep you reading and it is quite well written.","The premise of Triffids seems cheesy enough: venomous tripedal plants stalk the land of England while most people are struck blind by a mysterious comet's emissions. However, when the reader witnesses witty and often insightful writing skills, all cheesiness vanishes and the remnants of a seriously undertaking is revealed. I loved the bucolic English landscape being traversed, much like it was in H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds. Brilliant countryside to visit and travel upon!The opening paragraph has me hook, line and sinker: `When a day you happen to know is Wednesday starts off by sounding like Sunday, there is something seriously wrong somewhere.' Wyndham often finds little nooks and crannies in his salubrious plot to fill with humor, be it a chuckle or an outburst of laughter on my part. It's always unexpected and kept me on my toes while being exposed to the trials and hardships being experiences by the survivors of the ordeal.When the double tragedy of arboreal attacks compounding the widespread blindness surfaces, the Latin quip `In regione caecorum rex est luscus' takes a toehold. Those who retain their sight, through their own personal misfortune yet pure luck, are able to safely traverse the city, scavenge the stores of food and find shelter. Eventually, some of the blind begin to stalk and persecute the able-eyed, shackling them and having them lead food foraging. Wyndham covers a wide range of how different communities come to cope with the tragedy. The able-eyed lead and care for the blind is only one solution.Other solution include a small commune sheltered in a country home, a religious reclusive community behind stone walls, a scientific approach to the problem with emphasis on births and science, or even a militant stance with the vision of assimilating other sects of those with vision. The reader is taken through all of these scenarios and the case for and against each situation is given, which I found to be enlightening. Usually an author has a tight, unshiftable focus and the plot beelines towards a predictable end. Wyndham, however, veers through all possibilities and lets the reader assume the role of judge.Beyond being insightful, witty and enlightening, the vocabulary is graceful and at times sexy (for those with lexiophilia). It's just a steadily hale and hearty, like beef, and full of lipoidal goodness, like butter. As a post-apocalyptic novel, it's dead on the mark with lists of items which need to be hoarded in order to live through the winter and through the years. My only grievance with the novel is the superfluous role the triffids take and the foregone bland explanation for the blindness. The intelligent reader could have constructed a more plausible if not terror-filled scenario for the tragic events. Wyndham leaves a rather acerbic taste on the tongue when the circumstances of the blindness and the triffids are discussed.","Re-reading this after many years, it is good to know that the novel still holds up as one of the all time classics of literature. Less of a science fiction novel but more a story of survival against the odds following the total break-down of society. A grand novel from a master novelist.","I read through this gem the past few days and it was far better than the movies. It does a nice job of character development and situational explanation of the lights in the sky, what happens after and the triffids being \"harmless\" resources man created. Resources that get loose once man is 99.9% blinded overnight.I really liked the speculation on the trees intelligence which added a new dimension, to me, not found in the original movie. I also liked the protagonists assumption that the lights int he sky may have been a sattelite weapon gone wrong. Very different vibe to the movies and for that I enjoyed it a lot.","I know that a book with carnivorous plants sounds like, umm ... well, a bad 1960's Star Trek episode. But, to pass this book by would be a mistake. It is an excellent read. Ultimately the story is a case study of what it takes to make the hard decisions. After a cataclysmic event, do you decide to help humanity or yourself? And, what would the ramifications be for either decision? You may find out that looking after yourself and saying to hell with the rest of humanity might be the only choice no matter how deplorable that may seem. It makes you think. This would be a great sci-fi pick for a book club.","John Wyndham is not exactly a household name, not even among horror or science fiction fans. He did, however, write at least a couple noteworthy books, notable for their cinematic adaptations. The Midwich Cuckoos became Village of the Damned, one of the earliest \"creepy kid\" horror films (inspiring at least one sequel, one remake and one Simpson's parody). The other adaptation would bear the same name as the book: The Day of the Triffids.This short (less than 250 pages) apocalyptic novel begins with a strange comet shower that permanently blinds anyone who looks at it. Bill Masen, in hospital with bandaged eyes, is quickly over his disappointment at missing the shower when he discovers that he is one of a small minority who can see. The old saying (referred to in the novel) that in the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king, turns out not to be true. Bill and the few other sighted people are often too busy struggling to survive to worry about setting up empires.Blindness is not the worst problem, nor is the plague that preys on a lot of the people, particularly in London. No, the worst problem are the triffids, bioengineered plants that are not only poisonous and carnivorous, but also have a rudimentary intelligence and can walk. It's kind of like a precursor to the zombie story: the triffids are slow-moving but deadly and getting more numerous and putting Bill and his small group of allies under siege.As a novel written in the early 1950s, The Day of the Triffids does have a bit of English stuffiness to it, but not as much as some other works from the same period. For the most part, this is a nicely dark novel, one that addresses the dangers of Cold War warfare, particularly the use of biological weapons.","The Day of the Triffids shows its age, particularly in its treatment of the female characters, but is still worth reading because it informed so much of today's science fiction writing. On the whole the characters are long-winded by today's standards and spend more time discussing philosophy and literaure than people in a similar situation would likely do. The triffids themselves are a brilliant bit of imagination by the author. Check it out.","In order to read this book and enjoy it, you have to put yourself back in the time period in which it was written. This is a 'classic' sci-fi novel. Its dated.First of all, you have over reaching elements of early space exploration (Sputnik), the cold war, and limited communication. If you think about the plot and the meteor shower that opens this story and the subsequent blindness worldwide, its sort of stretching plausibility. But if you go with it and read on, your in for a historical treat.Im sure your aware, The Triffids are these carnivorous plants that humans originally planted for the oils they produced. Only when everyone went blind, the plants were able to break out and hunt down the humans. They could think collectively.This is sort of like a zombie novel before Romero and Night of the Living Dead. This is also written as a memoir... from the point of view of a survivor. Its well done and holds up well.","Raising questions of environmentalism, ethics, and structure of society, John Wyndham wrote a frightening tale in \"The Day of the Triffids\". Though some would label this work in the genre of science fiction, I would suggest this book exceeds that label. Like so many of the works of H.G. Wells, this book gives a vision of the future with themes of bio-warfare and mass destruction.Bandages over his eyes prevent Bill Masen from seeing a spectacular meteor shower. When he removes his bandages after the shower, Masen finds most of the world has lost its sense of sight. Meeting few others with sight, he discovers a world that seems to have changed overnight. As a fellow scientist predicted, the major advantage humans held over the mysterious plants known as \"triffids\" was sight. Without sight, humans become easy prey. Maseon is challenged not only to promote his survival, but the survival of others in his charge. A reluctant leader accepts his call during a team of need.Though the plot is well thought-out and the story is well told, I found myself frustrated by some questions that were never answered clearly. The only acceptable justification seem to be that the author was trying to lend the story a sense of realism. Not all questions or dilemmas are answered in real life. Being written as a post-disaster diary, does seem to relieve the author of some duty of explanation. The ending was acceptable, but the origins of the problems remain unexplained.John Wyndham's writing seems underappreciated as his books are not available in most book stores in America. Still, I would highly recommend this book as well as \"The Chrysalids\".","This was the first book I purchased in Kindle edition.I knew all about The Day of the Triffids before I even read the book. It's about how everyone goes blind and plants that attack...right? Wrong. This is so much more, in fact I felt that the Triffids were a bit like extra's in a movie, or a lurking background menace, and presented to the reader not dissimilar to the idea of communism being a lurking menace to the west (the reds under the bed so to speak). This book is more about how people relate to each other in times of adversity, and how generally, it's not very well. Its age gives it an element of \"twee\" which soon becomes lost as you get caught up in the story. You don't have to be a lover of Sci Fi or horror genres to enjoy this book. Any person interested in the human condition would enjoy it.","I am a huge fan of the End-of-the-World genre of books, and there are some great ones out there! One of my absolute favorites is the 1951 sci-fi \"Day of the Triffids\" by the English author John Wyndham. The first time I read it, I was 13 years old in school, reading it during our Cold War/ Disaster literature classes. At the time I preferred The Chrysalids & Midwich Cuckoos, but I was very glad to rediscover this last year and it become rooted into one of my firm favorites.Influenced by HG Well's War of the Worlds, Day of the Triffids has a two tiered plot.... the Triffids are potentially mobile killer plants that have inhabited earth under human control for years. For the most part they have been controlled well and caused very few problems. But the book opens with another seemingly harmless event, (a little reminiscent of War of the Words): a meteor shower. By morning, the effects are devastating: the millions unlucky enough to witness the falling comets are inexplicably blinded, with the lucky sighted few left to fend for the victims - and keep the Triffids at bay.While the people of Britain await American rescue, society changes rapidly. And as they realize that help might not be coming, the small communities of survivors must learn how to keep the Triffids at bay.Superbly written, albeit outdated with its gender roles, Day of the Triffids is still an absolute classic sci-fi and a must for EOTW genre lovers!","I have recently decided to see how many of the movies that I have always loved were based on books. This is the book that got me started. I have shared it with others and we love the comments on society that are very true for today!","For years my only exposure to \"Day of the Triffids\" was the 1962 British filmThe Day of the Triffids, a hysterical monster flick that was fun to watch as a kid. I heard the John Wyndham novel on which it was based, published in 1951, was a far superior science fiction classic dealing with the end of the world. Fortunately, I tracked down a copy and was thrilled to discover the rumors were correct.Wyndham, a quirky British novelist during the post WW II years (he also pennedMidwich Cuckoos (Penguin Modern Classics), later filmed asVillage of the Damned/Children of the Damned), has fashioned an extraordinary, thought-provoking thriller with \"Day of the Triffids,\" easily one of the best entrants into the apocalyptic genre. There's not as much violence as inLucifer's Hammer, and it's perhaps not as profound asEarth Abidesor The Road, but there are emotionally horrifying moments, specifically during the opening passages when the protagonist views hospital patients, suddenly struck blind, stumbling over one another in hopeless panic. Other passages are equally chilling.The protagonist is Bill Masen, a British chap who works at triffid farms. These triffids, a mysterious plant created by the Soviets, have the ability to walk and possess deadly stingers to stun prey long enough to be consumed, akin to a human-sized Venus fly traps. They are now farmed by humans for their precious oils. Luckily for Masen, he's stung by a triffid and is recuperating at a hospital with temporary blindness. A rare meteor shower explodes across the evening skies and witnesses, almost all of humanity, awake the next morning to discover they've been blinded by the light. Masen removes his bandages to find he's the only human left in London with the ability to see. And so begins the fascinating \"Day of the Triffids.\"I was enthralled by Wyndham's novel and could not put it down. It's an ingenious concept and, as noted by others, the triffids are a thinly-veiled symbol of the contemporary fear of growing Soviet power. As Masen hikes across London, he witnesses the frantic attempts of blind humans stumbling down streets to find food. He luckily runs across Josella Playton, a local writer who also missed the meteor show, and they become a virtual Adam and Eve in a nightmarish Garden of Eden. The triffids, meanwhile, run amok as blind humans become an easy source of food.Wyndham only scratches the surface of the horrors of a blind populace, though at night when Masen and Playton try to sleep, they can hear the terrified screams of humanity. It's an ugly world, but Wyndham has wisely left much to the imagination. The recent filmBlindness, based on the famous novel (Blindness) by Jos&eacute; Saramago, takes the idea a step further (in this case, blindness becomes an international plague), though it wallowed in uncomfortable bleakness that became suffocating.28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)has similar opening scenes undoubtedly inspired by this novel.Wyndham's succinct and thoughtful writing beautifully realizes his unique idea. As we travel with Masen and Playton, we discover from their viewpoint an increasingly eroding civilization. The reality of this new world grows even more dour as a military regime attempts to take charge, expecting those with site to work for the helpless blind populace. Thus, those who see become prisoners of the blind and vice-versa, another symbol of Communism.\"Day of the Triffids\" is one of the earliest entries into the apocalyptic genre (not as early as H.G. Wells'The War of the Worlds (Modern Library Classics), of course). Wrought with contemporary symbols of the Cold War, it's never-the-less a timeless work, thought-provoking and unforgettable. It's sad such a mediocre (though amusing) film was made from the book, as Wyndham's novel is truly a respectable classic deserving of discovery. It's a terrific surprise.","I first read an early set of Wyndham books at the encouragement of my eldest sister when I was about 14 and she was a junior school teacher. The set included \"Day of the Triffids\", \"The Chrysalids\", \"The Midwich Cuckoos\" and \"The Trouble with Lichen\". I return to them every few years, often buying the latest imprints to make up for the wear and tear my family seem to impose on books I encourage them to read. In my opinion, John Wyndham, like many Sci-Fi authors was visionary. I love all these books, despite the passing of time and find that they are far better than many modern attempts to narrate similar ideas. My children, nieces and nephews agree!Besides being enjoyable, elegant, writing that does not require 700 pages to convey complex ideas, \"The day of the Triffids\" forces us to understand the fragility of the technological achievements on which our societies are built. It is also topical in the inferences and clear descriptions surrounding transgenic modification of plants, that become ambush predators, then active hunters. I thoroughly recommend this book to everyone. The book is global in reach and the context will become intuitive quickly. The Triffids are not improbable constructs any longer. Indeed human propensity for violence and clever technology, intertwined with greed make the picture clearly painted in the book all too plausible. Buy it and don't put it down until finished, then read it again.","I'm not sure why Wyndham even threw the triffids into this story; they are actually more of a background item. The main theme is 99% of humanity all going blind at once, and the hero dealing with that little problem. The triffids show up once in awhile just to stir things up, but Wyndham really didn't need them to muddy the storyline; he had plenty to work with already.As I recall, the movie version dealt more with fighting and defeating the triffids; here, they are more or less marginal.My only real complaint is that the book ends too soon. He could have done much more with it. Still a good read, however.","If you forgive the author the premise of a weapon from outer space that blinds everyone, the rest of this classic science fiction novel is a prescient picture of our world today.The triffids are plants, but not like any we know. They have been specially bred to solve our need for scarce resources, in this case plant byproducts and oils. They can move though, and they are carnivorous, so they have to be tied down to keep them from escaping and eating us, which they do in some lesser developed regions of the globe.Then a mysterious accident happens so only people who could not see the sky are left with sight. Everyone else is blind. The rest of the story concerns how people survive after the unexpected disaster and how they manage to find a space among the triffids and less moral groups to begin to recreate a civilization.The story reflects the angst of the 50's when new industrial products were producing unexpected effects on the ecology and economy of western societies. But, it could be just as real today. The triffids are a symbol of our willingness to take chances with technologies that offer great rewards but whose costs are not fully understood. For instance, genetically modified corn offers the opportunity for greately increased agricultural yields, but we can't control where it ends up in the food chain. What if it changes our biochemistry in some unexpected way? Well... this is not likely, but you can see how some new technologies might have far reaching unexpected impacts on how we live.A good read. Well written. Highly recommended for readers who want to find hope for after the apocalypse.","\"The Day of the Triffids\" was for many years my favorite sci-fi novel; afterwards it was replaced in that honor place by Dune and Hyperion.I've read this novel when I was a teenager in the mythical Argentinean sci-fi magazine \"Mas Alla\", it was published there as the main story of the inaugural number. I've treasured my collection for more than 40 years.\"The Day of the Triffids\" still stands in my all-time best novels list and I've reread it once every couple of years.It is a typical product of the '50, but with a forceful story line, exploring a post catastrophe world. The drama evolves smoothly, griping you up to the last page; it has a somewhat melancholic background, our known world fading into dust and a new one emerging from the ashes in a pitiless confrontation with the Triffids of the title.It is a novel that fifty years after it was written still catch your interest and keep you going on.In sci-fi not to be dated is a commendation.If the reader wants to have a vivid picture of London in a state similar to this book descriptions I encourage he/she to see the movie \"28 Days Later\".Reviewed by Max Yofre","Great book, really makes you think. Set in England, it has a very english feel and style to it. Wyndham writes &quot;future fiction&quot; rather than science fiction. There's not much science in this book and what occurs in the book does not require a great leap for the mind to imagine it might happen one day. That's what I like about Wyndham's novels, they are so accessable to all types, not just the sci fi geeks.Every turn that the protagonists take makes sense and you are left thinking - &quot;That's exactly what I would do&quot; or &quot;what would I do in that situation&quot;.I think anyone who studied sociology or has an interest in it, would enjoy this book, as several issues are raised.","At first, the thought of plants taking over the world seems a little absurd. But the author managaes to create a &quot;post-apocalyptic&quot; world that is quite interesting. I was hooked through the whole book - from the main character exploring his new world in blindness, to the desperation felt as the end as you hope that somehow humanity will find a way to survive. I had low expectations going in, but it has turned out to be one of my favorites.","A meteor shower thrills the world with a beautiful bright green show. But the next morning dawns with the realization that everyone who watched (all but a very few) is now blind. Bill Masen, a biologist, was in the hospital with his eyes bandaged due to an accident. Bill works with a new species of plant known as triffids, which are cultivated for their oils but also highly dangerous for their carnivorous nature and surprising ability to wander about. They have a deadly whip-like poisonous stinger allowing them to quickly kill their prey and seem to possess some degree of intelligence. As London, and presumably the entire world, sinks into chaos people begin forming into groups. But the triffids are always on the periphery, patiently waiting for opportunities, and they seem to be the only creatures truly able to profit and flourish in this new world.I've had an interest incarnivorous plantssince I was a kid and heard of The Day of the Triffids many times. I thought it was just a cheesysci-fi B movie- I didn't realize it was a book first. I'm not usually a fan of science fiction or horror, but was surprised by how much I enjoyed this story. The description of how the triffids came to be so widespread was fascinating and frightening, and I could imagine myself as a boy doing the same innocent and naive things as Bill. The book remains vague on their origin, speculating they were bred by the Soviet Union, and reflects the secrecy and mistrust developing in 1951 when this book was written and the Cold War was shifting into high gear. (The way the seeds blew around put a creepy twist onWeslandia, a favorite book of my children.)But as an end of the world story the social questions raised are particularly interesting. What is right and wrong when the social order breaks down? Is looting justified? Who should be in charge? What obligation do the sighted have to the sightless? Just how precious is life, even in an altered (sightless) state? And as groups and tribes begin to establish, what moral responsibilities do they have to others? The issue of polygamy is raised to some objections, but even then views differ. The characters also speculate on the meteor shower - was it an act of God, or maybe an accident involving the radioactive weapons then being developed. And as it becomes apparent just how serious of a threat the triffids are, they seem to be yet another obstacle to re-establishing a new civilization... or are they?Another interesting facet, given that the book was written soon after WWII, was the frequent expectation that \"someone\" would come to save them, probably America. TheMarshall Planhad certainly played a large role by 1951, but the book encourages self-reliance as it was likely the US had experienced the same catastrophe. And I noticed a number of reviews here complain of the antiquated view of womanhood, but this is most likely a reflection of the period in which it was written when women weren't as common in the workplace, although one character takes a stand for the untapped abilities of women. I found it odd that there wasn't much discussion on why certain people missed the meteor showers - people always talk about \"where\" they were when tragedies happen - but I guess that probably would have just added a lot of unecessary dialog.I didn't expect to enjoy this book as much as I did. Enough questions are left unanswered and explanations somewhat vague to make it a frightening consideration. It's a clever and insightful look at social conditions and evidently still very influential on many other authors (I was reminded strongly of theGone series by Michael Grant). I listened to the audio book read by Samuel West who does a very good job with the different accents, although his volume goes up and down excessively sometimes.","One night a spectacular meteor shower fills the sky, and everyone who has seen it awakes blind the next morning. For the most part, this science fiction classic follows Bill Masen (who was in bandages during the shower) as he finds his way in this post-apocalyptic world. Add to this a special plant, the triffid, which can walk and attack. But the triffids are no more a concern than the rival governments being established by Bill's few sighted peers and the blind forced to rely on them.I read this on my last work trip and could barely put down. According to the critical introductory essay by Edmund Morris,* in the British Commonwealth \"it has the reputation of being the one science fiction book you must read, even if you don't read science fiction.\" I agree.1. This is a great read. It takes no time at all to get moving, with this excellent opening line: \"When a day that you happen to know is Wednesday starts off by sounding like Sunday, there is something seriously wrong somewhere.\"2. The book is an interesting mix of post-apocalyptic (think The Road but less dark despite the carnivorous plants) and dystopian (as we observe the new orders being established).3. Many of these British survivors are obsessed with Americans. I remember seeing this in the filmIndependence Day(with Will Smith), when the Americans develop a plan and the British say, \"It's about time\" or some such. As Bill and his friends seek other survivors, they found that most other small groups \"waited for the arrival of the Americans, who were bound to find a way. ... The Americans, they assured us, would never have allowed such a thing to happen in their country\" (163). This appears several times.4. Wyndham captures the oppressive loneliness of wandering through this post-apocalyptic world: \"Until then I had always thought of loneliness as something negative - an absence of company, and, of course, something temporary. ... That day I had learned that it was much more. It was something which could press and oppress, could distort the ordinary and play tricks with the mind. Something which lurked inimically all around, stretching the nerves and twanging them with alarms, never letting one forget that there was no one to help, no one to care.\" (169-170)I highly recommend this book. I intend to seek out more Wyndham.* This essay is included in the Modern Library: 20th Century Rediscovery edition. I recommend reading the essay after reading the novel.","I'm a fan of apocalypse stories and this is one of the greatest of all time. But this book is so old that the Kindle version is obviously created from a poor scan. There are no paragraph indents or spacing which makes reading a bit difficult. There are also a BUNCH of typo-type mistakes. For example, it might read \"hut\" instead of \"but\" or \"bill\" instead of \"hill\". Sometimes there are even numbers in there instead of letters. Clearly, the scanner software misread (on average several times per page) an old print. Once you get used to this, and become OK about ignoring the typos (in some places so bad you can't figure out what the words were supposed to be) it is a REALLY good story. Deserves to be right up there with Mattheson's I AM LEGEND, which is my favorite.","Please note that this is not a review of the book itself, which is worth reading if for no other reason than for its influence on the genre.I'm giving this product one star because the Kindle edition is just riddled with typos. Misspellings, text garbled with punctuation instead of letters--it's unforgivably bad and at times impossible to decipher. Skip this one and download something less sloppy.","As if the concept of a strange meteor shower blinding all but a very few members of the earth's population wasn't scary enough, author Wyndham menaces the sightless survivors with a malignant breed of man-eating plants. This book oozes with suspense and excitement with every page. Surprisingly, though it is almost fifty years old, it has aged very well. If you like end-of-the-world fiction, this is one of the best of the genre.","This is an outstanding post-apocalyptic book about survival in a world destroyed by a cataclysmic event and a biogenetically engineered plant. William Masen is in the hospital with his entire head wrapped in bandages. He has been stung by a Triffid, a biogenetically modified plant that was developed in Russia. Standing 7 to 10 feet tall with a large tentacle whip like pad it can quickly kill even large animals with its powerful poisons. They are considered carnivorous even though they mostly eat carrion of the victims they kill. William works at a site where Triffids are raised to harvest their valuable plant oil and he is attacked at work. Two of the horrifying things about Triffids are that they can walk and they appear to have intelligence!While recovering after medical treatment he misses out on the interstellar event of all history. It is a historic meteor shower that encircles the globe and produces thousands of bright green atmospheric flashes that are spectacular to view. The entire world stays out all night and enjoys the amazing spectacle while he sits in a hospital room blinded by bandages. He is lucky!The next morning almost all of mankind (and most animals) are blind while he is one of the few who can still see. Worse than that he is a Triffid expert and realizes that the giant and deadly plants are a lethal menace to mankind, especially when they are blind. He lives in London and he quickly sees the fall of mankind as everyone else is blind and helpless. He knows surviving means avoiding the Triffids and not letting the thousands of people around you become aware that you can see. You are their last hope of survival and you cannot take care of them all...This book, written in 1951 is a masterpiece of Sci-Fi. Author John Wyndham uses a double catastrophic event of the meteor shower and the Triffids to spell the doom of human civilization. A handful of people still possessing their sight cannot protect the blind from starving, disease and the ever present danger of the Triffids. In 1951 the author talks about a biogenetically modified plant long before people knew what biogenetic engineering was really all about.The story line is very good and the character development is deep and interesting. Not only must the survivors try to live but they have to overcome disease, Triffids and the different groups of people who have gathered together to survive at any cost including murder. \"The earth is intact, un-scared, still fruitful.\" Unfortunately the dangers are very high and the chances of survival are very low. Many characters in the book keep saying that they are waiting for the Americans to show up and straighten things out. They refuse to accept that the entire world is in the same predicament that they are in.The author develops different camps of people who set up small communes that range from hyper religious to not much more than barbarism. Groups form based on feudal principles to socialism. This is an excellent book that I was happy to pick up as a daily deal on Amazon. I own the original paperback release and I enjoyed reading it again over 50 years later.This is a wonderful book that I thoroughly enjoyed and I recommend it to you as a very good read!","Well, the book is great, content-wise that is - let's call it a must read for folks enjoying sci-fi. I won't be offering much more in that direction, this review is about technical issue ratherWill just add that for myself, I used to have a paperback copy once, failed to locate it and decided to get this kindle edition insteadIt's my first Penguin e-book though, and I found something to my dislike - I can't switch through to chapters, only page-by-page - at least for Kindle Keyboard (it's v3 I believe). Whether it is the feature of all Penguin e-books or runs true for this particular one only, I have no idea, but just be warnedI would not have found out if it weren't provided with a longish introductory note (Of the kind I never read as this one, for instance, is giving out plot spoilers - not much of an issue as I've read the book before - but anyway) - so I've naturally tried to skip to actual Chapter 1 and found that I couldn't - had to click the page turning button umpteen number of times before I got to the actual textIt still gets 4 stars from me - for the sheer pleasure in reading I remember from my paparback and am now anticipating. One star deducted for this technical deficiency I've described above, and I guess should be applied to this very edition only.","\"The Day of the Triffids\" is ostensibly a dark science fiction tale where civilization has destroyed itself, but really it's a perceptive analysis of human nature, the diversity and range of humans. It's a dire warning as to who will survive (those who are imaginative and willing to adapt) and who will not (unflinching fanatics) in a time of change. More than half a century it was written it's still compelling and readable because it captures so many human truths.","John Wyndham was clearly influenced by H. G. Wells. There is a reference in this story to \"The Country Of The Blind\", and certainly the story itself borrows more than a little from \"The War Of The Worlds\", as Edmund Morris discusses in his introduction to this edition. There are many differences between \"The Day Of The Triffids\" and The War Of The Worlds\" as well. Wyndham's triffids are not the invincible threat that Wells' Martians were, and they are often not the most immediate problem for the characters in the story. The triffids appear off and on for most of the story, as William Masen has to deal with helping the blind, gathering food, disease, and dealing with the chaos of a civilization which has come crashing down.The story opens with William recovering in the hospital, but finding that on the day his bandages were to be removed, that there weren't any people working in the hospital, and that the city itself was very quiet. William had to work with the triffids prior to the disaster, and ironically, they are responsible in a way for his keeping his sight. After removing the bandages himself, he quickly discovers that almost the entire city has gone blind, and that indeed it appeared to be a world wide phenomenon. He manages to find Josella Playton, who has also managed to avoid the loss of her sight, and together they set about finding a way to survive. Wyndham does a great job of bringing the triffids into the story, and then letting them drift into the background, only to bring them forward again for most of the story.Wyndham deals with many issues in this story; including ethics, and the threat of biological warfare. This is a very solid story, and interesting to read. One might think that the fall of civilization would result in a lot more problems then appear in this book in terms of human interactions, but that doesn't harm its overall message. This book was nominated for the International Fantasy Award in 1952.","Many novels have the adjective \"brilliant\" fixed to their name. For some this is justified, for others not. \"The Day of the Triffids\" falls into the former category.The essence of John Wyndham's tale is that a massive meteor shower is watched by most of the world's population. The next day, most of the population wakes to find themselves absolutely blind. A handful miss the shower for various reasons including the novel's narrator, Bill Masen, who was in hospital having eye surgery. His eyes are thus bandaged and the glorious shower is missed. He can count himself very lucky!Coinciding with the shower is the emergence of Triffids; plants that are both extremely poisonous and mobile. They can actually lift their roots and move to another location. Triffids plus near universal human blindness puts civilization and the human race in extreme peril. The modern world disappears as humans revert to barbarism and feudalism. Several theories are tested as to how the comet shower occurred but no one explanation can be proved. The threat to humanity, however, is very real.John Wyndham's novel is now more than fifty years old but still reads wonderfully well. He paints a bleak scenario in which the remaining sighted humans must strive to rebuild a modern world. It is often a battle between good and evil and the resultant victor is not always clear. Wyndham was probably using an analogy for a post nuclear holocaust world. His message is as fresh today as it was during a time of cold war hostility.","It is interesting to read stories that were written 40 to 50 years ago. This one starts fast and doesn't let you go until the end.Just the prospect of almost every one going blind gives me the chill. To be attacked by murderous carnivorous plants is an horror added on terror. This is a story that could be remade in a movie. It could be much better than \"28 days\".Wyndham is very good at describing the different ways that people would react to such an holocaust. The principal character's quest to find his new love is very well integrated with the story.You can almost see the thousands of triffids waiting at the gates for you to come out. Read this book please and if you know a movie producer, give him your book.","The Day of the Triffids is set in the suburbs of England in the early twenty-first century. Bill Masen, the main character, is admitted to the hospital after having survived a savage attack by a triffid, a strange and unusual carnivorous plant. During the assault, the triffid struck him across the face, injuring his eyes. The doctors are making every effort to prevent Bill from becoming blind by performing a risky surgery. Little do they know, they will save his sight more than once. While Bill is in the hospital, the Earth passes through what is believed to be a cloud of comet debris, creating what the press calls, \"the most remarkable celestial spectacle on record.\" However, the beautiful meteor shower has a hidden catch - all who watch it become blind. Bill, who is unable to view the phenomenon due to his bandaged eyes, awakens the next morning to a deathly silence. After removing his bandages, he comes to the awful realization that everyone around him is sightless. He ventures out of the hospital and teams up with a young author, Josella Playton, another lucky person who can see as well. Together they explore the country in the hope of finding more humans who have not been blinded by the meteor shower. Instead, they discover that the triffids have begun to walk and are attacking the blinded humans. The Day of the Triffids relates the story of Bill and Josella's fight to survive against seemingly impossible odds in a world of chaos, violence, and destruction.John Wyndham's The Day of the Triffids is an exciting and compelling novel that will keep the reader hanging on to every word, just waiting to see what will happen next. The plot of the book is farfetched yet understandable and interesting, and leaves one wondering if something so horrifying could occur in the world today. It also makes one think about whether or not our advances in science are actually as beneficial as they initially seem. Is the human race getting too smart for their own good? Wyndham strings together a series of events in such a way that every part of the book is engrossing, and he leaves the reader begging for more.","My father was given this book as a 14 year old, and lost it until a few years ago it was found and returned to him. We both read it now at least once a year, but as i had never seen a copy besides our 1950s edition i was happily surprised to find this page. all i can say is i am buying my own copy right now, and this novel is a must read for anyone who loves true science fiction. Its a battle of man against his own worst nature, and a wonderfully thought provoking read. from the first page the author offers truly well crafted text, and it just keeps on coming. You MUST own this book.","I was initially skeptical that &quot;science fiction&quot; almost fifty years old would be able to keep my interest on the way back from Christchurch, but the sign at Whitcoulls said it was one of their &quot;top 100 books of the century.&quot;What a great read!Wyndham does an excellent job getting us interested by opening with the &quot;crisis&quot; -- Bill Masen wakes up in his hospital room expecting to have his bandages removed after an eye injury, but instead being faced with silence. Thinking he's been overlooked, he ventures out to discover that society has been unraveled.As the story progresses, we learn more on the origins of the Triffids and Bill Masen's connection with them.Wyndham doesn't bog the reader down with the minutae of genetic engineering, but presents enough plausible background to the story that one can enjoy the book today or half a century ago.Wyndham also explores the &quot;what ifs&quot; as society attempts to rebuild itself and debate how it can accomodate the blind into the new society.","It's one of the few Sci-Fi books I actually like. Very well written","John Wyndham was the pseudonym of John Wyndham Parkes Lucas Beynon Harris (1903-1969). This novel is regarded as one of the classics of science fiction literature and was made into a film in 1963 (poorly made). The book was runnerup for the 1952 International Fantasy Award. It is one of the classic examples of the &quot;disaster novel;&quot; or, more specifically, the sub-genre referred to as the &quot;cozy catastrophe&quot; in which a world-wide disaster is depicted in such a manner that the reader doesn't feel too upset and roots for the main character to overcome all odds. This novel set the pattern for many later novels of other authors: a disaster occurs, a large city is depopulated, panic develops, bravery is seen in the main characters, and a small core of individuals strive to build a foundation from which mankind can reestablish his position. (The synopsis given above with the publisher's comments is wrong. Wyndham is not the father of the disaster nove. There were several prior to 1951.) In this particular story, a series of green showers from a comet's tail (we are later told that this may have been a weapon in orbit that had been accidentally set off by an Earth government) cause most of Earth's inhabitants to become blind. Only the few who didn't see the showers (such as the main character Bill Mason who was in a hospital) can see. Later, a plague (possibly originating from a biological weapon) kills many survivors. But, the main malevolent force in the novel are the triffids: carniverous plants that can walk. Bill Mason believes these plants to have been genetically engineered by the Soviet Union and were accidentally released. Now that mankind is blind, the triffids &quot;day&quot; has come. The word &quot;triffid,&quot; first used in this novel, has even gotten into the English language as a term describing any malevolent or obnoxious plant.","I wouldn't suggest reading the book. The only similarities between the two are the Triffids (walking plants), the setting (everyone blind) and some of the names. If you haven't watched the film, or you didn't like it very much, I would most definitely urge you to read this book.What I liked so much about it was the philosophies raised - what is morally correct when society has been destroyed? Is it really *right* to try to help a few people for a short while, or to save yourself and give society a chance to be rebuilt? A great plot, good characters and interesting moral dilemmas.","This novel is remarkable for introducing several ideas, and for setting new benchmarks for other speculative novels. Wyndham doesn't bog himself down in the technical details of the end of society, instead he focuses on the human effects. Perhaps more telling, he allows his characters to muddle about and take their time learning how to live in a decimated world., thus enabling the reader to constantly consider \"What would I do?\" An apocalyptic novel unlike any other","First published in 1951, this intelligent and fascinating novel tells the story of a global cataclysm that results in a world in which most of the population is blind, and all become the prey of flesh-eating plants that can \"walk\" and, perhaps, think and communicate. That brief summary makes it sound like something from a B-grade horror movie collection, but such a characterization would be unfair and inaccurate. Told from the first-person perspective of one of the sighted survivors, the novel quickly establishes a strong narrative voice for Bill Masen as he attempts to understand what has happened to the comfortable world he knew as recently as the day before. He manages to piece the picture together, both from his own observations and experience (he had been employed as a biologist working with commercialized triffids), and from observing and talking with others. It becomes clear that whatever the storm of \"green comets\" was that lit up the night sky, it either was something, or triggered something, that has permanently altered the conditions--personal, social, economic, political, material--under which everyone, sighted or blind, now lives. What is never clear exactly how blindness was caused in most of the population, but that's not really the point. The point is that they are blind, and in this state their greatest advantage over the triffids is gone. Indeed, since the triffids have never had sight, they have an advantage over the newly-blind humans in that they \"know\" (if that is the right word) how to function without sight.Much has been made by commentators about the Cold War context of the novel, and certainly knowing that context can add a dimension to your reading. A population living with the possibility of nuclear catastrophe gets a catastrophe quite different from the one that haunted their thoughts, and yet it is one that grew out of the very competition that defined the Cold War. But even without that context, Wyndham's novel succeeds both as a sociological thought experiment and as a wonderfully told story. One of the questions at the heart of the novel is how (and whether) to build a new community when so many of the conditions, mores, habits of mind, practices, and rules that buttressed the old one have gone. Several alternatives for a reorganized society arise in the days and months following the initial crisis. The pitfalls of most of them become apparent fairly quickly, but the issue remains: most human beings by their nature (or at least by habit) are inclined toward society and some kind of social and political organization, be it large or small. But will people be left alone to make their own way in the new reality, or will some social/political structure be forced upon them by those who have, for good or ill, managed to organize themselves more quickly than others? What is the obligation of the sighted to the blind? And, as a plague begins to spread with devastating effect, what responsibility do the healthy have to the dying? Though the story of the triffids never completely recedes, some of the most interesting sections of the book (for me) were those in which Wyndham's characters discuss--and act out--the tensions inherent in such questions. As Wyndham interlaced the survival story with his sociological and political speculations, I was often reminded of \"Shantung Compound,\" American theologian Langdon Gilkey's 1966 book about his own captivity in a Japanese prison camp in China during World War II. (Gilkey had gone to China to teach English.) One of the striking things about Gilkey's book is his description of how quickly the prisoners went about organizing themselves, though they were largely strangers to one another prior to their internment. Indeed, creating some kind of camp organization was one of their very first tasks. Wyndham's fictional story and Gilkey's memoir draw from the same insights into human nature.Wyndham is able to move the story back and forth from these broad sociological questions to more intimate and personal concerns. At times, the story is essentially a search for love, or at least for a specific human connection that is more powerful than a generalized connection to humanity. One thing the novel is not, however, is a return-to-nature story. Far from it. The pendulum has swung back--from humans moving back the desert and the forests to wild growth retaking former human settlements--but this is seen neither as a form of cosmic justice nor as a chance to return to an idyllic existence based on small agriculture. The presence of the triffids makes the latter option untenable. Don't be put off by the funny title or the premise that may initially be hard to take seriously. Wyndham's novel is serious, enjoyable, thought-provoking, and well worth the time.","I discovered \"Day of Triffids\" when I was around 11 years old... too many years ago for me to mention. It was the first John Wyndham book I read and probably my favorite. It's a close call but another Wyndham book, \"Chrysalids\", is another close contender for that title.I wont waffle on about the story line in Triffids its covered comprehensibly by other reviews. Suffice to say the book is classic sci-fi, mixed with light scary horror and oodles of imagination. It sets the readers mind alight with terrific \"what if\" concepts.Highly recommended.","For a very long time I avoided reading The Day of the Triffids because I thought the notion of flesh-eating plants gobbling up the newly-blind population of England would be the literary equivalent ofThe Little Shop of Horrors(\"Feeeed Meeeeee\") -- so awful that it might be funny, but not to be taken seriously. My bad. I finally read it and I wish I had done so years ago so that I could enjoy rereading it now. The Day of the Triffids is a masterpiece.This is a novel that challenges the intellect. As the story progresses, characters intelligently debate a variety of topics: the nature of leadership, the role of women in a survivalist society (from a 1951 perspective), whether spirituality conflicts with practicality in extreme situations. The book poses moral questions to which there are no easy answers: Should the sighted form their own society, separate from the blind (who arguably would contribute little and drain their resources), to assure humanity's survival? Or should the sighted help the blind survive, knowing that the overwhelming task is mostly futile, that they would merely be postponing the day when triffids will devour the blind, and knowing that they might risk humanity's survival by diverting their attention from efforts to preserve the fittest? When most of humanity is destined to die, should sighted men impregnate as many women as possible to assure that the human race continues, or should monogamy remain the norm? Wyndham provides no easy answers; he raises the questions and leaves it to the reader to decide. Some will dislike that kind of moral ambiguity but the preponderance of five star reviews indicates that most readers enjoy having their minds stimulated by this fascinating novel. I certainly did.The Day of the Triffids works on many levels: as a science fiction adventure, a love story, a morality play, an allegory about the breakdown of societal structures, and one of the strangest visions of the apocalypse ever imagined. It works so well because Wyndham wrote in a convincing voice, using understated prose, giving believable dialog to credible characters. Some are arrogant, some are decent, some are just lost. He wrote about the fundamental emotions of fear, hope, despair, loneliness, and love. The Day of the Triffids has joinedA Canticle for LeibowitzandAlas, Babylonas my favorite post-apocalyptic novels.","Nothing taps into primal fear like the thought of true loneliness. One of the central themes of countless Twilight Zones was the fear of being alone, whether in a post-nuclear world where every one had been killed or one that looks exactly like our own, only without people. From page one, Wyndham taps into that fear and confronts it at every turn. We start the book to discover that the main character, Bill Masen, has been temporarily blinded by a mutant plant called a Triffid that he was essentially caring for. He finds himself alone, in a hospital, bandages on his eyes, completely apart from the rest of humanity who happen to be enthralled by a rare meteor shower taking place at that time. When the celestial event ends, Masen finds himself even more alone, as the voices around him have gone silent. Removing his bandages, he eventually realizes that while he can see, the rest of the world has gone blind. Masen is alone again, this time cursed to be one of the sightless in the land of the blind.From here on out, the story follows a somewhat standard post-catastrophe plot line in which survivor fights his way through a decaying world in an effort to reestablish order and sanity; but while the scope of events may be predictable, the nature of the events as Wyndham unfolds them and the immediacy with which he writes gives the story a horror that easily could have descended into camp. Masen meets friends, only to lose them; finds love, only to lose it. The threat of loneliness- of being a seeing freak in the land of the blind, AND of being a human in the land of the suddenly murderous Triffids- lingers over Masen every minute, whether awake or asleep.\"Day of the Triffids\" is easily one of the more memorable and haunting entries in the post-apocalyptic novel genre.","You won't read this book if you base your decision on a quick summary: \"A mysterious green meteor shower blinds most of humanity, who are then preyed upon by large, ambulatory, three-legged plants that lash long, poisonous, whip-like tentacles out of their stalks. Our hero, spared the blindness by a timely stay in the hospital, finds romance and socio-political insight as he helps rebuild civilization. All of this happens in the UK.\"Suspend your disbelief and read the book. The motivations and actions of people trying to survive are realistic and interesting. And the various philosophies for both individual and group survival are thought-provoking. You will enjoy this story if you have enjoyed any ofThe Stand,Alas, Babylon, orEarth Abides. It is a thoughtful exploration of the fall of civilization and its implications, packaged in an engaging adventure. Good reading.A caution: Enjoying science fiction always requires some suspension of disbelief. Even more so with older science fiction. In this case, the story and exploration of ideas is worth this effort. Don't trouble yourself wondering why the cold of winter doesn't help human beings in their struggle with these walking plants. Or why most of the unstable triffids don't expire in some \"I've fallen and can't get up\" scenario. (Their anatomy as described wouldn't permit them to bend enough to get up from a prone position.) You can find more of these issues if you try. Don't. Not the first time through, anyway. Just enjoy a great story from one of the masters of early science fiction.","This is a wonderfully told apocalyptic tale, as relevant today as it was in nineteen hundred and fifty one, when it was first published. Well-written, with believable characters and dialogue, it is rich with social issues that provide much food for thought.This is definitely a book that has withstood the test of time and remains one of the finest examples of science fiction ever written and a true classic. It is much more three dimensional than the movie that was made based upon the book. That being said, I confess that I did enjoy the movie, which starred Howard Keel. The book, however, is much richer fare.The triffid is a unique form of plant life, with appetites similar to a Venus flytrap, and is believed to have been genetically engineered by the Russians, though its true origin remains unknown. It also is able to pick up its roots and lurch about, almost as if it were walking, and seems to manifest a rudimentary intelligence.Ever resourceful, mankind puts the triffids to work and harvests the rich oils that they produce. The only true drawback of the triffid is that it also has a stem that can lash out and sting a person with enough poison to kill. Still, mankind finds a way to control even this aberration of the oil rich triffid, now viewed as a profitable form of vegetation.Then, came the meteorite shower, a stellar phenomena that lit the sky with a bright green light, but which would, ultimately, leave all those who saw it, forever changed. Those few, who were fortunate enough to have missed the spectacle, struggle to survive in a world that has transformed radically. It is up to them to set right what has gone terribly wrong. Soon enough, however, they realize that the day of the triffids has come. This is their story.","This is a book that shouldn't work, but it does. It is based on two absurd and totally unrelated science fiction premises. The first is the evolution of \"triffids.\" Triffids are a new species of plant of unknown origin (probably artificially cultivated) that, when mature, pick themselves up out of their roots and begin walking around and killing people. The other spectacular premise is that one night there is a terrific \"comet shower.\" The entire world watches it. The only problem is, much like a solar eclipse, if you look straight at it, it blinds you.The triffids have already been around a while by the time of the comet shower. They have become domesticated and people have become bored with them. After the world is stricken blind, nobody thinks much about the triffids, until...I was expecting a schlock science fiction novel about marauding killer plants. What I got instead was a very well-written, literate, thoughtful book about survival and sociology. (Don't be put-off - there are still those scary killer plants.) I was reminded of The Stand and the George Romero \"Dead\" films. The difference is, the rest of the world doesn't have to be killed off - they just have to go blind. It is shocking to think of how collectively helpless the world would be if that happened.The focus of the novel is more on the post-apocalyptic aspect than the killer plants. The triffids do take over the Earth, but it is not a story like I am Legend, in which the triffids are such a threat no one can leave the house. The triffids are relatively week and can be dealt with - but there's so many of them.After reading this book, I am not surprised that it is reprinted by Modern Library. It is a very nice paperback edition with helpful \"reading group\" questions at the end. It is worthwhile to pick up this \"rediscovered\" classic and see what good science fiction is.","I have read this book a number of times in the past 40 years. I've seen movies, and listened to the audiobook. This is one of the post-apocalyptic stories that has had the most impact on me.It isn't so much the plausibility of mobile killer plants: it is the impact on 'civilised' society when the ordinary becomes the extraordinary. This novel can be read as social commentary or as science fiction. It doesn't rely on science or on technology for its impact. It relies on the reader's capacity to imagine a world where sightedness is rare and where danger is in the seemingly mundane.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","After having recently reviewed the film of 1961, I pulled this off the shelf and was utterly enthralled by the story and consistent mood. In contrast to the film, this is first-rate scifi, one in the genre where most of humanity is wiped out and a few individuals are left to deal with the aftermath.Interestingly, the triffids are not alien, though their origin is mysterious, and rather than some monstrous transformation they move to fill an ecological niche that opens before them with the disaster that blinds most of humanity. However, they are just the backdrop to a wonderful exploration of human possibility and its limits, in the bizarre circumstnace that scifi allows. Indeed, there are entire chapters where they are barely mentioned. This is what the best scifi does, convincingly explores a path that is believable and leads to reflection on one's own circumstances.You get few heroics and lots of struggle by normal people trying to survive, as they organize themselves into new groupings and institutions. Thus, the characters are extremely strong and well drawn, good enough for a realist novel. THen, there is the mystery of what happened: this is only speculated about with tantailising hints, and never definitively explained, which only strengthens the basic themes. Every detail adds to the story.Warmly recommended.","I first encountered \"the Day of the Triffids\" when I was ten years old - and can still read it with enjoyment at 59. For me that says it all.Add to this that the book itself was seven years old when I read it, and its quality is brought home even more. Published in 1951, it is still believable in 2007, perhaps more credible now than when it was written. How many novels are there, sf or otherwise, of which this could be said?The triffids of the title are a new breed of plant, produced by some unspecified means as a source of oil. The term \"Genetically Engineered\" was not known in the 50s, but would instantly spring to mind today. Despite their vicious sting, capable of blinding or even killing a man, and the fact they are carnivorous, they are no particular problem until a new disaster strikes. A meteor shower of incredible brilliance draws almost the whole population out at night to watch - and gives off harmful radiation which blinds all those who see it.Bill Masen, temporarily blinded by a triffid sting, spends the crucial night in hospital with his eyes bandaged, and removes them the morning after to find a world gone blind (at least it seems to be the world. Were there no overcast skies anywhere that night? Never mind) and searches frantically for the handful of others who can see. Needless to say, his first \"find\" is female and about his own age &lt;g>. They are faced with a terrible moral dilemma. Do they just clear off and leave the blind ones to (mostly) die? Or should the sighted stay to help the blind - and almost certainly end up dying with them? And of course not all, even among the sighted, are content to leave this to individual choice. There are those prepared to kidnap and enslave the sighted and force them into helping the blind - and equally those who see a not so brave new world with themselves as masters and the blind majority as serfs.If all this weren't enough, the triffids are on the loose. With their deadly stings, they commit mayhem on the helpless blind humans, and soon develop into a major problem even for the sighted, who must search desperately for some refuge which can be defended against them. The rest of the novel is devoted to their finding one.I have a few gripes here and there. Would the triffids really be much threat to sighted people, if the latter had sense enough to wear crash helmets, goggles and heavy coats? And where's the Navy? Did every submarine in the world surface to look at the meteors? I'd expect a sub or two to come moseying up the Thames before too long. Quibble, quibble, Mike.And was that plague just a leetle bit too convenient? Masen is agonising about whether to stay with the blind party into whose service he was kidnapped and \"drafted\" when a germ or virus comes along and gets him off the hook by killing them all. Bit of a cop-out there?I also feel that Wyndham made a mistake, later, in implying that the \"comet\" was a secret weapon that went wrong, and the meteors an official cover story. I don't trust government either, but this doesn't really fit the facts. Were it so, those in the know would surely have taken shelter, and ordered Army and police to do the same. Yet there's no sign whatever of this having happened. No mention of the Royal Family, Cabinet, or Armed Forces, who evidently all went out and got blinded along with the rest. Even for a British government, that's an improbable degree of stupidity. While fully sharing Wyndham's distrust of the Powers That Be, I feel we have to acquit them of this particular crime.Finally, though appreciating how Wyndham liked his disasters \"cosy\" and localised, I'd have liked to see just a little more (either in this book or the sequel he never wrote) about how the world at large was getting on. Was everywhere as badly hit as England? Being plants, the triffids wouldn't fare too well in deserts, so Americans and Mexicans might hold out in the southwest, and the Moslems (Oh dear!) in N Africa and the Mideast, while the sighted Australians could retreat into their arid interior. Dry grasslands might also be unsuitable, and even if triffids could live there, a human would see them on the horizon long before they got near enough to detect him, so on steppes or prairies, or even in the Scottish highlands, human and triffid would generally meet only when the human wanted it. These, rather than the Isle of Wight, seem to me the \"best hope of mankind\".But enough grousing. It's a really great novel, rivalling \"Earth Abides\" as the classic post disaster yarn. If you haven't read it, you are missing out big time!","The world experiences a series of calamities which are somehow unrelated; this is somehow disappointing because they are so extraordinary and feed off each other that to not link the sequence of events more unbelievable. The two major fiascos that bring the world to its knees are a nightfall of comets that blind the bulk of the population who watch the spectacle, and the explosion of a type of mobile plant, which has a tendency to kill or blind humans (but for no particular reason, they don't eat them). These man-killing hedges are possibly man-made in origin, imported from Russia, and are grown for exploitation and amusement... that is until the world is rendered blind and the plants gain the upper hand! Those heartless bushes! With their whip-like toxic appendages they start wrecking havoc on the hapless populous by striking them dead and adding to the body count. Add to this the forced enslavement of the sighted to the greater population of the blind, an unrelated intestinal disease that kills off the blind, and the wry British humor as the narrator encounters very silly people trying to survive (are the British really this disaffected?), and you get a classic sci-fi novel that has been borrowed from liberally by better authors. For my taste, if you want to experience mass blindness, read Jose Saramago'sBlindness (Harvest Book)and for surviving man-killing foliage, try rentingLittle Shop of Horrors, I prefer the musical to the B-movie from the 1960's. Read this one for laughs; was it intended to be a comedy?","day of the triffids would have to be one of the best zombie books ever written without there technically being any zombies actually in it.","Somehow, an astronomical event has caused the overwhelming majority of the population to become blind.If that wasn't bad enough, mobile, dangerous plans called Triffidsare able to take advantage of the disdavantage. Without sight humansare extremely vulnerable to these predators.The narrator avoided blindness, by being in a hospital with bandaged eyes.From there, we have an examination of this disaster scenario, and what would happen.","Before there was Doom, or Aliens, or Night of the Living Dead, there was the Day of the Triffids. Written at the beginning of the Cold War, this sci-fi drama explores the fate of a human society where the masses are blinded (literally) and being stalked by predatory plants. The latter were created by the Russians (of course) thru genetic experiments. When comets pass by Earth and blind the majority of the human race, the triffids get loose and start feeding on humans.The book is a quick read; easy to follow and quite exciting. I first read it years ago and still remember it. The book is worth reading on two levels. First, it is quite entertaining. Second, it is a good attempt at describing what happens to human society when chaos reigns supreme.","Day of the Triffids had been on my must read list for an exceptionally long time because I remembered watching the film as a child and being utterly terrified (keep in mind that I was one of the only children not to freak out at The Dark Crystal). When I found out that it was based on a book I just had to read it- so when I discovered it at the second hand bookstore a few weeks ago I just couldn't pass up the opportunity.I think to anyone who has read anything that I have written, especially about the subjects of books, should know that I have a thing for post apocalyptic novels written in the 50's, 60's, 70's and on the rare occasion the 80's. I always thought that it was just because of my obsession with the end of the world, the desolation of humanity and my fear that even though at present we are the dominant species we will one day become obsolete. And in part it may be that- but following on the heels of The World in Winter it has become clear to me that the thing that I like about these stories is that they are character driven. It isn't about the story, it isn't about how the world ends. It is about how people survive and act when all governing bodies are removed and people are left to their own devices. Whether they sink or swim. Whether they become savages or try and remain civilized. It is about how the author thinks people will cope when the only people they have to rely on is themselves.I fully understand how the triffids terrified me so much- they are barbarous plants- but they are merely plot devices and secondary to the characters.Wyndham makes some fabulous points about science (especially about satellites, which I have always found a little creepy and invasive) and the human condition. I especially liked his attack on people thinking that the US was going to come and save the day- fifty years later people are still holding onto that same ineffectual thread.When I got to the end I wanted to read me, I wanted Elspeth's History of the Colony to be a sequel.Of course parts of it are outmoded, such as gender perceptions (though Coker's soliloquy about feminism was pretty close on the mark) but Wyndham manages to squeak through cleanly by pointing out the stupidity in such modesty or habits and foreseeing much of what would happen to certain movements.And his references to a specific war could have been more general to allow people to relate better to it later on, allowing for a change in the enemy of future generations.Still, it was thoroughly enjoyable.","Let me preface this by saying that I love fiction of \"end of the world\" syndrome. If you're a fan of the genre, you'll like this book. The author is an Englishman but his writing style is not hard to read and enjoyable. The plot is your basic \"something happens to shake things up and how does the protagonist survive\". That being said, the author does a good job of it; gives you plenty of creeps without being gory. I'd recommend it and will see what else is by John Wyndham.","I read this book on recommendation from a friend, and I have to say it was really very good. I intend to read more Wyndham when I get the chance. Some reviewers will draw all sorts of comparisons to cold war paranoia or other such metaphors, and they're necessarily wrong in their conclusions. But I think \"Triffids\" is first and foremost a sci-fi adventure book.If you've seen the movie, you don't really know the story in these pages. It's a desperate struggle, portrayed with stark, unforgiving realism. Our heroes don't save everyone. In fact, they barely manage to save themselves. Wyndham doesn't paint a pretty picture of the end of the world, but he ultimately gives it hope.The last fourth drags a little, and it doesn't end with everything resolved, which normally bugs the heck out of me, but fit the theme of the book nicely. Namely: Life goes on, no matter how bad things get. Check it out.","The novel has an excellent opening. The hero appears to be the only one left who can see, in a world gone blind... then the strange plants begin their attack on humanity. There are some very imaginative and thoughtful elements featuring throughout the book and Wyndham makes the seemingly absurd plot convincing. In summary, the book is extremely readable and has a satisfying 'feel-good' ending. It does however become somewhat dissapointingly nostalgic.","I've obtained that book from my father. I've thought it's an ordinary book as many others as I've taken it in my hands, but it was a mistake...When I've opened it and begun to read, I wasn't able to stop. I hadn't to eat or drink - a reading was all that I've needed. I was taken into the story I was in the book, my world obtained a new dimension. It was wonderful...What everything would happen, when something &quot; in the sky &quot; will destroy. A few lights, a few beautifull lights on the sky and - all men are blind. Almost all... Some of them survived wihout a damege of eyes, because they didn't see that strange light - stroke of luck. One of them is our hero. He was at the hospital in sake of his eyes at that time. Once, when he wake up, he found out that something is wrong, something about the people all around him. - People gone blind ! - In this way begins his story..., he goes throgh the city and he see a lot of unhappy blind people, which try to get somewhere, which try to do something. A new world begins... A world with only one right - the right of the stranger. A blind people will die and all of them who are alive wants only one - to stay alive another day. It's bad, a many people are bad, at's stange. In this time we can see who is who - everything best and worst will rise up from deep inside of human. It's interesting to see it. And that is not all - a special kind of living form, something between a plant and animal, which is able to kill - such a creature begines to go among the people and it kills them. People which stayed alive and want to stay alive have to be together. They are able to resist only in this way and it's hard. A many different people with various kind of behavour and the alliens - the Triffids -. /.../ This book is not serious only, it's humorous too. You have to read it, because it's not possible to write as good this book really is. You will see, you haven't feel such intensive experience anytime before...","I'm giving one star not for the book itself (which is great) but for its really horrible edition. As others have mentioned, it's crawling with typos and mistakes as if there was absolutely no proofreading. Skip this edition, better buy a paperback.","This book is, or should be, a classic. I'm a writer (author ofShiver on the Sky), and as far as I'm concerned John Wyndham was one of the best. I pick up one of his books from time to time, and every time I'm inspired to work harder. He was true craftsman, who probably never wrote an awkward sentence. Or at least not accidentally.I kind of liked the movie too, by the way. It wasn't very good in an absolute sense, but that's okay with me--I'm also a B-movie fan. Plus...this particular book (which does NOT have zombies in it) is really the father of all zombie movies. If you ever liked one, you probably liked the bits that were inspired by this book.","This is not a B-Movie story or something of the sorts, even though some covers (of some editions) and the summary might make you think so. The book is well written - it's a bit old, of course, and not so easy to read, specially for a foreigner English student as myself - but the plot is direct, powerful, thought-provoking, and complete.I'm fed up with all these new books that come in installments and leave so many gaps and open questions for the next one. I think the new authors should learn something with this so called, classic. John Wyndham knew how to write a SciFi... and it doesn't have to be a series or a trilogy!Don't miss it if you like post-apocalyptic books, the kind of that makes you not scared, but thoughtful. The story is very plausible; don't wait for aliens or zombies here, it's all about human nature.","A single male protagonist wakes up in a dark room, discovers his world has fallen apart, and sets about surviving. It's a standard setting these days, isn't it? Sure, these days it's zombies, but back then, this first time? Plants. Giant walking plants with whiplashes.This story has it all. There's little I can add to it, save to say that those who are obsessed over new stories like World War Z would do well to read the original and see how it should be done.","It was absolutely bloody fantastic! Think Little Shop of Horror's meets the zombie apocalypse to get a feel of what this is like.","I purchased this as a Kindle special and was quite happy that the purchase turned out to be worthwhile. This novel is a good apocalyptic novel with strong characters.","I picked this up as a Kindle special on books made into movies. I had never heard of the movie or the author. So the book was a very pleasant surprise; it was one of those books that I hated to have end. The book hits on a number of points. The characters are likable and easy to empathize with. The premise of something like a triffid that was dangerous, although manageable, is intriguing. However, the real strength of this novel is how Wyndham works through the consequences of a society dismantled by the meteor/comet event. That kind of thoughtfulness is rare in today's action-mainly thrillers (not only sci-fi but other). Can't believe a major author hasn't picked up where Wyndham left off. The author even seemed to invite other accounts to be written in his closing lines. As our world seems to be closer to some kind of world-level catastrophe, it would be nice to have more 'conversations' about the aftermath that Wyndham carries on with us in this novel.","i picked this book out of nostalgia really. It was one of the ones I read as a child when it first came out and I'd seen the films. This time round it brought back the atmosphere of fear we all lived under then - the Aldermaston marches for nuclear disarmanent, the feeling that the Bomb would drop if not tomorrow then the day after. The Triffids could only have come out of that time. I am now in my sixties and did survive to own a handbag (my deepest regret about the imminent nuclear holocaust being that I would not grow up to be an adult and get to do this)and I realise we do live in gentler times despite everything. Anyway the book is gripping, vivid and original, combining as it does two catastrophes - a blinding of the world's population (bar a few accidentally spared individuals) and the proliferation of a strange hunting plant - the triffid which preys upon the newly helpless humans. Moral dilemmas are explored along with the ways different people respond to the threats and opportunities presented by a devastated world. Its messages still seem relevant but fortunately these days terror fatigue has set in for most of us and it's less scary than fascinating. Really recommended. JJ","The Day of the Triffids is a book that should reside on any science fiction fan's book shelf. You have all of the classic sci-fi themes in the novel that stand the test of time. Civilization seeks to control what it does not understand. It backfires of course in a large way. Civilization is faced with extinction and therefore must reinvent itself. Wyndham forces us to examine the the price of arrogance and the balance due this time is destruction on a global scale.What are triffids? Deadly plants that walk like humans. They kill indiscriminately and are sllowly taking over the earth. A number of fascinating questions are posed throughout the novel. Are triffids evil or are they merely following their nature? What about humans? What is our nature? Can we truly put aside our differences and unite when faced with the apocalypse? The answers lie within. Enjoy.","Well, this is the book that started it. I really enjoyed this book. Naturally it goes further into the reason as to why the \"Triffids\" started in the first place. However, I must say that the movie starring Howard Keel (\"Showboat\") was excellent as well.","This is a entertaining story that will make you wonder about flowers and how they are thought to be just flowers! The story moves along nicely and is very believable. It will make you look at flowers differently and wonder if you should really be talking to them. It is a light sci fi/fantasy story and readers new to the sci fi genre will find it very readable. They may never look at new flowers in the same way again.","The Rosetta edition seems to be quite good. I have checked various spots throughout and found no errors. I have searched for the symbol \"!\" and the number \"1\" to see if they have been substituted for letters like \"i\" or \"l\" and found none.Most, if not all, of the negative reviews seem to be for an edition (put out by someone else) that is no longer available. I don't think that anyone should be afraid of the Rosetta version.","I heard about this book when it was reviewed by Kill Me If I Stop and knew I just had to read it. I'd never heard of it or the author, John Wyndham, even though he's written quite a few science fiction books.Let me just say that this book is amazing! It's unlike anything I've ever read and not only is it an entertaining read, it's also terrifying and very thought provoking. I don't want to give away too much of what happens because it's best if you discover it for yourself.As I read I felt so aware of my eyes and ability to see. It's something I take for granted and don't even think about until forced to contemplate a life in the dark. This book makes you realize just how much you rely on sight and how helpless you could become if you were deprived of it.Another thing this book really impressed upon me was how much people in the past had to overcome when building society as we know it today. When the people have to start from scratch they have the advantage of knowledge but they still have to work to create a new world. That alone made me realize just how fortunate I am to live in this era where many things have already been discovered, best practices already implemented, and technology already invented. All those things allow me to live a rather easy life full of leisure time and enjoyment versus a constant struggle to survive and find food, for example.While the concept of plants that can walk around might sound outrageous, Wyndham's writing deals with the idea so well that you find yourself imagining that it just might be possible. Not to mention we already have venus flytrap plants and mimosa pudica, a plant that shrinks back when touched. And then there's Cleve Backster, a lie-detector expert who hooked up a plant to one of his machines and found it \"reacted sharply when he merely thought about burning one of its leaves.\"The Triffid plants in the book are definitely dangerous but Wyndham doesn't write them as horrific monsters. That doesn't mean they aren't that scary because they are. He just didn't sensationalize them and I think that's why this book comes across as so realistic and frightening.","This was the book that turned me into a reader at aged 12. Sure, I read books before this...because I had to at school.That first time I read Day of the Triffids in one night...I just couldn't put it down. That had never happened to me before. The opening was so haunting...it was like nothing I'd ever read before. I remember I spilled tea on it, dried it out on the radiator and had to return it to the school library...somewhat guiltily... the next day. I made up for it by becoming a school librarian, though I must admit this did also allow me to work my way through the science-fiction books available. All of John Wyndham, on to Arthur C. Clarke, Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, A.E. Van Vogt....on and on. Oh, happy days.I remember, in my final year or so of school, we had to read it for English literature lessons. It turns out it was abridged. I spotted it inside a few minutes, and simply refused to read the abridged version. How dare they?I've been a science-fiction fan for decades now thanks intitially to this book, but long ago also branched out into fantasy, history, military history, science, philosophy, biographies, poetry, gothic horror and some classic and modern fiction.Day Of The Triffids is just one of those books I love to re-read. I've lost count how many times I've read it. I don't claim it's the best science-fiction ever, but it does hold a very special and personal place in my heart. I know - flesh eating plants and meteorites that make you blind. How can that weird apocalyptic stuff possibly work? But it does....at least in John Wyndham's hands.It's not a long book and it's a very easy read. I was gripped from the opening pages. If you haven't read it I hope you try it and enjoy it as much as I did.","Re-reading this Great Classic 1962 Novel is pure pleasure. John Wyndam's book was made into a movie (1962), BBC Miniseries (twice) and a Sam Raimi rumoured remake. Another of his great books, The Midwich Cuckoos (available on the Kindle also) was made into the movie \"The Village of the Damned\". The Day of the Triffids is definitely one of the best Sci-Fi books ever written. Pick it up for your Kindle and enjoy!","Day of the Triffids is many things. Most are well covered in other reviews. I fist saw the movie 45 or so years ago, and read the book about 40 years ago. It is a fun book to read. That may be somewhat odd to say about a post apocalyptic novel, but the book, while dealing with a serious subject, is not depressing and has enough mystery about the how things will turn out to keep you avidly reading.I think we have generally forgotten the tension that existed in the 1950's - even though it was not all that long ago. Day of the Triffids is definitely a product of the early Cold War and helps remind us how real the possibility of large scale destruction was.","The world comes to an end in this novel with a cosmic light show that leaves everyone who watches it...which is almost everybody...blind the next morning. And ready to take advantage of this are the triffids, ambulatory tree-like plants that have become a mainstay in the economy because they produce a high quality vegetable oil. The problem with the triffis, however, if they have a whip-like tendril that sprouts from their crown and is capable of killing people struck by it. After sufficient time for decompositionl, the whip will hook meat and bring it back so they can feed themselves. How do you deal with that?The book spawned a movie with American actor and singer Howard Keel in the lead, a common practice in 1950's English movies where American character actors took the lead with an otherwise all-British cast. The story is different in details, but substantially similar.The triffids, of course, sound much more impressive in the book than they look on screen -- that's the power of imagination for you. Unlike the movie, the book doesn't try for a simple happy ending, but more like a conditional happy ending.It's a nice little chiller. I first read it when I was a teen...I had to snap it up and reread it. Glad I did.","If you like H.G. Wells, apocalypse books or even if zombie books are your thing, then this is an excellent read. An apocalypical story in which the remaining survivors of a holocoust(fantasticaly slow holocoust)band together, plan to avoid the extcintion of the human race, avoid the power hungry psycopathic gangs and build something for themselves and their offspring. Gripping stuff, fantastically written, make this a pure joy to read.","I really enjoyed this short novel, its \"english\" take on the end of the world , especially having been written in the 50's, is refreshing, i hope youll give it a go...","Great book, it grips you from the first page. I read it in high school in 1980 and then again last year and I think it was even better the second time around","I loved this book. If you love survival stories that make you think \"if I lived in that situation, how would -I- survive?\", then read this one. The characters are likeable, it is simple enough to read (I read it casually in two days) yet is thought-provoking, has a good pace, and has a good ending. Read if you like learning about alien species, following a likeable character on his journey to find a new way of life, and imagining how you would try to rebuild society if survival and cooperation were more important than petty politics and materialism.","\"The Day of the Triffids\" by John Wyndham seems to be a forgotten child of the post-apocalyptic genre. I'm not sure if this is due to it's relatively unorthodox premise, or it's somewhat dated take on gender roles, but either reason is, frankly, dead wrong as this is an amazing book that ranks with \"On the Beach\" and \"Alas, Babylon\" as a cornerstone of the genre. With a premise that is both utterly unique and rich in metaphor, and characters that are charged with emotion, it is a truly gripping read.What sets \"The Day of the Triffids\" apart from other books in the genre is its two tiered approach to the end of the world. The first revolves around the eponymous Triffids, which are mobile, semi-carnivorous plants which are presumed to be the result of Soviet genetic tampering. While one would expect that they would be treated as a scourge, quite the opposite occurs as mankind farms them for the rich oils they produce. Thus, is the hubris of man framed quite nicely, and the pieces put in play.For the triffids are only benign so long as man can control them; when left to their own devices they grow an intensely venomous lash that can kill a full grown human. When a bizarre stellar event leaves everyone who witnessed it blind, the time of the triffids is suddenly at hand. To go further would risk spoiling the plot, but as the few sighted survivors struggle to make sense of, and survive in, their greatly altered world, the triffids become the foremost obstacle to their continued existence.Thus, \"The Day of the Triffids\" stands quite nicely as a post-apocalyptic thriller. However, it is what is going on between the lines that makes this a classic. First is the obvious comparison between the triffids and the Soviets. Not only did the latter create the former, but the swarming, relentless approach of the triffids nicely mirrors the Western view of Soviet expansions in the 1950's. However, unlike many Cold War era authors, Wyndham's view of the world is not entirely black and white. While the Soviet system may be the enemy, and not one he wants to live under, he doesn't remove all blame from the West. By their very response to Soviet moves he sees a world made less, not more safe, and one that is walking a knife's edge over the abyss.Ultimately though, he sees hope for mankind because even as it teeters on the brink of extinction, he anticipates the ability to learn and grow from the mistakes of the past. His rather prescient views of the use of space and bio-technology offer hope, but only if used responsibly, and therefore \"The Day of the Triffids\" is as much a cautionary tale, somewhat in the vein of a \"Jurassic Park\", as it is a post-apocalyptic thriller.Finally, there is a small but very noticeably element that infuses much of the first half of the novel. Time and again, Wyndham has his characters assuming that the Americans will be along by and by to sort things out. Given that this novel was published in 1951 on the heels of World War II, one has to assume that Wyndham was warning his fellow countrymen that the Americans weren't going to be around forever, so they better start standing on their own two feet. While hardly essential to the plot, this historical artifact does offer interesting insight into the context of the book.Finally, as I alluded to above, there is definitely a pervasive, but largely benign note of sexism in \"The Day of the Triffids\". While it may offend some, it is by no means misogynistic, and rather reflects a form of chivalry that was probably outdated even as Wyndham wrote the book. On some level he seems to recognize this, as his writing of female characters is somewhat conflicted; he wants to shelter them even as he knows they must be strong. Again, more than anything this offers an interesting historical context to the novel.I should also add that the introduction by Edmund Morris is superb, as he does an excellent job of stating why \"The Day of the Triffids\" is still relevant, and perhaps more pertinent than ever in our post-9/11 world. He writes particularly strongly of Wyndham's pathos for the victims, and how it mirrors our own response to terrorism. The rare novel that offers both gripping narrative and thoughtful commentary, \"The Day of the Triffids\" represents post-apocalyptic literature at its best and should rightly be held among the best contributions to the genre.Jake Mohlman","While I stand by the reviews that state the excellence of this story, and the skill of the author, intending purchasers should know that this is an *edited* edition - something I didn't pick up on until reading along with a BBC unabridged reading of the book.Example - in Chapter 1 when Bill Masen encounters the doctor in the corridors of the hospital - this has been removed from this edition.The fact this is an edited version needs to be made clear to intending purchasers","Day of the Triffids kicks butt! Two weeks ago I had never heard of John Wyndham, but I found his name in [...] fiction archive, and I looked up his books here at Amazon.The opening scene in Triffids is mesmerizing. The basic premise of the book is that a meteor shower blinds most of the world population, except for a handful of people. One of lucky ones is Bill Masen, who was in a hospital with bandages over his eyes and was not able to watch the meteor shower. Towards the end of the book, narrator Masen speculates that the meteor shower might have been caused by man-made satellites orbiting Earth, and indeed, the whole apocalyptic vision of the novel voices the concerns any sane human being would have had shortly after WWII and the discovery of the destructive power of atomic energy.That said, the novel is not at all a doom and gloom book. It is actually quite hopeful, optimistic, and funny. There is a romantic subplot wherein Bill meets a charming woman named Josella Payton, only to be separated from her in the aftermath of the devastating meteor shower. A good part of the book follows Bill's search for Josella through various malevolent organizations that spring up in the months after the meteor shower.Developing alongside this story line, is the story of the triffids, a kind of six-foot-tall Venus Flytrap with a stinging whip that has the ability to pick up its roots and walk around. In the wake of world blindness, these plants begin attacking people who stumble blindly around London and the English countryside outside of London.The novel has a very solid ending that made me feel happy to have read the book. It was such a good story I'm going to see if I can get a copy of Wyndham's other classic bestseller, The Cuckoo's of Midwich. I highly recommend Day of the Triffids to any sci-fi fan, as well as to anyone who likes a good old-fashioned white-knuckle yarn. And, of course, I hope this review is helpful to you!Stacey CochranAuthor of CLAWS available for 80 cents","This is a great classic work of science fiction; however, the Kindle edition doesn't do it justice. Besides not including the Introduction that's included in the paperback edition, the Kindle version is full of typos, missing letters, missing punctuation, and so on. Amazon needs to do a better job of quality control on the books it accepts for the Kindle.","First published in 1951, this classic science-fiction novel was unique for its time (although undoubtedly inspired by &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;). The story follows the plight of the world's few remaining survivors after three (possibly) coincidental cataclysmic events of uncertain origins: the genetic development of mobile, carnivorous plants; the blinding of the earth's inhabitants by what may or may not have been a meteor shower; and the sudden onset of a mysterious and fatal disease. Most of the world's inhabitants are sightless and unable to defend themselves against the marauding plants, and even those with vision succumb to the plague.End-of-the-world scenarios have of course been done to death, especially in B-movies, but &quot;Day of the Triffids&quot; has withstood the test of time--not because of its plot, but because it anticipated many other works and because the writing and themes are a cut above your typical pulp fiction. Nearly every episode in the book has been replicated in dozens of science fiction and horror movies and novels. Filmgoers who have seen &quot;Resident Evil&quot; or &quot;28 Days Later&quot; will recognize the opening scene, in which Wiliam Masen wakes up in a hospital room, unaware that the world as he knows it has come to a devastating end. Other scenes recall the &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; series and similar films, and the descriptions of the survivors' efforts to rebuild society clearly influenced many later works of dystopian fiction.Wyndham adopts a minimalist &quot;noir&quot; style for the first sections, using a surreal first-person perspective to convey the confusion, fear, and isolation afflicting William Masen while he tries to figure out what has happened. When the focus of the book changes from the lone individual to bands of the living, the author shifts to a more expansive and analytic prose that fleshes out the book's social and political commentary.It is the exploration of these themes that makes the book so fascinating. As various groups of survivors unite together, they adopt different modes of government: a communalism that tries to rescue as many people as possible, a fundamentalism entrenched in its devotion to outdated moral codes, a militarism that quickly degenerates to totalitarianism, and a rationalism relying on the survival of the fittest to guarantee as many new offspring as possible. Each of these myopic systems suffers from a slavishness to one goal at the expense of any other: preventing as many deaths as possible, preserving morality, maintaining law and order, and insuring the survival of the species. Following the traditions of the best dystopian fiction, Wyndham uses his story to examine the faults with our present world and its communist, theocratic, authoritarian, and Darwinian societies.The ending of the book is just open-ended and ambiguous enough to have allowed for a sequel, by Wyndham wasn't the type to write or authorize one (although Simon Clark published &quot;The Night of the Triffids&quot; two years ago). This closing ambiguity seems appropriate: in the real world, there are never as many solutions as there are problems.","My first introduction to The Day of the Triffids was watching the BBC series as a child. I was terrified. Many years later I opened the book and discovered John Wyndham. Having read all his books I rate this one right at the top.Like his other titles, the reader is immediately immersed in the &quot;what if&quot; world that Wyndham creates. The protagonist, Bill Mason is one of the few people in the world not sent blind by a meteor shower. To compound his situation earth is taken over by Triffids; walking, man eating plants, biological abominations created by you guessed it, humans. Our hero must flee the death and depravity of London and attempt to start a new life not only for himself but for humankind.A battle for survival of the fittest is dramatically played out with the winner changing constantly. Some themes that I found interesting included the struggle for man to again dominate over nature and the effect of a cataclysmic event on human inter-relations.This book is classic Science Fiction but I also like think of it as Horror without gore.","You can read other reviews to get the storyline etc. But - although it's brilliantly imagined and carried off - the plot isn't the most important thing about this book. What counts is the vision, the intelligence, the language, and most of all the humanity.These bring to the book a timelessness usually absent in science fiction. It's astonishing to realize that this book was written in 1951! Not only because Wyndham foresaw orbiting weapons and designer crops, but because there's almost nothing that would need to change if it was rewritten today. The important things don't change even that fast, and this book deals with important things. This is subtly done, since all of the protagonist's concerns are immediate throughout; but his and others' decisions reflect unchanging aspects of human nature and of nature itself.I first read this around 1960, and enjoyed it but did not really appreciate it then. This time I had the additional advantage of hearing the Chivers audiobook, wonderfully narrated by Samuel West.Don't miss it!","This is the first serious novel I ever read. (Before that I was only reading Doctor Who tie-in's.) After seeing the BBC adaptation on TV I wanted to read this book. I got it when I was 11 and have cherished it ever since. This was the book that made John Wyndham famous: the overnight destruction of civilization by &quot;comet debris&quot;, the world overrun by flesh-eating plants called triffids.One could look at this book as a war between man and nature on a grand scale. When mankind was the species that dominated all others, nature was driven back, &quot;suppressed&quot;, or killed in the name of progress. When the tables are suddenly turned, it looks as if mankind is in decline. As the years pass, dead cities are slowly disappearing, turning into jungles as nature takes hold. In a matter of time nature will take over completely and the triffids will be the new inheritors. Unless the human race can fight back and reassert itself.I have lost count of how many times I have read this book. I am 23 and the story is just as effective now as it was when I first read it. I like seeing all the different cover artwork that people have done for this book. The fact that it's been reprinted so many times is proof that this novel shows no sign of losing its popularity.","The Day of the Triffids has all the feel on a 1950s cheesy science fiction movie: implausible monsters (walking/thinking/hunting plants) threatening the existence of the human race. There is also some Cold War paranoia (..the commies are behind all this!) for good measure. However the book surprisingly rises above the silliness and is, thankfully, an enjoyable read.The Day of the Triffids succeeds because of two factors. One, it does a terrific job of building suspense; it is indeed a page-turner. Secondly, its description of how people act after &quot;the world has ended&quot; is frighteningly realistic. Think Stephen King's The Stand and you've got the right idea. However Wyndham's prose is a bit more crisp, and the scenes are less graphic.Bottom line: a surprisingly mature bit of nostalgic science fiction. Not quite as shocking as when it was first published, yet The Day of the Triffids still offers reading entertainment value.","Fantastic, frightening and entirely plausible, \"Day of the Triffids\" is a post-apocalyptic story based on a simple hypothesis - mass blindness coupled with the natural disaster of a mobile stinging plant called the triffid created by genetic engineering gone sour! Wyndham's genius is how he uses the tale of his still sighted protagonists, Bill Masen and Josella Playton, to address the moral and psychological issues that would be certain to raise their heads in this particular new world order - the definition of marriage, sexuality and the survival of the race, law and order, male vs female roles, government and authority, survival of the fittest and many more. Thought provoking in the extreme and yet still completely satisfying even when read only on the surface as a science-fiction thriller!Paul Weiss","I am fortunate that I had not seen the movie before picking up this book--it would have persuaded me not to buy it. Day of the Triffids is a fantatstic science fiction story written in the 1950s but is hardly outdated. The main reason that the story stays current is that the main issues in this book are not about technology (like a lot of scifi) but deal with human psychology and cultural issues following a mass catastrophe.(I would like to ask Margaret Atwood if she was influenced by some of Wyndham's ideas about gender issues discussed in this book before she wrote the Handmaid's Tale...there are some definate similarities concerning the post-apocolyptic role of women).If you live in London, this book is especially good. Everyday I walk past the various parks and university areas that the triffids run over in the book. The story really comes to life when you walk past Russell Square and imagine triffids swaying in the wind.","I have always liked this story. It was realistic if such an event were to really happen. There have been some film adaptations which, for the most part, don't give the written version much credit. Reading the book is much better than watching the film.","John Wyndam's book is over 50 years old andstill holds up, why this is not on more top 10scifi list is beyound me.","i loved re reading this again having first read it in my late teens.a solid story a little dated now (no cell phones and internet) but simply relished it","Read it for the first time 50 years ago. Made a lasting impression and what I measure good SiFi against. Bought it just for the memories.","Disturbing, thought provoking, beautifully written. 60 odd years later it makes your question where we're going as a race. Timeless","I keep ordering extra copies of this book because I can't stop giving it to people. It is one of my favorite stories.","Having lived in the area (Southern England) for many years the story was even more realistic to me. Who knows what is out there in the universe! thought provoking and enjoyable to the last page!","Well worth reading much better than the old film. I heard about his books on the First Tuesday book show, never read at school as so many people seem to have.","Never having read anything by this author previously, I like his wording and fined the detail of the story much better than the small amount used for the movie.","There is another entry on Amazon for this same book.Type in:The Day of the Triffids (Modern Library 20th Century Rediscovery) on Amazon.The OTHER entry has 44 reviews of this same book.This OTHER entry also gives you the ability to\"Search inside this book\"","I read this book on the offhand advice of a microbiology professor, who flung it out casually during a discussion on genetic manipulation. He appeared rather amused by the plot line and narrative. His amusement, in retrospect, is certainly justified. The premise of the novel (two disasters, at least one brought upon mankind by his own hubris, which act in fateful concert to utterly destroy society as we know it) seems trite several decades after the writing. End-of-the-World scenarios are well explored by old and recent movies and books. And, well, man-eating plants were ever so exhausted by Little Shop of Horrors.However, like any really good science fiction, the genius is not in the details but in the way they play out and how the characters react to them. Wyndham wrote a study of human society which, while occasionally clumsy (I never felt that the central relationship between the main character and his girl was really believable), nevertheless provides food for thought. When you look at this book, look not only at the types of societies that Wyndham experiments with; notice the ways in which he dodges criticism regarding his treatment of ethics in his changed world. The author is very much present among the lines, and attempting to piece him together is as interesting as discovering his characters.As for the details: as corny as they seem at face value, they are possibly even more relevant to today's concerns than they were in the 60's. The triffids are a man-modified plant organism whose origin is unknown (though it is hinted that the Russians developed them, and were definitely growing them). The unfortunate fact is that, untended, they become very dangerous, often deadly. It is unclear whether they were designed to be such, or if this was an unintended side-effect, but everyone is fine with the situation since the plants can be controlled. Enter The Comets. The Comets are anticipated and eagerly observed by billions around the globe, who subsequently find themselves blind. And thus the stage is set for the two crises of the book: uncontrolled triffids and human anarchy. The latter is ultimately more interesting, and really subsumes the former. After all, in a society composed mostly of blind persons who all simultaneously are ignorant of how to cope with blindness, a GMO weed problem is only one of many issues that will have to be addressed on the road to survival.The biggest problem I have with the book's premise is that it seems to imply that, barring a cataclysmic event, the human species is in full control of its inventions. Per my very adamant opinion, we are not. We play with fire constantly, heedlessly, and often with an eye for nothing but the bottom line. I will spare everyone a discussion on genetically modified organisms and agribusiness practices, but the parallels are certainly there to see. The potential for things to go wrong (in overt as well as subtle ways) is real, and doesn't necessarily require worldwide blindness to be realized. To Wyndham's credit, he does provide an appropriate sense of uncertainty, at least where cataclysms are concerned. He does not take the subtle route, with either his comets or his triffids, but he does warn us that we are not in as much control as we would like to think.The overall sense of the book is one of tentative hope. After everything, humanity will (with luck) muddle through and even prevail, though possibly not. Possibly, the survivors will learn from the mistakes of the past, though very probably not. It is refreshing that not every loose end is perfectly tied, that some questions are left unanswered. The sense that the book is describing someone's reality is thus preserved. Few life stories have neat little endings, and it is gratifying to see an author who can bring a book to a solid conclusion without being a neat-freak about it. Good read.","I loved the opening, and overall thought it was a good book - the descriptions were good, the writing was snappy and engaging - however, by the end, I felt unfullfilled by it. The opening was super, very visual, getting you involved with the main character immediately. However, as the book continued, there were long diversions from the plot development that wound up going nowhere - such as the time Bill Mason (the main charactor and narrator) gets waylaid by a group and he gets separated from his female interest. This, as I said, did not contribute much to the story, as this group kind of just fizzles and now, Bill embarks on a nearly hopeless search for the woman from whom he became separated. This would not be so bad a plot development, but I was never convinced that Bill had that much feeling for her - nothing approaching passion - nothing approaching the kind of devotion that such a hopless search under dire and perilous circumstances would warrant.Additionally, there were so many details that were unaccounted for - how in heck did all those blind people take care of their sanitation? It might be nitpicking, it might seem low class of me to think of it, but I always look for this in a book. If people in books and movies never go to the bathroom, it detracts from the realism. Let's face it - all men and women on this planet - as well as every other organism, is no more than 2 - 3 hours at most from their next whizz. How did they ever wash? Or get their hair cut? Or get shoes or clothing? They were only trying to get food most of the time - very little else. I love these details - it draws me into a story - makes me almost feel a part of things. Without them, I become detached from a story. As far as sanitation, I guess at the time the book was written (1951) it would have been scandelous to account for it but hell, the Earth was ending. It's ok to kill off millions, but not ok to account for their hygene? Nah, the real end of the Earth would be very very very very much worse than Wyndham had it. P. C. Jersild had it right in After the Flood. The real END would be nearly unbearable, not a mere inconvenience. Then, the triffids themselves were less terrifying than they should have been. They just didn't arrouse the kind of horror that they might have. So - a good book - deserving of its reputation, yet, it falls a bit short.Just my humble opinion.","I'm torn as how best to review this book. One the one hand I've seen many adaptations of the book on TV and film. Some credit the book others don't. Having just recently seen the UK series &quot;Survivors&quot; (1975) I must say that I'm surprised that Terry Nation didn't credit Wyndham given the heavily lifted plot and dialogue! Sure, the main characters are changed around but the incidental plot elements are nearly the same and in the same order. All that is missing is the triffids and the comet.Which brings me to my main complaint about the book: The triffids hardly have anything to do with the plot of the book even though they are the title of it and are the most thought out piece of the book. The idea of a tech industry expirament let loose in the wild was fascinating but save for chapter 2, nothing is further is developed along those lines.Then there's the comet (if it is one) which blinds everyone and then the unexplained plague a few days later. Now if you believe the B film Day of the Comet, the comet turns those who saw it into zombies -- triffids be damned and then the same sort of plot (minus menacing plants) goes on. In this book though, the two seem unrelated except to kill off all those annoying recently rendered blind folks.","I understand the role this book has played in apocalyptic writings and has heavily influenced many writers and directors who have drawn on its themes, but... still couldn't get into it or much care for it. I found the book to be very dated in its cultural relevance and more or less a tract on the authors ideas about how to create a society in his own image, which bears some resemblance to Joseph Smith and Brigham Young's thoughts on the subject (which Wyndham touches on). Lots of internal and external dialog and exposition without resolution. It's written as a first-person of course, but I found the approach frankly tiresome. Kind of like reading Ayn Rand - you want to jump over big chunks just to avoid amateur philosophy. I suppose I'm happy to have read it since it is somewhat a touchstone of this oeuvre, but there are better options out there (The Road, A Canticle for Lebovitz, even The Stand) if you are looking for musings on the end of our current civilization.","I read this book for a class in British film because supposedly this book is a classic of the science fiction genre. And I like science-fiction. But this is just stupid. Don't get me wrong , it's got some very interesting ideas...the fall and fragmentation of civilization, etc. etc. But walking plants! For God's sake.There is not much of a coherent narrative here. The protagonist walks around telling us what he does here, there, and the next place. But do we care about the characters he runs into? No. Do the events relate well to one another? No. For example, Wyndham introduces a love interest for the main character early on in the story and then they meet up again at the end. We are told that he loves her, but he hardly shows it. And we don't care, because she hardly ever appears.You may want to read this for the ideas. It's got some good ones. But the writing ain't too good. Lots and lots of exposition and wasted space. A bit like a 1950's pulp magazine story, but a lot longer.Watch out for the walking plants! Don't get stung. Ooooooo.","Glaring grammatical and editing errors detract from a hastily constructed plot built on a series of flimsy contrivances. The author explores an end of the world motif, mankinds degradations and obligatory redemptions against a backdrop of killer plants and blindness. Disappointing at best.","\"The Day of the Triffids\" had its heyday back in the 1950s. For the most part, English teachers loved it and SF fans yawned. The author, Wyndom, knew how to write well. However, after the first quarter of the novel, real science fiction fans were asking: \"Well? When are we going to get to the serious science fiction?\" Alas! All that followed seemed like: \"Blah, blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah.\"My older brother, an English teacher, gave me the book when I was in eighth grade. He said: \"Here. Read something good for a change.\" I got through it. I remember it. But the darn thing has faded and faded ever since then. I am not sure why someone is trying to resurect it, now.Meanwhile, there were several science fiction novels written in the 1940s and 1950s, which continue to grow and become more influential.Towards the end of the first third of the book, the novel turns into a sort of science fiction horror story. However, most of the last two thirds left me wondering when the 'hero' was going to do something against the Triffids. Well, he does, sort of, do something. But the hero is not exactly a hero, he is more of a protagonist. Now there is a title that English teachers like. But, regular people wonder why he is standing there and talking, why not DO SOMETHING!At least, that is how I felt, fifty years ago. The second and last time I picked the book up, was, about, twenty or thirty years later. I went through it quickly and confirmed my first impressions. I have not tried to go through it again. Meanwhile, there are some books I pick up every year to go through them and enjoy them all over again.So, two stars, no more than that. Sorry.","What a fantastic book! I really don't like scifi for the most part, now sure I loved Ender's Game and 1984 (who didn't) but for the most part - technology bores me... so I avoid scifi books like the plague. Why I ended up reading this one I'll never know, but I am so glad I did.Published in 1951 (that's the version I read - it's OLD) there are some forward looking assumptions that are rather creepy when you think of when it was published. We follow a survivor and the people he encounters after something strange occured that blinded most of humanity. On top of that, these vicious little (well not that little) plants that we had been cultivating for their oil are quite happliy munching on all of the blind folks that are now wandering around. Then there's the plague.That's quite a lot to deal with especially when you throw in the sighted survivors have all gone a wee bit crazy in their attempts to survive and rebuild civilization. Probably one of the oldest survival horror books that I have read (it's clear that many zombie novels written later took a few ideas from this) I absolutley loved this book.2012 here we come baby! Bring on the Triffids","William Masen wakes up in the hospital to discover that everyone in the world has gone blind after observing a strange, green glow in the sky. He was spared because of temporary blindness caused the sting of a triffid, a large, mobile, carnivorous plant which is cultivated for its oil. William manages to find some other people who escaped the blindness, but their efforts to survive are complicated by the triffids which seem to be consciously trying to hunt down humans.I read Triffids for the first time about 20 years ago, and rereading it now it still holds up quite well. I can see how this book has probably formed the basis for a lot of later end-of-the world stories. Wyndham manages to pack a lot of story into under two hundred pages. The moral choices that the characters has to make were interesting, and not just a simple black or white, especially in the way that Coker could come to admit that his attempt to do what he saw was right was in fact a mistake. The only thing that seems a little off is that the story seems like it would be taking place in the 1970's or 1980's, but society has not changed at all, and the characters seem more like they are still in the 1950's, but I guess that trying to extrapolate and explain social changes in society on top of everything else would have been too much for the book.I do wonder what the purpose of the triffids really is in the story. The blinding itself is enough to bring down civilization, and to provide the cautionary message. The triffids don't really play a major role until late in the story. They do seem to provide a means to unify most of the remnants of humanity in the fight against a common enemy, and provide a reason to quickly rebuild civilization.","That's really all I have to say.This is a great book!","You won't read this book if you base your decision on a quick summary: \"A mysterious green meteor shower blinds most of humanity, who are then preyed upon by large, ambulatory, three-legged plants that lash long, poisonous, whip-like tentacles out of their stalks. Our hero, spared the blindness by a timely stay in the hospital, finds romance and socio-political insight as he helps rebuild civilization. All of this happens in the UK.\"Suspend your disbelief and read the book. The motivations and actions of people trying to survive are realistic and interesting. And the various philosophies for both individual and group survival are thought-provoking. You will enjoy this story if you have enjoyed any ofThe Stand,Alas, Babylon, orEarth Abides. It is a thoughtful exploration of the fall of civilization and its implications, packaged in an engaging adventure. Good reading.A caution: Enjoying science fiction always requires some suspension of disbelief. Even more so with older science fiction. In this case, the story and exploration of ideas is worth this effort. Don't trouble yourself wondering why the cold of winter doesn't help human beings in their struggle with these walking plants. Or why most of the unstable triffids don't expire in some \"I've fallen and can't get up\" scenario. (Their anatomy as described wouldn't permit them to bend enough to get up from a prone position.) You can find more of these issues if you try. Don't. Not the first time through, anyway. Just enjoy a great story from one of the masters of early science fiction.","Since purchasing my Kindle, I am reading a lot of older books and truly enjoying the ride. Day of the Triffids was a great read. Not too heavy on the despair of humanity after a devastating event, and not too heavy on any one person's search for answers. I would have liked to read more about the global response to the tragedy and ensuing hysteria, but still a great original story.","\"The Day of the Triffids\" was for many years my favorite sci-fi novel; afterwards it was replaced in that honor place by Dune and Hyperion.I've read this novel when I was a teenager in the mythical Argentinean sci-fi magazine \"Mas Alla\", it was published there as the main story of the inaugural number. I've treasured my collection for more than 40 years.\"The Day of the Triffids\" still stands in my all-time best novels list and I've reread it once every couple of years.It is a typical product of the '50 immersed in the \"Cold War\", but with a forceful story line, exploring a post catastrophe world.The drama evolves smoothly, griping you up to the last page; it has a somewhat melancholic background, our known world fading into dust and a new one emerging from the ashes in a pitiless confrontation with the Triffids of the title.It is a novel that fifty years after it was written still catch your interest and keep you going on.In sci-fi not to be dated is a commendation.If the reader wants to have a vivid picture of London in a state similar to this book descriptions I encourage he/she to see the movie \"28 Days Later\".I wholeheartedly recommend this book to all sci-fi fans and general public too!Reviewed by Max Yofre","A great novel in the zombie/vampire genre, with a solitude-induced dystopia akin to Matheson's I Am Legend and Brook's World War Z.Some may see the sci-fi concepts as far fetched, specifically the triffids themselves, but the overall story congeals well bringing about stressful situations and sparking philosophical questions regarding morality, social convention, principles, and what would be the appropriate type of organization in the chaotic aftermath of pandemic blindness.","Not much I can add that others haven't.This is an excellent book, which, because it deals with human nature, surely has to remain timeless.In the aftermath of the comets, the loneliness of people who are literally left in the dark is tangible and help to make this novel remain in your mind long after you've finished reading it.The part the triffids play in this chaos is remarkably easy to imagine, especially knowing the scientific research that is carried out now into genetic engineering. The triffids, although dangerous, are tolerated and managed because of their useful oil. If some degenerative diseases could be eradicated by cultivating a deadly plant...would we?I really enjoyed the way Wyndham makes us think about human behaviour and how hard it is to unlearn. The ideas on what to tell future generations and the references to disasters in the ancient world I found really thought provoking.","\"The Day of the Triffids\" was for many years my favorite sci-fi novel; afterwards it was replaced in that honor place by Dune and Hyperion.I've read this novel when I was a teenager in the mythical Argentinean sci-fi magazine \"Mas Alla\", it was published there as the main story of the inaugural number.

While the folks who made the film did quite a good job within the framework of the fifties horror movie, there's a great deal more to the book.Bill Masen wakes up in the hospital the morning after a meteor shower that had captivated the entire planet to find that most of his human compatriots have been blinded by the light from the meteors. Masen, with his head in bandages during the shower, missed it, and retains his sight, strolling through a post-apocalyptic England in the first half of the novel, documenting life after the tragedy-- and before the triffids. The triffids are odd plants that seemingly appeared out of nowhere, and Masen, in fact, worked for a company that extracted nutritional compounds from them. Wonderfully useful as long as they were kept in tight check by their human masters, triffids had spread throughout England without anyone giving them a second thought. A blind populace, however, cannot control its previously-useful pet...Much has been made of the brilliance of the layered narrative and the many parallels with life at the beginning of the Cold War, so I won't do anything here except mention it all in passing. This new edition's introduction, by the always wonderful Edmund Morris, is aimed at convincing a new generation that Wyndham's remarkable Cold War fable is still as relevant, if not more so, in the post-9/11 world. As much as reading Edmund Morris' words, even if only in a brief introduction, pleases me, I have to wonder why this was necessary; a simple reading of this very quick and compelling novel should be more than enough to convince the average person of the validity of the introduction's argument. The Day of the Triffids is very much still relevant, and still just as cracking as it was in 1951. ***","A wonderful post-apocalyptic look at the human comdition. Disregard the movie. This is a surprisingly good look examination of different arcs that humanity could take if civilization was pulled out from under us. Cold, harsh, and cruel, but gripping and honest. Highly recommended. While you're at it, check out \"The Chrysalids.\"","I first saw the movie Day of the Triffids With Howard Keel and was interested in reading the book. I found that the book was very interesting and thought provocing as it has the elements many of which can be found being put forward in scientific circles today. Man tinkering around with genetics that may one day engulf and possibly overshadow mankind itself by mistake or mutation. I found the book to be one that once I started I had to finnish to see the outcome. The book puts man against the triffids but the handicap gives the plants an advantage over most of mankind. The few people that have retained thier sight have their hands full staying alive. This book makes the one who reads it actually become one of the charactors either main or background. This book is exciting reading. Mr.Wyndham was truly a writer before his time","Nature has always been an unfolding mystery to the human race. From the very beginning of time, men depicted stories of nature's beginning on cave walls and told beautiful myths and stories in an attempt to explain the unknown. Even today, there is much in the world we do not understand. John Wyndam's The Day of the Triffids presents a possible side of nature that has not yet been discovered.The novel takes place in the suburbs of England in the early twenty-first century, where Bill Masen has been checked into the hospital after surviving a brutal attack from a triffid, one of a strange species of carnivorous plants. While he is in he hospital, the Earth supposedly passes through a cloud of comet debris, creating what the press call \"the most remarkable celestial spectacle on record.\" However, like many things today, the beautiful meteor shower has a hidden catch - all who watch it will become blind. Bill, who is unable to watch the phenomenon due to his bandaged eyes, awakes in the morning to a deathly silence and to the awful realization that everyone around him is sightless. He ventures out of the hospital and teams up with a young author, Josella Playton, who can see as well. The two explore the country together in hopes of finding more humans who have not become blinded by the shower and instead discover that the triffids have begun to walk and are attacking innocent and blinded humans. The Day of the Triffids relates the story of Bill and Josella's fight to survive in the seemingly impossible.John Wyndam's The Day of the Triffids is an exciting and compelling novel that will keep the reader hanging on every word, just waiting to see what will happen next. The plot of the book is farfetched yet understandable and interesting, and leaves one wondering if something so horrifying could occur in the world today. The terror that Bill and Josella face in their triffid-inhabited world makes the characters easy to relate to and sympathize with. Practically everyone in the world has been faced with a challenge or difficult situation, and The Day of the Triffids just magnifies the fear one might go through. Wyndam strings together a series of events in such a way that every part of the book is engrossing, and he leaves the reader begging for more.For more information on The Day of the Triffids, go to:http://people.ne.mediaone.net/cjr815/reviews/triffids","I love old sci-fi movies -- especially those made in the late 50s and 60s. This book was reminiscent of those old movies. It had the same character build-up, the sense of despair, and horror at what was happening, which was countered with the determination of the individuals to survive no matter what the odds.The book started off well, and continued on in the same vein, giving enough information along the way to paint the picture of what life might be like if nature turned on us and another form of life took over.The story is told through the eyes of Bill Masen, one of the lucky ones who survived the first events and retained his eye sight. Through his eyes we see mankind turning on each other, we desolation, and we experience fear. Fortunately, we also see hope and the will to live through a story well told. I recommend this book.","Definately not one to miss. A great story with an interesting plot. My favorite aspect of the work is its treatment of biological principles. Aside from the other-wordly nature of the story, biologically most of the ideas are pretty sound.","This is a good book and one that more people should take time to read. Dull at parts, but otherwise very interesting. Also, if you like the book, do not watch the 1963 film version. It takes away from the book and gives nothing back.","As if most everyone on earth losing their sight would not be enough of a story line, Wyndham next throws in the Triffids! I enjoyed this book tremendously as Wyndham explored how people survived this dual tragedy. The book is one of my favorites.","This is a fantastic book! It's one of the first science fiction books I've read, and now I want to read John Whyndam's other books. The plot is really good-a world in which most people have gone blind, then eaten by walking, talking plants! I give this book 5 out of 5. I just hope this doesn't happen in real life!","The book has a very simple plot and is good for those who are just starting to read science-fiction. The idea is that these huge plants which can walk and talk [to each other] take over the world. High unbeliveable you might think, well the whole sroy is wound into a clever, but yet not so dramatic as I expected, ending","If you have read the info about the movies about killer plants from outer space, then put that entirely out of your mind. The story is written in first person and there are some things that you will realize by the end of the book which are actually never spelled out. I consider this a classic, and a good book. As to whether there are better stories that use the same scenario, I am not even sure that there are book that use the same scenariio.","\"The Day of the Triffids\" was for many years my favorite sci-fi novel; afterwards it was replaced in that honor place by Herbert's \"Dune\" and Simmon's \"Hyperion\".I've read this novel when I was a teenager in the mythical Argentinean sci-fi magazine \"M?s All?\", it was published there as the main story of the inaugural number.

Rather, the spelling and grammatical errors are from whatever program transcribed the paper text into electronic form. Many of the errors will be a word like \"naive\" that is incorrectly spelt \"hal-e\" or something like that, where the program was approximating the figures.I do recommend reading the book itself and hope the mistakes in this kindle version do not deter others from enjoying it.","I received a Kindle for Christmas, and downloaded this as my very first book from the Amazon.com Kindle Store (I have to use Amazon.com rather than the UK store because I live in Luxembourg). To my deep disappointment the quality of the text itself (I am not talking about the content here) turns out to be completely appalling, to the point where, if I had not had a paper edition available for comparison, I would not always have understood it. For example: at location 121, instead of 'a party for all the world going on', we have 'a parry for all the world going on'; at location 152, instead of 'the lower part of it was not made to open', we have 'the lower pan of it was not made to open'; at location 158, instead of 'be more self-reliant now', we have 'he more self-reliant now'. And so it goes on; it can be seen from the proximity of the locations that these are not isolated typos - the text is littered with these errors. In addition, there are mistakes in punctuation, and no distinction is made between hyphens and dashes (in terms of either length or spacing), which makes the text more nonsensical still. This would make any reader deeply unhappy, I'm sure, and being a wordsmith and editor by profession, I may be even unhappier than the average reader. I am trying very hard not to allow this distressing start to put me off the whole Kindle idea, but it's not easy. I certainly think I am owed a refund of the 7 or so dollars I spent on this product. A corrupt text such as this would be quite unacceptable in a conventional book, and should be equally so in an e-book.","As many others have noticed, the Kindle version of this book is corrupt and I'd encourage you to purchase another version of the book.","I read this book way back when I was a teenager and have never forgotten Wyndham's story. His story is proving to be prophetic as we humans continue to actively attempt to destroy our planet through our neglect and over-reliance and faith in technology.I purchased this edition as a gift for my wife after she mentioned that she'd never read it. I found the price most reasonable and, of course, ordering was quite easy. My thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery.My wife told me that she enjoys the story, too, so it's all good. I give this five stars, partly because of Amazon's price and availability, but also because Wyndham wrote a five-star book.David H. Keith[...]","this book has been made into a movie more than once, which should tell you something in itself. On the surface, it seems to be a typical sci-fi story-the uprising of predator plants. Actually, it is an after-the-holocaust tale that side-steps the usual nuclear war plot device. Written in the middle of the cold war when people were buildilg bomb shelters in their basements, this book has some truely creepy litle scenes in it, as well as examples of human nobility and rationalism. I first read this book when I was in high school (which is starting to be a very long time ago) and have never forgotten it. All of John Wyndham's books are thought provoking. In many ways this book has always reminded me of ALAS BABYLON (also worth your time) from the same era. All these years later it seems prophetic in it's appraisal of science, religion, big business, human nature, the plight of the common man, and the will to survive with dignity under the worst of conditions. It's definately worth a look.","The most interesting fascinating thing about Day of the Triffids is how real the author manages to make his world and his various characters. They actually act like real humans. The world has suffered a calamity and he's in the middle of it. The triffids are part of it, but only a part. Cardboard cutout characters in movies and poorly written sci fi seem to behave as though they only need to survive to the credits. Real people do more. His characters encounter aspects of disaster that a real person would have seen, but which a less intelligent writer would never have thought about. Even more extraordinarily, there are big, serious issues that get raised in a calamity such as this. And here we have people disagreeing without any of them being made obviously right. Shallow writers tell you what the \"right\" answer is by making the \"wrong\" guy behave politically incorrectly; then we see that everything that character says is therefore also wrong, and we can relax, hate them, and go the right way, selected by the author (and of course GOING that way will work out just fine, as the author will demonstrate). In Triffids there are serious dilemmas and all the answers are ugly ones, but via the mechanism of story, we explore the various routes.But Triffids wasn't just a think-piece, a story in some guy's head. It's a ripping yarn, an action tale. It's not a comic book story though, where you get to race through life shooting things, where no one can be tougher than you, so long as your gun is loaded. This is a realistic story, and you can feel yourself being there, trying to decide how YOU would overcome the obstacles he faces. I've read it several times. It's one of my favorite post-apocalypse stories, and once of my favorite science fiction stories. Read and enjoy.","This is a good story of so-called apocalyptic sci-fi. The beginning of the story hugely lacks in credibility, and the triffids are a really way too obvious examples of technology developed by mankind without always weighing the possible negative effects (nuclear holocaust was THE big theme, back then).But the post-apocalypse part is among the better ones written.Also, and this is welcome, Wyndham CAN write, I mean he can write in proper English, with more than a basic vocabulary, which turns the book into literature, wheras, very unfortunately, most sci-fi today is so poorly written, than even when it contains great ideas it just is not literature.","This is My personal favorite Science Fiction/Horror novel that I've ever read, I'm 39 yrs. old and I can still remember digging through my dad's Science Fiction books in the basement of our house when I came across this book, I sat down and read it in 2 day's and what an exhilarating frightening experience it was, one I will never forget. Unfortunately I compare everything to this brilliant story and it's a tough sell, so far Lucifers Hammer, RingWorld by Larry Niven and The Wanderer, Conjure Wife by Fritz Leiber even come close in the sheer power of storytelling. I am still wondering why this hasn't been remade by hollywood with today's technology and actually follow the story this time(unlike the british version), it would be the movie event of the summer. Other stories worth reading by John Wyndham are Out of the Deep, Trouble with Lichen, Re-Birth, The Midwich Cuckoo's they are to put it subtly... awesome!.

The tagline might read: Everyone goes blind in a world ravaged by man eating plants! It sounds like a sixties B horror film... oh yeah, it was made into a sixties B horror film. Somehow, John Wyndham pulls it off. Bill Masen serves as our eyes in this blind world, and tells the tale of his life with total believability. The meteor shower event that causes the blindness and the appearance of the carnivous triffid plants are both explained in such a way as to be convincing. Of course, as is often the case with end of the world stories, the actual end of the world serves only as a setting for how the remaining characters will now interact. How will they live? What will they use for food? Will they develope into a new type of society? Wyndam's end of the world tool works better than most. Having helpless masses of blind people around raises some pretty serious ethical questions that can be related to many real problems in the here and now. And the triffids, they make the task of reinvinting the world just a little bit harder.In &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;, characters grow and express better than in most science fiction novels. Family, love, fidelity, loyalty, and forgiveness are all deftly handled here, and not preachily. The triffids are ever present in the backdrop to the other grander themes.Wyndham, I believe, is going through somewhat of a resurgence, as &quot;The Midwhich Cuckoo's&quot; and &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; will both soon be availble in new less pulpy formats. In their new guise, perhaps they will attract some new readers.My only criticism concerns that trick that writers use to set up an unbelievable event. We see it all the time in the movies: before the truck explodes, they show us a gas leak. That way, when the truck does explode, we not only know why, but we see it as something that was likely to happen. Wyndam uses this tactic to excess, right down to a conversation Bill has with a coworker about how the triffids sure would be deadly to a blind person. &quot;We can see and they can't. Take away that, and the superiority is gone.&quot; That's a somewhat unneccesary foundation, and not the only one of its kind. But in a novel with this monstrosity of a bizarre setting, it is a forgivable mistake to make.","John Wyndham's novels have often been mislabelled \"cosy catastrophes\". However, there is little that is very cosy about The Day of the Triffids, a gritty and poignant novel about global disaster and the end of civilisation. This is an SF classic for very good reasons, not least due to the triffids themselves, wonderfully menacing plant monsters, who take advantage of humanity's disarray to make their bid for world domination. The word \"triffid\", like the word \"dalek\", is now a permanent part of the English language, reason enough to make this novel essential reading for science fiction and mainstream readers alike.","John Wyndham Parkes Lucas Beynon Harris was born in 1903, just outside Birmingham. He wrote under a variety of pen-names, though \"The Day of the Triffids\" was the first time he used the name \"John Wyndham\". It's also is his most famous book and is set in 1950s England.The story is told by Bill Masen, a biologist for the Arctic and European Oil Company. The oil Arctic and European sell, however, isn't used to fuel trains, planes and automobiles : it's a food supplement derived from a recently `discovered' species of plant life known as \"triffids\". Bill believes the species is not a naturally occurring one, but was instead created in a laboratory by scientists. With the Cold War still in full-swing, Bill points the finger squarely at the USSR. It's possible the intention was to create them solely as a food source : the oil derived from triffids is so rich in vitamins that it's seen the bottom fall out of the fish-oil market. However, a triffid is also so dangerous it could also have been created as an extreme form of biological warfare.Triffids are carnivorous plants : insects always provide a quick and easy snack, though as time goes on, they seem to develop a preference for decomposing human flesh. It appears they can hear and make a strange rattling sound that some believe to be a form of communication. Even more dramatically, they can actually walk. They also have very dangerous `stingers', which can reach a length of around ten feet and - if they connect with bare skin - can be fatal. When triffids have attacked humans, they tend to strike first at the head - blinding a remarkably high number of the victims. A colleague of Bill's at Arctic-European believed this to be significant as the only real advantage humans had over triffids was their sight. With this removed from the equation, humans become little more than lunch.Bill's introduction to triffids came at an early age, when triffids were still a novelty and little was known about them. Although stung, he survived - luckily, the triffid in question was immature. As the book opens, Bill is recovering in hospital from another close encounter - a couple of drops of triffid poison splashed into Bill's eyes. The treatment included heavy padding and bandages, meaning that Bill couldn't see a thing. As a result, he missed out on a very dramatic free show : the previous night, the Earth apparently passed through some comet debris that resulted in a dazzling light show in the sky. Unfortunately, it also blinded everyone who watched it. Obviously, protected by his bandages and padding, Bill is now one of the few sighted people left and triffids are now a bigger threat than they should have been.There are some very quaint, old -fashioned elements to this book, the most obvious centring on Bill's relationship with Josella Playton. Josella is the first sighted person meets after leaving the hospital and - shortly after they've shaken hands - start discussing the size of the family they'll have together. Josella, it has to be said, is a good deal more pragmatic than Bill - who seems to be the sort of character born to shout \"I say !\". However, even after the world as we know it has ended, there are still some who seem unwilling to allow Josella to live down a rather racy book she once wrote. Nevertheless, this is definitely well worth reading. In fact, it seems to describe a world we're well familiar with in places : genetically modified plants, biological weapons and a web of satellites orbiting the planet in the name of `defence'.","John Wyndham's books (such as this and THE CHRYSALIDS and THE MIDWICH CUCKOOS) are pretty much classics of the scifi genre in the UK but have not enjoyed the same status in the USA; they're very intelligently crafted and also genuinely scary. THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS is his most famous work, and shows his intellectual debt to HG Wells very clearly. Like THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, it's a catastrophe novel that seems to mirror Britain's anxieties during its long imperial decline that it (and the whole world) was on the brink of utter chaos. In this book, giant ambulatory poisonous, carnivorous plants, called \"triffids\" have been created through the errors of human bioengineering; not long after, a mysterious spectacular meteor shower blinds everyone on Earth who sees it, leaving them at the mercy of the triffids.The triffids sound a bit ridiculous when described but you almost immediately believe in their possibility when you read this novel; what makes them so frightening and effective is that they're fairly slow in moving (except when they whip out their poisonous tendrils for the kill) and behave fairly instinctually, so the characters, preoccupied with their planet's social catastrophe, tend to forget about the menace they pose until its too late. Indeed, the triffids are mostly background menaces for the real subject of the book, which is the possibilities of new social structures after the apocalypse. The novel's hero comes across several new survivor communities, organized (variously) on feudal, Christian, and eugenicist/breeding models, and Wyndham seems greatly interested in comparing them. It might be that there's just too much, in the end, going on in this book, especially since the creation of the triffids and the meteor shower seem ultimately coincidental. Yet it's a hard book to put down, and the vein of anti-feminism that runs through it makes it exceptionally intriguing as a peice of post-War social commentary. Anbd you'll never forget the triffids themselves.","i know that George Romero's 1968 masterpiece NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD was the first film to feature hordes of mindless zombies roaming the countryside looking for nice tasty humans to eat, but what i want to know is \"what was the first book to feature the same?\".the reason i'm asking is if you replace the triffids in this book with dead humans then you've got a very interesting zombie story.that said this is a great book. very imaginative, fast-paced and hard to put down. i can't wait to read some more wyndham.","The Day of the Triffids is a classic end-of-the-world sci-fi novel set in England. Two bizarre things happen at the beginning of the novel to create disaster. Number 1: Science \"discovers\" walking plants that are named Triffids that can communicate among themselves. Our narrator, Bill Masen, believes that they are the result of Russian military testing, possibly meant to be a weapon, but they quickly spread all over the world. The Triffid is harmless enough until it grows to be man-sized. Then, it is able to walk by using its branches to swing its trunk, similar to the way a man on crutches walks. Once it walks, it is also able to hunt with this long whip-like tentacle with a poisoned tip. The Triffids like to eat putrid, rotting meat, much like a Venus Flytrap. It tears the meat loose with its tentacle.The Triffids are more of a curiosity to the world, though until bizarre thing #2 happens: There is a meteor shower one night - it is very bright and people all over the world watch it because it goes on all night. The next day, everyone who saw any part of the shower goes blind. Our narrator, however, is not blind because he had hospitalized for eye surgery and his eyes had been bandaged the night of the shower. Masen believes the meteor shower was not a natural ocurrence, but rather it was all a mistaken attack by an American or Russian satellite with a space-based radiation weapon.The rest of the book concerns Masen and his struggle to survive. Everything collapses when 95% of the population goes blind. The whole of England becomes a Mad Max environment and different types of communities are formed to attempt to deal with the blind survivors, the Triffids and the threat from other sighted survivors.All in all, its a good read and it holds up well, considering it is 50+ years old. Wyndham did a great job of prediciting the Cold War and the buildup of weapons and the push to harnass science for military applications. I would assume that this book had been read by the creators of Mad Max because they share a lot of the same images. However, don't get this book confused with the constant violence of the Road Warrior. Those scenes are rare, even if the settings are similar. This is a much more philosophical work, with lots of discussion about the nature of man.","I couldn't believe I would like this book when my dad recommended it to me. But I had to read something anyway for my English-class and man was my first impression wrong!This book changed my life! I was wondering all the time what I would do in that situation and kept on fantasising about that after finishing the book. It also got me really into the (post-)apocalyptic novels and the other books of Wyndham. Still, this one is my all-time favourite.A book that comes close is 'Lucifer' by Pournelle &amp; Niven. But it's also nice to read the follow-up: 'the night of the triffids'.I hope some day someone will write yet another book about triffids.","An excellent book - I only read it recently (despite its being on my 'to read' list for many years now) although can remember seeing a pretty cheesy series or movie of it on TV in the UK many years ago. The book is dark and frightening and very well written. Although I have only read one other Wyndham (The Chysalids), I intend to read a lot more. Anyone looking for some fine early science fiction should read some Wyndham - it as aged reasonably well and contains all the ingredients for a good read. I highly recommend this book.","If you saw the movie as a youngster who hadn't read the book, you probably had nightmares. If you saw it as an adult, or a kid who had read the book, you most certainly were disappointed. What Wyndham does here is put the reader into close contact with a very believable world. Maybe those satellites twirling around up there can't really blind us all; maybe plants such as these can never be produced by humankind, but Wyndham deftly (and, I think correctly) speculates on the events that would take place if those things did happen. Here, in The Day Of the Triffids these things did happen and the reader is, hand-in-hand with the hero, taken along on a dark and disturbing journey through a nightmare landscape. It is not just the Triffids that produce the horror; it is Wyndham's insightful portrayal of the actions and reactions of our fellow beings that disrupt our ease; that produces the horror that certainly lurks just below the surface of our present maelstrom world society.","Ignore the film. While a bit atmospheric, it's nowhere as close to the book as Village Of The Damned is to The Midwich Cuckoos. Instead, read this book because it's a complex but approachable book about the human condition on so many levels. Less imaginative science fiction fans may warn you away because it doesn't feature galactic empires or anthropomorphic horrors, but all the better. This is an imaginative and, you bet, classic book from a man who, along with Clifford Simak, knows how to invade the Earth in a genuinely horrifying way.While enjoying this book, keep an eye out for a copy of his even better invasion novel The Kraken Wakes (Out Of The Deeps). Ahead of its time in many ways.","I fell in love with Wyndham after &quot;The Kraken Wakes&quot;--his novels, just saturated with intelligent, thought-provoking, sometimes humorous and sometimes scary ideas reminds me of Aldous Huxley. &quot;Triffids&quot; is another fantastic piece of 'Science Fiction'. Wyndham once again takes us through yet another variation of The End Of The World As We Know It, and this one is very very eerie indeed. The desolation, the tribalness of the survivors, and the sheer loneliness and isolation pressing down on his hero, William Masen, as he wanders through the wreckage of London in search of his post-apocalypse friend, are very effective. So two are the matter-of-fact and chilling suicides of the blind survivors he comes across--one blind doctor tells Masen to lead him to his office, asks kindly in which direction the window is, and proceeds to jump through it without another word.Unfortunately it's just not as accomplished as 'Kraken Wakes'. And since I read 'Kraken' first, I have to give this one less star. I don't know if its just less believeable, or that Wyndham touches on a few of the same themes (and even locations!) in both novels that rubs off some of the magic, but there you have it.However, that's only a comparative comment. This book is fantastic. Everyone should read it."],

      "reviews.text":["The novel has an excellent opening. The hero appears to be the only one left who can see, in a world gone blind... then the strange plants begin their attack on humanity. There are some very imaginative and thoughtful elements featuring throughout the book and Wyndham makes the seemingly absurd plot convincing. In summary, the book is extremely readable and has a satisfying 'feel-good' ending. It does however become somewhat dissapointingly nostalgic.","I've obtained that book from my father. I've thought it's an ordinary book as many others as I've taken it in my hands, but it was a mistake...When I've opened it and begun to read, I wasn't able to stop. I hadn't to eat or drink - a reading was all that I've needed. I was taken into the story I was in the book, my world obtained a new dimension. It was wonderful...What everything would happen, when something &quot; in the sky &quot; will destroy. A few lights, a few beautifull lights on the sky and - all men are blind. Almost all... Some of them survived wihout a damege of eyes, because they didn't see that strange light - stroke of luck. One of them is our hero. He was at the hospital in sake of his eyes at that time. Once, when he wake up, he found out that something is wrong, something about the people all around him. - People gone blind ! - In this way begins his story..., he goes throgh the city and he see a lot of unhappy blind people, which try to get somewhere, which try to do something. A new world begins... A world with only one right - the right of the stranger. A blind people will die and all of them who are alive wants only one - to stay alive another day. It's bad, a many people are bad, at's stange. In this time we can see who is who - everything best and worst will rise up from deep inside of human. It's interesting to see it. And that is not all - a special kind of living form, something between a plant and animal, which is able to kill - such a creature begines to go among the people and it kills them. People which stayed alive and want to stay alive have to be together. They are able to resist only in this way and it's hard. A many different people with various kind of behavour and the alliens - the Triffids -. /.../ This book is not serious only, it's humorous too. You have to read it, because it's not possible to write as good this book really is. You will see, you haven't feel such intensive experience anytime before...","2.5 stars. I really wanted to like this novel; it's in the Masterwork series, I enjoyed the Sci-fi mini-series they made a few years ago of the same title, and I love the post-apocalyptic genre. However, this book really disappointed me for a couple reasons.Wyndham is unnecessarily long-winded. This is often a criticism heard from young people today w/ respect to older works. It often engenders a feeling that these young people are too impatient to enjoy these classic pieces. I am not young and I have enjoyed classic sci-fi for my entire life. However, Wyndham is tedious and bland to the point that he ruins whatever tension or drama may have existed in his story. This may be due to Wyndham's lot in life as a British author and a reflection of the times, but I have never felt that his contemporaries' stories bogged down quite like Triffids. The attention paid to innocuous dialogs and trivial details slowed this book down and made me feel like I was following someone around as they got fitted for a custom-made pair of socks, rather than reading about someone coping w/ a global extinction event.Secondly, where are the titular characters the Triffids?? A more accurate title for this novel would be \"Grocery Shopping at the End of the World and the Minor Inconvenience of the Triffids.\" Wyndham does a superb job during the first 40 pages of describing the Triffid's origin and their modern uses, pre-catastrophe. This was my favorite part of the book. However, for the next 200 pages the Triffids make only brief appearances and are ancillary to the main plot. Additionally, there is no drama in the main character's clashes w/ the Triffids. Wyndham's writing style reduces the interactions w/ the Triffids to \"Oh look, a Triffid, well I'll go get my shotgun and blow it's sting off. Then we can get back to talking about groceries.\" Only in the last 20 pages of the book do the Triffids rise up as a menace that can't be ignored. However, even then Wyndham deals w/ the encroachment of the Triffids in such an off-hand manner that I was totally turned off w/ how he handled them.The plot of this book was incredibly imaginative and I love the allegory. I'm thankful to Wyndham for his contribution to the genre, but I can't bring myself to recommend this book on its own merits. I would recommend reading it simply to appreciate how its ideas shaped other works.","I can't understand why this book is on so many \"best SF novels\" lists and so highly rated by other reviewers here. This is not a bad book - the writing is uniformly readable and artistic in spots, and I didn't find it objectionable to read through to the end - it's just that I would never encourage anyone to read it instead of many, many other SF novels. The premise might have seemed compelling in the paranoia-stricken 1950s, but now it seems anachronistic and underdeveloped. Multiple bogeys, the hero and his heroine fighting the good fight against them. In places the musings on the loneliness of the survivor are interesting - particular given the British perspective, with the thought that Americans were somewhat born from the longing for this loneliness, while those that stayed in Europe feared it. Otherwise I found the characters to be near-wooden and unbelievable. A child's parents disappear and her little brother is killed before her eyes, leaving her alone - she has a cry before bedtime and is fine from then on. Please.ReadThe Road (Movie Tie-in Edition 2009) (Vintage International)and leave this one.","An important book from the 1950's, one that I remember affecting me strongly as a teenager. Well worth a read now although a bit stuffy by modern standards.","There's one point that other reviewers have missed.The author represents the traditional left-wing viewpoint quite well. On the surface, he is all bluster about the wickedness of profits, etc. but if you read the book carefully, you will notice that everyone who survives unblinded is middle-class. The workers need looking after by a paternalist dictatorship.Otherwise, I agree with the consensus or other reviewers. It's a great SF read.","It's British sci-fi from 1952, at the threshold of our era of fear of nuclear warfare, biological terrorism, and ecological catastrophe, all of which author John Wyndham foresaw with plegmatic prescience. The tale begins with a global disaster, in which the vast majority of humans and quadrupeds are blinded by atmospheric luminescence, eventually revealed to be the result of a 'mistake' in the Reaganesque orbiting of defensive/offensive weaponry. Right on the heels of one man-made disaster of space weaponry, another strikes in the form of a plague caused by an orbited laboratory virus. Most uncanny and horrifying of all, scientists in the USSR have developed a plant that can walk, hear, communicate vaguely with others of its kind, and kill with venom delivered by a lashing tentacle. It turns out to have great commercial value, as long as it remains under control (Aha! Greed as the root of all catastrophe!), but once it gets loose, as the Brits would say, it's a bl**dy ugly customer.The recognition that such perceptions of humanity's self-caused plight were possible in 1952 constitutes the main reason wny anyone might want to read \"The Day of the Triffids\" in 2009. The writing style is thin, the character development is podgy at best, the action is deftly limited to an intensity that wouldn't upset a nanny reading to a toddler, and the inevitable romantic involvement is prudish even by recrudescent Victorian norms. This is not one of the literary masterpieces of science-fiction, not equal to Wells or Stapledon in intrinsic interest, certainly not on a par with Karel Capek's \"War of the Newts\", another tale of inter-species armageddon. But it's not a bad quick read on a long flight.","I'm not so much for long narratives, and this book is one of them.The story is about the aftermath of meteor showers as a lot have thought them to be. Almost all people went blind except for a few. Recovery was initiated by small groups, but the triffids, plants who seem to have a mind of their own slowed the process. The story mentioned 6 years since the tragic circumstances started. Even after this time, triffids were still abounding, and man was still fighting to eradicate them. That's where it ended, with a few words to give some glimpse of hope into the future.For all it's long narratives, I was still left wanting at the end. The chaos was still there, albeit an organized chaos. Nothing has changed except that there were now more people (babies conceived and born after the tragedy). The struggle to fight off the triffids was still there. I believe the lesson that the author wanted his readers to take is that man will fight to survive, and to go on living, he'll make do with what's available for him. The lesson can be gleamed from the story alright, it just wasn't much of a reading pleasure for me.","In my opinion this book isn't quite in the same league as Alas, Babylon, On The Beach, A Canticle for Leibowitz, or Earth Abides, but it is very good and belongs in the pantheon of classic science fiction literature.Some have pointed out the dated feel and attitudes of the book, but I don't mind those qualities. I enjoy getting a window into the sensibilities of the world before I knew it. The premise of the story isn't a problem for me either, even considering the idea of walking, thinking, communicating, killer sunflower plants chasing around a population of blind people. If I have a complaint, it's a mild one: I sometimes wished the author would have been more concise in his writing... some sections were a bit long-winded. Perhaps it was a function of his British station and the period in which the book was written that Wyndham used so much exposition. Still, it's a minor criticism and it didn't affect the flow of the story or my opinion of the book overall.","Over a week passed since I got a message that the books had been sent. I emailed an inquiry, but got no answer. After I received the books, I realized they came from overseas. If I had known this I would have been more patient. This information should be made more clear.The books were in excellent condition and made good gifts.","Well, this is the book that started it. I really enjoyed this book. Naturally it goes further into the reason as to why the \"Triffids\" started in the first place. However, I must say that the movie starring Howard Keel (\"Showboat\") was excellent as well.","This is a entertaining story that will make you wonder about flowers and how they are thought to be just flowers! The story moves along nicely and is very believable. It will make you look at flowers differently and wonder if you should really be talking to them. It is a light sci fi/fantasy story and readers new to the sci fi genre will find it very readable. They may never look at new flowers in the same way again.","This is a terrific book, much unlike the 1960's film of the same name. Aside from the triffids, the novel and the film are actually quite dissimilar. My issue is with the RosettaBooks version - I don't know if it's just a Kindle problem (I read mine on a Fire) or if it goes for the print version as well, but my E-book was loaded with misspellings and missing punctuation. It was more a nuisance than anything else, but it's hard to believe that an editor okay'd this for publication. That said, it was still a very enjoyable read. My first Wyndham novel but certainly not my last!","A good book with much food for thought. Tightly plotted and well-written. The proper English was a bit clunky for me and lacked the dry humor of other British sci-fi authors, but overall, I can see why it's a sci-fi classic.","My favorite Wyndham books are The Kraken and The Midwich Cookoos (also known as children of the Damned). This is a really great book.","i was pleasantly surprised by this book. i normally dont like \"old\" books as in books written before the 80s. no offense to them, just usually not into the writing style and even though they were the originals, alot of their ideas are now cliche. but this book, was awesome. sure the dialogue was alittle formal at times but i the author managed to not make it corny w the smart killer plants. definately recommend to all post-apoc fans. it will keep you reading and it is quite well written.","The premise of Triffids seems cheesy enough: venomous tripedal plants stalk the land of England while most people are struck blind by a mysterious comet's emissions. However, when the reader witnesses witty and often insightful writing skills, all cheesiness vanishes and the remnants of a seriously undertaking is revealed. I loved the bucolic English landscape being traversed, much like it was in H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds. Brilliant countryside to visit and travel upon!The opening paragraph has me hook, line and sinker: `When a day you happen to know is Wednesday starts off by sounding like Sunday, there is something seriously wrong somewhere.' Wyndham often finds little nooks and crannies in his salubrious plot to fill with humor, be it a chuckle or an outburst of laughter on my part. It's always unexpected and kept me on my toes while being exposed to the trials and hardships being experiences by the survivors of the ordeal.When the double tragedy of arboreal attacks compounding the widespread blindness surfaces, the Latin quip `In regione caecorum rex est luscus' takes a toehold. Those who retain their sight, through their own personal misfortune yet pure luck, are able to safely traverse the city, scavenge the stores of food and find shelter. Eventually, some of the blind begin to stalk and persecute the able-eyed, shackling them and having them lead food foraging. Wyndham covers a wide range of how different communities come to cope with the tragedy. The able-eyed lead and care for the blind is only one solution.Other solution include a small commune sheltered in a country home, a religious reclusive community behind stone walls, a scientific approach to the problem with emphasis on births and science, or even a militant stance with the vision of assimilating other sects of those with vision. The reader is taken through all of these scenarios and the case for and against each situation is given, which I found to be enlightening. Usually an author has a tight, unshiftable focus and the plot beelines towards a predictable end. Wyndham, however, veers through all possibilities and lets the reader assume the role of judge.Beyond being insightful, witty and enlightening, the vocabulary is graceful and at times sexy (for those with lexiophilia). It's just a steadily hale and hearty, like beef, and full of lipoidal goodness, like butter. As a post-apocalyptic novel, it's dead on the mark with lists of items which need to be hoarded in order to live through the winter and through the years. My only grievance with the novel is the superfluous role the triffids take and the foregone bland explanation for the blindness. The intelligent reader could have constructed a more plausible if not terror-filled scenario for the tragic events. Wyndham leaves a rather acerbic taste on the tongue when the circumstances of the blindness and the triffids are discussed.","Re-reading this after many years, it is good to know that the novel still holds up as one of the all time classics of literature. Less of a science fiction novel but more a story of survival against the odds following the total break-down of society. A grand novel from a master novelist.","I read through this gem the past few days and it was far better than the movies. It does a nice job of character development and situational explanation of the lights in the sky, what happens after and the triffids being \"harmless\" resources man created. Resources that get loose once man is 99.9% blinded overnight.I really liked the speculation on the trees intelligence which added a new dimension, to me, not found in the original movie. I also liked the protagonists assumption that the lights int he sky may have been a sattelite weapon gone wrong. Very different vibe to the movies and for that I enjoyed it a lot.","I know that a book with carnivorous plants sounds like, umm ... well, a bad 1960's Star Trek episode. But, to pass this book by would be a mistake. It is an excellent read. Ultimately the story is a case study of what it takes to make the hard decisions. After a cataclysmic event, do you decide to help humanity or yourself? And, what would the ramifications be for either decision? You may find out that looking after yourself and saying to hell with the rest of humanity might be the only choice no matter how deplorable that may seem. It makes you think. This would be a great sci-fi pick for a book club.","John Wyndham was clearly influenced by H. G. Wells. There is a reference in this story to \"The Country Of The Blind\", and certainly the story itself borrows more than a little from \"The War Of The Worlds\", as Edmund Morris discusses in his introduction to this edition. There are many differences between \"The Day Of The Triffids\" and The War Of The Worlds\" as well. Wyndham's triffids are not the invincible threat that Wells' Martians were, and they are often not the most immediate problem for the characters in the story. The triffids appear off and on for most of the story, as William Masen has to deal with helping the blind, gathering food, disease, and dealing with the chaos of a civilization which has come crashing down.The story opens with William recovering in the hospital, but finding that on the day his bandages were to be removed, that there weren't any people working in the hospital, and that the city itself was very quiet. William had to work with the triffids prior to the disaster, and ironically, they are responsible in a way for his keeping his sight. After removing the bandages himself, he quickly discovers that almost the entire city has gone blind, and that indeed it appeared to be a world wide phenomenon. He manages to find Josella Playton, who has also managed to avoid the loss of her sight, and together they set about finding a way to survive. Wyndham does a great job of bringing the triffids into the story, and then letting them drift into the background, only to bring them forward again for most of the story.Wyndham deals with many issues in this story; including ethics, and the threat of biological warfare. This is a very solid story, and interesting to read. One might think that the fall of civilization would result in a lot more problems then appear in this book in terms of human interactions, but that doesn't harm its overall message. This book was nominated for the International Fantasy Award in 1952.","Many novels have the adjective \"brilliant\" fixed to their name. For some this is justified, for others not. \"The Day of the Triffids\" falls into the former category.The essence of John Wyndham's tale is that a massive meteor shower is watched by most of the world's population. The next day, most of the population wakes to find themselves absolutely blind. A handful miss the shower for various reasons including the novel's narrator, Bill Masen, who was in hospital having eye surgery. His eyes are thus bandaged and the glorious shower is missed. He can count himself very lucky!Coinciding with the shower is the emergence of Triffids; plants that are both extremely poisonous and mobile. They can actually lift their roots and move to another location. Triffids plus near universal human blindness puts civilization and the human race in extreme peril. The modern world disappears as humans revert to barbarism and feudalism. Several theories are tested as to how the comet shower occurred but no one explanation can be proved. The threat to humanity, however, is very real.John Wyndham's novel is now more than fifty years old but still reads wonderfully well. He paints a bleak scenario in which the remaining sighted humans must strive to rebuild a modern world. It is often a battle between good and evil and the resultant victor is not always clear. Wyndham was probably using an analogy for a post nuclear holocaust world. His message is as fresh today as it was during a time of cold war hostility.","It is interesting to read stories that were written 40 to 50 years ago. This one starts fast and doesn't let you go until the end.Just the prospect of almost every one going blind gives me the chill. To be attacked by murderous carnivorous plants is an horror added on terror. This is a story that could be remade in a movie. It could be much better than \"28 days\".Wyndham is very good at describing the different ways that people would react to such an holocaust. The principal character's quest to find his new love is very well integrated with the story.You can almost see the thousands of triffids waiting at the gates for you to come out. Read this book please and if you know a movie producer, give him your book.","The Day of the Triffids is set in the suburbs of England in the early twenty-first century. Bill Masen, the main character, is admitted to the hospital after having survived a savage attack by a triffid, a strange and unusual carnivorous plant. During the assault, the triffid struck him across the face, injuring his eyes. The doctors are making every effort to prevent Bill from becoming blind by performing a risky surgery. Little do they know, they will save his sight more than once. While Bill is in the hospital, the Earth passes through what is believed to be a cloud of comet debris, creating what the press calls, \"the most remarkable celestial spectacle on record.\" However, the beautiful meteor shower has a hidden catch - all who watch it become blind. Bill, who is unable to view the phenomenon due to his bandaged eyes, awakens the next morning to a deathly silence. After removing his bandages, he comes to the awful realization that everyone around him is sightless. He ventures out of the hospital and teams up with a young author, Josella Playton, another lucky person who can see as well. Together they explore the country in the hope of finding more humans who have not been blinded by the meteor shower. Instead, they discover that the triffids have begun to walk and are attacking the blinded humans. The Day of the Triffids relates the story of Bill and Josella's fight to survive against seemingly impossible odds in a world of chaos, violence, and destruction.John Wyndham's The Day of the Triffids is an exciting and compelling novel that will keep the reader hanging on to every word, just waiting to see what will happen next. The plot of the book is farfetched yet understandable and interesting, and leaves one wondering if something so horrifying could occur in the world today. It also makes one think about whether or not our advances in science are actually as beneficial as they initially seem. Is the human race getting too smart for their own good? Wyndham strings together a series of events in such a way that every part of the book is engrossing, and he leaves the reader begging for more.","My father was given this book as a 14 year old, and lost it until a few years ago it was found and returned to him. We both read it now at least once a year, but as i had never seen a copy besides our 1950s edition i was happily surprised to find this page. all i can say is i am buying my own copy right now, and this novel is a must read for anyone who loves true science fiction. Its a battle of man against his own worst nature, and a wonderfully thought provoking read. from the first page the author offers truly well crafted text, and it just keeps on coming. You MUST own this book.","I was initially skeptical that &quot;science fiction&quot; almost fifty years old would be able to keep my interest on the way back from Christchurch, but the sign at Whitcoulls said it was one of their &quot;top 100 books of the century.&quot;What a great read!Wyndham does an excellent job getting us interested by opening with the &quot;crisis&quot; -- Bill Masen wakes up in his hospital room expecting to have his bandages removed after an eye injury, but instead being faced with silence. Thinking he's been overlooked, he ventures out to discover that society has been unraveled.As the story progresses, we learn more on the origins of the Triffids and Bill Masen's connection with them.Wyndham doesn't bog the reader down with the minutae of genetic engineering, but presents enough plausible background to the story that one can enjoy the book today or half a century ago.Wyndham also explores the &quot;what ifs&quot; as society attempts to rebuild itself and debate how it can accomodate the blind into the new society.","It's one of the few Sci-Fi books I actually like. Very well written","John Wyndham was the pseudonym of John Wyndham Parkes Lucas Beynon Harris (1903-1969). This novel is regarded as one of the classics of science fiction literature and was made into a film in 1963 (poorly made). The book was runnerup for the 1952 International Fantasy Award. It is one of the classic examples of the &quot;disaster novel;&quot; or, more specifically, the sub-genre referred to as the &quot;cozy catastrophe&quot; in which a world-wide disaster is depicted in such a manner that the reader doesn't feel too upset and roots for the main character to overcome all odds. This novel set the pattern for many later novels of other authors: a disaster occurs, a large city is depopulated, panic develops, bravery is seen in the main characters, and a small core of individuals strive to build a foundation from which mankind can reestablish his position. (The synopsis given above with the publisher's comments is wrong. Wyndham is not the father of the disaster nove. There were several prior to 1951.) In this particular story, a series of green showers from a comet's tail (we are later told that this may have been a weapon in orbit that had been accidentally set off by an Earth government) cause most of Earth's inhabitants to become blind. Only the few who didn't see the showers (such as the main character Bill Mason who was in a hospital) can see. Later, a plague (possibly originating from a biological weapon) kills many survivors. But, the main malevolent force in the novel are the triffids: carniverous plants that can walk. Bill Mason believes these plants to have been genetically engineered by the Soviet Union and were accidentally released. Now that mankind is blind, the triffids &quot;day&quot; has come. The word &quot;triffid,&quot; first used in this novel, has even gotten into the English language as a term describing any malevolent or obnoxious plant.","I wouldn't suggest reading the book. The only similarities between the two are the Triffids (walking plants), the setting (everyone blind) and some of the names. If you haven't watched the film, or you didn't like it very much, I would most definitely urge you to read this book.What I liked so much about it was the philosophies raised - what is morally correct when society has been destroyed? Is it really *right* to try to help a few people for a short while, or to save yourself and give society a chance to be rebuilt? A great plot, good characters and interesting moral dilemmas.","This novel is remarkable for introducing several ideas, and for setting new benchmarks for other speculative novels. Wyndham doesn't bog himself down in the technical details of the end of society, instead he focuses on the human effects. Perhaps more telling, he allows his characters to muddle about and take their time learning how to live in a decimated world., thus enabling the reader to constantly consider \"What would I do?\" An apocalyptic novel unlike any other","First published in 1951, this intelligent and fascinating novel tells the story of a global cataclysm that results in a world in which most of the population is blind, and all become the prey of flesh-eating plants that can \"walk\" and, perhaps, think and communicate. That brief summary makes it sound like something from a B-grade horror movie collection, but such a characterization would be unfair and inaccurate. Told from the first-person perspective of one of the sighted survivors, the novel quickly establishes a strong narrative voice for Bill Masen as he attempts to understand what has happened to the comfortable world he knew as recently as the day before. He manages to piece the picture together, both from his own observations and experience (he had been employed as a biologist working with commercialized triffids), and from observing and talking with others. It becomes clear that whatever the storm of \"green comets\" was that lit up the night sky, it either was something, or triggered something, that has permanently altered the conditions--personal, social, economic, political, material--under which everyone, sighted or blind, now lives. What is never clear exactly how blindness was caused in most of the population, but that's not really the point. The point is that they are blind, and in this state their greatest advantage over the triffids is gone. Indeed, since the triffids have never had sight, they have an advantage over the newly-blind humans in that they \"know\" (if that is the right word) how to function without sight.Much has been made by commentators about the Cold War context of the novel, and certainly knowing that context can add a dimension to your reading. A population living with the possibility of nuclear catastrophe gets a catastrophe quite different from the one that haunted their thoughts, and yet it is one that grew out of the very competition that defined the Cold War. But even without that context, Wyndham's novel succeeds both as a sociological thought experiment and as a wonderfully told story. One of the questions at the heart of the novel is how (and whether) to build a new community when so many of the conditions, mores, habits of mind, practices, and rules that buttressed the old one have gone. Several alternatives for a reorganized society arise in the days and months following the initial crisis. The pitfalls of most of them become apparent fairly quickly, but the issue remains: most human beings by their nature (or at least by habit) are inclined toward society and some kind of social and political organization, be it large or small. But will people be left alone to make their own way in the new reality, or will some social/political structure be forced upon them by those who have, for good or ill, managed to organize themselves more quickly than others? What is the obligation of the sighted to the blind? And, as a plague begins to spread with devastating effect, what responsibility do the healthy have to the dying? Though the story of the triffids never completely recedes, some of the most interesting sections of the book (for me) were those in which Wyndham's characters discuss--and act out--the tensions inherent in such questions. As Wyndham interlaced the survival story with his sociological and political speculations, I was often reminded of \"Shantung Compound,\" American theologian Langdon Gilkey's 1966 book about his own captivity in a Japanese prison camp in China during World War II. (Gilkey had gone to China to teach English.) One of the striking things about Gilkey's book is his description of how quickly the prisoners went about organizing themselves, though they were largely strangers to one another prior to their internment. Indeed, creating some kind of camp organization was one of their very first tasks. Wyndham's fictional story and Gilkey's memoir draw from the same insights into human nature.Wyndham is able to move the story back and forth from these broad sociological questions to more intimate and personal concerns. At times, the story is essentially a search for love, or at least for a specific human connection that is more powerful than a generalized connection to humanity. One thing the novel is not, however, is a return-to-nature story. Far from it. The pendulum has swung back--from humans moving back the desert and the forests to wild growth retaking former human settlements--but this is seen neither as a form of cosmic justice nor as a chance to return to an idyllic existence based on small agriculture. The presence of the triffids makes the latter option untenable. Don't be put off by the funny title or the premise that may initially be hard to take seriously. Wyndham's novel is serious, enjoyable, thought-provoking, and well worth the time.","I discovered \"Day of Triffids\" when I was around 11 years old... too many years ago for me to mention. It was the first John Wyndham book I read and probably my favorite. It's a close call but another Wyndham book, \"Chrysalids\", is another close contender for that title.I wont waffle on about the story line in Triffids its covered comprehensibly by other reviews. Suffice to say the book is classic sci-fi, mixed with light scary horror and oodles of imagination. It sets the readers mind alight with terrific \"what if\" concepts.Highly recommended.","For a very long time I avoided reading The Day of the Triffids because I thought the notion of flesh-eating plants gobbling up the newly-blind population of England would be the literary equivalent ofThe Little Shop of Horrors(\"Feeeed Meeeeee\") -- so awful that it might be funny, but not to be taken seriously. My bad. I finally read it and I wish I had done so years ago so that I could enjoy rereading it now. The Day of the Triffids is a masterpiece.This is a novel that challenges the intellect. As the story progresses, characters intelligently debate a variety of topics: the nature of leadership, the role of women in a survivalist society (from a 1951 perspective), whether spirituality conflicts with practicality in extreme situations. The book poses moral questions to which there are no easy answers: Should the sighted form their own society, separate from the blind (who arguably would contribute little and drain their resources), to assure humanity's survival? Or should the sighted help the blind survive, knowing that the overwhelming task is mostly futile, that they would merely be postponing the day when triffids will devour the blind, and knowing that they might risk humanity's survival by diverting their attention from efforts to preserve the fittest? When most of humanity is destined to die, should sighted men impregnate as many women as possible to assure that the human race continues, or should monogamy remain the norm? Wyndham provides no easy answers; he raises the questions and leaves it to the reader to decide. Some will dislike that kind of moral ambiguity but the preponderance of five star reviews indicates that most readers enjoy having their minds stimulated by this fascinating novel. I certainly did.The Day of the Triffids works on many levels: as a science fiction adventure, a love story, a morality play, an allegory about the breakdown of societal structures, and one of the strangest visions of the apocalypse ever imagined. It works so well because Wyndham wrote in a convincing voice, using understated prose, giving believable dialog to credible characters. Some are arrogant, some are decent, some are just lost. He wrote about the fundamental emotions of fear, hope, despair, loneliness, and love. The Day of the Triffids has joinedA Canticle for LeibowitzandAlas, Babylonas my favorite post-apocalyptic novels.","Nothing taps into primal fear like the thought of true loneliness. One of the central themes of countless Twilight Zones was the fear of being alone, whether in a post-nuclear world where every one had been killed or one that looks exactly like our own, only without people. From page one, Wyndham taps into that fear and confronts it at every turn. We start the book to discover that the main character, Bill Masen, has been temporarily blinded by a mutant plant called a Triffid that he was essentially caring for. He finds himself alone, in a hospital, bandages on his eyes, completely apart from the rest of humanity who happen to be enthralled by a rare meteor shower taking place at that time. When the celestial event ends, Masen finds himself even more alone, as the voices around him have gone silent. Removing his bandages, he eventually realizes that while he can see, the rest of the world has gone blind. Masen is alone again, this time cursed to be one of the sightless in the land of the blind.From here on out, the story follows a somewhat standard post-catastrophe plot line in which survivor fights his way through a decaying world in an effort to reestablish order and sanity; but while the scope of events may be predictable, the nature of the events as Wyndham unfolds them and the immediacy with which he writes gives the story a horror that easily could have descended into camp. Masen meets friends, only to lose them; finds love, only to lose it. The threat of loneliness- of being a seeing freak in the land of the blind, AND of being a human in the land of the suddenly murderous Triffids- lingers over Masen every minute, whether awake or asleep.\"Day of the Triffids\" is easily one of the more memorable and haunting entries in the post-apocalyptic novel genre.","You won't read this book if you base your decision on a quick summary: \"A mysterious green meteor shower blinds most of humanity, who are then preyed upon by large, ambulatory, three-legged plants that lash long, poisonous, whip-like tentacles out of their stalks. Our hero, spared the blindness by a timely stay in the hospital, finds romance and socio-political insight as he helps rebuild civilization. All of this happens in the UK.\"Suspend your disbelief and read the book. The motivations and actions of people trying to survive are realistic and interesting. And the various philosophies for both individual and group survival are thought-provoking. You will enjoy this story if you have enjoyed any ofThe Stand,Alas, Babylon, orEarth Abides. It is a thoughtful exploration of the fall of civilization and its implications, packaged in an engaging adventure. Good reading.A caution: Enjoying science fiction always requires some suspension of disbelief. Even more so with older science fiction. In this case, the story and exploration of ideas is worth this effort. Don't trouble yourself wondering why the cold of winter doesn't help human beings in their struggle with these walking plants. Or why most of the unstable triffids don't expire in some \"I've fallen and can't get up\" scenario. (Their anatomy as described wouldn't permit them to bend enough to get up from a prone position.) You can find more of these issues if you try. Don't. Not the first time through, anyway. Just enjoy a great story from one of the masters of early science fiction.","This is a wonderfully told apocalyptic tale, as relevant today as it was in nineteen hundred and fifty one, when it was first published. Well-written, with believable characters and dialogue, it is rich with social issues that provide much food for thought.This is definitely a book that has withstood the test of time and remains one of the finest examples of science fiction ever written and a true classic. It is much more three dimensional than the movie that was made based upon the book. That being said, I confess that I did enjoy the movie, which starred Howard Keel. The book, however, is much richer fare.The triffid is a unique form of plant life, with appetites similar to a Venus flytrap, and is believed to have been genetically engineered by the Russians, though its true origin remains unknown. It also is able to pick up its roots and lurch about, almost as if it were walking, and seems to manifest a rudimentary intelligence.Ever resourceful, mankind puts the triffids to work and harvests the rich oils that they produce. The only true drawback of the triffid is that it also has a stem that can lash out and sting a person with enough poison to kill. Still, mankind finds a way to control even this aberration of the oil rich triffid, now viewed as a profitable form of vegetation.Then, came the meteorite shower, a stellar phenomena that lit the sky with a bright green light, but which would, ultimately, leave all those who saw it, forever changed. Those few, who were fortunate enough to have missed the spectacle, struggle to survive in a world that has transformed radically. It is up to them to set right what has gone terribly wrong. Soon enough, however, they realize that the day of the triffids has come. This is their story.","This is a book that shouldn't work, but it does. It is based on two absurd and totally unrelated science fiction premises. The first is the evolution of \"triffids.\" Triffids are a new species of plant of unknown origin (probably artificially cultivated) that, when mature, pick themselves up out of their roots and begin walking around and killing people. The other spectacular premise is that one night there is a terrific \"comet shower.\" The entire world watches it. The only problem is, much like a solar eclipse, if you look straight at it, it blinds you.The triffids have already been around a while by the time of the comet shower. They have become domesticated and people have become bored with them. After the world is stricken blind, nobody thinks much about the triffids, until...I was expecting a schlock science fiction novel about marauding killer plants. What I got instead was a very well-written, literate, thoughtful book about survival and sociology. (Don't be put-off - there are still those scary killer plants.) I was reminded of The Stand and the George Romero \"Dead\" films. The difference is, the rest of the world doesn't have to be killed off - they just have to go blind. It is shocking to think of how collectively helpless the world would be if that happened.The focus of the novel is more on the post-apocalyptic aspect than the killer plants. The triffids do take over the Earth, but it is not a story like I am Legend, in which the triffids are such a threat no one can leave the house. The triffids are relatively week and can be dealt with - but there's so many of them.After reading this book, I am not surprised that it is reprinted by Modern Library. It is a very nice paperback edition with helpful \"reading group\" questions at the end. It is worthwhile to pick up this \"rediscovered\" classic and see what good science fiction is.","I have read this book a number of times in the past 40 years. I've seen movies, and listened to the audiobook. This is one of the post-apocalyptic stories that has had the most impact on me.It isn't so much the plausibility of mobile killer plants: it is the impact on 'civilised' society when the ordinary becomes the extraordinary. This novel can be read as social commentary or as science fiction. It doesn't rely on science or on technology for its impact. It relies on the reader's capacity to imagine a world where sightedness is rare and where danger is in the seemingly mundane.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","After having recently reviewed the film of 1961, I pulled this off the shelf and was utterly enthralled by the story and consistent mood. In contrast to the film, this is first-rate scifi, one in the genre where most of humanity is wiped out and a few individuals are left to deal with the aftermath.Interestingly, the triffids are not alien, though their origin is mysterious, and rather than some monstrous transformation they move to fill an ecological niche that opens before them with the disaster that blinds most of humanity. However, they are just the backdrop to a wonderful exploration of human possibility and its limits, in the bizarre circumstnace that scifi allows. Indeed, there are entire chapters where they are barely mentioned. This is what the best scifi does, convincingly explores a path that is believable and leads to reflection on one's own circumstances.You get few heroics and lots of struggle by normal people trying to survive, as they organize themselves into new groupings and institutions. Thus, the characters are extremely strong and well drawn, good enough for a realist novel. THen, there is the mystery of what happened: this is only speculated about with tantailising hints, and never definitively explained, which only strengthens the basic themes. Every detail adds to the story.Warmly recommended.","I first encountered \"the Day of the Triffids\" when I was ten years old - and can still read it with enjoyment at 59. For me that says it all.Add to this that the book itself was seven years old when I read it, and its quality is brought home even more. Published in 1951, it is still believable in 2007, perhaps more credible now than when it was written. How many novels are there, sf or otherwise, of which this could be said?The triffids of the title are a new breed of plant, produced by some unspecified means as a source of oil. The term \"Genetically Engineered\" was not known in the 50s, but would instantly spring to mind today. Despite their vicious sting, capable of blinding or even killing a man, and the fact they are carnivorous, they are no particular problem until a new disaster strikes. A meteor shower of incredible brilliance draws almost the whole population out at night to watch - and gives off harmful radiation which blinds all those who see it.Bill Masen, temporarily blinded by a triffid sting, spends the crucial night in hospital with his eyes bandaged, and removes them the morning after to find a world gone blind (at least it seems to be the world. Were there no overcast skies anywhere that night? Never mind) and searches frantically for the handful of others who can see. Needless to say, his first \"find\" is female and about his own age &lt;g>. They are faced with a terrible moral dilemma. Do they just clear off and leave the blind ones to (mostly) die? Or should the sighted stay to help the blind - and almost certainly end up dying with them? And of course not all, even among the sighted, are content to leave this to individual choice. There are those prepared to kidnap and enslave the sighted and force them into helping the blind - and equally those who see a not so brave new world with themselves as masters and the blind majority as serfs.If all this weren't enough, the triffids are on the loose. With their deadly stings, they commit mayhem on the helpless blind humans, and soon develop into a major problem even for the sighted, who must search desperately for some refuge which can be defended against them. The rest of the novel is devoted to their finding one.I have a few gripes here and there. Would the triffids really be much threat to sighted people, if the latter had sense enough to wear crash helmets, goggles and heavy coats? And where's the Navy? Did every submarine in the world surface to look at the meteors? I'd expect a sub or two to come moseying up the Thames before too long. Quibble, quibble, Mike.And was that plague just a leetle bit too convenient? Masen is agonising about whether to stay with the blind party into whose service he was kidnapped and \"drafted\" when a germ or virus comes along and gets him off the hook by killing them all. Bit of a cop-out there?I also feel that Wyndham made a mistake, later, in implying that the \"comet\" was a secret weapon that went wrong, and the meteors an official cover story. I don't trust government either, but this doesn't really fit the facts. Were it so, those in the know would surely have taken shelter, and ordered Army and police to do the same. Yet there's no sign whatever of this having happened. No mention of the Royal Family, Cabinet, or Armed Forces, who evidently all went out and got blinded along with the rest. Even for a British government, that's an improbable degree of stupidity. While fully sharing Wyndham's distrust of the Powers That Be, I feel we have to acquit them of this particular crime.Finally, though appreciating how Wyndham liked his disasters \"cosy\" and localised, I'd have liked to see just a little more (either in this book or the sequel he never wrote) about how the world at large was getting on. Was everywhere as badly hit as England? Being plants, the triffids wouldn't fare too well in deserts, so Americans and Mexicans might hold out in the southwest, and the Moslems (Oh dear!) in N Africa and the Mideast, while the sighted Australians could retreat into their arid interior. Dry grasslands might also be unsuitable, and even if triffids could live there, a human would see them on the horizon long before they got near enough to detect him, so on steppes or prairies, or even in the Scottish highlands, human and triffid would generally meet only when the human wanted it. These, rather than the Isle of Wight, seem to me the \"best hope of mankind\".But enough grousing. It's a really great novel, rivalling \"Earth Abides\" as the classic post disaster yarn. If you haven't read it, you are missing out big time!","The book has a very simple plot and is good for those who are just starting to read science-fiction. The idea is that these huge plants which can walk and talk [to each other] take over the world. High unbeliveable you might think, well the whole sroy is wound into a clever, but yet not so dramatic as I expected, ending","If you have read the info about the movies about killer plants from outer space, then put that entirely out of your mind. The story is written in first person and there are some things that you will realize by the end of the book which are actually never spelled out. I consider this a classic, and a good book. As to whether there are better stories that use the same scenario, I am not even sure that there are book that use the same scenariio.","I'm giving one star not for the book itself (which is great) but for its really horrible edition. As others have mentioned, it's crawling with typos and mistakes as if there was absolutely no proofreading. Skip this edition, better buy a paperback.","The world experiences a series of calamities which are somehow unrelated; this is somehow disappointing because they are so extraordinary and feed off each other that to not link the sequence of events more unbelievable. The two major fiascos that bring the world to its knees are a nightfall of comets that blind the bulk of the population who watch the spectacle, and the explosion of a type of mobile plant, which has a tendency to kill or blind humans (but for no particular reason, they don't eat them). These man-killing hedges are possibly man-made in origin, imported from Russia, and are grown for exploitation and amusement... that is until the world is rendered blind and the plants gain the upper hand! Those heartless bushes! With their whip-like toxic appendages they start wrecking havoc on the hapless populous by striking them dead and adding to the body count. Add to this the forced enslavement of the sighted to the greater population of the blind, an unrelated intestinal disease that kills off the blind, and the wry British humor as the narrator encounters very silly people trying to survive (are the British really this disaffected?), and you get a classic sci-fi novel that has been borrowed from liberally by better authors. For my taste, if you want to experience mass blindness, read Jose Saramago'sBlindness (Harvest Book)and for surviving man-killing foliage, try rentingLittle Shop of Horrors, I prefer the musical to the B-movie from the 1960's. Read this one for laughs; was it intended to be a comedy?","day of the triffids would have to be one of the best zombie books ever written without there technically being any zombies actually in it.","Somehow, an astronomical event has caused the overwhelming majority of the population to become blind.If that wasn't bad enough, mobile, dangerous plans called Triffidsare able to take advantage of the disdavantage. Without sight humansare extremely vulnerable to these predators.The narrator avoided blindness, by being in a hospital with bandaged eyes.From there, we have an examination of this disaster scenario, and what would happen.","Before there was Doom, or Aliens, or Night of the Living Dead, there was the Day of the Triffids. Written at the beginning of the Cold War, this sci-fi drama explores the fate of a human society where the masses are blinded (literally) and being stalked by predatory plants. The latter were created by the Russians (of course) thru genetic experiments. When comets pass by Earth and blind the majority of the human race, the triffids get loose and start feeding on humans.The book is a quick read; easy to follow and quite exciting. I first read it years ago and still remember it. The book is worth reading on two levels. First, it is quite entertaining. Second, it is a good attempt at describing what happens to human society when chaos reigns supreme.","Day of the Triffids had been on my must read list for an exceptionally long time because I remembered watching the film as a child and being utterly terrified (keep in mind that I was one of the only children not to freak out at The Dark Crystal). When I found out that it was based on a book I just had to read it- so when I discovered it at the second hand bookstore a few weeks ago I just couldn't pass up the opportunity.I think to anyone who has read anything that I have written, especially about the subjects of books, should know that I have a thing for post apocalyptic novels written in the 50's, 60's, 70's and on the rare occasion the 80's. I always thought that it was just because of my obsession with the end of the world, the desolation of humanity and my fear that even though at present we are the dominant species we will one day become obsolete. And in part it may be that- but following on the heels of The World in Winter it has become clear to me that the thing that I like about these stories is that they are character driven. It isn't about the story, it isn't about how the world ends. It is about how people survive and act when all governing bodies are removed and people are left to their own devices. Whether they sink or swim. Whether they become savages or try and remain civilized. It is about how the author thinks people will cope when the only people they have to rely on is themselves.I fully understand how the triffids terrified me so much- they are barbarous plants- but they are merely plot devices and secondary to the characters.Wyndham makes some fabulous points about science (especially about satellites, which I have always found a little creepy and invasive) and the human condition. I especially liked his attack on people thinking that the US was going to come and save the day- fifty years later people are still holding onto that same ineffectual thread.When I got to the end I wanted to read me, I wanted Elspeth's History of the Colony to be a sequel.Of course parts of it are outmoded, such as gender perceptions (though Coker's soliloquy about feminism was pretty close on the mark) but Wyndham manages to squeak through cleanly by pointing out the stupidity in such modesty or habits and foreseeing much of what would happen to certain movements.And his references to a specific war could have been more general to allow people to relate better to it later on, allowing for a change in the enemy of future generations.Still, it was thoroughly enjoyable.","Let me preface this by saying that I love fiction of \"end of the world\" syndrome. If you're a fan of the genre, you'll like this book. The author is an Englishman but his writing style is not hard to read and enjoyable. The plot is your basic \"something happens to shake things up and how does the protagonist survive\". That being said, the author does a good job of it; gives you plenty of creeps without being gory. I'd recommend it and will see what else is by John Wyndham.","I read this book on recommendation from a friend, and I have to say it was really very good. I intend to read more Wyndham when I get the chance. Some reviewers will draw all sorts of comparisons to cold war paranoia or other such metaphors, and they're necessarily wrong in their conclusions. But I think \"Triffids\" is first and foremost a sci-fi adventure book.If you've seen the movie, you don't really know the story in these pages. It's a desperate struggle, portrayed with stark, unforgiving realism. Our heroes don't save everyone. In fact, they barely manage to save themselves. Wyndham doesn't paint a pretty picture of the end of the world, but he ultimately gives it hope.The last fourth drags a little, and it doesn't end with everything resolved, which normally bugs the heck out of me, but fit the theme of the book nicely. Namely: Life goes on, no matter how bad things get. Check it out.","Well worth reading much better than the old film. I heard about his books on the First Tuesday book show, never read at school as so many people seem to have.","Never having read anything by this author previously, I like his wording and fined the detail of the story much better than the small amount used for the movie.","This book is, or should be, a classic. I'm a writer (author ofShiver on the Sky), and as far as I'm concerned John Wyndham was one of the best. I pick up one of his books from time to time, and every time I'm inspired to work harder. He was true craftsman, who probably never wrote an awkward sentence. Or at least not accidentally.I kind of liked the movie too, by the way. It wasn't very good in an absolute sense, but that's okay with me--I'm also a B-movie fan. Plus...this particular book (which does NOT have zombies in it) is really the father of all zombie movies. If you ever liked one, you probably liked the bits that were inspired by this book.","This is not a B-Movie story or something of the sorts, even though some covers (of some editions) and the summary might make you think so. The book is well written - it's a bit old, of course, and not so easy to read, specially for a foreigner English student as myself - but the plot is direct, powerful, thought-provoking, and complete.I'm fed up with all these new books that come in installments and leave so many gaps and open questions for the next one. I think the new authors should learn something with this so called, classic. John Wyndham knew how to write a SciFi... and it doesn't have to be a series or a trilogy!Don't miss it if you like post-apocalyptic books, the kind of that makes you not scared, but thoughtful. The story is very plausible; don't wait for aliens or zombies here, it's all about human nature.","A single male protagonist wakes up in a dark room, discovers his world has fallen apart, and sets about surviving. It's a standard setting these days, isn't it? Sure, these days it's zombies, but back then, this first time? Plants. Giant walking plants with whiplashes.This story has it all. There's little I can add to it, save to say that those who are obsessed over new stories like World War Z would do well to read the original and see how it should be done.","It was absolutely bloody fantastic! Think Little Shop of Horror's meets the zombie apocalypse to get a feel of what this is like.","I purchased this as a Kindle special and was quite happy that the purchase turned out to be worthwhile. This novel is a good apocalyptic novel with strong characters.","I picked this up as a Kindle special on books made into movies. I had never heard of the movie or the author. So the book was a very pleasant surprise; it was one of those books that I hated to have end. The book hits on a number of points. The characters are likable and easy to empathize with. The premise of something like a triffid that was dangerous, although manageable, is intriguing. However, the real strength of this novel is how Wyndham works through the consequences of a society dismantled by the meteor/comet event. That kind of thoughtfulness is rare in today's action-mainly thrillers (not only sci-fi but other). Can't believe a major author hasn't picked up where Wyndham left off. The author even seemed to invite other accounts to be written in his closing lines. As our world seems to be closer to some kind of world-level catastrophe, it would be nice to have more 'conversations' about the aftermath that Wyndham carries on with us in this novel.","i picked this book out of nostalgia really. It was one of the ones I read as a child when it first came out and I'd seen the films. This time round it brought back the atmosphere of fear we all lived under then - the Aldermaston marches for nuclear disarmanent, the feeling that the Bomb would drop if not tomorrow then the day after. The Triffids could only have come out of that time. I am now in my sixties and did survive to own a handbag (my deepest regret about the imminent nuclear holocaust being that I would not grow up to be an adult and get to do this)and I realise we do live in gentler times despite everything. Anyway the book is gripping, vivid and original, combining as it does two catastrophes - a blinding of the world's population (bar a few accidentally spared individuals) and the proliferation of a strange hunting plant - the triffid which preys upon the newly helpless humans. Moral dilemmas are explored along with the ways different people respond to the threats and opportunities presented by a devastated world. Its messages still seem relevant but fortunately these days terror fatigue has set in for most of us and it's less scary than fascinating. Really recommended. JJ","The Day of the Triffids is a book that should reside on any science fiction fan's book shelf. You have all of the classic sci-fi themes in the novel that stand the test of time. Civilization seeks to control what it does not understand. It backfires of course in a large way. Civilization is faced with extinction and therefore must reinvent itself. Wyndham forces us to examine the the price of arrogance and the balance due this time is destruction on a global scale.What are triffids? Deadly plants that walk like humans. They kill indiscriminately and are sllowly taking over the earth. A number of fascinating questions are posed throughout the novel. Are triffids evil or are they merely following their nature? What about humans? What is our nature? Can we truly put aside our differences and unite when faced with the apocalypse? The answers lie within. Enjoy.","In order to read this book and enjoy it, you have to put yourself back in the time period in which it was written. This is a 'classic' sci-fi novel. Its dated.First of all, you have over reaching elements of early space exploration (Sputnik), the cold war, and limited communication. If you think about the plot and the meteor shower that opens this story and the subsequent blindness worldwide, its sort of stretching plausibility. But if you go with it and read on, your in for a historical treat.Im sure your aware, The Triffids are these carnivorous plants that humans originally planted for the oils they produced. Only when everyone went blind, the plants were able to break out and hunt down the humans. They could think collectively.This is sort of like a zombie novel before Romero and Night of the Living Dead. This is also written as a memoir... from the point of view of a survivor. Its well done and holds up well.","Raising questions of environmentalism, ethics, and structure of society, John Wyndham wrote a frightening tale in \"The Day of the Triffids\". Though some would label this work in the genre of science fiction, I would suggest this book exceeds that label. Like so many of the works of H.G. Wells, this book gives a vision of the future with themes of bio-warfare and mass destruction.Bandages over his eyes prevent Bill Masen from seeing a spectacular meteor shower. When he removes his bandages after the shower, Masen finds most of the world has lost its sense of sight. Meeting few others with sight, he discovers a world that seems to have changed overnight. As a fellow scientist predicted, the major advantage humans held over the mysterious plants known as \"triffids\" was sight. Without sight, humans become easy prey. Maseon is challenged not only to promote his survival, but the survival of others in his charge. A reluctant leader accepts his call during a team of need.Though the plot is well thought-out and the story is well told, I found myself frustrated by some questions that were never answered clearly. The only acceptable justification seem to be that the author was trying to lend the story a sense of realism. Not all questions or dilemmas are answered in real life. Being written as a post-disaster diary, does seem to relieve the author of some duty of explanation. The ending was acceptable, but the origins of the problems remain unexplained.John Wyndham's writing seems underappreciated as his books are not available in most book stores in America. Still, I would highly recommend this book as well as \"The Chrysalids\".","This was the first book I purchased in Kindle edition.I knew all about The Day of the Triffids before I even read the book. It's about how everyone goes blind and plants that attack...right? Wrong. This is so much more, in fact I felt that the Triffids were a bit like extra's in a movie, or a lurking background menace, and presented to the reader not dissimilar to the idea of communism being a lurking menace to the west (the reds under the bed so to speak). This book is more about how people relate to each other in times of adversity, and how generally, it's not very well. Its age gives it an element of \"twee\" which soon becomes lost as you get caught up in the story. You don't have to be a lover of Sci Fi or horror genres to enjoy this book. Any person interested in the human condition would enjoy it.","I am a huge fan of the End-of-the-World genre of books, and there are some great ones out there! One of my absolute favorites is the 1951 sci-fi \"Day of the Triffids\" by the English author John Wyndham. The first time I read it, I was 13 years old in school, reading it during our Cold War/ Disaster literature classes. At the time I preferred The Chrysalids & Midwich Cuckoos, but I was very glad to rediscover this last year and it become rooted into one of my firm favorites.Influenced by HG Well's War of the Worlds, Day of the Triffids has a two tiered plot.... the Triffids are potentially mobile killer plants that have inhabited earth under human control for years. For the most part they have been controlled well and caused very few problems. But the book opens with another seemingly harmless event, (a little reminiscent of War of the Words): a meteor shower. By morning, the effects are devastating: the millions unlucky enough to witness the falling comets are inexplicably blinded, with the lucky sighted few left to fend for the victims - and keep the Triffids at bay.While the people of Britain await American rescue, society changes rapidly. And as they realize that help might not be coming, the small communities of survivors must learn how to keep the Triffids at bay.Superbly written, albeit outdated with its gender roles, Day of the Triffids is still an absolute classic sci-fi and a must for EOTW genre lovers!","I have recently decided to see how many of the movies that I have always loved were based on books. This is the book that got me started. I have shared it with others and we love the comments on society that are very true for today!","For years my only exposure to \"Day of the Triffids\" was the 1962 British filmThe Day of the Triffids, a hysterical monster flick that was fun to watch as a kid. I heard the John Wyndham novel on which it was based, published in 1951, was a far superior science fiction classic dealing with the end of the world. Fortunately, I tracked down a copy and was thrilled to discover the rumors were correct.Wyndham, a quirky British novelist during the post WW II years (he also pennedMidwich Cuckoos (Penguin Modern Classics), later filmed asVillage of the Damned/Children of the Damned), has fashioned an extraordinary, thought-provoking thriller with \"Day of the Triffids,\" easily one of the best entrants into the apocalyptic genre. There's not as much violence as inLucifer's Hammer, and it's perhaps not as profound asEarth Abidesor The Road, but there are emotionally horrifying moments, specifically during the opening passages when the protagonist views hospital patients, suddenly struck blind, stumbling over one another in hopeless panic. Other passages are equally chilling.The protagonist is Bill Masen, a British chap who works at triffid farms. These triffids, a mysterious plant created by the Soviets, have the ability to walk and possess deadly stingers to stun prey long enough to be consumed, akin to a human-sized Venus fly traps. They are now farmed by humans for their precious oils. Luckily for Masen, he's stung by a triffid and is recuperating at a hospital with temporary blindness. A rare meteor shower explodes across the evening skies and witnesses, almost all of humanity, awake the next morning to discover they've been blinded by the light. Masen removes his bandages to find he's the only human left in London with the ability to see. And so begins the fascinating \"Day of the Triffids.\"I was enthralled by Wyndham's novel and could not put it down. It's an ingenious concept and, as noted by others, the triffids are a thinly-veiled symbol of the contemporary fear of growing Soviet power. As Masen hikes across London, he witnesses the frantic attempts of blind humans stumbling down streets to find food. He luckily runs across Josella Playton, a local writer who also missed the meteor show, and they become a virtual Adam and Eve in a nightmarish Garden of Eden. The triffids, meanwhile, run amok as blind humans become an easy source of food.Wyndham only scratches the surface of the horrors of a blind populace, though at night when Masen and Playton try to sleep, they can hear the terrified screams of humanity. It's an ugly world, but Wyndham has wisely left much to the imagination. The recent filmBlindness, based on the famous novel (Blindness) by Jos&eacute; Saramago, takes the idea a step further (in this case, blindness becomes an international plague), though it wallowed in uncomfortable bleakness that became suffocating.28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)has similar opening scenes undoubtedly inspired by this novel.Wyndham's succinct and thoughtful writing beautifully realizes his unique idea. As we travel with Masen and Playton, we discover from their viewpoint an increasingly eroding civilization. The reality of this new world grows even more dour as a military regime attempts to take charge, expecting those with site to work for the helpless blind populace. Thus, those who see become prisoners of the blind and vice-versa, another symbol of Communism.\"Day of the Triffids\" is one of the earliest entries into the apocalyptic genre (not as early as H.G. Wells'The War of the Worlds (Modern Library Classics), of course). Wrought with contemporary symbols of the Cold War, it's never-the-less a timeless work, thought-provoking and unforgettable. It's sad such a mediocre (though amusing) film was made from the book, as Wyndham's novel is truly a respectable classic deserving of discovery. It's a terrific surprise.","I first read an early set of Wyndham books at the encouragement of my eldest sister when I was about 14 and she was a junior school teacher. The set included \"Day of the Triffids\", \"The Chrysalids\", \"The Midwich Cuckoos\" and \"The Trouble with Lichen\". I return to them every few years, often buying the latest imprints to make up for the wear and tear my family seem to impose on books I encourage them to read. In my opinion, John Wyndham, like many Sci-Fi authors was visionary. I love all these books, despite the passing of time and find that they are far better than many modern attempts to narrate similar ideas. My children, nieces and nephews agree!Besides being enjoyable, elegant, writing that does not require 700 pages to convey complex ideas, \"The day of the Triffids\" forces us to understand the fragility of the technological achievements on which our societies are built. It is also topical in the inferences and clear descriptions surrounding transgenic modification of plants, that become ambush predators, then active hunters. I thoroughly recommend this book to everyone. The book is global in reach and the context will become intuitive quickly. The Triffids are not improbable constructs any longer. Indeed human propensity for violence and clever technology, intertwined with greed make the picture clearly painted in the book all too plausible. Buy it and don't put it down until finished, then read it again.","I'm not sure why Wyndham even threw the triffids into this story; they are actually more of a background item. The main theme is 99% of humanity all going blind at once, and the hero dealing with that little problem. The triffids show up once in awhile just to stir things up, but Wyndham really didn't need them to muddy the storyline; he had plenty to work with already.As I recall, the movie version dealt more with fighting and defeating the triffids; here, they are more or less marginal.My only real complaint is that the book ends too soon. He could have done much more with it. Still a good read, however.","If you forgive the author the premise of a weapon from outer space that blinds everyone, the rest of this classic science fiction novel is a prescient picture of our world today.The triffids are plants, but not like any we know. They have been specially bred to solve our need for scarce resources, in this case plant byproducts and oils. They can move though, and they are carnivorous, so they have to be tied down to keep them from escaping and eating us, which they do in some lesser developed regions of the globe.Then a mysterious accident happens so only people who could not see the sky are left with sight. Everyone else is blind. The rest of the story concerns how people survive after the unexpected disaster and how they manage to find a space among the triffids and less moral groups to begin to recreate a civilization.The story reflects the angst of the 50's when new industrial products were producing unexpected effects on the ecology and economy of western societies. But, it could be just as real today. The triffids are a symbol of our willingness to take chances with technologies that offer great rewards but whose costs are not fully understood. For instance, genetically modified corn offers the opportunity for greately increased agricultural yields, but we can't control where it ends up in the food chain. What if it changes our biochemistry in some unexpected way? Well... this is not likely, but you can see how some new technologies might have far reaching unexpected impacts on how we live.A good read. Well written. Highly recommended for readers who want to find hope for after the apocalypse.","\"The Day of the Triffids\" was for many years my favorite sci-fi novel; afterwards it was replaced in that honor place by Dune and Hyperion.I've read this novel when I was a teenager in the mythical Argentinean sci-fi magazine \"Mas Alla\", it was published there as the main story of the inaugural number. I've treasured my collection for more than 40 years.\"The Day of the Triffids\" still stands in my all-time best novels list and I've reread it once every couple of years.It is a typical product of the '50, but with a forceful story line, exploring a post catastrophe world. The drama evolves smoothly, griping you up to the last page; it has a somewhat melancholic background, our known world fading into dust and a new one emerging from the ashes in a pitiless confrontation with the Triffids of the title.It is a novel that fifty years after it was written still catch your interest and keep you going on.In sci-fi not to be dated is a commendation.If the reader wants to have a vivid picture of London in a state similar to this book descriptions I encourage he/she to see the movie \"28 Days Later\".Reviewed by Max Yofre","Great book, really makes you think. Set in England, it has a very english feel and style to it. Wyndham writes &quot;future fiction&quot; rather than science fiction. There's not much science in this book and what occurs in the book does not require a great leap for the mind to imagine it might happen one day. That's what I like about Wyndham's novels, they are so accessable to all types, not just the sci fi geeks.Every turn that the protagonists take makes sense and you are left thinking - &quot;That's exactly what I would do&quot; or &quot;what would I do in that situation&quot;.I think anyone who studied sociology or has an interest in it, would enjoy this book, as several issues are raised.","At first, the thought of plants taking over the world seems a little absurd. But the author managaes to create a &quot;post-apocalyptic&quot; world that is quite interesting. I was hooked through the whole book - from the main character exploring his new world in blindness, to the desperation felt as the end as you hope that somehow humanity will find a way to survive. I had low expectations going in, but it has turned out to be one of my favorites.","A meteor shower thrills the world with a beautiful bright green show. But the next morning dawns with the realization that everyone who watched (all but a very few) is now blind. Bill Masen, a biologist, was in the hospital with his eyes bandaged due to an accident. Bill works with a new species of plant known as triffids, which are cultivated for their oils but also highly dangerous for their carnivorous nature and surprising ability to wander about. They have a deadly whip-like poisonous stinger allowing them to quickly kill their prey and seem to possess some degree of intelligence. As London, and presumably the entire world, sinks into chaos people begin forming into groups. But the triffids are always on the periphery, patiently waiting for opportunities, and they seem to be the only creatures truly able to profit and flourish in this new world.I've had an interest incarnivorous plantssince I was a kid and heard of The Day of the Triffids many times. I thought it was just a cheesysci-fi B movie- I didn't realize it was a book first. I'm not usually a fan of science fiction or horror, but was surprised by how much I enjoyed this story. The description of how the triffids came to be so widespread was fascinating and frightening, and I could imagine myself as a boy doing the same innocent and naive things as Bill. The book remains vague on their origin, speculating they were bred by the Soviet Union, and reflects the secrecy and mistrust developing in 1951 when this book was written and the Cold War was shifting into high gear. (The way the seeds blew around put a creepy twist onWeslandia, a favorite book of my children.)But as an end of the world story the social questions raised are particularly interesting. What is right and wrong when the social order breaks down? Is looting justified? Who should be in charge? What obligation do the sighted have to the sightless? Just how precious is life, even in an altered (sightless) state? And as groups and tribes begin to establish, what moral responsibilities do they have to others? The issue of polygamy is raised to some objections, but even then views differ. The characters also speculate on the meteor shower - was it an act of God, or maybe an accident involving the radioactive weapons then being developed. And as it becomes apparent just how serious of a threat the triffids are, they seem to be yet another obstacle to re-establishing a new civilization... or are they?Another interesting facet, given that the book was written soon after WWII, was the frequent expectation that \"someone\" would come to save them, probably America. TheMarshall Planhad certainly played a large role by 1951, but the book encourages self-reliance as it was likely the US had experienced the same catastrophe. And I noticed a number of reviews here complain of the antiquated view of womanhood, but this is most likely a reflection of the period in which it was written when women weren't as common in the workplace, although one character takes a stand for the untapped abilities of women. I found it odd that there wasn't much discussion on why certain people missed the meteor showers - people always talk about \"where\" they were when tragedies happen - but I guess that probably would have just added a lot of unecessary dialog.I didn't expect to enjoy this book as much as I did. Enough questions are left unanswered and explanations somewhat vague to make it a frightening consideration. It's a clever and insightful look at social conditions and evidently still very influential on many other authors (I was reminded strongly of theGone series by Michael Grant). I listened to the audio book read by Samuel West who does a very good job with the different accents, although his volume goes up and down excessively sometimes.","One night a spectacular meteor shower fills the sky, and everyone who has seen it awakes blind the next morning. For the most part, this science fiction classic follows Bill Masen (who was in bandages during the shower) as he finds his way in this post-apocalyptic world. Add to this a special plant, the triffid, which can walk and attack. But the triffids are no more a concern than the rival governments being established by Bill's few sighted peers and the blind forced to rely on them.I read this on my last work trip and could barely put down. According to the critical introductory essay by Edmund Morris,* in the British Commonwealth \"it has the reputation of being the one science fiction book you must read, even if you don't read science fiction.\" I agree.1. This is a great read. It takes no time at all to get moving, with this excellent opening line: \"When a day that you happen to know is Wednesday starts off by sounding like Sunday, there is something seriously wrong somewhere.\"2. The book is an interesting mix of post-apocalyptic (think The Road but less dark despite the carnivorous plants) and dystopian (as we observe the new orders being established).3. Many of these British survivors are obsessed with Americans. I remember seeing this in the filmIndependence Day(with Will Smith), when the Americans develop a plan and the British say, \"It's about time\" or some such. As Bill and his friends seek other survivors, they found that most other small groups \"waited for the arrival of the Americans, who were bound to find a way. ... The Americans, they assured us, would never have allowed such a thing to happen in their country\" (163). This appears several times.4. Wyndham captures the oppressive loneliness of wandering through this post-apocalyptic world: \"Until then I had always thought of loneliness as something negative - an absence of company, and, of course, something temporary. ... That day I had learned that it was much more. It was something which could press and oppress, could distort the ordinary and play tricks with the mind. Something which lurked inimically all around, stretching the nerves and twanging them with alarms, never letting one forget that there was no one to help, no one to care.\" (169-170)I highly recommend this book. I intend to seek out more Wyndham.* This essay is included in the Modern Library: 20th Century Rediscovery edition. I recommend reading the essay after reading the novel.","I'm a fan of apocalypse stories and this is one of the greatest of all time. But this book is so old that the Kindle version is obviously created from a poor scan. There are no paragraph indents or spacing which makes reading a bit difficult. There are also a BUNCH of typo-type mistakes. For example, it might read \"hut\" instead of \"but\" or \"bill\" instead of \"hill\". Sometimes there are even numbers in there instead of letters. Clearly, the scanner software misread (on average several times per page) an old print. Once you get used to this, and become OK about ignoring the typos (in some places so bad you can't figure out what the words were supposed to be) it is a REALLY good story. Deserves to be right up there with Mattheson's I AM LEGEND, which is my favorite.","Please note that this is not a review of the book itself, which is worth reading if for no other reason than for its influence on the genre.I'm giving this product one star because the Kindle edition is just riddled with typos. Misspellings, text garbled with punctuation instead of letters--it's unforgivably bad and at times impossible to decipher. Skip this one and download something less sloppy.","As if the concept of a strange meteor shower blinding all but a very few members of the earth's population wasn't scary enough, author Wyndham menaces the sightless survivors with a malignant breed of man-eating plants. This book oozes with suspense and excitement with every page. Surprisingly, though it is almost fifty years old, it has aged very well. If you like end-of-the-world fiction, this is one of the best of the genre.","This is an outstanding post-apocalyptic book about survival in a world destroyed by a cataclysmic event and a biogenetically engineered plant. William Masen is in the hospital with his entire head wrapped in bandages. He has been stung by a Triffid, a biogenetically modified plant that was developed in Russia. Standing 7 to 10 feet tall with a large tentacle whip like pad it can quickly kill even large animals with its powerful poisons. They are considered carnivorous even though they mostly eat carrion of the victims they kill. William works at a site where Triffids are raised to harvest their valuable plant oil and he is attacked at work. Two of the horrifying things about Triffids are that they can walk and they appear to have intelligence!While recovering after medical treatment he misses out on the interstellar event of all history. It is a historic meteor shower that encircles the globe and produces thousands of bright green atmospheric flashes that are spectacular to view. The entire world stays out all night and enjoys the amazing spectacle while he sits in a hospital room blinded by bandages. He is lucky!The next morning almost all of mankind (and most animals) are blind while he is one of the few who can still see. Worse than that he is a Triffid expert and realizes that the giant and deadly plants are a lethal menace to mankind, especially when they are blind. He lives in London and he quickly sees the fall of mankind as everyone else is blind and helpless. He knows surviving means avoiding the Triffids and not letting the thousands of people around you become aware that you can see. You are their last hope of survival and you cannot take care of them all...This book, written in 1951 is a masterpiece of Sci-Fi. Author John Wyndham uses a double catastrophic event of the meteor shower and the Triffids to spell the doom of human civilization. A handful of people still possessing their sight cannot protect the blind from starving, disease and the ever present danger of the Triffids. In 1951 the author talks about a biogenetically modified plant long before people knew what biogenetic engineering was really all about.The story line is very good and the character development is deep and interesting. Not only must the survivors try to live but they have to overcome disease, Triffids and the different groups of people who have gathered together to survive at any cost including murder. \"The earth is intact, un-scared, still fruitful.\" Unfortunately the dangers are very high and the chances of survival are very low. Many characters in the book keep saying that they are waiting for the Americans to show up and straighten things out. They refuse to accept that the entire world is in the same predicament that they are in.The author develops different camps of people who set up small communes that range from hyper religious to not much more than barbarism. Groups form based on feudal principles to socialism. This is an excellent book that I was happy to pick up as a daily deal on Amazon. I own the original paperback release and I enjoyed reading it again over 50 years later.This is a wonderful book that I thoroughly enjoyed and I recommend it to you as a very good read!","Well, the book is great, content-wise that is - let's call it a must read for folks enjoying sci-fi. I won't be offering much more in that direction, this review is about technical issue ratherWill just add that for myself, I used to have a paperback copy once, failed to locate it and decided to get this kindle edition insteadIt's my first Penguin e-book though, and I found something to my dislike - I can't switch through to chapters, only page-by-page - at least for Kindle Keyboard (it's v3 I believe). Whether it is the feature of all Penguin e-books or runs true for this particular one only, I have no idea, but just be warnedI would not have found out if it weren't provided with a longish introductory note (Of the kind I never read as this one, for instance, is giving out plot spoilers - not much of an issue as I've read the book before - but anyway) - so I've naturally tried to skip to actual Chapter 1 and found that I couldn't - had to click the page turning button umpteen number of times before I got to the actual textIt still gets 4 stars from me - for the sheer pleasure in reading I remember from my paparback and am now anticipating. One star deducted for this technical deficiency I've described above, and I guess should be applied to this very edition only.","\"The Day of the Triffids\" is ostensibly a dark science fiction tale where civilization has destroyed itself, but really it's a perceptive analysis of human nature, the diversity and range of humans. It's a dire warning as to who will survive (those who are imaginative and willing to adapt) and who will not (unflinching fanatics) in a time of change. More than half a century it was written it's still compelling and readable because it captures so many human truths.","\"The Day of the Triffids\" was for many years my favorite sci-fi novel; afterwards it was replaced in that honor place by Herbert's \"Dune\" and Simmon's \"Hyperion\".I've read this novel when I was a teenager in the mythical Argentinean sci-fi magazine \"M?s All?\", it was published there as the main story of the inaugural number. I've treasured my collection for more than 40 years.\"The Day of the Triffids\" still stands in my all-time best novels list and I've reread it once every couple of years.It is a typical product of the '50, but with a forceful story line, exploring a post catastrophe world.Our hero awakes one day at a London Hospital to discover 99,99% of Earth population has gone blind. The drama evolves smoothly, griping you up to the last page; it has a somewhat melancholic background, our known world fading into dust and a new one emerging from the ashes in a pitiless confrontation with the Triffids of the title.It is a novel that fifty years after it was written still catch your interest and keep you going on.In sci-fi not being dated is a commendation.If the reader wants to have a vivid picture of London in a state similar to this book descriptions I encourage he/she to see the movie \"28 Days Later\".I recommend this book to all sci-fi fans and general public too.Do not miss this incredible story!Reviewed by Max Yofre","The errors found in the kindle version are not by the original author. Rather, the spelling and grammatical errors are from whatever program transcribed the paper text into electronic form. Many of the errors will be a word like \"naive\" that is incorrectly spelt \"hal-e\" or something like that, where the program was approximating the figures.I do recommend reading the book itself and hope the mistakes in this kindle version do not deter others from enjoying it.","I received a Kindle for Christmas, and downloaded this as my very first book from the Amazon.com Kindle Store (I have to use Amazon.com rather than the UK store because I live in Luxembourg). To my deep disappointment the quality of the text itself (I am not talking about the content here) turns out to be completely appalling, to the point where, if I had not had a paper edition available for comparison, I would not always have understood it. For example: at location 121, instead of 'a party for all the world going on', we have 'a parry for all the world going on'; at location 152, instead of 'the lower part of it was not made to open', we have 'the lower pan of it was not made to open'; at location 158, instead of 'be more self-reliant now', we have 'he more self-reliant now'. And so it goes on; it can be seen from the proximity of the locations that these are not isolated typos - the text is littered with these errors. In addition, there are mistakes in punctuation, and no distinction is made between hyphens and dashes (in terms of either length or spacing), which makes the text more nonsensical still. This would make any reader deeply unhappy, I'm sure, and being a wordsmith and editor by profession, I may be even unhappier than the average reader. I am trying very hard not to allow this distressing start to put me off the whole Kindle idea, but it's not easy. I certainly think I am owed a refund of the 7 or so dollars I spent on this product. A corrupt text such as this would be quite unacceptable in a conventional book, and should be equally so in an e-book.","As many others have noticed, the Kindle version of this book is corrupt and I'd encourage you to purchase another version of the book.","I read this book way back when I was a teenager and have never forgotten Wyndham's story. His story is proving to be prophetic as we humans continue to actively attempt to destroy our planet through our neglect and over-reliance and faith in technology.I purchased this edition as a gift for my wife after she mentioned that she'd never read it. I found the price most reasonable and, of course, ordering was quite easy. My thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery.My wife told me that she enjoys the story, too, so it's all good. I give this five stars, partly because of Amazon's price and availability, but also because Wyndham wrote a five-star book.David H. Keith[...]","this book has been made into a movie more than once, which should tell you something in itself. On the surface, it seems to be a typical sci-fi story-the uprising of predator plants. Actually, it is an after-the-holocaust tale that side-steps the usual nuclear war plot device. Written in the middle of the cold war when people were buildilg bomb shelters in their basements, this book has some truely creepy litle scenes in it, as well as examples of human nobility and rationalism. I first read this book when I was in high school (which is starting to be a very long time ago) and have never forgotten it. All of John Wyndham's books are thought provoking. In many ways this book has always reminded me of ALAS BABYLON (also worth your time) from the same era. All these years later it seems prophetic in it's appraisal of science, religion, big business, human nature, the plight of the common man, and the will to survive with dignity under the worst of conditions. It's definately worth a look.","The most interesting fascinating thing about Day of the Triffids is how real the author manages to make his world and his various characters. They actually act like real humans. The world has suffered a calamity and he's in the middle of it. The triffids are part of it, but only a part. Cardboard cutout characters in movies and poorly written sci fi seem to behave as though they only need to survive to the credits. Real people do more. His characters encounter aspects of disaster that a real person would have seen, but which a less intelligent writer would never have thought about. Even more extraordinarily, there are big, serious issues that get raised in a calamity such as this. And here we have people disagreeing without any of them being made obviously right. Shallow writers tell you what the \"right\" answer is by making the \"wrong\" guy behave politically incorrectly; then we see that everything that character says is therefore also wrong, and we can relax, hate them, and go the right way, selected by the author (and of course GOING that way will work out just fine, as the author will demonstrate). In Triffids there are serious dilemmas and all the answers are ugly ones, but via the mechanism of story, we explore the various routes.But Triffids wasn't just a think-piece, a story in some guy's head. It's a ripping yarn, an action tale. It's not a comic book story though, where you get to race through life shooting things, where no one can be tougher than you, so long as your gun is loaded. This is a realistic story, and you can feel yourself being there, trying to decide how YOU would overcome the obstacles he faces. I've read it several times. It's one of my favorite post-apocalypse stories, and once of my favorite science fiction stories. Read and enjoy.","This is a good story of so-called apocalyptic sci-fi. The beginning of the story hugely lacks in credibility, and the triffids are a really way too obvious examples of technology developed by mankind without always weighing the possible negative effects (nuclear holocaust was THE big theme, back then).But the post-apocalypse part is among the better ones written.Also, and this is welcome, Wyndham CAN write, I mean he can write in proper English, with more than a basic vocabulary, which turns the book into literature, wheras, very unfortunately, most sci-fi today is so poorly written, than even when it contains great ideas it just is not literature.","This is My personal favorite Science Fiction/Horror novel that I've ever read, I'm 39 yrs. old and I can still remember digging through my dad's Science Fiction books in the basement of our house when I came across this book, I sat down and read it in 2 day's and what an exhilarating frightening experience it was, one I will never forget. Unfortunately I compare everything to this brilliant story and it's a tough sell, so far Lucifers Hammer, RingWorld by Larry Niven and The Wanderer, Conjure Wife by Fritz Leiber even come close in the sheer power of storytelling. I am still wondering why this hasn't been remade by hollywood with today's technology and actually follow the story this time(unlike the british version), it would be the movie event of the summer. Other stories worth reading by John Wyndham are Out of the Deep, Trouble with Lichen, Re-Birth, The Midwich Cuckoo's they are to put it subtly... awesome!.

The tagline might read: Everyone goes blind in a world ravaged by man eating plants! It sounds like a sixties B horror film... oh yeah, it was made into a sixties B horror film. Somehow, John Wyndham pulls it off. Bill Masen serves as our eyes in this blind world, and tells the tale of his life with total believability. The meteor shower event that causes the blindness and the appearance of the carnivous triffid plants are both explained in such a way as to be convincing. Of course, as is often the case with end of the world stories, the actual end of the world serves only as a setting for how the remaining characters will now interact. How will they live? What will they use for food? Will they develope into a new type of society? Wyndam's end of the world tool works better than most. Having helpless masses of blind people around raises some pretty serious ethical questions that can be related to many real problems in the here and now. And the triffids, they make the task of reinvinting the world just a little bit harder.In &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;, characters grow and express better than in most science fiction novels. Family, love, fidelity, loyalty, and forgiveness are all deftly handled here, and not preachily. The triffids are ever present in the backdrop to the other grander themes.Wyndham, I believe, is going through somewhat of a resurgence, as &quot;The Midwhich Cuckoo's&quot; and &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; will both soon be availble in new less pulpy formats. In their new guise, perhaps they will attract some new readers.My only criticism concerns that trick that writers use to set up an unbelievable event. We see it all the time in the movies: before the truck explodes, they show us a gas leak. That way, when the truck does explode, we not only know why, but we see it as something that was likely to happen. Wyndam uses this tactic to excess, right down to a conversation Bill has with a coworker about how the triffids sure would be deadly to a blind person. &quot;We can see and they can't. Take away that, and the superiority is gone.&quot; That's a somewhat unneccesary foundation, and not the only one of its kind. But in a novel with this monstrosity of a bizarre setting, it is a forgivable mistake to make.","John Wyndham's novels have often been mislabelled \"cosy catastrophes\". However, there is little that is very cosy about The Day of the Triffids, a gritty and poignant novel about global disaster and the end of civilisation. This is an SF classic for very good reasons, not least due to the triffids themselves, wonderfully menacing plant monsters, who take advantage of humanity's disarray to make their bid for world domination. The word \"triffid\", like the word \"dalek\", is now a permanent part of the English language, reason enough to make this novel essential reading for science fiction and mainstream readers alike.","John Wyndham Parkes Lucas Beynon Harris was born in 1903, just outside Birmingham. He wrote under a variety of pen-names, though \"The Day of the Triffids\" was the first time he used the name \"John Wyndham\". It's also is his most famous book and is set in 1950s England.The story is told by Bill Masen, a biologist for the Arctic and European Oil Company. The oil Arctic and European sell, however, isn't used to fuel trains, planes and automobiles : it's a food supplement derived from a recently `discovered' species of plant life known as \"triffids\". Bill believes the species is not a naturally occurring one, but was instead created in a laboratory by scientists. With the Cold War still in full-swing, Bill points the finger squarely at the USSR. It's possible the intention was to create them solely as a food source : the oil derived from triffids is so rich in vitamins that it's seen the bottom fall out of the fish-oil market. However, a triffid is also so dangerous it could also have been created as an extreme form of biological warfare.Triffids are carnivorous plants : insects always provide a quick and easy snack, though as time goes on, they seem to develop a preference for decomposing human flesh. It appears they can hear and make a strange rattling sound that some believe to be a form of communication. Even more dramatically, they can actually walk. They also have very dangerous `stingers', which can reach a length of around ten feet and - if they connect with bare skin - can be fatal. When triffids have attacked humans, they tend to strike first at the head - blinding a remarkably high number of the victims. A colleague of Bill's at Arctic-European believed this to be significant as the only real advantage humans had over triffids was their sight. With this removed from the equation, humans become little more than lunch.Bill's introduction to triffids came at an early age, when triffids were still a novelty and little was known about them. Although stung, he survived - luckily, the triffid in question was immature. As the book opens, Bill is recovering in hospital from another close encounter - a couple of drops of triffid poison splashed into Bill's eyes. The treatment included heavy padding and bandages, meaning that Bill couldn't see a thing. As a result, he missed out on a very dramatic free show : the previous night, the Earth apparently passed through some comet debris that resulted in a dazzling light show in the sky. Unfortunately, it also blinded everyone who watched it. Obviously, protected by his bandages and padding, Bill is now one of the few sighted people left and triffids are now a bigger threat than they should have been.There are some very quaint, old -fashioned elements to this book, the most obvious centring on Bill's relationship with Josella Playton. Josella is the first sighted person meets after leaving the hospital and - shortly after they've shaken hands - start discussing the size of the family they'll have together. Josella, it has to be said, is a good deal more pragmatic than Bill - who seems to be the sort of character born to shout \"I say !\". However, even after the world as we know it has ended, there are still some who seem unwilling to allow Josella to live down a rather racy book she once wrote. Nevertheless, this is definitely well worth reading. In fact, it seems to describe a world we're well familiar with in places : genetically modified plants, biological weapons and a web of satellites orbiting the planet in the name of `defence'.","John Wyndham's books (such as this and THE CHRYSALIDS and THE MIDWICH CUCKOOS) are pretty much classics of the scifi genre in the UK but have not enjoyed the same status in the USA; they're very intelligently crafted and also genuinely scary. THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS is his most famous work, and shows his intellectual debt to HG Wells very clearly. Like THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, it's a catastrophe novel that seems to mirror Britain's anxieties during its long imperial decline that it (and the whole world) was on the brink of utter chaos. In this book, giant ambulatory poisonous, carnivorous plants, called \"triffids\" have been created through the errors of human bioengineering; not long after, a mysterious spectacular meteor shower blinds everyone on Earth who sees it, leaving them at the mercy of the triffids.The triffids sound a bit ridiculous when described but you almost immediately believe in their possibility when you read this novel; what makes them so frightening and effective is that they're fairly slow in moving (except when they whip out their poisonous tendrils for the kill) and behave fairly instinctually, so the characters, preoccupied with their planet's social catastrophe, tend to forget about the menace they pose until its too late. Indeed, the triffids are mostly background menaces for the real subject of the book, which is the possibilities of new social structures after the apocalypse. The novel's hero comes across several new survivor communities, organized (variously) on feudal, Christian, and eugenicist/breeding models, and Wyndham seems greatly interested in comparing them. It might be that there's just too much, in the end, going on in this book, especially since the creation of the triffids and the meteor shower seem ultimately coincidental. Yet it's a hard book to put down, and the vein of anti-feminism that runs through it makes it exceptionally intriguing as a peice of post-War social commentary. Anbd you'll never forget the triffids themselves.","i know that George Romero's 1968 masterpiece NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD was the first film to feature hordes of mindless zombies roaming the countryside looking for nice tasty humans to eat, but what i want to know is \"what was the first book to feature the same?\".the reason i'm asking is if you replace the triffids in this book with dead humans then you've got a very interesting zombie story.that said this is a great book. very imaginative, fast-paced and hard to put down. i can't wait to read some more wyndham.","The Day of the Triffids is a classic end-of-the-world sci-fi novel set in England. Two bizarre things happen at the beginning of the novel to create disaster. Number 1: Science \"discovers\" walking plants that are named Triffids that can communicate among themselves. Our narrator, Bill Masen, believes that they are the result of Russian military testing, possibly meant to be a weapon, but they quickly spread all over the world. The Triffid is harmless enough until it grows to be man-sized. Then, it is able to walk by using its branches to swing its trunk, similar to the way a man on crutches walks. Once it walks, it is also able to hunt with this long whip-like tentacle with a poisoned tip. The Triffids like to eat putrid, rotting meat, much like a Venus Flytrap. It tears the meat loose with its tentacle.The Triffids are more of a curiosity to the world, though until bizarre thing #2 happens: There is a meteor shower one night - it is very bright and people all over the world watch it because it goes on all night. The next day, everyone who saw any part of the shower goes blind. Our narrator, however, is not blind because he had hospitalized for eye surgery and his eyes had been bandaged the night of the shower. Masen believes the meteor shower was not a natural ocurrence, but rather it was all a mistaken attack by an American or Russian satellite with a space-based radiation weapon.The rest of the book concerns Masen and his struggle to survive. Everything collapses when 95% of the population goes blind. The whole of England becomes a Mad Max environment and different types of communities are formed to attempt to deal with the blind survivors, the Triffids and the threat from other sighted survivors.All in all, its a good read and it holds up well, considering it is 50+ years old. Wyndham did a great job of prediciting the Cold War and the buildup of weapons and the push to harnass science for military applications. I would assume that this book had been read by the creators of Mad Max because they share a lot of the same images. However, don't get this book confused with the constant violence of the Road Warrior. Those scenes are rare, even if the settings are similar. This is a much more philosophical work, with lots of discussion about the nature of man.","I couldn't believe I would like this book when my dad recommended it to me. But I had to read something anyway for my English-class and man was my first impression wrong!This book changed my life! I was wondering all the time what I would do in that situation and kept on fantasising about that after finishing the book. It also got me really into the (post-)apocalyptic novels and the other books of Wyndham. Still, this one is my all-time favourite.A book that comes close is 'Lucifer' by Pournelle &amp; Niven. But it's also nice to read the follow-up: 'the night of the triffids'.I hope some day someone will write yet another book about triffids.","An excellent book - I only read it recently (despite its being on my 'to read' list for many years now) although can remember seeing a pretty cheesy series or movie of it on TV in the UK many years ago. The book is dark and frightening and very well written. Although I have only read one other Wyndham (The Chysalids), I intend to read a lot more. Anyone looking for some fine early science fiction should read some Wyndham - it as aged reasonably well and contains all the ingredients for a good read. I highly recommend this book.","If you saw the movie as a youngster who hadn't read the book, you probably had nightmares. If you saw it as an adult, or a kid who had read the book, you most certainly were disappointed. What Wyndham does here is put the reader into close contact with a very believable world. Maybe those satellites twirling around up there can't really blind us all; maybe plants such as these can never be produced by humankind, but Wyndham deftly (and, I think correctly) speculates on the events that would take place if those things did happen. Here, in The Day Of the Triffids these things did happen and the reader is, hand-in-hand with the hero, taken along on a dark and disturbing journey through a nightmare landscape. It is not just the Triffids that produce the horror; it is Wyndham's insightful portrayal of the actions and reactions of our fellow beings that disrupt our ease; that produces the horror that certainly lurks just below the surface of our present maelstrom world society.","Ignore the film. While a bit atmospheric, it's nowhere as close to the book as Village Of The Damned is to The Midwich Cuckoos. Instead, read this book because it's a complex but approachable book about the human condition on so many levels. Less imaginative science fiction fans may warn you away because it doesn't feature galactic empires or anthropomorphic horrors, but all the better. This is an imaginative and, you bet, classic book from a man who, along with Clifford Simak, knows how to invade the Earth in a genuinely horrifying way.While enjoying this book, keep an eye out for a copy of his even better invasion novel The Kraken Wakes (Out Of The Deeps). Ahead of its time in many ways.","I fell in love with Wyndham after &quot;The Kraken Wakes&quot;--his novels, just saturated with intelligent, thought-provoking, sometimes humorous and sometimes scary ideas reminds me of Aldous Huxley. &quot;Triffids&quot; is another fantastic piece of 'Science Fiction'. Wyndham once again takes us through yet another variation of The End Of The World As We Know It, and this one is very very eerie indeed. The desolation, the tribalness of the survivors, and the sheer loneliness and isolation pressing down on his hero, William Masen, as he wanders through the wreckage of London in search of his post-apocalypse friend, are very effective. So two are the matter-of-fact and chilling suicides of the blind survivors he comes across--one blind doctor tells Masen to lead him to his office, asks kindly in which direction the window is, and proceeds to jump through it without another word.Unfortunately it's just not as accomplished as 'Kraken Wakes'. And since I read 'Kraken' first, I have to give this one less star. I don't know if its just less believeable, or that Wyndham touches on a few of the same themes (and even locations!) in both novels that rubs off some of the magic, but there you have it.However, that's only a comparative comment. This book is fantastic. Everyone should read it.","The book is fantastic and I have recommended it to many people.However, I always tell them to avoid reading the back cover or introduction of this particular edition. Both the introduction and back cover contain spoilers, especially the introduction. I understand that I may be more sensitive to spoilers than some people, but the level of give-away in the introduction is mind-blowing. The entire book is summarized and all the twists are given away.Introductions like this should be considered literary crimes.Nonetheless, the book is wonderful. You should read it - but if you're buying this edition of the title as a gift, find a different edition or insert a note to avoid the introduction and back cover copy until after the book has been read.","Interesting read. Old SF novel that talks about the fears of the time (apocalypse from space). Story is told well but I felt the reaction of the blind people was a little unrealistic in that they were more non-functionally depressed than they were hysterical. The triffids were interesting creatures that were never really explained to my satisfaction.","There is another entry on Amazon for this same book.Type in:The Day of the Triffids (Modern Library 20th Century Rediscovery) on Amazon.The OTHER entry has 44 reviews of this same book.This OTHER entry also gives you the ability to\"Search inside this book\"","I read this book on the offhand advice of a microbiology professor, who flung it out casually during a discussion on genetic manipulation. He appeared rather amused by the plot line and narrative. His amusement, in retrospect, is certainly justified. The premise of the novel (two disasters, at least one brought upon mankind by his own hubris, which act in fateful concert to utterly destroy society as we know it) seems trite several decades after the writing. End-of-the-World scenarios are well explored by old and recent movies and books. And, well, man-eating plants were ever so exhausted by Little Shop of Horrors.However, like any really good science fiction, the genius is not in the details but in the way they play out and how the characters react to them. Wyndham wrote a study of human society which, while occasionally clumsy (I never felt that the central relationship between the main character and his girl was really believable), nevertheless provides food for thought. When you look at this book, look not only at the types of societies that Wyndham experiments with; notice the ways in which he dodges criticism regarding his treatment of ethics in his changed world. The author is very much present among the lines, and attempting to piece him together is as interesting as discovering his characters.As for the details: as corny as they seem at face value, they are possibly even more relevant to today's concerns than they were in the 60's. The triffids are a man-modified plant organism whose origin is unknown (though it is hinted that the Russians developed them, and were definitely growing them). The unfortunate fact is that, untended, they become very dangerous, often deadly. It is unclear whether they were designed to be such, or if this was an unintended side-effect, but everyone is fine with the situation since the plants can be controlled. Enter The Comets. The Comets are anticipated and eagerly observed by billions around the globe, who subsequently find themselves blind. And thus the stage is set for the two crises of the book: uncontrolled triffids and human anarchy. The latter is ultimately more interesting, and really subsumes the former. After all, in a society composed mostly of blind persons who all simultaneously are ignorant of how to cope with blindness, a GMO weed problem is only one of many issues that will have to be addressed on the road to survival.The biggest problem I have with the book's premise is that it seems to imply that, barring a cataclysmic event, the human species is in full control of its inventions. Per my very adamant opinion, we are not. We play with fire constantly, heedlessly, and often with an eye for nothing but the bottom line. I will spare everyone a discussion on genetically modified organisms and agribusiness practices, but the parallels are certainly there to see. The potential for things to go wrong (in overt as well as subtle ways) is real, and doesn't necessarily require worldwide blindness to be realized. To Wyndham's credit, he does provide an appropriate sense of uncertainty, at least where cataclysms are concerned. He does not take the subtle route, with either his comets or his triffids, but he does warn us that we are not in as much control as we would like to think.The overall sense of the book is one of tentative hope. After everything, humanity will (with luck) muddle through and even prevail, though possibly not. Possibly, the survivors will learn from the mistakes of the past, though very probably not. It is refreshing that not every loose end is perfectly tied, that some questions are left unanswered. The sense that the book is describing someone's reality is thus preserved. Few life stories have neat little endings, and it is gratifying to see an author who can bring a book to a solid conclusion without being a neat-freak about it. Good read.","I loved the opening, and overall thought it was a good book - the descriptions were good, the writing was snappy and engaging - however, by the end, I felt unfullfilled by it. The opening was super, very visual, getting you involved with the main character immediately. However, as the book continued, there were long diversions from the plot development that wound up going nowhere - such as the time Bill Mason (the main charactor and narrator) gets waylaid by a group and he gets separated from his female interest. This, as I said, did not contribute much to the story, as this group kind of just fizzles and now, Bill embarks on a nearly hopeless search for the woman from whom he became separated. This would not be so bad a plot development, but I was never convinced that Bill had that much feeling for her - nothing approaching passion - nothing approaching the kind of devotion that such a hopless search under dire and perilous circumstances would warrant.Additionally, there were so many details that were unaccounted for - how in heck did all those blind people take care of their sanitation? It might be nitpicking, it might seem low class of me to think of it, but I always look for this in a book. If people in books and movies never go to the bathroom, it detracts from the realism. Let's face it - all men and women on this planet - as well as every other organism, is no more than 2 - 3 hours at most from their next whizz. How did they ever wash? Or get their hair cut? Or get shoes or clothing? They were only trying to get food most of the time - very little else. I love these details - it draws me into a story - makes me almost feel a part of things. Without them, I become detached from a story. As far as sanitation, I guess at the time the book was written (1951) it would have been scandelous to account for it but hell, the Earth was ending. It's ok to kill off millions, but not ok to account for their hygene? Nah, the real end of the Earth would be very very very very much worse than Wyndham had it. P. C. Jersild had it right in After the Flood. The real END would be nearly unbearable, not a mere inconvenience. Then, the triffids themselves were less terrifying than they should have been. They just didn't arrouse the kind of horror that they might have. So - a good book - deserving of its reputation, yet, it falls a bit short.Just my humble opinion.","I'm torn as how best to review this book. One the one hand I've seen many adaptations of the book on TV and film. Some credit the book others don't. Having just recently seen the UK series &quot;Survivors&quot; (1975) I must say that I'm surprised that Terry Nation didn't credit Wyndham given the heavily lifted plot and dialogue! Sure, the main characters are changed around but the incidental plot elements are nearly the same and in the same order. All that is missing is the triffids and the comet.Which brings me to my main complaint about the book: The triffids hardly have anything to do with the plot of the book even though they are the title of it and are the most thought out piece of the book. The idea of a tech industry expirament let loose in the wild was fascinating but save for chapter 2, nothing is further is developed along those lines.Then there's the comet (if it is one) which blinds everyone and then the unexplained plague a few days later. Now if you believe the B film Day of the Comet, the comet turns those who saw it into zombies -- triffids be damned and then the same sort of plot (minus menacing plants) goes on. In this book though, the two seem unrelated except to kill off all those annoying recently rendered blind folks.","I understand the role this book has played in apocalyptic writings and has heavily influenced many writers and directors who have drawn on its themes, but... still couldn't get into it or much care for it. I found the book to be very dated in its cultural relevance and more or less a tract on the authors ideas about how to create a society in his own image, which bears some resemblance to Joseph Smith and Brigham Young's thoughts on the subject (which Wyndham touches on). Lots of internal and external dialog and exposition without resolution. It's written as a first-person of course, but I found the approach frankly tiresome. Kind of like reading Ayn Rand - you want to jump over big chunks just to avoid amateur philosophy. I suppose I'm happy to have read it since it is somewhat a touchstone of this oeuvre, but there are better options out there (The Road, A Canticle for Lebovitz, even The Stand) if you are looking for musings on the end of our current civilization.","I read this book for a class in British film because supposedly this book is a classic of the science fiction genre. And I like science-fiction. But this is just stupid. Don't get me wrong , it's got some very interesting ideas...the fall and fragmentation of civilization, etc. etc. But walking plants! For God's sake.There is not much of a coherent narrative here. The protagonist walks around telling us what he does here, there, and the next place. But do we care about the characters he runs into? No. Do the events relate well to one another? No. For example, Wyndham introduces a love interest for the main character early on in the story and then they meet up again at the end. We are told that he loves her, but he hardly shows it. And we don't care, because she hardly ever appears.You may want to read this for the ideas. It's got some good ones. But the writing ain't too good. Lots and lots of exposition and wasted space. A bit like a 1950's pulp magazine story, but a lot longer.Watch out for the walking plants! Don't get stung. Ooooooo.","Glaring grammatical and editing errors detract from a hastily constructed plot built on a series of flimsy contrivances. The author explores an end of the world motif, mankinds degradations and obligatory redemptions against a backdrop of killer plants and blindness. Disappointing at best.","\"The Day of the Triffids\" had its heyday back in the 1950s. For the most part, English teachers loved it and SF fans yawned. The author, Wyndom, knew how to write well. However, after the first quarter of the novel, real science fiction fans were asking: \"Well? When are we going to get to the serious science fiction?\" Alas! All that followed seemed like: \"Blah, blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah.\"My older brother, an English teacher, gave me the book when I was in eighth grade. He said: \"Here. Read something good for a change.\" I got through it. I remember it. But the darn thing has faded and faded ever since then. I am not sure why someone is trying to resurect it, now.Meanwhile, there were several science fiction novels written in the 1940s and 1950s, which continue to grow and become more influential.Towards the end of the first third of the book, the novel turns into a sort of science fiction horror story. However, most of the last two thirds left me wondering when the 'hero' was going to do something against the Triffids. Well, he does, sort of, do something. But the hero is not exactly a hero, he is more of a protagonist. Now there is a title that English teachers like. But, regular people wonder why he is standing there and talking, why not DO SOMETHING!At least, that is how I felt, fifty years ago. The second and last time I picked the book up, was, about, twenty or thirty years later. I went through it quickly and confirmed my first impressions. I have not tried to go through it again. Meanwhile, there are some books I pick up every year to go through them and enjoy them all over again.So, two stars, no more than that. Sorry.","John Wyndham is not exactly a household name, not even among horror or science fiction fans. He did, however, write at least a couple noteworthy books, notable for their cinematic adaptations. The Midwich Cuckoos became Village of the Damned, one of the earliest \"creepy kid\" horror films (inspiring at least one sequel, one remake and one Simpson's parody). The other adaptation would bear the same name as the book: The Day of the Triffids.This short (less than 250 pages) apocalyptic novel begins with a strange comet shower that permanently blinds anyone who looks at it. Bill Masen, in hospital with bandaged eyes, is quickly over his disappointment at missing the shower when he discovers that he is one of a small minority who can see. The old saying (referred to in the novel) that in the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king, turns out not to be true. Bill and the few other sighted people are often too busy struggling to survive to worry about setting up empires.Blindness is not the worst problem, nor is the plague that preys on a lot of the people, particularly in London. No, the worst problem are the triffids, bioengineered plants that are not only poisonous and carnivorous, but also have a rudimentary intelligence and can walk. It's kind of like a precursor to the zombie story: the triffids are slow-moving but deadly and getting more numerous and putting Bill and his small group of allies under siege.As a novel written in the early 1950s, The Day of the Triffids does have a bit of English stuffiness to it, but not as much as some other works from the same period. For the most part, this is a nicely dark novel, one that addresses the dangers of Cold War warfare, particularly the use of biological weapons.","The Day of the Triffids shows its age, particularly in its treatment of the female characters, but is still worth reading because it informed so much of today's science fiction writing. On the whole the characters are long-winded by today's standards and spend more time discussing philosophy and literaure than people in a similar situation would likely do. The triffids themselves are a brilliant bit of imagination by the author. Check it out.","What a fantastic book! I really don't like scifi for the most part, now sure I loved Ender's Game and 1984 (who didn't) but for the most part - technology bores me... so I avoid scifi books like the plague. Why I ended up reading this one I'll never know, but I am so glad I did.Published in 1951 (that's the version I read - it's OLD) there are some forward looking assumptions that are rather creepy when you think of when it was published. We follow a survivor and the people he encounters after something strange occured that blinded most of humanity. On top of that, these vicious little (well not that little) plants that we had been cultivating for their oil are quite happliy munching on all of the blind folks that are now wandering around. Then there's the plague.That's quite a lot to deal with especially when you throw in the sighted survivors have all gone a wee bit crazy in their attempts to survive and rebuild civilization. Probably one of the oldest survival horror books that I have read (it's clear that many zombie novels written later took a few ideas from this) I absolutley loved this book.2012 here we come baby! Bring on the Triffids","William Masen wakes up in the hospital to discover that everyone in the world has gone blind after observing a strange, green glow in the sky. He was spared because of temporary blindness caused the sting of a triffid, a large, mobile, carnivorous plant which is cultivated for its oil. William manages to find some other people who escaped the blindness, but their efforts to survive are complicated by the triffids which seem to be consciously trying to hunt down humans.I read Triffids for the first time about 20 years ago, and rereading it now it still holds up quite well. I can see how this book has probably formed the basis for a lot of later end-of-the world stories. Wyndham manages to pack a lot of story into under two hundred pages. The moral choices that the characters has to make were interesting, and not just a simple black or white, especially in the way that Coker could come to admit that his attempt to do what he saw was right was in fact a mistake. The only thing that seems a little off is that the story seems like it would be taking place in the 1970's or 1980's, but society has not changed at all, and the characters seem more like they are still in the 1950's, but I guess that trying to extrapolate and explain social changes in society on top of everything else would have been too much for the book.I do wonder what the purpose of the triffids really is in the story. The blinding itself is enough to bring down civilization, and to provide the cautionary message. The triffids don't really play a major role until late in the story. They do seem to provide a means to unify most of the remnants of humanity in the fight against a common enemy, and provide a reason to quickly rebuild civilization.","That's really all I have to say.This is a great book!","You won't read this book if you base your decision on a quick summary: \"A mysterious green meteor shower blinds most of humanity, who are then preyed upon by large, ambulatory, three-legged plants that lash long, poisonous, whip-like tentacles out of their stalks. Our hero, spared the blindness by a timely stay in the hospital, finds romance and socio-political insight as he helps rebuild civilization. All of this happens in the UK.\"Suspend your disbelief and read the book. The motivations and actions of people trying to survive are realistic and interesting. And the various philosophies for both individual and group survival are thought-provoking. You will enjoy this story if you have enjoyed any ofThe Stand,Alas, Babylon, orEarth Abides. It is a thoughtful exploration of the fall of civilization and its implications, packaged in an engaging adventure. Good reading.A caution: Enjoying science fiction always requires some suspension of disbelief. Even more so with older science fiction. In this case, the story and exploration of ideas is worth this effort. Don't trouble yourself wondering why the cold of winter doesn't help human beings in their struggle with these walking plants. Or why most of the unstable triffids don't expire in some \"I've fallen and can't get up\" scenario. (Their anatomy as described wouldn't permit them to bend enough to get up from a prone position.) You can find more of these issues if you try. Don't. Not the first time through, anyway. Just enjoy a great story from one of the masters of early science fiction.","Since purchasing my Kindle, I am reading a lot of older books and truly enjoying the ride. Day of the Triffids was a great read. Not too heavy on the despair of humanity after a devastating event, and not too heavy on any one person's search for answers. I would have liked to read more about the global response to the tragedy and ensuing hysteria, but still a great original story.","\"The Day of the Triffids\" was for many years my favorite sci-fi novel; afterwards it was replaced in that honor place by Dune and Hyperion.I've read this novel when I was a teenager in the mythical Argentinean sci-fi magazine \"Mas Alla\", it was published there as the main story of the inaugural number. I've treasured my collection for more than 40 years.\"The Day of the Triffids\" still stands in my all-time best novels list and I've reread it once every couple of years.It is a typical product of the '50 immersed in the \"Cold War\", but with a forceful story line, exploring a post catastrophe world.The drama evolves smoothly, griping you up to the last page; it has a somewhat melancholic background, our known world fading into dust and a new one emerging from the ashes in a pitiless confrontation with the Triffids of the title.It is a novel that fifty years after it was written still catch your interest and keep you going on.In sci-fi not to be dated is a commendation.If the reader wants to have a vivid picture of London in a state similar to this book descriptions I encourage he/she to see the movie \"28 Days Later\".I wholeheartedly recommend this book to all sci-fi fans and general public too!Reviewed by Max Yofre","A great novel in the zombie/vampire genre, with a solitude-induced dystopia akin to Matheson's I Am Legend and Brook's World War Z.Some may see the sci-fi concepts as far fetched, specifically the triffids themselves, but the overall story congeals well bringing about stressful situations and sparking philosophical questions regarding morality, social convention, principles, and what would be the appropriate type of organization in the chaotic aftermath of pandemic blindness.","Not much I can add that others haven't.This is an excellent book, which, because it deals with human nature, surely has to remain timeless.In the aftermath of the comets, the loneliness of people who are literally left in the dark is tangible and help to make this novel remain in your mind long after you've finished reading it.The part the triffids play in this chaos is remarkably easy to imagine, especially knowing the scientific research that is carried out now into genetic engineering. The triffids, although dangerous, are tolerated and managed because of their useful oil. If some degenerative diseases could be eradicated by cultivating a deadly plant...would we?I really enjoyed the way Wyndham makes us think about human behaviour and how hard it is to unlearn. The ideas on what to tell future generations and the references to disasters in the ancient world I found really thought provoking.","The Rosetta edition seems to be quite good. I have checked various spots throughout and found no errors. I have searched for the symbol \"!\" and the number \"1\" to see if they have been substituted for letters like \"i\" or \"l\" and found none.Most, if not all, of the negative reviews seem to be for an edition (put out by someone else) that is no longer available. I don't think that anyone should be afraid of the Rosetta version.","I heard about this book when it was reviewed by Kill Me If I Stop and knew I just had to read it. I'd never heard of it or the author, John Wyndham, even though he's written quite a few science fiction books.Let me just say that this book is amazing! It's unlike anything I've ever read and not only is it an entertaining read, it's also terrifying and very thought provoking. I don't want to give away too much of what happens because it's best if you discover it for yourself.As I read I felt so aware of my eyes and ability to see. It's something I take for granted and don't even think about until forced to contemplate a life in the dark. This book makes you realize just how much you rely on sight and how helpless you could become if you were deprived of it.Another thing this book really impressed upon me was how much people in the past had to overcome when building society as we know it today. When the people have to start from scratch they have the advantage of knowledge but they still have to work to create a new world. That alone made me realize just how fortunate I am to live in this era where many things have already been discovered, best practices already implemented, and technology already invented. All those things allow me to live a rather easy life full of leisure time and enjoyment versus a constant struggle to survive and find food, for example.While the concept of plants that can walk around might sound outrageous, Wyndham's writing deals with the idea so well that you find yourself imagining that it just might be possible. Not to mention we already have venus flytrap plants and mimosa pudica, a plant that shrinks back when touched. And then there's Cleve Backster, a lie-detector expert who hooked up a plant to one of his machines and found it \"reacted sharply when he merely thought about burning one of its leaves.\"The Triffid plants in the book are definitely dangerous but Wyndham doesn't write them as horrific monsters. That doesn't mean they aren't that scary because they are. He just didn't sensationalize them and I think that's why this book comes across as so realistic and frightening.","This was the book that turned me into a reader at aged 12. Sure, I read books before this...because I had to at school.That first time I read Day of the Triffids in one night...I just couldn't put it down. That had never happened to me before. The opening was so haunting...it was like nothing I'd ever read before. I remember I spilled tea on it, dried it out on the radiator and had to return it to the school library...somewhat guiltily... the next day. I made up for it by becoming a school librarian, though I must admit this did also allow me to work my way through the science-fiction books available. All of John Wyndham, on to Arthur C. Clarke, Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, A.E. Van Vogt....on and on. Oh, happy days.I remember, in my final year or so of school, we had to read it for English literature lessons. It turns out it was abridged. I spotted it inside a few minutes, and simply refused to read the abridged version. How dare they?I've been a science-fiction fan for decades now thanks intitially to this book, but long ago also branched out into fantasy, history, military history, science, philosophy, biographies, poetry, gothic horror and some classic and modern fiction.Day Of The Triffids is just one of those books I love to re-read. I've lost count how many times I've read it. I don't claim it's the best science-fiction ever, but it does hold a very special and personal place in my heart. I know - flesh eating plants and meteorites that make you blind. How can that weird apocalyptic stuff possibly work? But it does....at least in John Wyndham's hands.It's not a long book and it's a very easy read. I was gripped from the opening pages. If you haven't read it I hope you try it and enjoy it as much as I did.","Re-reading this Great Classic 1962 Novel is pure pleasure. John Wyndam's book was made into a movie (1962), BBC Miniseries (twice) and a Sam Raimi rumoured remake. Another of his great books, The Midwich Cuckoos (available on the Kindle also) was made into the movie \"The Village of the Damned\". The Day of the Triffids is definitely one of the best Sci-Fi books ever written. Pick it up for your Kindle and enjoy!","Day of the Triffids is many things. Most are well covered in other reviews. I fist saw the movie 45 or so years ago, and read the book about 40 years ago. It is a fun book to read. That may be somewhat odd to say about a post apocalyptic novel, but the book, while dealing with a serious subject, is not depressing and has enough mystery about the how things will turn out to keep you avidly reading.I think we have generally forgotten the tension that existed in the 1950's - even though it was not all that long ago. Day of the Triffids is definitely a product of the early Cold War and helps remind us how real the possibility of large scale destruction was.","The world comes to an end in this novel with a cosmic light show that leaves everyone who watches it...which is almost everybody...blind the next morning. And ready to take advantage of this are the triffids, ambulatory tree-like plants that have become a mainstay in the economy because they produce a high quality vegetable oil. The problem with the triffis, however, if they have a whip-like tendril that sprouts from their crown and is capable of killing people struck by it. After sufficient time for decompositionl, the whip will hook meat and bring it back so they can feed themselves. How do you deal with that?The book spawned a movie with American actor and singer Howard Keel in the lead, a common practice in 1950's English movies where American character actors took the lead with an otherwise all-British cast. The story is different in details, but substantially similar.The triffids, of course, sound much more impressive in the book than they look on screen -- that's the power of imagination for you. Unlike the movie, the book doesn't try for a simple happy ending, but more like a conditional happy ending.It's a nice little chiller. I first read it when I was a teen...I had to snap it up and reread it. Glad I did.","If you like H.G. Wells, apocalypse books or even if zombie books are your thing, then this is an excellent read. An apocalypical story in which the remaining survivors of a holocoust(fantasticaly slow holocoust)band together, plan to avoid the extcintion of the human race, avoid the power hungry psycopathic gangs and build something for themselves and their offspring. Gripping stuff, fantastically written, make this a pure joy to read.","I really enjoyed this short novel, its \"english\" take on the end of the world , especially having been written in the 50's, is refreshing, i hope youll give it a go...","Great book, it grips you from the first page. I read it in high school in 1980 and then again last year and I think it was even better the second time around","I loved this book. If you love survival stories that make you think \"if I lived in that situation, how would -I- survive?\", then read this one. The characters are likeable, it is simple enough to read (I read it casually in two days) yet is thought-provoking, has a good pace, and has a good ending. Read if you like learning about alien species, following a likeable character on his journey to find a new way of life, and imagining how you would try to rebuild society if survival and cooperation were more important than petty politics and materialism.","\"The Day of the Triffids\" by John Wyndham seems to be a forgotten child of the post-apocalyptic genre. I'm not sure if this is due to it's relatively unorthodox premise, or it's somewhat dated take on gender roles, but either reason is, frankly, dead wrong as this is an amazing book that ranks with \"On the Beach\" and \"Alas, Babylon\" as a cornerstone of the genre. With a premise that is both utterly unique and rich in metaphor, and characters that are charged with emotion, it is a truly gripping read.What sets \"The Day of the Triffids\" apart from other books in the genre is its two tiered approach to the end of the world. The first revolves around the eponymous Triffids, which are mobile, semi-carnivorous plants which are presumed to be the result of Soviet genetic tampering. While one would expect that they would be treated as a scourge, quite the opposite occurs as mankind farms them for the rich oils they produce. Thus, is the hubris of man framed quite nicely, and the pieces put in play.For the triffids are only benign so long as man can control them; when left to their own devices they grow an intensely venomous lash that can kill a full grown human. When a bizarre stellar event leaves everyone who witnessed it blind, the time of the triffids is suddenly at hand. To go further would risk spoiling the plot, but as the few sighted survivors struggle to make sense of, and survive in, their greatly altered world, the triffids become the foremost obstacle to their continued existence.Thus, \"The Day of the Triffids\" stands quite nicely as a post-apocalyptic thriller. However, it is what is going on between the lines that makes this a classic. First is the obvious comparison between the triffids and the Soviets. Not only did the latter create the former, but the swarming, relentless approach of the triffids nicely mirrors the Western view of Soviet expansions in the 1950's. However, unlike many Cold War era authors, Wyndham's view of the world is not entirely black and white. While the Soviet system may be the enemy, and not one he wants to live under, he doesn't remove all blame from the West. By their very response to Soviet moves he sees a world made less, not more safe, and one that is walking a knife's edge over the abyss.Ultimately though, he sees hope for mankind because even as it teeters on the brink of extinction, he anticipates the ability to learn and grow from the mistakes of the past. His rather prescient views of the use of space and bio-technology offer hope, but only if used responsibly, and therefore \"The Day of the Triffids\" is as much a cautionary tale, somewhat in the vein of a \"Jurassic Park\", as it is a post-apocalyptic thriller.Finally, there is a small but very noticeably element that infuses much of the first half of the novel. Time and again, Wyndham has his characters assuming that the Americans will be along by and by to sort things out. Given that this novel was published in 1951 on the heels of World War II, one has to assume that Wyndham was warning his fellow countrymen that the Americans weren't going to be around forever, so they better start standing on their own two feet. While hardly essential to the plot, this historical artifact does offer interesting insight into the context of the book.Finally, as I alluded to above, there is definitely a pervasive, but largely benign note of sexism in \"The Day of the Triffids\". While it may offend some, it is by no means misogynistic, and rather reflects a form of chivalry that was probably outdated even as Wyndham wrote the book. On some level he seems to recognize this, as his writing of female characters is somewhat conflicted; he wants to shelter them even as he knows they must be strong. Again, more than anything this offers an interesting historical context to the novel.I should also add that the introduction by Edmund Morris is superb, as he does an excellent job of stating why \"The Day of the Triffids\" is still relevant, and perhaps more pertinent than ever in our post-9/11 world. He writes particularly strongly of Wyndham's pathos for the victims, and how it mirrors our own response to terrorism. The rare novel that offers both gripping narrative and thoughtful commentary, \"The Day of the Triffids\" represents post-apocalyptic literature at its best and should rightly be held among the best contributions to the genre.Jake Mohlman","While I stand by the reviews that state the excellence of this story, and the skill of the author, intending purchasers should know that this is an *edited* edition - something I didn't pick up on until reading along with a BBC unabridged reading of the book.Example - in Chapter 1 when Bill Masen encounters the doctor in the corridors of the hospital - this has been removed from this edition.The fact this is an edited version needs to be made clear to intending purchasers","Day of the Triffids kicks butt! Two weeks ago I had never heard of John Wyndham, but I found his name in [...] fiction archive, and I looked up his books here at Amazon.The opening scene in Triffids is mesmerizing. The basic premise of the book is that a meteor shower blinds most of the world population, except for a handful of people. One of lucky ones is Bill Masen, who was in a hospital with bandages over his eyes and was not able to watch the meteor shower. Towards the end of the book, narrator Masen speculates that the meteor shower might have been caused by man-made satellites orbiting Earth, and indeed, the whole apocalyptic vision of the novel voices the concerns any sane human being would have had shortly after WWII and the discovery of the destructive power of atomic energy.That said, the novel is not at all a doom and gloom book. It is actually quite hopeful, optimistic, and funny. There is a romantic subplot wherein Bill meets a charming woman named Josella Payton, only to be separated from her in the aftermath of the devastating meteor shower. A good part of the book follows Bill's search for Josella through various malevolent organizations that spring up in the months after the meteor shower.Developing alongside this story line, is the story of the triffids, a kind of six-foot-tall Venus Flytrap with a stinging whip that has the ability to pick up its roots and walk around. In the wake of world blindness, these plants begin attacking people who stumble blindly around London and the English countryside outside of London.The novel has a very solid ending that made me feel happy to have read the book. It was such a good story I'm going to see if I can get a copy of Wyndham's other classic bestseller, The Cuckoo's of Midwich. I highly recommend Day of the Triffids to any sci-fi fan, as well as to anyone who likes a good old-fashioned white-knuckle yarn. And, of course, I hope this review is helpful to you!Stacey CochranAuthor of CLAWS available for 80 cents","This is a great classic work of science fiction; however, the Kindle edition doesn't do it justice. Besides not including the Introduction that's included in the paperback edition, the Kindle version is full of typos, missing letters, missing punctuation, and so on. Amazon needs to do a better job of quality control on the books it accepts for the Kindle.","First published in 1951, this classic science-fiction novel was unique for its time (although undoubtedly inspired by &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;). The story follows the plight of the world's few remaining survivors after three (possibly) coincidental cataclysmic events of uncertain origins: the genetic development of mobile, carnivorous plants; the blinding of the earth's inhabitants by what may or may not have been a meteor shower; and the sudden onset of a mysterious and fatal disease. Most of the world's inhabitants are sightless and unable to defend themselves against the marauding plants, and even those with vision succumb to the plague.End-of-the-world scenarios have of course been done to death, especially in B-movies, but &quot;Day of the Triffids&quot; has withstood the test of time--not because of its plot, but because it anticipated many other works and because the writing and themes are a cut above your typical pulp fiction. Nearly every episode in the book has been replicated in dozens of science fiction and horror movies and novels. Filmgoers who have seen &quot;Resident Evil&quot; or &quot;28 Days Later&quot; will recognize the opening scene, in which Wiliam Masen wakes up in a hospital room, unaware that the world as he knows it has come to a devastating end. Other scenes recall the &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; series and similar films, and the descriptions of the survivors' efforts to rebuild society clearly influenced many later works of dystopian fiction.Wyndham adopts a minimalist &quot;noir&quot; style for the first sections, using a surreal first-person perspective to convey the confusion, fear, and isolation afflicting William Masen while he tries to figure out what has happened. When the focus of the book changes from the lone individual to bands of the living, the author shifts to a more expansive and analytic prose that fleshes out the book's social and political commentary.It is the exploration of these themes that makes the book so fascinating. As various groups of survivors unite together, they adopt different modes of government: a communalism that tries to rescue as many people as possible, a fundamentalism entrenched in its devotion to outdated moral codes, a militarism that quickly degenerates to totalitarianism, and a rationalism relying on the survival of the fittest to guarantee as many new offspring as possible. Each of these myopic systems suffers from a slavishness to one goal at the expense of any other: preventing as many deaths as possible, preserving morality, maintaining law and order, and insuring the survival of the species. Following the traditions of the best dystopian fiction, Wyndham uses his story to examine the faults with our present world and its communist, theocratic, authoritarian, and Darwinian societies.The ending of the book is just open-ended and ambiguous enough to have allowed for a sequel, by Wyndham wasn't the type to write or authorize one (although Simon Clark published &quot;The Night of the Triffids&quot; two years ago). This closing ambiguity seems appropriate: in the real world, there are never as many solutions as there are problems.","My first introduction to The Day of the Triffids was watching the BBC series as a child. I was terrified. Many years later I opened the book and discovered John Wyndham. Having read all his books I rate this one right at the top.Like his other titles, the reader is immediately immersed in the &quot;what if&quot; world that Wyndham creates. The protagonist, Bill Mason is one of the few people in the world not sent blind by a meteor shower. To compound his situation earth is taken over by Triffids; walking, man eating plants, biological abominations created by you guessed it, humans. Our hero must flee the death and depravity of London and attempt to start a new life not only for himself but for humankind.A battle for survival of the fittest is dramatically played out with the winner changing constantly. Some themes that I found interesting included the struggle for man to again dominate over nature and the effect of a cataclysmic event on human inter-relations.This book is classic Science Fiction but I also like think of it as Horror without gore.","You can read other reviews to get the storyline etc. But - although it's brilliantly imagined and carried off - the plot isn't the most important thing about this book. What counts is the vision, the intelligence, the language, and most of all the humanity.These bring to the book a timelessness usually absent in science fiction. It's astonishing to realize that this book was written in 1951! Not only because Wyndham foresaw orbiting weapons and designer crops, but because there's almost nothing that would need to change if it was rewritten today. The important things don't change even that fast, and this book deals with important things. This is subtly done, since all of the protagonist's concerns are immediate throughout; but his and others' decisions reflect unchanging aspects of human nature and of nature itself.I first read this around 1960, and enjoyed it but did not really appreciate it then. This time I had the additional advantage of hearing the Chivers audiobook, wonderfully narrated by Samuel West.Don't miss it!","This is the first serious novel I ever read. (Before that I was only reading Doctor Who tie-in's.) After seeing the BBC adaptation on TV I wanted to read this book. I got it when I was 11 and have cherished it ever since. This was the book that made John Wyndham famous: the overnight destruction of civilization by &quot;comet debris&quot;, the world overrun by flesh-eating plants called triffids.One could look at this book as a war between man and nature on a grand scale. When mankind was the species that dominated all others, nature was driven back, &quot;suppressed&quot;, or killed in the name of progress. When the tables are suddenly turned, it looks as if mankind is in decline. As the years pass, dead cities are slowly disappearing, turning into jungles as nature takes hold. In a matter of time nature will take over completely and the triffids will be the new inheritors. Unless the human race can fight back and reassert itself.I have lost count of how many times I have read this book. I am 23 and the story is just as effective now as it was when I first read it. I like seeing all the different cover artwork that people have done for this book. The fact that it's been reprinted so many times is proof that this novel shows no sign of losing its popularity.","The Day of the Triffids has all the feel on a 1950s cheesy science fiction movie: implausible monsters (walking/thinking/hunting plants) threatening the existence of the human race. There is also some Cold War paranoia (..the commies are behind all this!) for good measure. However the book surprisingly rises above the silliness and is, thankfully, an enjoyable read.The Day of the Triffids succeeds because of two factors. One, it does a terrific job of building suspense; it is indeed a page-turner. Secondly, its description of how people act after &quot;the world has ended&quot; is frighteningly realistic. Think Stephen King's The Stand and you've got the right idea. However Wyndham's prose is a bit more crisp, and the scenes are less graphic.Bottom line: a surprisingly mature bit of nostalgic science fiction. Not quite as shocking as when it was first published, yet The Day of the Triffids still offers reading entertainment value.","Fantastic, frightening and entirely plausible, \"Day of the Triffids\" is a post-apocalyptic story based on a simple hypothesis - mass blindness coupled with the natural disaster of a mobile stinging plant called the triffid created by genetic engineering gone sour! Wyndham's genius is how he uses the tale of his still sighted protagonists, Bill Masen and Josella Playton, to address the moral and psychological issues that would be certain to raise their heads in this particular new world order - the definition of marriage, sexuality and the survival of the race, law and order, male vs female roles, government and authority, survival of the fittest and many more. Thought provoking in the extreme and yet still completely satisfying even when read only on the surface as a science-fiction thriller!Paul Weiss","I am fortunate that I had not seen the movie before picking up this book--it would have persuaded me not to buy it. Day of the Triffids is a fantatstic science fiction story written in the 1950s but is hardly outdated. The main reason that the story stays current is that the main issues in this book are not about technology (like a lot of scifi) but deal with human psychology and cultural issues following a mass catastrophe.(I would like to ask Margaret Atwood if she was influenced by some of Wyndham's ideas about gender issues discussed in this book before she wrote the Handmaid's Tale...there are some definate similarities concerning the post-apocolyptic role of women).If you live in London, this book is especially good. Everyday I walk past the various parks and university areas that the triffids run over in the book. The story really comes to life when you walk past Russell Square and imagine triffids swaying in the wind.","Fantastic book, just needs a real publisher with proofreaders on staff.Check this out...&#34;The Tynsham people had the means to fetch supplies was in London. A couple of loads would not make a great deal from towns where there was no sign of the disease that of difference to them either way, so in the end we went as we had come.&#34;Yikes.No author's work, let alone a great one, should be treated this way.Do it right, or not at all.","Great story, spoilt by what must be no proof reading of the OCR-ed print edition. Disappointing and will make me avoid the Rossetta Books Into Film editions in the future.","I have always liked this story. It was realistic if such an event were to really happen. There have been some film adaptations which, for the most part, don't give the written version much credit. Reading the book is much better than watching the film.","John Wyndam's book is over 50 years old andstill holds up, why this is not on more top 10scifi list is beyound me.","i loved re reading this again having first read it in my late teens.a solid story a little dated now (no cell phones and internet) but simply relished it","Read it for the first time 50 years ago. Made a lasting impression and what I measure good SiFi against. Bought it just for the memories.","Disturbing, thought provoking, beautifully written. 60 odd years later it makes your question where we're going as a race. Timeless","I keep ordering extra copies of this book because I can't stop giving it to people. It is one of my favorite stories.","Having lived in the area (Southern England) for many years the story was even more realistic to me. Who knows what is out there in the universe! thought provoking and enjoyable to the last page!","\"The Day of the Triffids\" was for many years my favorite sci-fi novel; afterwards it was replaced in that honor place by Dune and Hyperion.I've read this novel when I was a teenager in the mythical Argentinean sci-fi magazine \"Mas Alla\", it was published there as the main story of the inaugural number. I've treasured my collection for more than 40 years.\"The Day of the Triffids\" still stands in my all-time best novels list and I've reread it once every couple of years.It is a typical product of the '50, but with a forceful story line, exploring a post catastrophe world. The drama evolves smoothly, griping you up to the last page; it has a somewhat melancholic background, our known world fading into dust and a new one emerging from the ashes in a pitiless confrontation with the Triffids of the title.It is a novel that fifty years after it was written still catch your interest and keep you going on.In sci-fi not to be dated is a commendation.If the reader wants to have a vivid picture of London in a state similar to this book descriptions I encourage he/she to see the movie \"28 Days Later\".Reviewed by Max Yofre","John Wyndham, The Day of the Triffids (Modern Library, 1951)If you've only seen the quite fine fifties film based on this book, as is the case with most film adaptations, you don't know triffids. While the folks who made the film did quite a good job within the framework of the fifties horror movie, there's a great deal more to the book.Bill Masen wakes up in the hospital the morning after a meteor shower that had captivated the entire planet to find that most of his human compatriots have been blinded by the light from the meteors. Masen, with his head in bandages during the shower, missed it, and retains his sight, strolling through a post-apocalyptic England in the first half of the novel, documenting life after the tragedy-- and before the triffids. The triffids are odd plants that seemingly appeared out of nowhere, and Masen, in fact, worked for a company that extracted nutritional compounds from them. Wonderfully useful as long as they were kept in tight check by their human masters, triffids had spread throughout England without anyone giving them a second thought. A blind populace, however, cannot control its previously-useful pet...Much has been made of the brilliance of the layered narrative and the many parallels with life at the beginning of the Cold War, so I won't do anything here except mention it all in passing. This new edition's introduction, by the always wonderful Edmund Morris, is aimed at convincing a new generation that Wyndham's remarkable Cold War fable is still as relevant, if not more so, in the post-9/11 world. As much as reading Edmund Morris' words, even if only in a brief introduction, pleases me, I have to wonder why this was necessary; a simple reading of this very quick and compelling novel should be more than enough to convince the average person of the validity of the introduction's argument. The Day of the Triffids is very much still relevant, and still just as cracking as it was in 1951. ***","A wonderful post-apocalyptic look at the human comdition. Disregard the movie. This is a surprisingly good look examination of different arcs that humanity could take if civilization was pulled out from under us. Cold, harsh, and cruel, but gripping and honest. Highly recommended. While you're at it, check out \"The Chrysalids.\"","I first saw the movie Day of the Triffids With Howard Keel and was interested in reading the book. I found that the book was very interesting and thought provocing as it has the elements many of which can be found being put forward in scientific circles today. Man tinkering around with genetics that may one day engulf and possibly overshadow mankind itself by mistake or mutation. I found the book to be one that once I started I had to finnish to see the outcome. The book puts man against the triffids but the handicap gives the plants an advantage over most of mankind. The few people that have retained thier sight have their hands full staying alive. This book makes the one who reads it actually become one of the charactors either main or background. This book is exciting reading. Mr.Wyndham was truly a writer before his time","Nature has always been an unfolding mystery to the human race. From the very beginning of time, men depicted stories of nature's beginning on cave walls and told beautiful myths and stories in an attempt to explain the unknown. Even today, there is much in the world we do not understand. John Wyndam's The Day of the Triffids presents a possible side of nature that has not yet been discovered.The novel takes place in the suburbs of England in the early twenty-first century, where Bill Masen has been checked into the hospital after surviving a brutal attack from a triffid, one of a strange species of carnivorous plants. While he is in he hospital, the Earth supposedly passes through a cloud of comet debris, creating what the press call \"the most remarkable celestial spectacle on record.\" However, like many things today, the beautiful meteor shower has a hidden catch - all who watch it will become blind. Bill, who is unable to watch the phenomenon due to his bandaged eyes, awakes in the morning to a deathly silence and to the awful realization that everyone around him is sightless. He ventures out of the hospital and teams up with a young author, Josella Playton, who can see as well. The two explore the country together in hopes of finding more humans who have not become blinded by the shower and instead discover that the triffids have begun to walk and are attacking innocent and blinded humans. The Day of the Triffids relates the story of Bill and Josella's fight to survive in the seemingly impossible.John Wyndam's The Day of the Triffids is an exciting and compelling novel that will keep the reader hanging on every word, just waiting to see what will happen next. The plot of the book is farfetched yet understandable and interesting, and leaves one wondering if something so horrifying could occur in the world today. The terror that Bill and Josella face in their triffid-inhabited world makes the characters easy to relate to and sympathize with. Practically everyone in the world has been faced with a challenge or difficult situation, and The Day of the Triffids just magnifies the fear one might go through. Wyndam strings together a series of events in such a way that every part of the book is engrossing, and he leaves the reader begging for more.For more information on The Day of the Triffids, go to:http://people.ne.mediaone.net/cjr815/reviews/triffids","I love old sci-fi movies -- especially those made in the late 50s and 60s. This book was reminiscent of those old movies. It had the same character build-up, the sense of despair, and horror at what was happening, which was countered with the determination of the individuals to survive no matter what the odds.The book started off well, and continued on in the same vein, giving enough information along the way to paint the picture of what life might be like if nature turned on us and another form of life took over.The story is told through the eyes of Bill Masen, one of the lucky ones who survived the first events and retained his eye sight. Through his eyes we see mankind turning on each other, we desolation, and we experience fear. Fortunately, we also see hope and the will to live through a story well told. I recommend this book.","Definately not one to miss. A great story with an interesting plot. My favorite aspect of the work is its treatment of biological principles. Aside from the other-wordly nature of the story, biologically most of the ideas are pretty sound.","This is a good book and one that more people should take time to read. Dull at parts, but otherwise very interesting. Also, if you like the book, do not watch the 1963 film version. It takes away from the book and gives nothing back.","As if most everyone on earth losing their sight would not be enough of a story line, Wyndham next throws in the Triffids! I enjoyed this book tremendously as Wyndham explored how people survived this dual tragedy. The book is one of my favorites.","This is a fantastic book! It's one of the first science fiction books I've read, and now I want to read John Whyndam's other books. The plot is really good-a world in which most people have gone blind, then eaten by walking, talking plants! I give this book 5 out of 5. I just hope this doesn't happen in real life!"],

      "description":"\"David Gemmell tells a tale of very real adventure, the stuff of true epic fantasy.\" --R.A. Salvatore, New York Times Bestselling author While the Earth quaked, a deadly power burst forth from ancient Atlantis. For the gate of time had been torn open, freeing a cataclysmic evil. Only the last guardian, Jon Shannow, the legendary pistoleer, could shut the deadly portal. But to accomplish this he would have to find the shining Sword of God, said to be floating among the clouds in the perilous lands beyond the wall, where beasts walked like men and worship a dark goddess.

      "reviews.text":["Wonderful reading!!!!Just don't use Amazon shipping....just buy the book from the local bookseller for the same price and begin reading immediately instead of 2 weeks later!","Jon Shannow has learned that he is not just a man. When an Atlantean king out of the ages appears to him in dreams and tells him of his mythic heroic destiny, and tells how he, Pendarric, loosed the bloodstones upon the world.An upstart gunslinger is looking to make a rep for himself by coming after Shannow, reliant on his speed.That is a minor problem, when a mystic time gate opens, letting loose all sorts of problems.Easily fixed. Easy, that is, if you call finding the Sword of God easy.","This book freaked me out. Books 1 and 2 of the Stones of Power series are centered around King Uther. Book 3 introduces the adventures of Jon Shannow.And Book 4? Book 4 of the Stones of Power series thrusts us into a continuation of crazy sci-fi, but adds a little religion to the mix. We learn more about Atlantis (finally!) as a portal is opened that exposes the modern tipsy-turvy world to Atlantis, a nation unknowingly on its death bed. A prophet from Atlantis flees to Shannow's land and sort of finds answers to questions he didn't even know he needed to ask. Shannow battles the forces of evil, quotes scripture, and somehow is connected to the mysterious revival taking place in other parts of the land.His ability to look back upon \"our\" time to see our mistakes is eye opening and a bit more than you bargain for in a futuristic novel. Eloquent and very well done fiction.","This was a great book, i loved the way Shannow aged and did get slower instead of staying totally young- although as those who've read it know... there is a twist. the line between good and evil was blurred because the 'Daggers' in particular were sown to be kind of nice. I liked that and I'd give this book an 11 if i could.","Jon Shannow easily mistaken for a post nuclear Clint Eastwood,is head and shoulders the most calmest man in a fire fight.After reading his stories there is nothing you could believe hecouldn't do, yet you are astounded with everything he does.David Gemmell the master of heroic fantasy.","While most sequels are underwhelming retreads of mealticket stories, some do manage to outdo, or at least match, their predecessor. 'The Last Guardian', sequel to the amazing 'Wolf in Shadow' is the latter; it doesn't quite better the first, but is an awesome story nonetheless.Gemmell manages to take the character of the Jerusalem Man in a new direction, keeping true to the original source material but adding new details and nuances to the story. 'Last Guardian' does what many fail to do; keep the flavour of the original while expanding and adding to the mythos it created.And like 'Wolf in Shadow', 'Guardian' bookends the amazing story with a creative knock-your-mental-socks off finale that will have you turning back pages just to relive the action.Gemmell is a master storyteller and not only knows how to create characters, but guide them through his fantastic stories. Another near-perfect creation.","Gemmell's commitment to his readers surely shows in his work. He delivers, and you get good action with mind-blowing ideas and concepts.Jon Shannow is the legendary Jerusalem man, feared and hated by many, but those who become close to him get to know the real pain inside him? He hopes not to be a killer, but still, the threats to the peace of the post-apocalyptic world force him to sling gun and shoot away at any evil that lives.He portrays a great world that mixes sci-fi, fantasy and myth. The frequent use of the Bible here is a great idea. And the ironic mix of Shannow as a Bible reader and heroic killer is fascinating.The way Gemmell weaves Bible lore and history together with his own telling of how the 'actual' events happened is cohesive, beautiful and telling. You can't go wrong with his books if you want action-fantasy.","A deadly power burst forth from ancient Atlantis. For the gate of time had been torn open, freeing a cataclysmic evil. Only the last guardian, Jon Shannow, the legendary pistoleer, could shut the deadly portal. But to accomplish this he would have to find the shining Sword of God.I highly recommend this book. Gemmell is perfect again. So go out and buy this book.","This book is great all the way through, following Jon Shannow trying to have a break from being himself. Jon finds himself trying to go to the other side of a large wall where men have been trying to climb and pass with no success, the land seems to be run by lion-men, men have been mysteriuosly turned into walking lions and soon the great beasts of the wild themselves. The sword of God is an interesting part in the story as the reader wonders how sword could be suspended in the air. Also the story has a link with Atlantis as a gateway has opened between the past and the present, a tidal wave aproaches Atlantis with the capabilities of destroying the past and the future.","This is far and away Gemmell's best ever. Firstly his portrayal of Jon Shannow. His unwavering faith in his ethical system is all the more astounding because it he doesn't actualy understand it totally. Keeping his cool is the secret of his success.Then Daniel Cade, Shannow's brother who, reacting to the same event that made Shannow an evangelist (the slaughter of their parents) became a notorius bandit leader. As a large army begins to eat into his territory, he claims to be inspired by God to unite the bandits and farmers against the invaders.All in all an excellent book about the power of faith and what people will do if they believe God is on their side (something that applies equally to both sides).","Jon Shannow is what every tough guy in the world wants to be. His sense of duty and faith unwavering, his skill unparalleled, nothing could stop the Jerusalem Man. He is a man who does what he thinks is right, when he thinks it. But the conflict within him eats him from inside. Jon Shannow is not a hero like with stars in his eyes holding up a flag, but more like an angel of death who gives out the appropriate penalties whenver they must be given. One of the reasons Jon Shannow always wins is because he always keeps his cool, no matter what he's up against. For this character alon this book is a must have.","Very well developed characters and story line. Cover to cover action and intrigue. Plot makes for food for thought of where we find ourselves in the world today.","One of my favourite series. Great read, recommended especially for fans of post apocalypse (Fallout franchise). It's not another two dimensional story about gunslinger or some hero. Jon Shannow is a tormented man with his flaws. Legend for some, murderer for others. After dealing with Hellborn once again he is drawn into middle of a war. Circle of history almost finished the turn this time not one but two worlds can be destroyed. Great action scenes, well written dialogues, awesome characters and some tough subject and decision that a reader can definitely enjoy.Only downside is absence of my favourite character from part 1, Batik. Well, I'll live.If you like western, post apocalypse, special setting like in Dark Tower series - this is a book for you.","Jon Shannow returns and finds himself thrust in a gritty epic fantasy adventure where the fates of two worlds hang in the balance.Story:The story begins in two places: The Post Apocalyptic future where bands of people struggle to survive with technology equal to the wild west, and thousands of years earlier during the final days of Atlantis. The two story arcs clash and the fate of both worlds are at stake. This definitely plays out like a sci-fi western, with some high fantasy elements. Before you read this book, you really should read Wolf in Shadow (Stones of Power Book 3). You don't need to read the first two books in this series to enjoy this book. All of the characters, themes, and settings are vastly different.World Building:The world takes place over 100 years from now and is similar to the frontiers of the old west. There are horses, muskets, revolvers, and some magic in the form of astral projection, premonition, and possession. There is also time travel, dimensional travel, demons, lizard men, lion men, bear men, hired killers, lawmen, preachers, and good folk trying to survive on an unforgiving frontier.Characters:This is the second of three books that feature Jon Shannow. He's not a perfect man and he's made many mistakes, but he is an honest man who just tries to do right by others. If you wrong him, chances are that he's better with a gun than you are. He definitely deserves to be mentioned with some of the many great characters created by David Gemmell: Druss, Skilgannon, Waylander, Connor, Decado, and The Lion of Macedon.The supporting characters are also very strong. There are villains that you love to hate and some memorable allies that lend a hand.Writing Style:David Gemmell is one of the All Time Greats at creating heroic characters in harsh worlds. These are battle hardened characters tested by the world itself. They can survive and persevere where most of us would give up. They all live by some sort of code, whether it is just or unjust. The world is dangerous, the story is epic, the characters are memorable, and the action is hard hitting. Wolf in Shadow (the previous book) flows a bit better and there's more momentum, where The Last Guardian hiccups a just a bit, but it's still a very fun read.Action:This book is loaded with action. There are brawls, assassinations, maulings, gunfights, skirmishes, battles, shootouts, magic, demons, and memorable deaths. If you like the heroes of the old west, then you should enjoy this book.Maturity: TeenThere is lots of violence in the form of gun and knife fights and a brief mention of non-graphic sex. It's kind of like a Hollywood action film.Overall:This is a very good book written by one of the greats. It has a bit of everything. A fast moving plot, memorable characters, humor, action, honor, romance, and some diabolical villains.Buy it if you like heroic westerns.Buy it if you are a fan of David Gemmell.Avoid it if you just like pure medieval fantasy with swords.If you enjoyed this book, I'd say keep on reading books by David Gemmell. These are some his best: Legend, Waylander, Winter Warriors, Sword in the Storm, the Lion of Macedon.","This is the second novel of David Gemmell's that I have read, and the second book in the Jon Shannow trilogy. I have to say, I am amazed that David Gemmell is not a more common name in the fantasy world. I also hope that some day his works get translated into different mediums. Comic books would be great, but so would films or TV shows.The Last Guardian picks up immediately after Wolf in Shadow, where Jon Shannow, the Jerusalem Man is continuing his search for the holy city, and being tragically accosted by villains and surrounded by death. He is a noble madman, who goes through a very satisfying arc in this second installment. David Gemmell is good at introducing lost of disparate elements into his novels until you wonder what the heck he could be thinking. He weaves these together in a most satisfying manner. He melds mythology, religion, and good old post-apocalyptic fantasy adventure in a great story. I can't wait to read the final installment, but I am hesitant, because I have truly fallen in love with this story and don't want it to end.The story has action, and lots of despicable characters, and noble ones, too. Even the despicable ones, however, manage to find redemption. There is also a lot of weird events and historical/biblical events that are explained in an amazing way in a novel just under 300 pages. The story can be read on many levels simultaneously. It is one part pulp action, one part mythical western, and one part philosophical fantasy. If you used to enjoy the brain candy of Thundarr the barbarian, you will love losing yourself in the world of Gemmell's creation while being pleasantly surprised as an adult reader at the same time.Perhaps, this isn't for every one, but if you're anything like me, a thoughtful lover of fantasy who gets fed up with cliche and political dramas, you will love Jon Shannow and The Last Guardian.Also, if you can't get your hands on The Wolf in Shadow, you can read this story as a stand alone novel."],

      "description":"Journey of a Thousand Miles tells the remarkable story of a boy who sacrificed almost everything – family, financial security, childhood and his reputation in China’s insular classical music world – to fulfil his promise as a classical pianist. Lang Lang was born in Shenyang in north-eastern China just after the end of the Cultural Revolution. He began piano lessons at three years old and by age ten had been awarded a place at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. In order to continue his studies he moved thousands of miles from home, living with his exacting father in a cramped, shared apartment, while his mother stayed at home to earn the money to pay his fees. At fifteen he moved to the United States to take up a scholarship at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia; by nineteen he was selling out Carnegie Hall. His tutor and mentor Daniel Barenboim was perhaps the first to describe him as ‘extraordinarily talented’; today his assessment is shared by millions. Now in adulthood, Lang Lang tours relentlessly, delighting sell-out audiences with his trademark flamboyance and showmanship. Journey of a Thousand Miles is a tale of heartbreak, drama and ultimately triumph. His inspiring story demonstrates the courage and self-sacrifice required to achieve artistic greatness.",

      "reviews.text":["This book started off boring, continued on being boring and ended boring.In a post apocalyptic world, the main character meets his fantasy, loves his fantasy despite knowing nothing about him, and lives with his fantasy. The author makes not so subtle points about the evils of religion, corporations, military, and man. It all combines to conspire against this supposed utopian society where art is the key to membership and to hell with the rest. Never mind that someone who might pose a better choice because of his skills than some flighty artist, just so long as you can play an instrument, you are guaranteed membership in Utopia.Basically, the story arrogantly says in a voice reminiscent of Porky Pig and Elmer Fudd \"unless you match the 'art' sterotype, you have to prove you are worthy, over and over again.\" Oh, and all heterosexuals are bad, unless they are women.Steer clear of this book if you are expecting a realistic approach to a post apocalyptic gay life. This is one of those stories that just didn't need to be told.","Finally got the book from Amazon and read it &quot;straight-through!&quot; I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book. Finding good SF/F novels, whose main characters are gay, is very difficult. Refreshing! Looking forward to a sequel!","An excellent first time adventure story. The intriguing plot and very well crafted characters really kept me going. I usually like to savor my novels, reading just a little bit at a time in my leisure. But by the time I got 3/4 of the way through, I was so excited that I couldn't stop reading! Peter Kasting amazed me with his ability to weave such a lavishly descriptive action packed story considering the context, background and setting for this novel. I really began to identify with Rafael, the Army Medical officer who is forced to come to terms with his gay feelings and the rapidly changing violent world around him. I was truly flabbergasted.","Buying small publisher books is always a gamble, as is relying on the on-line reviews of \"normal\" folk. I thought long and hard about this book before I took the plunge, mostly because of the price. The first few paragraphs were enough to make me think I'd made the right choice. The writing was intelligent, the main character extremely likable (if you're into cute, buff, modest guys, that is.*rowr*) The setup is interesting, if a bit unbelievable -- from what little I know of radiation, the sort of attack precipitating this book would have made any sort of normal life unattainable -- but, hey, it's called 'fiction' for a reason. Rafael's and Leo's growing relationship is sweet and loving, in an inevitable way. No complaints whatsoever on these counts. And yet... Bad things keep happening. Very bad things, from which there is no recovery. This book takes the adage of 'anything bad that can happen, will happen' one step too far. The last half of the book is one bad thing after another, with enemies who must be either precogs or psychic, judging by the way they anticipate every single movement of the good guys. The ending drops off quite suddenly and very ineffectually. The focus on Rafael's and Leo's love all but ceases as soon as they get into bed together (something which is handled quite tastefully -- if you're looking for smut, this isn't your book). It all devolves from people with pasts and histories reacting to situations into which they've been thrown, to things happening to 2-D representations of previously 3-D characters. All in all, it was worth reading, but I would have much rather borrowed it from a library (as if... >_&lt;).","This was an increadible read/find for me. I am not new to the SF genre but SF with gay main charaters yes. I have read gay charater driven stories before but it was too smutty or over sexed, it seemed that sex was the main part of the story and everthing else was just filler, like a plot. The scenerio is over the top but echoes very much the present, scary when this happens \"Science Fiction becomes Science Fact\".The characters are wonderful. A quick satisfying read, great for a rainy day or lazy afternoon, I definitely recommend this book.","Kasting has given us some characters we can care about. And his world is really interesting, too. Society has fallen apart, but not completly. There's still government and culture. He focuses a lot on a commune of artists in the Pacific Northwest and the descriptions are beautiful. You really care what happens to these people.","Kasting's writing is highly engaging and his vision of the distopian near-future, though published years ago, seems very apt again. The fact that internalized and externalized homophobia should remain unchanged and foremost through a nuclear disaster is made easily believable.His story held me in thrall throughout and his settings stayed with me after the reading. It's nice to have a musician and a karate expert as the central characters, emphasizing the energetic and spiritual forces as embodied by Leo and Rafael.Finally, though, the book reads a bit like a chess game -- sacrifice so many pawns, exchange the rook for the bishop, the queen ... it plays painfully on the fact that fiction is \"not real\" -- and the characters never quite emerge from being game pieces which is too bad. Because they almost became people one could care about.","Set in a grim, oppressive post nuclear future of military and religious dictatorships this work allows its characters and its reader no real hope. Mankind is just as mindless, cruel and obtuse as it has always been all through the millennia and it is believably so.While admitting this is perfectly realistic I must also wonder if fiction really needs such boundless pessimism unless the writing is so beautiful to justify any kind of content.In this desolate, not too hypothetical future of ours moves Rafael, a 24 year-old deserter looking for some happiness and love: he finds them (sort of) rather early in the story in the arms of another young man and in Wellspring, a -not so- utopian community that is willing to accept him, his troubled past and his homosexual tendencies. Everything comes at a price though: Wellspring and Rafael are not out of harm's way and do not get out unscathed.Mr Kasting is a competent writer. His writing is neat, very fast paced; his plot believable and interesting.His fault lies in characterization, which is rather sketchy both for the main and the side characters. This, together with the sad, hopeless atmosphere probably make this book of interest only for those willing to read gay-themed fiction.Sex is often mentioned but it is never graphic. The book might (or not) disturb very conservative/religious readers: Mr Kasting's opinions on religious fanaticism (which I happen to share entirely) are harsh enough and clearly inspired by some very conservative religious communities which are to be found in the States.","Wow, this book was so awesome! Rafael's story is inspiring and real. In a near-future America, Rafael goes AWOL in the hopes of finding a place where he can be himself. He finds a closed community that's willing to accept him--as long as he has something to offer. But he's not sure what that is. Meanwhile, he finds himself falling in love with a musician who's sure to be invited to stay.Rafael's story is a lot about self-acceptance and gaining a feeling of self-worth in a world that seems to have gone completely crazy. He makes friends, learns to accept his gayness and undergoes some remarkable transformations. It's really a great story--don't miss it!","This is a very interesting book. It is set in the future. in a world that has survived a nuclear blast. But the world that remains is a very scary one, with enclaves of people living wary lives. Rafael lives in this world and he has to cope with it and also with his blossoming gay feeling for Leo. A very intesting book with a lot of relevance for our world today.","When Peter Kasting first brought this novel to Windstorm, I read it in one sitting. What intrigued me about the novel, and why I decided to offer Mr. Kasting a contract for publication, had less to do with the utopia he creates and more with Rafael's personal journey. Rafael's road is never easy. He has to come to terms with his own self-hatred. Until he does this, he knows he will never have anything to offer the community he'd like to join. Rafael's inner journey also mirrors some of the physical journeys in the book and creates the bulk of the multi-layered tale.Any book you pick up should at least be a good story. The writing should be solid, the characters believable. If those basic elements aren't present, you might as well throw the book out. Journey of a Thousand Miles is all of these things. It's not an easy read at times--Mr. Kasting makes you think--but he's a very strong writer with terrific ideas. Journey of a Thousand Miles isn't just about gay characters; it's not simply a \"gay\" novel. It's a novel about real people who are struggling to carve out some kind of existence in a violent, post-Apocalypic world (more like post-Pulse ala Dark Angel rather than post-nuclear winter). Mr Kasting takes us on a journey that's worth taking and I encourage you to take a risk on a book from a publisher who takes risks everyday with unknown, first time writers who are producing something other than mind-numbing sludge."],

      "reviews.text":["Good book... well worth the read. This book is an interesting mosaic of genres - part (mostly) shoot 'em up war/western, part romance (read sex) and part political statement. Could this story really happen? Perhaps. Unfortunately, it would probably take an apocalyptic catalyst such as happens in this story to generate the public upheaval necessary for &quot;true patriots&quot; to make it so. Without that, Johnstone's societal vision wouldn't get off the ground. It may be tried from time to time, but only by cults, kooks and wacko survivalists. There is lots to learn from Johnstone's political statement in this book, but it IS fiction.","Out of the Ashes Is a must for anyone who cares about the government, the law and what happens with a nuclear war. I started in the middle of the Ashes Series and went back and bought them from the 1st Out of the Ashes and just ordered (5) more. They are the best survival books I have ever read. They are the best books for people that are getting tired of the way the government runs our lives. They have great characters and very exciting situations in all of the books. I can only hope if this ever happens in real life we will have a Ben Raines to help us start over. I have told many people about this series and encourage others to do the same. If nothing else, the books gave me a sense of hope for our future if we wake up!","At the time of this writing I have finished the first 27 books of the original series, and have started on book 28. I will not go into the premise of the story, that has been covered quite adaquately in previous reviews. And, I agree with many of the criticisms: Johnstone's writing is uneven. Most of his characters are 2-dimensional. There is much gratuitous violence and perversion. He goes over the top in portraying liberalism as BAD and his own flavor of conservatism as good. Anyone who has listened to the extreme Liberals in government with an objective ear, though, knows Kennedy, Carville, et al, go over the top themselves with their own - as Johnstone would put it - hankey-stomping snits. The major media, being the lapdogs of the Left, obediently report every word, every pronouncement while hardly ever checking the facts. I think Johnstone's counter attack of antiliberal rants echos what many of us who feel disenfranchised by the media want to say.Later books get strange, with the mutants, night people, and the Prophet's popping up from time to time. Some portions of the later books get downright boring. The series, as a whole though, is worth reading. Tri States, and the SUSA are places where I'd like to live. Johnstone gives us an ideal to look toward, in the world where even so-called Conservatives ignore the Constitution.Out of the Ashes opens the door to the Tri States philosophy. Maybe we can work toward that same return to common-sense government in the real world.","This is really a rather good example of the genre. This is a post apocalyptic thriller were the bad guys take over after the collapse of civilization and the good guys, led by Ben Raines, are always outnumbered but rarely outfought.The story is not rushed and Mr. Johnstone takes his time telling the tale the way he feels it should be told. I found the pacing and narration to be thoroughly enjoyable. The politics of the main character, Ben Raines, feature prominently in the book. The politic theories held by Ben are rather interesting. Ben appears to be a kind of Social Conservative. In Ben's world if you killed your neighbor then that night your other neighbors would probably judge you and kill you. If you raped your neighbor's daughter your neighbor would have the right to take you out in back of the barn and beat you within in inch of your life. Every person would not only be allowed firearms but be expected to be trained in them and serve in the army. Men and women are treated equally in politics, familial structure and the military. On the other hand, capitalism is allowed but controlled as to make sure that money continues to flow through the system and wealth hoarding is discouraged.I really enjoyed this book. There are 25 other books in the series, thus far. The other books are also pretty good but after 26 books the plot is starting to get a tad repetitive. They are still good but it is very hard to maintain tension and suspense along with originality for that long.A good book. Read it not only for the action and battles but also for the interesting social, political commentary.","This book is what started almost a cult following. It is definately not for the left wing portion of the citizenry.WWJ writes a pulp fiction style book about the obligatory post-apocalyptic world, and how a determined group of warrior idealists try and return to civilized society.The book isn't so much a work of fiction as it is an outlet for WWJ's political philosophies. Sadly enough, a large portion of what he says about the government is very true, and many of the flaws he points out are undeniable.The book is an excellant read, and the follow up books in the series are unnecessary, but decent reads nonetheless.","This book makes you stand back and think about our current form of government and the way the people are treated. Also, is makes you think about how the people of the United States might one day be treated by our government that is &quot;for the people&quot;, and how the people would react","For those fans of post-apocalyptic fiction, this book may fit the bill as long as one can overlook the ham-fisted dialogue and superficial treatment of complex political and sociological issues. The dialogue I found to be incredibly forced in many spots. The characters are mere caricatures, over-the-top extremists with little thought to complexities most people exhibit. Of course, perhaps the book is ABOUT extremism, but it doesn't read like it--the extremists on one side have found the \"one true way\" and everyone else is tragically, utterly wrong. Not a complex treatment of any of the topics presented. The description of the world blowing up, often the more gripping parts of this type of fiction, is afforded little attention.Merely average, basically.","Ben Raines in the Ashes Series is the man that most men deep down want to be. Despite the liberal reviews it has gotten it touches a part of our ego in a way only Johnstone could write it. It is harsh and it is believable and that scares the hell out of most people. To all the liberals outt there watch out if the bottom ever does fall out. You would be lucky to have a leader rise up half as tough and compassionate as Ben Raines. For the Tri-States and the possibilites my hat is of to the authour. Keep them coming.","Started to read the series in the 80's It was my first\" end of the world book\" I ever read. I never did finish the series because I ended up going overseas and couldn't find them anymore. I Look forward to finding them again & reading them all over. Great books loved his \"tri-states philosophy\"","This series by William Johnstone is a must read. It was written (this is the first book) back in the 80's and depicts exactly what we are heading for and going through today! His ability to see the downfall of the USA is amazing. He's way ahead of his time.","As the author of &quot;Strike Hard&quot;, I continually read books that piqued my interest. &quot;Out of the Ashes&quot;, the first of the Ashes Series, was one of the most enjoyable that I have ever read. Ben Raines seems to be a reflection of William Johnstone, thus adding a lot of depth to the character. Johnstone manages to put the reader right in the middle of the war, and its aftermath, plunging the reader into a world where chaos exists. However, there is a desire to see things set right, and Ben Raines is the man for the job. From punks to outlaws, Ben manages to strive victoriously to clear the way for the rebirth of the country, in the way it was meant to be. First of a series, &quot;Out of the Ashes&quot; is a terrific stand-alone novel, as well as an enticing beginning to a wonderful series. It is a book that I never tire of reading.","America after a nuclear apocalypse? What a great idea! Not many writers are brave enough to tackle a subject matter like that, much less do it well. Sounds like an idea too big for one book? Have no fear, this is just book one in an ongoing series with continuing characters (currently 25 books and going strong!) If you don't agree with the author's political stance (an eye for an eye, let me live in complete freedom - the less government, the better), you might get annoyed with it. I rather enjoyed imagining a world where you truly get what you deserve. The book is chock-full of spys, action, twists, sex, humor, and moves very quickly. The simplicity of the writing didn't bother me, allowing me to finish it in 3 days. It also helps move it along.As for the reviewer from Chicago, I'm surprised (and confused) that even though you didn't like the book, you read &quot;seven other books&quot; in the series. I would think that (giving it a rating of 1) would have you staying far away from them... but 7 others !? I guess you are hooked - whether you like it or not - like the thousands of other &quot;Ashes&quot; fans around the world! As for your comments on people not joining the militia if they had problems with the government... it's already (and has been for a while) happening in the south, with certain groups having hundreds of members. Knowing about some of the battles in history, it is not unrealistic for a few thousand people to die on one side and only lose a few hundred on the other... great leaders win great battles.If you are tired of government and big business controlling 90% of everything in society, and would like to see what could happen without them, give this series a try. It's only in theory, of course, but it's a damn good one.","I'm usually a romance book reader, but I was curious & read the back cover & decided to give it a try, something different...I found the storyline & the dialogue to be very easy-to-read & the story rolled as if written by a 'real' person (if a bit preachy, but the guy sure knows what he believes in!). It's a great 'what-if' story of the ever-popular 'end of the world as we know it by nuclear war'. What if some of the people who are left want to band together, rebuild, create a society that enforces law-abiding, the right to defend yourself & your family, & live in peace ? No racism, no sexism, everyone works somehow, no free-loaders, everyone votes on the basic laws & majority is 90%, not 51%. Anyone who doesn't want to live there, can leave. Must leave. The main character hates 'scum, thugs & slime' of humanity, rape & murder are not tolerated, for any reason, justice is swift, & everyone learns, & carries, firearms, everyone from childhood is taught self-defense. Strong emphasis on Education: if your raise children to be productive, law-abiding citizens, they won't grow up to be 'racists' or 'thugs', or will know the consequences in advance. Age-old question: Would you rob someone or try to hurt someone, if you knew that they & all their family are armed ? Parents are required to teach their children clear right from wrong, so that they are not in doubt, anyone who doesn't do that, are kicked out. These people just want to live in peace & rebuild, health care for all, everyone pulls their share, only wants people who WANT to live there, they don't 'recruit' or 'force' citizenship, they just kick out anyone who doesn't want to follow the rules. No crime, no poverty, no slums...interesting concept.& in the end, the 'NEW' government after the 'big bomb' that starts back up can't handle an independant society, living separately, prosperous, & in peace. The other side of humanity: the people who want to dominate & control, destroy for their own purposes....If you believe in the death penalty for murder, rape & child molestation; the right to bear arms; & that governments usually tend towards corruption, then you will LOVE this book. If you are a bleeding-heart that thinks that violent criminals should be 'rehabilitated' & kept in comfortable prisons with cable & access to law libraries to find a loophole to get out, then you will HATE this book. or you will cheer for the 'bad' guys in it.....The descriptions of the landscape afterwards, the effects of the germ warfare on the survivors, & how the people that are left behind interact are interesting....(it is fiction & what-if, but you never know -- possible)The weapons talk/descriptions was not as 'cumbersome' as I thought it would be, if you LIKE guns, you will like all their talk & comparisons on which is best for which situation, but if you are like me & not very knowledgable about guns in particular, you can still read without getting lost.The places that he visits in his travels have interesting back-stories.One cheesy point -- the phrase 'out of the ashes' occurs ALOT in the story...will make you roll your eyes a few times....The girl in me found alot of the parts very sad & depressing, especially the parts that are very common among people, even in this 'advanced' day & age. i.e. it's EASY to be racist & HARD to be open-minded & fair. & when some people will work hard to rebuild & help others, there are always other people who will want to kill & destroy & ruin all their hard work & good efforts.....stuff like that....Definitely worth reading, but I don't think I will attempt all 34 of them....(well, maybe #2, & remember, I'm a GIRL, ha ha !!) :)","I like the post-apocalyptic genre. Like reading, watching, and writing in it. Unfortunately, a lot of it is pap. After hearing much word-of-mouth about Johnstone and his \"tri-states philosophy,\" I hoped this would be one of the better flagships for the genre.The nuclear war is triggered by a coup-gone-wrong involving rogue military hawks (think Jack T. Ripper with scads of accomplices). Ben Raines survives the dirty bomb holocaust, as do many others...inexplicably (at first I thought it might have something to do with the wasp stings). He begins touring the ravaged southeastern region, intending to document the nuclear devastation for a memoir, but is unwittingly crowned the leader of a new resistance movement. Idaho, Montana and Wyoming become his empire. But he and his followers are headed for a showdown with the other 47 states.The opening act was rather tedious to wade through. I suppose the convoluted, improbable conspiracy plot was supposed to rivet me to the pages with suspenseful intrigue as it unfolded, but I really wanted to just skim. Once the missiles struck home, and we got into Ben Raines' point-of-view, it was smoother going.If Johnstone ever explained why some people survived the radiation and some didn't, I missed it. I thought it rather unrealistic that electricity was still on for so long after a nuclear strike, and that Raines never had trouble finding gas for his vehicles. There is some mention of looting, I think, but our hero never had any trouble finding weapons, ammo, gear, food or clean water. Also, just like Captain Kirk, women throw themselves at him pretty much everywhere he goes. Nubile, supermodel-looking women, of course who \"don't like sleeping alone.\" All but twice, though, Raines and his current squeeze intuitively sensed that their affair would only be casual and temporary...and that was just okie-dokie with both parties. Such is to be expected from the genre, I suppose.I can go on nit-picking for a while, but I'll try to limit my exclamations of disbelief to just two more elements:1) His dialog is just outright painful in many places. I have come to expect this problem with inexperienced/immature (yet passionate) writers, but am REALLY annoyed when I see a successful, traditionally published author...of a popular series, no less...getting away with it. How did this ever get published as is?2) Raines is a Vietnam veteran from a super-secret elite unit which, I guess, would supposedly surpass Delta Force. But at the story's inception he is an alcoholic novelist. Almost everyone he encounters has heard of him, and read his books. And everyone is convinced he is destined to be the savior who unites freedom-loving folks and builds a utopia out of the ashes. Evidently his greatness is plain for everyone to see--everyone but his humble self. He ignores the pleas for his elevation to leadership, but is finally drug to his destiny, kicking and screaming (OK, perhaps I exagerate a wee bit). His greatness is so powerful as to inspire slavish, blind devotion in all the good guys he encounters. Apparently his alcohol-heavy diet and lethargic lifestyle have kept him in supreme fighting condition, too. I don't have a PHD in Group Dynamics or anything like that, but I've studied history, observed the surrounding culture, and worked in/with conglomerations of human beings both in military and civilian contexts. Unless God himself elevated someone like Ben Raines to power (as He did with King Saul and David), that person would never reach the top of any leadership ladder. People who rise to power...even in regulated structures...are shameless self-promoters; supremely confident in their own abilities (no matter how undeserved that confidence is); \"type A\" personalities; charismatic; ambitious; control freaks; opportunistic; remorseless; proactive and outgoing. They usually aren't the best choice for leadership, and many times are the worst. But they will beat somebody like Ben Raines in an election, mob takeover or popularity contest (which is what such things turn out to be, beneath the surface, anyway) every single time. It doesn't matter how many dead military officers have endorsed you, or even if the majority of the mob thinks you're the smartest guy with the perfect plan. The guy with the magic mouth and the zealous conviction that he is the best possible man for the job will climb higher and faster. I've taken pains so far not to be harsh or personally insulting to Mr. Johnstone, but this Reluctant Savior routine reeks of a misfit writer's closet egomania.Up to now, I've also avoided commenting on the author's political ideas, which he unabashedly rams down the reader's throat throughout the novel. I won't discuss them in detail, because they're at least as convoluted as his expository chapters. But even while preaching racial equality, Johnstone strikes me as a bigot. He also takes periodic jabs at his Religious Right Boogeymen, denouncing the cult of personality embraced by their respective sycophants (kinda like what I touched on above). Meanwhile, his own cult of personality is the driving force behind the Tri-States kingdom. Hypocritical IMO. And while pontificating on his love of freedom, Johnstone/Raines build a utopia which is, in most respects, a totalitarian regime. So while I see all the problems in the USA that Johnstone saw, our viewpoint on feasible solutions are often radically different.Plot, character(s), dialog, realism and (IMO) political savvy in Out of the Ashes is seriously flawed.Henry Brown is the author of TEOTWAWKI aviation adventure The Delayed Blitz(Krieg), as well as the military thriller Hell and Gone. He is the columns editor at New Pulp Fiction, and does some blogging of his own at the Two-Fisted Blogger.","Johnstone is clearly a very talented and imaginative man. These books are truely invigorating. WWJ takes a single man from his imagination and turns him into a Legend. Ben Raines would be a true American Hero; strong, forceful, attractive and very sexy. Raines and his Rebels face danger at every turn and come out victorious almost every time. I am currently reading #9 &quot;Valor in The Ashes&quot; and I can't put it down. The excitement jumps at you from every page. And although it is something that may never happen, it is also very real. The way America thinks needs to change and Johnstone announces this in a very bold and caragious way. These books can be frightening to the left wing Americans because they don't want violence and guns in this world. But people need to wake up and smell the Willie Peter because we already have violence and guns!!!! Now all we need is Ben Raines and his Rebels to come to the rescue!!! Keep up the good work Johnstone. I'm on your side.","Book 1 of the Ashes seriesPlot kernel - Rouge elements in the US Military cause world-wide nuclear and biological war - with absolutely no significant lasting health effects whatsoever for those that survive: the nukes were \"clean\" and the biological danger diffuses with the wind and time - any areas \"permanently affected\" are only briefly mentioned and then dropped from the story. It is said that 2/3 the population has perished.A writer of paperback action adventure novels, himself ex military special forces, survives the collapse of civilization. He travels about the states east of the Mississippi, meets many violent racists (he himself is not one) and generally very bad people, usually groups of men looking to rape women. He also meets the occasional woman, herself a victim of gang rape or a witness to it, who quickly and eagerly decides to sleep with him and stay, temporarily and with affection, in his company. (Rape and racism are referred to and talked about a lot in this story.)He eventually heads west and becomes the leader (the setup for this role is provided) of a break away, racially diverse, government comprising Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming: the Tri-States. Despite the (one would think) devastation of nuclear and biological war, both the Tri-States and the reconstituted US government now under the control of a radical left wing senator seem to enjoy all the conveniences of the modern world. (This is not a story about a survivalist or survivors of a world-wide war coping with physical hardship.)The Tri-States government is utopian, militant, communitarian (it seems), and judicially very severe, yet with a slight mixture of libertarian principles (prostitution, for example, is legal). Education, however, is state controlled, Biblical (the implication seems to be that evolution is out, creationism is in, although there is no explicit suggestion of anti-science) and compulsory. Those who refuse to work are deported, their children confiscated by the state, and adopted. The laws of the Tri-States are determined by an approximately 90 percent majority, and so regarded as the true will of the people. Anyone who disapproves is free to leave. Anyone who stays is required to obey or suffer the unbending consequences.The US government, now at its worst as a tyranny, will not allow the Tri-States to exist separately from the 47 other states. Complications arise.(The novel preaches against bad politics and the government which bad politics creates and then presents an alternative, utopian, society, which is not laid out well enough to really understand. The nuclear war occurs within the story merely to allow the author to clear some land, create conclaves of lawlessness to show human nature at its worst, institute a US tyranny, and set up this preferred alternative society. It is a story about tyranny and freedom fighters. This book is the first in a series that is currently 30 novels long.)","A modern day retired Special Forces Soldier, Ben Raines, is certainly Smoke Jensen reborn. He certainly feels that his is the only one type of justice for evil people and that justice needs to be handed out swift and hard. In this story, after a germ and nuclear war, Ben gets to defend a Tri-State conservative area of the Rocky Mountains against the corrupt and liberal Remnants of what is left of the East Coast United States goverment.Good vs. Evil; right vs. wrong; it's all here with violence and romance. But the action really drags and the story slows with the describing of the \"perfect\" Tri-State government. If you don't mind skim reading, the ending is OK and good enough to get me to read the next story in the series; someday. \"Preacher\" is still my favorite Johnstone character with the early Smoke Jensen next.","After reading this book and several others in the series, I have learned to treasure the rights I &quot;still&quot; have. The government is trying to take away our basic rights that the constitution gives us and there is not too many people who will speak up against this. However, William Johnstone is one of these people. In &quot;Out of the Ashes&quot;, Johnstone describes how the government's increasing control over us eventually leads to a revolution. Johnstone's main character, Ben Raines, is given the job of restoring america and he creates a new nation within a nation called the Tri-States. In this new nation, people make all of the laws, there is virtually no crime, and there is a plentiful supply of jobs for people who are willing to work.One thing I especially like is the fact that Ben Raines does not put up with crime or those people who are able to work but don't. The laws are straight-forward and easy to understand. The trails are quick and to the point, but fair. These are just some of the points that William Johnstone makes in this book. All in all, it will make you think twice about your rights and it will motivate you to defend the freedom's that we still have.","If you are patriotic, and do not want to loose any more of your freedoms...this series (over 30 books!) is for you.This series has no middle ground. You will love Ben Raines or hate him so much you wish you could kill him yourself.Fantasic storylines & dialouge. Characters hold true to form throughout the series.","I read this book more out of curiosity than anything else. I found the now 20 year old political views that swarm the book utterly fascinating, not always in a good way. The book is a not unusual (post) apocalyptic plot, flooded with political views interspersed with rather frank sex discussions. Rather too coarse to be interesting in my opinion, but I suppose that's personal view. No desire to read further into the series because the story line is not strong and not really what the author is bent on communicating. The author's website is kinda interesting, not seen anyone that prolific except certain romance authors. However, his stories are at that level... so I suppose it makes sense.","this is probably one of the best books I have ever read. I love William W Johnstone, and he out did himself here. Everyone should read this book. I am now on book #8 out of 35.","Awesome Book! I was introduced to the Ashes series a few years ago and read through them all in a couple of months. Out of the Ashes is book 1 and probably my favorite of all of them.","Great book and great story with a great action sequence. Characters are well thought out and sequence of events is riveting.Hey, I am writing a few year's of reviews. This stuff is tedious, so give me a break.","One of my favorite books. I am all for this concept of living, well later in the books. Great for trips, walking the dog etc. Just wish it was on CD or downloadable.","This series is the most disappointing in my reading experience. After this book, which was mediocre, I started to read number 2 book in a lengthy series. The uncalled numerous foul language and lurid sex scenes detracted from what I thought was going to be a military thriller series. Needless to say, after the 2nd book, the 3rd was very similar and also repetitive in recalling scenes from the 1st 2 books in lengthy detail. I stopped reading the 3rd book after about 45 pages.Needless to say, I gathered up the rest of the 12 books I had purchased and not read, and put them out for recycling.In closing, I would like to state that this is my first 1 star review.Out Of The Ashes","I read Out of the Ashes when it first came out and go back now and then to reread it. In fact, I've read all of Johnstone's books, since they're quick and easy reads, something for when you have time on your hands and want something to occupy your mind while waiting in, say, a doctor's office.For the most part, I agree with the TriState philosophy as regards big government, liberals and politicians; I just have a problem with how, whenever Ben Raines speaks, everybody drops what they're doing and listens to all he says with slavish devotion (what, there aren't any others around in his age group who couldn't expound on the same subject?). People, that's a cult, especially when Johnstone continually states that the movement will live on without Ben, yet whenever he's not around to lead, it all sort of goes to hell (none of them seems willing to follow Ike or Cecil unless Ben is there to enforce it).The inconsistencies in the series are irritating: Ben is 44 when the first Ashes book begins, in his mid-fifties when it ends, yet by the end of the series, he's described as being barely 50 years old. Even Lamar Chase manages to stay age 70; in fact, none of the main characters seem to age, or else age in reverse. Hmmm.Another inconsistency: In From the Ashes: America Reborn (my favorite book in the series), Ben talks about how morals were slipping and women were having illegitimate babies left and right; uh...I lost track of how many women Raines impregnated throughout the series, so either he wore alot of faulty condoms or else he always rode bareback (not smart, one would think, what with all the STDs around). And he has absolutely no interest in any of his children (a failing common with the main characters of his other books, think especially Preacher or Terry Kovak), other than Buddy. In fact, he cares more about his adopted kids than his natural ones.And finally 'all women love him desperately', especially his bodyguard Jersey. NOT a good trait in a bodyguard, since it clouds judgment. Always had me wondering if her ear was pressed to the keyhole at the bedroom door when he was entertaining a woman. Come to think of it, why did Jersey have to always be within 5-10 feet of him at almost all times, even at closed meetings with his most trusted advisors, weapon at the ready as if she suspected one of them would kill him?One more thing: That thing full of ammo that you insert in a weapon is a MAGAZINE, not a clip.In the end, I've enjoyed Johnstone's books as a momentary diversion, if nothing more, but overall, I much prefer the writings of his nephew, JA Johnstone, who's also a much better writer.","Read this back in the mid 80's and still very relevant today with our skewed liberal parties. Will again enjoy the series.","The main character (Ben Raines)is your typical retired 'super soldier' type that's already been done to death. The bad guys are too retarded to take seriously. The characters all behave exactly like bad Hollywood cliche's and there's a serious lack of action in the book, unless you count the constant sex Ben Raines has with every single female he meets. Roughly two hundred pages of it use the characters for social commentary; mostly anti racist critique. The author obviously did little or no research on the actual effects of NBC warfare since there are absolutely no secondary effects from the use of such weapons; no poisoned earth, no EMP,no radioactive clouds, no mutant bacteria, nothing. The author explains this away with so called \"clean bombs\". This book does not really belong to the post apocalyptic genre; it is really more the authors' way of telling everybody what he would do with America were he at the helm, and in that he repeatedly advocates invading the privacy of home so he can brainwash peoples' kids. So if you love political tripe you'll love this book, but if you're looking for a good post apocalypse survival novel you might want to avoid this. I'd recommend 'Swan Song' by Robert McCammon.","After the bombs go off we have a new world but same types of people so they beginning warring all over again. Can't waIt until I get further along.","I HAVE READ MOST OF THE OUT OF THE ASHES SERIES AND REREAD THE SAME ONES EACH TIME CATCHING A GLIMPSE OF WHAT THE AUTHOR WAS WRITING ABOUT. I STOP AT ALL THE BOOKSTORES IN MY AREA SEARCHING FOR ONE I DON'T HAVE.PLEASE DON'T STOP WRITING THIS SERIES ANY TIME SOON.THANKS MATT","I picked up this book after a recommendation from a friend to read when I was finished with my other reads. He warned me, \"you'll be reading the rest of the books in the 32 book series\". I told him I had heard it before, but \"we'll see\". Well, this is an excellent start to a series and I hope it continues.Set in the 80's the USA is on the brink of nuclear war with Russia and China, no thanks in part to a government and military with their own vendetta's and agendas of which direction America should head. The story centers around Ben Raines, a former special operations soldier turned into an alcoholic. The book documents and parallels Ben's struggle and choices he makes as an author to travel the US and view and report the aftermath of the nuclear holocaust. Little does he know, he has been hand-picked by a former colleague to head the largest rebellion against the newly un-elected, self-appointed government hell-bent on toppling the Rebels and anyone who stand in the corrupt governments way.The novel is similar to a number of other post-apocalyptic stories out there, the big difference being this author focuses more on what he already had and not from the focus of a survivalist who had been stocking food, ammo, and supplies for years. The author uses what he has found or what he can scavenge from other areas with his focus being \"it would lay to waste and not be used anyways\".The story can be graphic at times with depictions of shooting, rape, sex, and torture; however, consider the state of mind of people at that time after a holocaust. Civility would be a thing of the past and it would become a \"dog eat dog\" world. His dream of the Tri-State \"oasis\" can be a bit difficult to accept; however, the goal of creating a utopian based society with few rules mimicking that of the 1880's wouldn't be totally un-ideal if people of like mind all sought the same goal. 65,000 people strong? I'm not sure about it, but over 9 years I suppose the possibility could exist.Overall, the book is an excellent read, better than a number of other post-apocalypse survival novels I have read in the past. I have begun his second in the series \"Fire in the Ashes\" and plan to continue with the series as I like his style of writing.My recommendation? Purchase a good condition used paperback from Amazon and enjoy your read. This is a good book that will keep you engaged within it's pages.","There's a delightful touch of &quot;otherworldliness&quot; in the first few books. There's the Prophet and references to final judgement days. These topics made the series more than just a shoot-em-up bang bang men's action series. Then, alas, these references were gone: the series turned into another hum drum blase' standard run-of-the-mill blow up the bad guys standard drivel. Oh well, I still re-read the first 6 books every other year. They're great!!!! as Tony the tiger says.","That's just the stuff I have been looking for 20 years to read and collect. Johnstone is a master of adventure and thrills. The main characters of the ASHES series are fascinanting - you like them from the first page. Ben Raines is not a typical hero - he is just a man who shares his vision with his rebels - and of course with the readers. I have the complete ASHES series and can surely say that Johnston loves his job. He is a natural born writer! ASHES is good entertainment and a true page turner. Those, who still do not know ASHES - please try it- you won't be disappointed. It's a dark picture of earth's future, but in a way very realistic and fascinating.","So what if this could never happen, it's still good fun. Don't take it seriously and just enjoy. If you're not careful, you might find yourself reading the next book in the series, then the next, then the next, and......you get the idea. The plot is obvious, the characters cardboard, but it does have a way of pulling you in and keeping you.","let me start by saying this, if the ever was or will be a Tri-States let me know. this is not a book for those panty waisted librales but a great book for a true red blooded american. From Mr. Raines veiws on crime, drugs, punks, relegion, the curent legal syestem, and even prostitution; he is an excpetional chacter and hero. In my eyes the wrold would be better off with more Ben Raines in it. Mr. Jhonstone, my hats off to you on the great writing in in this book. Also if i'd like to say that this book kicks of the series with a bang, with great chacters, &amp; events, and i hope they keep on coming back..... i know i will.","William Johnstone takes an excellent and sound political philosophy and wraps it into an exciting novel.Liberals will squeal and moan when they read this book, which is good.We need the Tri-States philosophy.","Johnstone's first book in the &quot;Ashes&quot; series is a survivalist's wet dream. It is chocked full of violence, stupid but sadistic bureaucrats and heroic rebels. The main character, Ben Raines, is a former special forces and mercenary soldier who has become an author. As the world falls down around him he puts his writings into practice in order to save what is left of humanity. He sets up his own country and then battles the resurected but evil US government.By the way, in all the &quot;Ashes&quot; books, all government officials are facists who sadisticaly rape, pillage, and plunder the countryside. Ben Raine's rebels on the other hand, practice what can only be called a kinder, gentler form of facism.Interestingly enough, the author's post apocolyptic world is characterized by nearly everybody but the rebels becoming sexual deviates. I don't know if this is caused by radiation or what but hardly 3-4 pages go by in &quot;Out of the Ashes&quot; without someone being raped or sodomized. By the fourth &quot;Ashes&quot; book it is difficult to find anyone left in America be it man, woman, or child who hasn't been raped and/or sodomized. Every other page is ripe with the vivid discriptions of these atrocities. Of course it is easier to justify the excessive violence in these books by the author demonizing the bad guys as sadistic rapists. It just makes it that much easier for the rebels to kill the dirty buggers.&quot;Out of the Ashes&quot; is classic pulp fiction. It is excessively violent, and has some form of sex act (mostly rape) at least every 4 pages. It is assinine in it presumptions about society and simplistic in it's assumptions of human nature. Ironicaly, it is just the kind of book to appeal to the ignorant masses that are so despised by the hero of the book. The fact that there are now at least 28 volumns in the &quot;Ashes&quot; series with an almost cult following merely proves the point.&quot;Out of the Ashes&quot; while not good literature, is somewhat entertaining in an excessively violent, sexual perverted and moronic kind of way. Have fun!","I bought this book in '83 or '84. I have enjoyed them all since. I was especially pleased when Mr. Johnstone started adding new books to the series and rereleasing the older books. The first of course is the best. Thank you Mr. Johnstone for hours and hours of enjoyment and excitement.","...headed in the direction the book states. I have read 'Out of the Ashes' several times and have found it not only intriguing, but informative as well. I would definately recommend this book (as well as the rest of the Ashes Series) to others. Want a look into the future? Read this...","Knowing that this is a work of ficton one should not take the events of how America was brought to its knees. But rather you should look for the deeper meaning of what is actually wrong in our country. If you are happy with the direction that this country is taking,,, do not read this book because you will not understand what Johnstone is trying to say. As a person whom has read every book in the Ashes series this is a great starting point to better understanding current problems in America. William Johnstone has taken an issue that every American should take notice of, and has offered us an entertaining medium of getting that message across.","I am not an atheist fundamentalist, or a political correctness freak. I wanted to preface with that. I also tried hard to view the book through the lens of the time it was written.It proved impossible. I like post-apoc fiction, but this book is easily among the worst I've read. It was a long Gary Stu projection by the author, where he gets laid every third page, all the women get raped and all the people besides him are immoral freaks. It was basically tired cliches from front to end, and I suppose that is to be expected when an author is a prolific in pulp as this guy is ... but if you want anything resembling a \"real\" fiction book, don't get this.It doesn't even hold up to mainstream stuff on the NYT bestseller list. Never mind actual \"good\" books. It seems very much like reading something I would have written in 8th grade in the 80's. which is fine, if you want your stories dictated through the eyes of a 15 year old boy in heat and whose literary experience entails reading reading fanfic on the imageboards. Not so great if you are over 18 and have half a brain.The book is among the worst I've ever read ... by far. How daft was I to buy the second one in the series as well before reading the first? Pretty daft I'd say. :(","I think a previous reviewer put it best when he summed this book up as merely pulp fiction....good pulp, but pulp nonetheless.My first introduction to the Ashes series was when I was a junior in high school. As part of \"The Day After\" generation, I was always curious as to what would ever happen if....and this series of books piqued my tenth grade curiosity...Years go by and a nostalgic part of me vaguely remembers these books, but not the specific titles. After some research, I finally found them and as coincedence would have it, they are in re-print.But I digress, the storyline in the series is very basic. Ben Raines, the hero, survives a nuclear and germ warfare attack brought about by the diabolical machinations of extremists hellbent on destroying the present society to allow a better one to take its place. After some reluctance, Ben accepts his \"fate\" to re-build a society based on very strict values and he assembles together a group of like-minded individuals for this purpose. The \"good\" guys are Ben Raines and his rebels, the \"bad\" guys are the US Government, the press and any other citizen who disagrees with Mr. Raines' views.The plot is simple, the characters are even simpler and the writing is mediocre, at best. But the story is damn entertaining, assuming you can take Mr. Johnstone's over simplified social and political diatribes with a grain of salt. These books conceivably could have been made into top gossing action films (Hell, Rambo did)... meant to entertain, not elighten.","This book deals with alot of problems in America today. Although it doesn't come right out and say that things need to change it does lead you around the edges of it. This book is fast-paced and full of action, It might start off confusing you but don't worry the book gets better the entire way through right up till the end.","\"Out of the Ashes\" caught my attention immediately, being a big fan of apocalyptic novels and a closet fan of disaster novels. Although the Ashes storyline starts out typically, with nuclear war looming and double and triple crosses being played out all around the world, the novel slowly turns into a lengthy sermon that is likely to have political liberals fuming and conservatives and libertarians like myself hiding in shame.It's not just that the author espouses his views, it's just that the views are so one-sided and childish. The additional shame of it is that the author's attitude toward the political aspects of the story and one-sided mindset seep into every aspect of the novel. Everyone who agrees is angelic and justified, everyone who disagrees is stupid, savage and unenlightened.Paper thin characters and generalizations abound in this story, especially when the author writes about women. All women are either raped and helpless, sexually promiscuous and devious or just sexually promiscuous. If, as some have suggested, the author identifies himself with the main character, he must have an incredible libido and be irresistable to women. Or maybe just a case of extreme wishful thinking.The dialogue is weak and repetitive, especially in the showdown scenes between the main character and various bad guys.The only thing that saves this novel from a 0-star rating is that the storyline (when removed of the grade school ideology) is interesting (a splintered United States trying to reunite) and that it's pure pulp fiction fun. If anyone has seen Starship Troopers, you'll know what I'm talking about.So if you're looking for a well-written, thought provoking novel, this is not it. If you're looking for pure pulp fiction with a ton of sex and violence where good and bad are easily defined, look no further than the 25+ books of this series.","Premise was good. But the thing that bothered me the most was the stupid \"sexual\" conquests. I was just put off with his hands \"going down the tangle of her pubic hair\" or \"into her wetness\". Heck this guy was the Terminator and Hugh Hefner rolled into Francis Marion and Thomas Jefferson. Then the stilted conservative speeches that passed for conversations and background made me cringe. As a believer in the free market and 2nd amendment I found this 7th grade writing project an embarrassment for \"my side\". I've read Lucifer's Hammer, Alas Babylon, Earth Abides... and many others. This was pathetic. I've finished half the book and can't get past the hand grenade trick in a Georgia roadblock. I haven't read it but I can guess that he's going to screw the liberal \"ACLU\" supporter over to the Libertarian side of life. I'll sell my copy and the two following books that were given to be as gifts when I mistakenly put this book on my wish list. How did this guy sell so many books like this? This is a great country. The author is a genius realizing that there is a market for this juvenile written cartoon.","This is the first in William Johnstone's &quot;Ashes&quot; series. I've noticed it described as &quot;survivalist literature,&quot; which --though an oxymoron-- is probably as accurate as anything could be. I was surprised to find out that the author was an adult when this was written. The simple plot, the terrible dialogue, and the walking stereotypes that pass as characters made me assume it was written by a high school student... and not one from the gifted program. The scary thing is that Johnstone has written so many sequels. With the ultra-right element so vocal in America these days, I imagine it really does pass for literature among the militia types. Btw... I bought the sequel, thinking it might get better. It doesn't. It actually gets worse. And after reading this one, that's hard to believe.","I really tried to finish this book, after all I paid good money for it and I like post-apocalyptic fiction, but this book is just ridiculous. I kept hoping that it would get better but by the time I was half way through I realized it was only getting worse. The author couldn't decide if he wanted to lecture us about the evils of big government and society in general or titillate us with second rate (make that third rate) smut. DO NOT waste your money on this drivel.","I read this as a paperback many years ago, as well as many of the books in the series. I remember enjoying them. Not so much now. I have grown, my politics and my world view has expanded. My self awareness and training have reached an advanced level in many areas.This book is still a fun read, but the whole thing is a cliche. It would be the equivalent of the \"Commando\" movie while books along Patriots, Jarkata Pandemic and One Second After would win Academy nods.First the stuff that is not so good:The story is based on a military coup involving the USA, China and Russia that ends in biological and limited nuclear warfare. Special Forces groups discover this prior, but somehow let the war happen. The main character is former SOG that survives by being in a coma due to wasp stings during the exchange.Then he happens to bed every lady he meets. Even the ones that hate him, and they love him for it. Yeah, right.His choice of weapon is a Thompson .45, even over M-16s (the book is a bit dated). His ideas on combat and self defense are suicidal.Now the things I like:Ben is a cool character for this type of fiction. He is a typical macho my way dude.Not someone I would get along with for lenghts of time, but fun to imagine in the situations presented.The action is evenly spaced and fun to read.Politically and socially I agree with a good portion of the main characters motivations and words.Save your money and borrow this from the library. If you still want to read about Ben, then come back here and get the rest.","I was really looking forward to reading this book but it disappointed me. The plot and charaters at the begining are hard to follow. Then the book degenerates into basically the sexual exploits of the main charater and unprobable gun fights. This book is really adolescent and appears to be written by a teenager. I got about halfway through the book and it did not appear to be going anywhere getting any better so quit reading it. Maybe Amazon will buy it back slightly used.","While this is the first review I have ever wrote I'm sure my opinion will vary. I am a sci-fi, post apocolyptic, TEOTWAWKI, SHTF, kinda reader. For ideas and for enjoyment.The scenes are well played out and have a very possible distinction. Not very many far fetched ideas or acts that seemed stupid. The \"sex scenes\" were too graphic for younger crowds. I look forward to the next book in the series. I just hope that they don't get stretched out for to long and start to fade.YMMVJohn","I've read all of the Ashes series, as well as every other book by Johnstone. The author is not trying to win an award for literature. His purpose for writing his stories is a warning to the reader about the inevitable results of the direction of our country.The most harsh critics of Johnstone's books attempt to dismiss his warnings as something only simple-minded extremists would seriously consider. These critics are in denial; they are fearful that there really is a group of Americans who would break away and start their own nation and establish their own set of laws. These critics have reason to fear. Johnstone's Ashes series is prophetic in the sense that we have no leadership with vision and we have a citizenry without the backbone to stop the government from creating such an outcome.When it comes, I will be with SUSA. There will always be critics and whiners. I would rather be part of something great that has no chance of winning than to lie down and let the left turn our republic into another failed socialist experiment.","This is by far my favorite novel of all time. I have two copies, one which I have read over and over again, and one which I am saving in mint condition. The themes helped shape my views when I was a teenager, and offered some sort of moral and politcal focus as well. I have given it as a gift to friends and family in the past. I whole-heartedly recommend this book.","This book brings Americas troubles to the forefront of our conciousness. Mr. Johnstone uses so many tools to get the point across to us the readers, it's truly amazing!!","The beginning of the book is excellent; with a rebellion brewing and nuclear apocylpse approaching. The story continues with the day-to-day survival of people across the country. Ben Raines eventually ends up recruiting a base of survivers and sets up a new state- Tri-State. This is where the book goes downhill; it goes downhill fast, in a very short period of time. He sets up his state and turns it into a conservative-utopia (an oxymoron in itself). A barbaric society results. A society with very few morals. A society that at times reminded me of Orwell's 1984. It almost seems as if Johnstone attempted to make more of a political statement than tell an entertaining story. If you are a good true blue American liberal, such as myself, don't bother with this book.","I have read this and seven other books of the &quot;in the ashes&quot; series. Frankly I just don't like them. They are pretty poorly written and are not something that looks like it will happen. Ben Raines and his army go around America distributing Uzi's to farmers and telling them to fight. Yeah, right. Johnstone seems to think this SUSA army is invinvcible, going around America killing hundreds of thousands of criminals and losing something like a few hundred Rebels. He seems to think everyone is fed up with the American goverenment. While we may have our problems with it, we would not just go and join some Soldier of Fortune militia. If a real life &quot;Raines&quot; ever took his army and formed a new country he would be smashed by Americans who wouldn't put up with that kind of crap. &quot;Raines&quot; real army would be filled with a bunch of military rejects. This series is one of the worst I have ever read. Don't waste your time looking at it.","This book got to me because we are so close everyday to being destroyed by nuclear weapons. The character of Ben Raines reminds us that every American should be Free.","Ben Raines...retired Soldier of Fortune, writer, patriot. He's the one to lead a decimated nation OUT OF THE ASHES! A very readable and entertaining novel, and also a critique of how empty-headed liberalism (redundant) is destroying society. Ben and his Tri-Staters tell the Federal Government to kiss their collective tookus (would that we all could do so). I have *every* ASHES book, and the first,as always, is the best....give this one a try, and you'll be hooked! I guarantee it! :)","Regardless of your political leanings, this book is an ill-conceived mess. The writing is barely above the fourth grade level, the characters are cardboard cutouts and the kindest thing that can be said about the plot is that it's absurdly choppy and uneven. The political views espoused by the author are so bizarre as to define explanation. The protaganist is presented as a far-right conservative who proceeds to excorciate the rich for failing to support the poor and seems to champion near-communistic wealth redistribution. Huh? Despite a right-wing, 'superpatriot'-initiated, worldwide military coup that has brought on armaggedon, every character is happy to blame the evil liberals for everything that has ever gone wrong in the history of the world. But it's not just the politics that make no sense: picture the scene where the protagonist calmly loads up on .45 ammo at a sporting goods store after complaining loudly several pages earlier that those damn liberals outlawed all personal firearms over three years ago. Johnstone creates such a lame apocalypse that the electicity is still on and his characters can cheerfully get gas at every gas station a full ten days after the nukes landed. If you absolutely must read right-wing, post-apocalyptic survivalist paperbacks, do yourself the favour of checking out James Axler's Deathlands books instead of this irredeemable drivel. Still, I have to give credit when it's due: most of this book is unintentionally hilarious.","This book is beyond description. It reads like an eighth grader wrote it, but without the deep thought of said middle schooler. The action is jumpy, the text almost pure exposition, and over half of the book is devoted to an extended rant/diatribe. And even the diatribe is unorganized, jumping from &quot;get tough on crime&quot; speeches to the main character's desire to &quot;screw&quot; a reporter he sees on television. All this being said, I couldn't put it down because I couldn't stop laughing. If you've ever wanted to look at truly bad pulp fiction with no attempt at organization or editing, be sure and pick up this book. I also enjoyed the author's musings on the coming race war. Thanks for the info, Johnstone! You are truly the greatest American hero.","Back in the mid 50s, Director Ed Wood made \"Plan 9 From Outerspace\" which has been called the worst movie ever made. Despite its glaring problems, the movie has become wildly popular. This book has lots in common with Mr. Wood's opus.I wont detail all the problems with \"Out of the Ashes\". The writing is shoddy, the plot is silly, there are tons of logical errors and the political/moral philosophy Mr. Johnstone seems to advocate is disjointed and childish. The action sequences are often decent but you have to put up with multi-chapter rants between scenes. All this makes for a novel so wretched and horrible you just cant put it down!A word of warning though. This book is actually the first of a series that tells the tale of super-patriot Ben Raines' effort to rebuild America as it should be in a post-apocalyptic world. Ive read a couple of the installments. The strange charm one can find in the first book does not carry on to later novels in the series. Dont bother with the rest of the \"Ashes\" series. They have absolutely no redeeming qualities.","I read \"Out of the Ashes\" a long time ago and could not remember much about it, so I ordered it on Kindle. Right now I am burning through various \"apocalypse now\" novels, and I wanted to see how this old soldier stacked up. The answer is, not well. This novel has not aged well and was not very good when it first came out. First of all, there is a lot of racist language in the book. I understand that the author was trying to be authentic and that some people really do talk that way, but it got so bad that I could not deal with it. That and long diatribes by the book's protagonist, Ben Raines, on his theory of how the various ethnic groups in America can, should, or cannot, get along are pretty awful. About 2/3 through this novel I realized that I was not enjoying it and was in fact completely put off by it.Even for readers who are not bothered by the constant ethnic diatribes, this is not much of an \"end of the world as we know it\" or \"survivalist\" novel. There is almost no detail in here about how people might survive a nuclear war (the cause of the apocalypse in this particular novel.) Basically, if you believe the author, people quietly die, there are lots of cars, gasoline, grenades, guns, food, and other goodies left around for the inexplicable survivors, and everyone can just get down to the serious business of killing and fornicating. Pretty dull really. \"Patriots\" and other novels of this genre are infinitely better than this one. There is almost no \"survivalism\" in this novel. Everything is just there, including bad guys to be killed every 20 pages or so.I know that there are almost countless novels in this series, so some folks obviously like it. I tried to like it but cannot, hence this negative review. RJB.","OK, so this story doesn't have the most original or deepest plots in the world, but what it does have is a strong political and social philosophy, and presents it in an interesting fashion.Mr. Johnstone's protagonist, Ben Raines, leads the way as a warrior-philosopher fighting the human scum rising to the top after World War Three destroys the world. Along the way, he hooks up with a group of survivors, and together they form a nation without crime, poverty, or injustice.Of course, the Washington liberals can't tolerate that, and destroy it.The book is over the top and sometimes thin, it's still a good lead into an exciting series.","This book makes an attempt to validate the most exasperating elements of the far right and far left. Taking children away from their families because they don't agree politically with Johnstone's utopian government and a sliding tax rate that places an extreme burden on the wealthy are just some examples. On the plus side, not a bad survivalist fiction.I would instead recommend PATRIOTS; Surviving the Coming Collapse by Rawles as an all-around better book with more palatable politics and solid survivalism information.","Enjoyed this book very much. Premise based on a WWIII scenerio, with Germ warfare as well as Nuclear. Hero is Ben Raines, a &quot;Hellhound&quot;, turned soldier of fortune, turned writer. Set in a decadent America (much like today), story portrays development of &quot;Tri-States&quot; philosophy of government--government truly by the people, with simple, easy to understand laws, enforced to the letter. Book details development of this philosophy through the destruction of Tri-States area by a reconstructed federal government which tries to be everything for everybody, and winds up satisfying nobody. Tri-States philosophy emphasizes personal responsibility/accountability for ones actions, which seems quite refreshing. Heartily recommend this book and all others in series...","This is one of the first post-apocalyptic series of books ever published. This book preaches self reliance, common sense government, a unified health care system and I almost forgot the Right to Bear arms. The stories revolve primarily around the adventures of one Ben Raines who I have to admit kicks more [bottom] then Dirty Harry. The series is primarily his own personal Eden The \"Tristates\"(a cool name). I can agree with enough of what these books are saying(and the action scenes) to enjoy them. If you want to read good pulp fiction go ahead and read these books.","The first 10 of the ashes books with all the side line storys are the best, yet the others stand on their own also. Tri States.. Hell yes, we need that kind of law and order.I dont agree with every thing he says but &quot;William J. Johnstone &quot; sure has some good ideas. All of his Adventure books are good, even the two that he wrote under another name. Check out Eagle Down and Dagger by William Mason and you'll see what i mean..","Check out the one star reviews of this title: virtually all of them were written by people (like myself) who are fans of post-apocalyptic fiction and widely read in the genre. This book is among the worst I've ever read, not only of that small sub-genre, but of books in general. Why?-the dialog reads like the fantasy of a teenager c. 1979-the plot is even worse-it slides from \"gun porn\" (boring, needless details about the internal workings of the Thompson sub-machine gun) to some of the worst sex scenes written since the script for Barbarella-it's sexist (and not in an interesting way)-it's racist (and not in a provocative way)-it's deeply hypocritical in its politics, ethics, and morals-it's so poorly written it will make your teeth hurtI stumbled on this book by accident (by searching the keyword \" apocalypse\" at the public library). I was surprised to find not one, but a whole series of books that I had never encountered, especially since I was deeply into this genre when the book was originally published during Reagan's first term. The fact that there's an entire shelf of books by William Johnstone in the public library is testament to the fact that you can't go broke selling crap to Americans.Bottom line: if you like teenage libertarian sex & gun fantasies there are better ones out there. Out of the Ashes offers up all a fifteen-year-old Ayn Rand reading, Call of Duty playing, never-dated-a-girl-yet boy could want. But if you're 16 or older, have a thing for quality writing, aren't into rape, or think certain ideas about the separation of races went out of style in fiction before the original Star Trek was on TV, this is one you should pass by.Really. It's that bad. Save your time and go re-read Lucifer's Hammer instead.","I love survival fiction, and i can almost always make it through a book, however bad. This one was just too painful, and I gave up halfway through. I won't go into plot, others have done so already. It sounded good from other reviews, so I gave it a try. Big mistake.The book reads like a high school creative writing class assignment. The main character is two dimensional and an obvious fantasy the author wishes he was. Each of the female characters encountered turns out to be beautiful and sexually interested in the main character. Apparently all the ugly women died when the world went to hell. The writing style is abrupt and juvenile, making it tough to get into any scene as it takes place. Predominately the author describes action, and even that poorly. It is also hampered by the fact that he is writing about a military character and coup with little apparent knowledge of the military, those who serve, or firearms. While I, myself, have never served, I'm embarrassed for the men and women of our armed forces by this portrayal of them.The author's fantastic approach to firearms is obvious by the continual use of full automatic weapons by a \"special ops\" character. Denigrating the M-16 (admittedly not always liked by vets) by refusing to have his character take one, instead favoring a pistol, submachine gun, and explosives goes against the common sense of everyone who seriously knows firearms. A pistol is for when you don't have a rifle, and a submachine gun is a short range solution. Why not take a rifle, even a bad rifle, when in a survival situation? Points like this populate the book.Additionally, the book comes strongly across as conservative propaganda. Issues like racial tension are handled as if violence between races is inevitable, slightly veiled by the fact that the main character doesn't quite agree. And while I, personally, may agree with some of the political stances of the main character, the way they are presented and pushed makes the whole thing feel preachy and contrived.Short version, save your money","From the first page this book will put chills down your spine. This really could have happened a few years ago during the cold war era. People living in their &quot;dream world&quot; now could learn alot about how the government works. We would have a lot less problems if justice was served the &quot;Ben Raines&quot; way. Thanks Mr. Johnstone","I would recommend this to anyone who has every played Fallout 3. Quick read with a long series, couldn't have asked for more for a 9 month deployment to Afghanistan."],

      "reviews.text":["When I first read \"Vault of the Ages\" it was an exciting book; in reviewing it as an adult close to 40 years later as an adult I find it still an enjoyable read. Looking back on the stories I read in my youth this had to be the first in the series of this genre of post doomsday chronicles that I continued to enjoy...This book emphasizes messages about human responsibility and the importance of using science only for good almost as though accentuated with a bright yellow Hi-Lighter Pen.The story is set in the Alleghenies roughly 500 years after a nuclear holocaust, Vault of the Ages tells the story peaceful farming tribes vs. fierce warriors. Carl, our lead hero and son of the village Chief is responsible for trading with the people from the ruined city to obtain metal and other needed materials form the remains of skyscrapers etc...Carl and his companions discover a \"time vault,\" basically a large time capsule remaining from the pre-holocaust civilization, containing numerous tools, books, models of apparatus and more depicting the sciences that have since been lost. With the aid of the newly discovered sciences and much common sense he is able to help his people.In rereading the description of the 'VAULT' it brings a smile to my face when I look around our office, library and museum facilities here at the Southwest Museum of Engineering, Communications and Computation here in Glendale Arizona.... I can imagine a facility such as this being the 'VAULT' spoken of in this story. I wonder what the world will be like in 500 years and what part the material preserved by the museum here will play in it....Ed Sharpe, Archivist for SMECC[...]","With a slight word of warning from Joachim on the juvenility of Vault of the Ages, I forged ahead on my sixteenth Poul Anderson book knowing the above objective truth with my own subjective truth: Poul Anderson has his hits (Tau Zero[1970] andThree Worlds to Conquer[1964]) more often than he has his misses (The Day of Their Return[1974] andOrbit Unlimited[1961]). Sadly, the familiar theme of The High Crusade, minus the aliens, comes across as shallow entertainment with a flowery epimyth or a conclusion. It's not a dud, but doesn't hearken to Poul's own science fiction traditions of wonderment and/or zany originality.Rear cover synopsis:\"20th Century, Mystery Century!Once upon a time (which hasn't happened yet) the fierce Lann army thundered down from the North to conquer the peace-loving Dalesmen. The `Doom' had destroyed nearly all concepts of civilization 500 years earlier. Defying charges of witchcraft, Carl of Dalesmen entered the forbidden city and the vault which held secrets of the long-ago twentieth century.\"------------With the winters being colder and longer than in recent memory, the northern clan of Lann has dispatched an army to the south in order to find new land to settle and cultivate, but not before killing and pillaging. Their reputation as a ruthless clan has reached further inland has become known as the fiercest, largest army. Lann's King Raymon's own son Lenard is the captain of the thousand-man platoon; both the leaders and the led are driven by the need to make a settlement further to south to ensure their clan's survival. In their way is peaceful town of Dalesmen.Democratically governed by Chief Ralph, the village has survived through the decades with the assistance of the town's \"Doctor,\" Donn. As with every village, the Doctor bears holy symbols, beats drums, and chants spells against witchcraft (130). One law of the Dalesmen tribe, and many tribes like them, is to not enter the City, where the scaffold remains of an ancient city still stand amid the rubble of concrete, steel, and glass. Though inhabited by a industrious yet cowardly band of so-called witches, the town is off-limits, especially so for the Time Vault within the city proper.Chief Ralph's son Carl treks through the forest and happens upon a country home where two boys, Tom and Owl, decide to tag along to enter the city, their mission to find reinforcement against the Lann horde. Their horses packed, they travel towards the City only to be chased by the Lann band, but they find solace in the City where they are greeted by the City's own Chief Ronwy. Permission is eventually granted for them to enter the Time Vault, where books and machines abound. To prove to his own clan that the City holds power enough for them to defeat the Lann clan, Carl takes a hand-crank flashlight to impress everyone.Denounced by Doctor Donn, the trio are ever eager to prove themselves potent in the eyes of the village and, most importantly, in the prying eyes of the Lann. Though the magic white light emanating from the contraption may have scared the army once, further technology must be attained so that they may conquer the horde of heathens at their threshold. Captured by the Lann eventually, the trio of Carl, Tom, and Owl defuse their situation craftily and return once again to their village where another challenge is thrown at them: the death penalty for trespassing on the ground of the City and overstepping the boundary of the Time Vault and the demons which lurk within.Yet another timely escape brandished by the young whippersnappers of Dalesmen sees them charge back into the City once and for all to gain control of the technology within the Time Vault, whether the City inhabitants or the Lann can stop them.------------Joachim is right when he states the juvenility of this novel. The gallivanting between their village, through the enemy's encampment, to the derelict perches of the City's skyscrapers is repetitive. The Vault holds such wonder to the trio of boys, but it also holds wonder in the reader. However, don't expect to be immersed in the ancient wonders of the Vault's bounty because only a handful of pages pertain to the Vault's treasures.You should familiarize yourself with some of the science lingo before dipping your toes into this science fiction novel:Smiting sabers, lancing pikes, gleaming shields, fringed buckskin breeches, sledging hammers, silver-studded boots... stop me when this begins to sound more like science fiction than fantasy or historical fiction... thudding hooves, drawn bows, quivers of arrows, moccasined feet, fur-lined tunics, saddle blankets, catapults... I could go on... hamstringing swords, creaking wagons, fur-trimmed boots, etc.It's not really that bad but it does drag on.I wasn't sympathetic with anyone in this novel, be they a person or a tribe: the morally high-grounded post-apocalyptic tribe (before post-apocalyptic was \"cool\") of Dalesmen pitted against the advancing threat of an impoverished clan from the Lann. Perhaps the Lann came at the encroachment the wrong way, with force, rather than diplomatically, but I didn't feel sorry for the villages left in their wake or those who had yet to feel the brunt of the great Lann warrior clan.The greedy territorial advance of the Lann army is synonymous to the technological lust of the Dalesmen youth. Where the Lann simply wanted land to live and thrive on, the Dalesmen youth look to the non-solution of technology to solve their problem of invasion. In the Time Vault itself, there were more than mere inventions of gunpowder and electricity, but there must have also been the inventions of the mind, something which they felt they could easily bypass. This reliance on knowing of technology rather than the knowledge of technology casts a dim view on the young bandits, be it for the greater cause or less. Even when they discuss to share the treasures within, they mention the material good rather than the good of knowledge.Even Doctor Donn says, \"There is no evil in the vault. There is only evil in the hearts of men. Knowledge, all knowledge, is good\" (187). If this were true in the context of the story, then why would the Dalesmen tribe offer to share the Vault's technology with competing clans when the exchange of ethics, morality, or religion could better change the \"hearts of men\" than a schooner could? Presuming the Vault is full of not only the world's most important technologies, but also full of the virtues of the world's most gifted thinkers, I would think the first thing to share would be the goodness of words, not the goodness of the material wealth.This will be one of the few Anderson novels that will be taken back to the second-hand bookstore. It's a pity that even the cover isn't noteworthy. I'll remind myself in the future to steer clear of Poul Anderson's historically themed novels if they don't include absurdity like The High Crusade. Now I'm only left with The Psycho-Technic League (1981) on my shelves... an ominous sign that I either need for Anderson, or none at all. Considering his wealth of material, there must be tastier morsels out there.","Poul Anderson's \"Vault of the Ages\" is a good tale of life going on after all is lost. Set 500 years after a nuclear disaster, a tribe in what is now the Alleghanies tries desparately to keep an invader from taking over. The son of a chiefian seeks shelter in a place that the others in his tribe are afraid of, and finds a very large time capsule in which the technology of our day is preserved in record. The rest deals with the invading horde which desparately needs fertile land or it'll strave and the fears of the tribe. Anderson showed his good writing from the beginning","This contains very succinct writing that conveys a very imaginative glimpse of a fictional post-apocalyptic future where civilization is about to be re-kindled. Very well written. The author doesn't get extravagant or excessive. This book is much more enjoyable when you maintain the perspective of what our culture was like when this book was written. It's also helpful to keep in mind that science fiction was comparatively rare when this book was written.","I love to read anything by Anderson, and decided on this because it is short and looked like a quick read. I knew going in that it was published in 1952, and tried mightily not to let that cloud my judgement. I have read many books in the genre from that time period, and most of them suffer at least a little from the changed times.Anderson's books are always polished and concise, and this one is no exception. The writing is clear and to the point, without being boring. It is a fine adventure story, and would likely have appealed to a young audience of the time, who undoubtedly would have found it exciting. Perhaps that would still be the case today, but the odds are that the overwhelming supply of these types of post-apocalyptic adventures written since this book appeared would provide a lot of competition. The story here is really all about the adventure and struggle that the young protagonist embarks upon, and the time vault is the vehicle for the adventure. The vault itself is only vaguely described, as far as its contents are concerned, and that is okay because it clearly is not the point of the book. The vault serves to provide a possible source of unity among otherwise warring tribes, who differ in their views about the possible harm or potential benefit the vault could provide humanity. Much of the book describes tribal warfare, but there are some memorable scenes that occur at the site of the time vault.If you are a fan of early science fiction, meaning perhaps the golden age or just a bit later (such as this book), you won't be disappointed with this. If you are a fan of Anderson, you'll enjoy it. If a young reader wishes to read this, the effect will likely not be the same as it was for young readers of the time. Unfortunately, in my view, excitement today is derived from a lot more dazzle and glitter than the days of this book. To be fair, there are many fine books of this type out there, and my rating takes that into account. I'm unable to view this, as it turns out, in a vacuum consisting of 1950's science fiction. This is a fine book for what it is, and I enjoyed reading it.","Vault of the Ages (1952), one of Poul Anderson's earliest novels, should not be missed. Although Vault of the Ages is at its core a simplistic juvenile (50s sci-fi for younger readers), Anderson's budding storytelling skills make it engaging and a joy to read. If only I had read it when I was younger! Suggested for any fans of 50s sci-fi, early post-apocalyptical sci-fi, and Poul Anderson completests.Brief Plot SummarySometime in the future the \"Doom\" (caused by atomic weapons) wipes out civilization -- all that remains are intensely superstitious loosely confederated tribes who live in wooden houses and tend livestock. Five hundred years after the Doom somewhere in the Alleghenies a boy named Carl, the son of the chief of the Dalesmen, dares to defy taboos and seek out the City (the ruins of a pre-Doom settlement).The plot concerns an invasion of fierce northern peoples called the Lann. Driven by a cooling climate and attacks from other unnamed peoples, the Lann desire to occupy the lands of the Dalesmen. Unlike other authors who are content to leave the \"barbarian\" enemy a nameless force of evil, Anderson tries give a rational for their actions and even introduces a character in parallel to Carl, Lenard, the son of the chief of the Lann. Like Carl, Lenard also does not fear the taboos and supposed curses and demons associated with ancient technology and the City.Carl is sent to the City to acquire metal (yanked from old skyscrapers) from the \"witches\" (various people who eek out an existence in the ruins). Here Carl finds a time vault with instructions to resurrect ancient technology (including simplistic mechanical technology -- windmills, sailboats, etc).The Dalesmen are suspicious of the time vault and its contents and condemn Carl to death. It's up to him and his few trusted friends to rescue his own people (despite their suspicion of him), raise the taboos on the technology which can deliver his people, and obtain the secrets of the vault before Lenard and the Lann!Final ThoughtsThe plot itself pulls no punches -- it's predictable and free of frills/twists etc. However, Anderson infuses his narrative with energy and excitement. Despite knowing the outcome I found myself rooting for Carl nevertheless! Vault of the Ages is characterized by unbridled optimism and obvious morals -- technology is beneficial if used by the right people and the right people are the idealistic young who push against the boundaries imposed by their elders with the good of society at heart.In frustrating 1950s fashion, the \"idealistic young\" are men... Women are nowhere to be seen.","Have looked at libraries and book stores for this old book for some time and finally found it at Amazon. Was very pleased with the condition of the book and very happy with the price. Thank you for having so many titles to search for."],
