                    "The field of artificial intelligence, in terms of its research content, and the confidence it expresses in the results of this research, has executed a roller coaster ride in the last five decades. There have been many proposals, many leads not going anywhere, but just as many leads showing great promise but were abandoned. The reasons why they were abandoned are unclear, but many researchers in artificial intelligence have let them themselves be persuaded that their results do not reflect real intelligence. This has thwarted the development of many promising areas in artificial intelligence, which could have been highly developed by now.The author, in this new edition of her book, has given the reader her opinions of the status of artificial intelligence in the twenty-five years after the first edition of the book. Her assessment of the last twenty-five years is in general optimistic, but her review concentrates mostly on research in the academic setting. There have also been dramatic advances in artificial intelligence in the commercial sector in the last twenty-five years, but many of these are difficult to document, since issues of propriety arise in the business environment. The many applications that are used by business and industry are practical proof of the rise of machine intelligence in the last twenty-five years, and many of these make use of the academic developments that the author discusses in this book.The self-doubts and concentrated attention expressed by various researchers are well documented by the author, and some interesting historical anecdotes are included. The author describes the \"odd paradox\" in artificial intelligence as one where the its practical successes are absorbed into the domains in which they found application. Once assimilated, they become \"silent partners\" alongside other (non-intelligent) approaches. This reinforces the belief that the intelligent applications were not intelligent in the first place, and are then viewed merely as \"valuable automatic helpers\". This scenario has been played out many times in the history of artificial intelligence, and, even worse, the fact that the workings of these applications were understood made many assert that this was proof of their non-intelligence. If a process or algorithm is understood, it cannot be intelligent. This bias, the author correctly observes, continues to this day. Regardless of these beliefs or prejudices, the fact remains though that many of today's computers and machines are packed full of intelligence, albeit in different levels, and these levels will dramatically increase in the next twenty-five years.Researchers in artificial intelligence have been accused of exaggerating the status of machine intelligence, and similar to the same exaggerations that occur in other fields, which arise many times from pressures to obtain funding, these accusations do have some truth to them. But the author points out a case where the funding was cancelled due to the project not being \"extravagant enough.\" This is an interesting historical fact, and one that illustrates the large swings in confidence that have plagued AI research from the beginning.The strong emphasis on emulating human intelligence has been dampened in recent years, with researchers realizing, refreshingly, that human intelligence is not the only kind in nature. It is in retrospect quite surprising that silicon-based machines were thought to be able to mimic the processes and powers of biological systems. The author quotes one researcher as saying that \"Silicon intelligence would surely be different from human intelligence\". This is indeed correct, and one can expect many different types of intelligence to reside in future machines, each of these types emphasizing particular tasks, but being general enough to think in many domains. Maybe a better word for describing the field would be to call it `Alien Intelligence', so as to emphasize the (non-human) idiosyncrasies of these different intelligences.With very exceptions, the philosophical community has been against the possibility of artificial intelligence. This continues to this day, and the author discusses some of the philosophical tirades leveled against artificial intelligence since the first edition of the book. Researchers in AI have taken the time (unfortunately) to answer some of these criticisms, but there is also a trend, which hopefully will continue, to ignore them and instead spend time on what is important, namely the design and construction of intelligent machines. There is no penalty in ignoring philosophical criticism; it lends no constructive insight into artificial intelligence. However there is a great penalty taken in the form of wasted hours in attempting to answer the vague and impractical claims of philosophers. Ironically, there have been a few renowned philosophers that have left the practice of philosophy and have entered into research into artificial intelligence (and have done a fine job in this regard).The author also shares with the reader her personal insights into artificial intelligence, and these are interesting considering her involvement with some of the major academic experts in AI. She describes her bias in thinking of (mobile) robots as the sole representative of artificial intelligence. This bias has been alleviated to a large degree in the last decade, but many still equate artificial intelligence to the presence of bipedal robots wandering around performing useful tasks or possibly acting as adversaries to human beings. The latter view of course is very popular in Hollywood interpretations of artificial intelligence. The real truth though is that (immobile) machines, be they servers in networks, laptop computers, or other types of machines, can exhibit high levels of intelligence, depending on what kind of \"software\" or \"mind\" is overlaid on them.The most important thing to be settled for the field of artificial intelligence, and this is brought out also in many of the author's remarks, is a general methodology for gauging machine intelligence. The Turing test is too subjective and tied too much to measures of human intelligence. The AI community definitely needs to arrive at quantitative measures of machine intelligence in order to assess progress and allow the business community to judge more accurately whether a certain level of machine intelligence is needed for their organizations.",
                    "Twenty five years ago Pamela McCorduck wrote a definitive book on Artificial Intelligence. She first went among the artificial intelligentsia when the field was fresh and new, and she asked the scientists engaged in it what they were doing and why. She saw artificial intelligence as the scientific apotheosis of one of the most enduring, glorious, often amusing, and sometimes alarming, traditions of human culture: the endless fascination with artifacts that think.Long out of print, it became a classic, often quoted, but not often read. Now it's back and in a new edition with an extended afterword that brings the field up to date in the last quarter century, including its scientific and public faces. McCorduck shows how, from a slightly dubious fringe science, artificial intelligence has moved slowly to a central place in our everyday lives, and how it will be even more crucial as the World Wide Web moves into its next generation.",
                    "This is a book written in the late 1970s about the early history of the field of Artificial Intelligence. The book reflects a considerable bias towards the part of this field that came out of the Dartmouth conference (McCarthy, Simon, Newell, Misky, etc). The first 2/3 of the book are good as historical context, though the book misses some things (eg at this time it was not yet known about Alan Turing's work with computers during the world war II). The book is, however, rather biased by the Dartmouth crowd. for example, there is little attention paid to the perceptron. Yet, all in all I would have given 4* to the book if it had stopped at 2/3, if nothing else because it is a good read. The last part is difficult to read. Twice I started this book, and twice I stopped before page 400. So overall it gets 3*"

                    "Concentrating on the mathematical and formal underpinnings of learning theory, this book gives a very interesting and general overview of the subject. Basing their discussion on the learning of \"texts\" and the learning of \"functions\", the authors address the main issues in the formal modeling of empirical inquiry. The models or \"paradigms\" they construct are based on five concepts, which they consider of central importance in empirical inquiry. These concepts are: (1) A reality that is theoretically possible; (2) hypotheses that are intelligible; (3) the data that is available about a given reality; (4) a model of a scientist; (5) the successful behavior of the scientist who is investigating a possible reality. The scientist is thought of as playing a game with Nature, with the class of possible realities being known to each of them initially. Nature selects a member from this class, initially unknown to the scientist. After providing a series of clues (data) to the scientist, the scientist forms hypotheses based on these clues. The scientist wins the game if the hypotheses become stable and accurate. The game is easier to win the more constrained Nature's choice of actual world is.After a brief philosophical discussion of the paradigms and a review of the theory of computation, the authors begin their study by concentrating on identification of languages and identification of functions. Both of these are considered to be `theoretically possible realities', and in the case of languages, it is \"texts\" that are to be identified by scientists. Those texts that can are called `identifiable' and the authors prove a theorem that characterizes how scientists identify languages in terms of finite strings of text. Success in function identification is cast as a generalization of that of text. In this case the class of possible realities are the collection of total recursive functions, and hypotheses are programs that compute these functions. The authors show however that a scientist who identifies the entire class of recursive functions cannot be computable. Very interesting in this discussion is the treatment of `parametrized scientists', i.e. those scientists who can incorporate background knowledge from other scientists.These considerations involve the view of a scientist as being a certain fixed entity. The authors also consider cases where alternative notions of scientist occur, but the other paradigms are held fixed. The abilities of computable scientists who deploy different inductive `strategies' are studied, with the goal of finding out if a member of a particular strategy can effectively identify languages or functions. Recognizing that the conjectures proposed successively by a particular scientist may not be related to one another, the authors then discuss strategies that result from imposing relations between the conjectures. One of these, called `conservative', insists that a conjecture that generates all the data observed to date should never be abandoned. Also discussed are `generalization strategies' that require scientists to improve upon their successive conjectures. One example of these strategies is called `strong-monotonic', which forbids the revision of a hypothesis if it made a mistake in identification. Another example is called `weak monotonic', which allows the rejection of parts of a hypothesis if it encounters data that cannot be accounted for by this hypothesis. Still another is `monotonic', which allows the correction of mistaken hypotheses, but does not allow hypotheses that will contradict correct classifications. The authors show that monotonicity does not imply weak-monotonicity, and vice versa. Also discussed are `specialization' strategies, which are \"dual\" to the three generalization strategies, and which involve the pruning of hypotheses in order to obtain convergence.The authors also address the case where the conception of a scientist is held fixed, but the criteria for scientific success are varied. This study, in the opinion of this reviewer, more accurately reflects the real behavior of scientists, who typically use very liberal notions of accuracy. For example, anomalies in data could be tolerated, pending alteration of the hypotheses in the future. These anomalies in fact serve to drive further research, with the goal of finding hypotheses or theories that resolve them. It is typically the case, if not always, that the hypotheses are considered approximate explanations, and so one would expect that the authors' discussion would revolve around the consideration of inference of approximations. The authors though do give an interesting twist to this discussion, namely, they attempt to find criteria for success that actually permit an infinite number of anomalies in the final explanations. This serves to better characterize explanations, they argue. A series of identification criteria are outlined each of which involves measure-theoretic notions of `asymptotic agreement.' A scientist presented with a function must arrive at an explanation that agrees asymptotically with the function up to a prespecified amount.Also more realistic, due to its emphasis on what happens in actual scientific investigation, is the authors' discussion on alternative conceptions of available data. Noting that data can be missing or have errors, and is presented in a definite order to a scientist, the authors study how to deal with error in the finding of intelligible hypotheses. Their results delineate the extent to which inaccurate data can impede the learning process, with three kinds of \"inaccurate\" data considered: \"incomplete\", \"noisy\", and \"imperfect.\"Other topics discussed include the modeling of empirical inquiry when many scientists are collaborating with each other, and that of probabilistic learning. For team identification of functions, several interesting results are proven, but the authors admit that their results do not apply to the (more realistic) scenario where the hypotheses of each individual scientist influence each other. Also discussed are \"oracle\" scientists, who use information of a noncomputable nature, or \"information oracles\", in order to perform identifications. When judged by how much information can be given to the scientist, oracles can be \"omniscient\" or \"trivial\", and it is thus of interest to determine how much oracles can supply scientists in their identification of functions. The authors discuss various results on this topic, showing how much is to be gained by allowing oracle scientists to make additional queries."

How intelligent are the best of today's AI programs? To what extent can we entrust them with decisions that affect our lives? How human-like do we expect them to become, and how soon do we need to worry about them surpassing us in most, if not all, human endeavours? From leading AI researcher and award-winning author Melanie Mitchell comes a knowledgeable and captivating account of modern-day artificial intelligence. Flavoured with personal stories and a twist of humor, Artificial Intelligence illuminates the workings of machines that mimic human learning, perception, language, creativity and common sense. Weaving together advances in AI with cognitive science and philosophy, Mitchell probes the extent to which today's 'smart' machines can actually think or understand, and whether AI requires such elusive human qualities in order to be reliable, trustworthy and beneficial.

For starters, the book is poorly organized. Topics that logically belong together are often several chapters apart. There is no overall structure to the book. It seems like a collection of topics in AI that were hastily assembled without concern for thematic organization or flow. For example, the forward and backward chaining algorithms are presented in a chapter (Ch. 7) on rule-based systems, but are not even mentioned in the chapter (Ch. 13) on logic! Perceptron training is presented AFTER backpropagation! Contrast this with the much better book by Russell and Norvig, which uses the theme of intelligent agents as a continuing motivation throughout, and which groups related topics into logically arranged chapters.The examples in Winston are atrocious. The main example in the backpropagation chapter is some kind of classification network with a bizarre topography. This example is so trivial and weird that it totally fails to illustrate the strengths of backpropagation. The explanations of generalization and overfitting in backprop training are awful.The only chapter of this book that is not an unmitigated pedagogical disaster is the chapter on genetic algorithms, although better introductions exist (e.g. Melanie Mitchell).A further annoyance is the placement of all the exercises at the end of the book instead of the end of the chapters to which they correspond.Avoid this book.

                    "This book is a collection of articles that give a fair representation of the status of artificial intelligence in the mid 1990's. In only a decade since those times, the field has expanded considerably, mostly due to applications and the rise of the Internet. Controversy as to the nature and characterization of machine intelligence continues of course, and one finds both intense criticism and uncritical optimism of the nature and future of artificial intelligence. Most of this takes place in the philosophical literature, but there are also places in mainstream AI circles where predictions of future developments are overly optimistic. This optimism is refreshing but it can be a distraction for those that are seriously working to develop useful applications of artificial intelligence. But also, cynicism and negativism have also thwarted research in AI, there having been a few cases that showed much promise, but were abandoned because the researchers were convinced by others that their ideas were unsound. The AM and EURISKO efforts in automated mathematics, which are discussed briefly in this book, are good examples of this.All of the articles in this book are interesting, but there are a few that stand out due to their penetrating insight on matters that are still of great interest in artificial intelligence. One of these is the article entitled \"Creativity\" by Margaret A. Boden, who is the editor of the book, and who has done some outstanding work in the elucidation of what it means for a machine (human or otherwise) to be creative. Her insights on this subject are many, and in the opinion of this reviewer her works should be required reading for all those interested in the origins of creativity and attempts to implement it in non-human machines.Boden asserts that every case of creativity cannot be explained by a single scientific theory, one reason for this being that an AI model must be evaluated, and such an evaluation is outside the realm of science. In addition, there is a high variability in creative psychological processes, which preclude a general understanding of them. Lastly, creativity is very idiosyncratic but Boden is careful to point out that it is not random, but instead subject to constraints in `conceptual space'. Boden does not define conceptual spaces from a mathematical standpoint in her article, but she does discuss their utility in modeling creativity in AI, and the role of AI models in making more rigorous the conceptual spaces employed by musicologists, literary critics, etc. Boden's ideas in this article on the mapping, exploring, and transforming conceptual spaces can be viewed in the context of dynamical systems, and such a view allows them to be more easily coded into a machine language. Boden discusses several examples of AI models of the arts, such as connectionist models of music, the AARON program for generating line drawings, and the Letter Spirit project, which tries to model the perception of alphabetic style. She points out the pluses and minuses in each of these examples, such as the limited compositional ability of connectionist models, the limited evaluative and self-correcting powers of AARON, and the lack of Letter Spirit in being able to justify its own decisions. AI models of science are also discussed, and Boden concludes that most of these are `data driven' and cannot identify relevance for themselves. She believes that they can learn, but their discoveries are `exploratory', and do not succeed in changing their own conceptual spaces.The status of machine intelligence for scientific discovery has changed quite a bit since this article was written. Techniques from inductive logic programming coupled with faster hardware are making the reality of automated scientific discovery closer with every passing year in the twenty-first century. With more powerful hardware on the horizon, these developments give evidence of a time when drawing on the efforts of their human tutors, machines will be able to think across scientific domains and formulate hypotheses and creative ideas that may far surpass anything that has been done by human scientists. The time scales needed for this scientific discovery to take place may be so short that it might be difficult for human observers to assimilate these new results in order to evaluate their efficacy and applicability. The machines though may have their own opinions on the utility of the ideas and theories they derive."

Its scope is intended to span the full range of interests from classical problems in the philosophy of mind and philosophical psycholo gy through issues in cognitive psychology and sociobiology (concerning the mental capabilities of other species) to ideas related to artificial in telligence and to computer science. While primary emphasis will be placed upon theoretical, conceptual, and epistemological aspects of these prob lems and domains, empirical, experimental, and methodological studies will also appear from time to time. The perspective that prevails in artificial intelligence today suggests that the theory of computability defines the boundaries of the nature of thought, precisely because all thinking is computational. This paradigm draws its inspiration from the symbol-system hypothesis of Newell and Simon and finds its culmination in the computational conception of lan guage and mentality. The \"standard conception\" represented by these views is subjected to a thorough and sustained critique in the pages of this book. Employing a distinction between systems for which signs are signif icant for the users of a system and others for which signs are significant for use by a system, I have sought to define the boundaries of what AI, in principle, may be expected to achieve.",

The book tries to cover as much as possible about the scope and limits of classical AI and is refreshing in its consideration of semiotics (chapter 2 is devoted to symbol systems and semiotic systems) and the relevance of Pierce's theories to the design of intelligent machines. However, I found many discussions in Fetzer's book to be rather banal, and many of his arguments are poor. An example of this is the first chapter's discussion of Searle's Chinese Room and Rapaport's Korean Room."

So, it's worth sticking to it for a lifetime, even if it takes 30 years or so to reap the benefits. The AI problem. The science of artificial intelligence (AI) may be defined as the construction of intelligent systems and their analysis. A natural definition of a system is anything that has an input and an output stream. Intelligence is more complicated. It can have many faces like creativity, solving prob lems, pattern recognition, classification, learning, induction, deduction, build ing analogies, optimization, surviving in an environment, language processing, and knowledge. A formal definition incorporating every aspect of intelligence, however, seems difficult. Most, if not all known facets of intelligence can be formulated as goal driven or, more precisely, as maximizing some utility func tion. It is, therefore, sufficient to study goal-driven AI; e. g. the (biological) goal of animals and humans is to survive and spread. The goal of AI systems should be to be useful to humans.",

                    "This book differs from most books on the theoretical formulations of artificial intelligence in that it attempts to give a more rigorous accounting of machine learning and to rank machines according to their intelligence. To accomplish this ranking, the author introduces a concept called `universal artificial intelligence,' which is constructed in the context of algorithmic information theory. In fact, the book could be considered to be a formulation of artificial intelligence from the standpoint of algorithmic information theory, and is strongly dependent on such notions as Kolmogorov complexity, the Solomonoff universal prior, Martin-Lof random sequences and Occam's razor. These are all straightforward mathematical concepts with which to work with, the only issue for researchers being their efficacy in giving a useful notion of machine intelligence.The author begins the book with a \"short tour\" of what will be discussed in the book, and this serves as helpful motivation for the reader. The reader is expected to have a background in algorithmic information theory, but the author does give a brief review of it in chapter two. In addition, a background in sequential decision theory and control theory would allow a deeper appreciation of the author's approach. In chapter four, he even gives a dictionary that maps concepts in artificial intelligence to those in control theory. For example, an `agent' in AI is a `controller' in control theory, a `belief state' in AI is an `information state' in control theory, and `temporal difference learning' in AI is `dynamic programming' or `value/policy iteration' in control theory. Most interestingly, this mapping illustrates the idea that notions of learning, exploration, adaptation, that one views as \"intelligent\" can be given interpretations that one does not normally view as intelligent. The re-interpretation of `intelligent' concepts as `unintelligent' ones is typical in the history of AI and is no doubt responsible for the belief that machine intelligence has not yet been achieved.The author's formulations are very dependent on the notion of Occam's razor with its emphasis on simple explanations. The measurement of complexity that is used in algorithmic information theory is that of Kolmogorov complexity, which one can use to measure the a prior plausibility of a particular string of symbols. The author though wants to use the `Solomonoff universal prior', which is defined as the probability that the output of a universal Turing machine starts with the string when presented with fair coin tosses on the input tape. As the author points out, this quantity is however not a probability measure, but only a `semimeasure', since it is not normalized to 1, but he shows how to bound it by expressions involving the Kolmogorov complexity.The author also makes use of the agent model, but where now the agent is assumed to be acting in a probabilistic environment, with which it is undergoing a series of cycles. In the k-th cycle, the agent performs an action, which then results in a perception, and the (k+1)-th cycle then begins. The goal of the agent is to maximize future rewards, which are provided by the environment. The author then studies the case where the probability distribution of the environment is known, in order to motivate the notion of a `universal algorithmic agent (AIXI).' This type of agent does not attempt to learn the true probability distribution of the environment, but instead replaces it by a generalized universal prior that converges to it. This prior is a generalization of the Solomonoff universal prior and involves taking a weighted sum over all environments (programs) that give a certain output given the history of a particular sequence presented to it. The AIXI system is uniquely defined by the universal prior and the relation specifying its outputs. The author is careful to point out that the output relation is dependent on the lifespan or initial horizon of the agent. Other than this dependence the AIXI machine is a system that does not have any adjustable parameters.The author's approach is very ambitious, for he attempts to define when an agent or machine could be considered to be `universally optimal.' Such a machine would be able to find the solution to any problem (with the assumption that it is indeed solvable) and be able to learn any task (with the assumption that it is learnable). The process or program by which the machine does this is `optimal' in the sense that no other program can solve or learn significantly faster than it can. The machine is `universal' in that it is independent of the true environment, and thus can function in any domain. This means that a universal optimal machine could perform financial time series prediction as well as discover and prove new results in mathematics, and do so better than any other machine. The notion of a universally optimal machine is useful in the author's view since it allows the construction of an `intelligence order relation' on the \"policies\" of a machine. A policy is thought of as a program that takes information and delivers it to the environment. A policy p is `more intelligent' than a policy p' if p delivers a higher expected reward than p'.The author is aware that his constructions need justification from current practices in AI if they are to be useful. He therefore gives several examples dealing with game playing, sequence prediction, function minimization, and reinforcement and supervised learning as evidence of the power of his approach. These examples are all interesting in the abstract, but if his approach is to be fruitful in practice it is imperative that he give explicit recommendations on how to construct a policy that would allow a machine to be as universal and optimal (realistically) as he defines it (formally) in the book. Even more problematic though would be the awesome task of checking (proving) whether a policy is indeed universally optimal. This might be even more difficult than the actual construction of the policy itself.",
                    "Solomonoff's famous inference model solves the inductive learning problem in a universal and provably very powerful way. Many methods from statistics (maximum likelihood, maximum entropy, minimum description length...) can be shown to be special cases of the model described by Solomonoff. However Solomonoff Induction has two significant shortcomings: Firstly it is not computable, and secondly it only deals with passive environments. Although many problems can be formulated in terms of sequence prediction (for example categorisation), in AI in general an agent must be able to deal with an active environment where the agent's decisions affect the future state of the environment.In essence, the AIXI model, the main topic of this book, is an extension of Solomonoff Induction to this much more general space of active environments. Although the model itself is very simple (it is really just Solomonoff's model with an expectimax tree added to examine the potential consequences of the agent's actions) the resulting analysis is now more difficult than in the passive case. While optimality can be show in certain senses, the powerful convergence bounds that Solomonoff induction has now appear to be difficult to establish.Like Solomonoff induction, AIXI also suffers from computability problems. In the one of the final sections a modified version of AIXI is presented which is shown to be computable and optimal in some sense. Practically this algorithm would be much too slow, but this is a clear step away from abstract models which can in theory be implemented.For anybody interested in universal theories of artificial intelligence this book is a must. The presentation is quite technical in places and thus the reader should have some understanding of theoretical computer science, statistics and Kolmogorov complexity.",
                    "This is probably the most rigorous attempt to formalize AI. The book succeeds in presenting the state-of-the-art AI theory from a technical point of view, but neglects intuition, and is difficult to read for the novice and thus inaccessible to a wider audience.The main idea of the book in combining classical control theory concepts with Bayesian inference and algorithmic information theory. The author avoids to struggle with anthropocentric aspects of intelligence (which are subject to a fierce debate) by defining intelligent agents as utility maximizing-systems. The core ideas are, in a nutshell (informally):1) Goal: Build a system with an I/O stream interfaced with an environment, where inputs are observations and outputs are actions, that optimizes some cumulative reward function over the observations. Two ingredients are necessary: model the a priori unknown environment and solve for the reward-maximizing actions.2) Model: This is a probability distribution over future observations conditioned on the past (actions and observations). Instead of using any particular domain-specific model, the author uses a weighted mixture over \"all\" models. By \"all models\", the set of all mechanically calculable models is meant, i.e. the set of all algorithmically approximable probabilistic models.3) Policy: Given the model, all possible futures can be simulated (up to a predefined horizon) by trying out all possible interaction paths. Essentially, a huge decision tree is constructed. Having this information, it is \"easy\" to solve for the best policy. Just pick at each step the action that promises the highest expected future rewards. These are calculated recursively using Bellman's optimality equations.Why does this work in theory? If the environment is equal to one of the models in the mixture (or \"close enough\"), then the mixture model converges to the true environment. The model is updated step by step using Bayes' rule. Since the model becomes more accurate, the policy based on it converges to the optimum. Algorithmic information theory is the main tool to derive the mathematical results.Does it work in practice? Unfortunately, the presented solution cannot be implemented in practice, because the mixture model is incomputable. Even worse, there is currently no principled way to downscale his approach (and make it practical), since we don't know how to simplify (a) the mixture model and (b) the computation of the policy. The author makes these points very clear in his book. IMHO these are the main challenges for future AI research.The PROs: This is the first time I see a unified, formal and mathematically sound presentation of artificial intelligence. The proposed theoretical solution provides invaluable insight about the nature of learning and acting - hidden even in very subtle details in his approach and in his equations. Whereas you might feel that classical AI or commonplace Machine Learning theory looks like a patchwork of interesting concepts and methods, here (almost) everything fits nicely together into a coherent and elegant solution. Once you have studied and understood this book (which took years in my case), it is very difficult to go back to the traditional approaches of AI.The CONTRAs: However, there are some downsides to this book. Hutter is a brilliant mathematician and sharp thinker. Unfortunately his writing style is very formal and many times he neglects intuition. The book introduces difficult notation (although some of it pays off in the long run) that ends up obfuscating simple ideas. The mathematical style of the book is difficult to digest.To summarize, this books represents a giant leap in the theory of AI. If you have advanced mathematical training and enough patience to study it, then this book is for you. For the more practically-oriented researcher who wants to learn about Universal AI, I recommend reading Shane Legg's \"Machine Super Intelligence\".",
                    "Have you ever wondered if Artificial Intelligence is possible at all? And if so, can it be achieved by a neat and simple construction, rather than some highly complex system that nobody could understand? This book proposes a theory answering both questions in the affirmative. The idea is easy: use a universal model class, treat observations in a probabilistic (Bayesian) way, and do an optimal far-sighted decision on this basis. In the book, this construction is mathematically elaborated, and many properties are stated and proven, such as asymptotic behavior, optimality, etc. On the other hand, no efficient implementation is possible at this stage, since the system requires infinite computation time.This is the only mathematical definition of universal AI I know of, and maybe the only one possible.

(For an earlier effort see, for instance,Theory of Problem Solving: An Approach to Artificial Intelligence, Ranan Banerji, Elsevier, 1969) If successful, such a foundation would permit us to elaborate and explore intelligence by applying the formal methods of mathematics (e.g., theorem proving).Hutter starts from Werbos' definition of intelligence: \"a system to handle all of the calculations from crude inputs through to overt actions in an adaptive way so as to maximize some measure of performance over time\" which seems reasonable. (P. J. Werbos, IEEE Trans. Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 1987, pg 7)Finding all of the proper axioms for such a mathematical theory of intelligence is still an open and difficult problem, however. Hutter places great stock in Occam's razor. But there is experimental evidence that Occam's razor is incorrect. (The Myth of Simplicity, M. Bunge, Prentice-Hall, 1963) See also, Machine Learning, Tom Mitchell, McGraw-Hill, 1997, pg 65-66. Rather than saying that nature IS simple I believe that it is more correct to say that we are forced to approximate nature with simple models because \"our\" (both human and AI) memory and processing power is limited.I am also unsure that we should assume a scalar utility. In Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (Princeton U. Press, 1944, pg 19-20) von Neumann and Morgenstern said: \"We have conceded that one may doubt whether a person can always decide which of two alternatives...he prefers...It leads to what may be described as a many-dimensional vector concept of utility.\" Vector utility (value pluralism) has been employed in AI in my Asa H system (Trans. Kansas Academy of Science, vol. 109, # 3/4, pg 159, 2006)I suppose, then, that I object to the word \"Universal\" in Hutter's title.I think that he is exploring only one kind of intelligence and that there are others.",
                    "Artificial Intelligence has proven to be one of those elusive holy grails of computing. Playing chess (very, very well) has proven possible, while driving a car or surviving in the wilderness is a long, long way from possible. Even the definition of these problems has proven impossible.This book first makes the assumption that unlimited computational resources are available, and then proceeds to develop a universal theory of decision making to derive a rational reinforcement learning agent.Even this approach is incomputable and impossible to implement. Chapter 7 presents a modified approach that will reduce the computational requirements, although they remain huge.Chapter 8 summarizes the assumptions, problems, limitations, performance of this approach, and concludes with some less technical remarks on various philosophical issues.This is a highly theoretical book that describes the state of the art in AI approaches. Each chapter concludes with a series of problems which vary from \"Very Easy, solvable from the top of your head\" to \"If you can solve this you should publish it in the professional literature.\"This is the state of the art as it exists today."

                "description": "An internationally recognized scientist presents his theories and associated technology for the coming generations of adaptive intelligent machines. In this extraordinary book, the pioneer of research in collective learning systems (an adaptive learning paradigm for artificial intelligence) describes the processes of cognition, postulates a fundamental adaptive building block for assembling very large scale collective learning systems (the learning cell), and proposes a design for the ultimate machine: a hierarchical network of 100 million learning cells that could exhibit the full range of cognitive capabilities of the human mind. The author predicts that using the classical \"expert system\" approach to create such a vast knowledge base would require thousands of years to program all the rules. As a feasible alternative, he explains how a massive collective learning system could achieve this goal in about 20 years, much as humans do. Based on natural biological precedents, a collective learning system acquires its knowledge through trial-and-error interaction with the real world. To put it all in proper perspective, the author introduces a theory of games for modeling the various processes of the universe, presents a futuristic glimpse of the creation of the first artificially cognitive being, and discusses the philosophical issues raised by the prospect of creating machines that exhibit human-like cognition. Two chapters are devoted to the design and evaluation of collective learning systems. The final chapter presents the remarkable results of an on-going international research project directed by the author, a parallel-processing collective learning system that simulates the sub-symbolic adaptive vision functions of the brain.",

Artificial Superintelligence: A Futuristic Approach directly addresses these issues and consolidates research aimed at making sure that emerging superintelligence is beneficial to humanity. While specific predictions regarding the consequences of superintelligent AI vary from potential economic hardship to the complete extinction of humankind, many researchers agree that the issue is of utmost importance and needs to be seriously addressed. Artificial Superintelligence: A Futuristic Approach discusses key topics such as: AI-Completeness theory and how it can be used to see if an artificial intelligent agent has attained human level intelligence Methods for safeguarding the invention of a superintelligent system that could theoretically be worth trillions of dollars Self-improving AI systems: definition, types, and limits The science of AI safety engineering, including machine ethics and robot rights Solutions for ensuring safe and secure confinement of superintelligent systems The future of superintelligence and why long-term prospects for humanity to remain as the dominant species on Earth are not great Artificial Superintelligence: A Futuristic Approach is designed to become a foundational text for the new science of AI safety engineering.

                    "What is this book all about? It is all about a mind-blowing universal law of nature. Mind-blowing, because it is unbelievable that at the end of the 20th century a new fundamental principle can be laid down. Here it would be of use to remind one shocking lesson in the history of humanity's understanding of the universe. More than 22 centuries ago a Greek astronomer, Aristarchus of Samos, revealed that our planet actually rotates and revolves around the Sun. But only in the 15th century Copernicus dared to boldly recognized this fact of nature thus refuting the long established myth of the Ptolemaic geocentric system. Now from this generous with fresh ideas publication we learn another mind-bogling suggestion that all fundamental processes are reversible, or all processes in Nature stand in a relation of convertibility. And on reading the book one starts to believe that the principle of reversibility appears to be universal as the genetic code for all living things. Besides, on reading the book our everspecialized boffins and academics could eventually know why each physical effect has its inverse counterpart, chemical reactions are reversible, and basic biological processes turn the other way round. To prove his thesis, author created an extremely wide but precise theory of reality which reveals a single underlying mechanism of all natural, mental, and social processes and explains a challenging secret of nature - the causes of the cycling of matter and energy in it. From AI viewpoint, Abdoullaev's comprehensive and exact ontology may well serve as the fundamental knowledge framework for artificial systems with general intelligence, and it looks much superior in conceptual principle and practical application of extant immature and idisyncratic ontologies now hastely constructed for multifarious Web-based intelligent systems projects. Don't want to play a visionary and don't like bombastic stile, but the discovery of the universal law of revesibility is likely to come the most important contibution in the history of modern science and technology. Also the book is sure to become the number one intellectual event although it was not published by a prestigious publisher like the MIT Press preferring to feed us with cut and dried academic materials, as well as regardless of damning opinions of those one-star reviewers. Although, it is pity that the book missed their attention, then it could be distributed worldwide. But thank goodness, it's not lost in the sea of information noise. Let's not make the sad error with Aristarchus' discovery a sort of intellectual fault that is typical for human minds. Apart from this, we are already overloaded with many sorts of &quot;the idols of the mind&quot;.",

What is the most promising way to proceed in order to find the intellectual structure within which at least some central questions can be formulated and reduced to problem solving? This volume suggests one avenue. It places at the center of the investigation some simple tasks of memory and learning, and advocates that these tasks be investigated by means of detailed computational models.\"Here are some representative quotations from the book:\"The aspect of reasoning that we are particularly concerned with here is so called commensense reasoning. This is the process that humans use to cope with the mundane but complex aspects of the world in evaluating everyday situations. It is reasoning that is generally done subconsciously. It is perhaps precisely because we have no awareness of these processes that it has proved to difficult to simulate them in machines. No one has yet made a home cleaning robot that can execute its task with reasonable flexibility and commonsense.\" (Pg. 159)\"The major stumbling block at first seemed to be the philosophical problem raised by inductive learning, an aspect of cognition that seems impossible to evade.

                    "The only reason I am giving this book three stars is that no other serious publication I know of discusses behavior based robotics. However, that being said, this book uses a lot of pages and costs a lot of dollars to explain a rather simple concept. It is an elegant concept, and I do take my hat off to Mr. Arkin for getting to the heart of the matter clearly and with good illustrations. But is it a concept that requires almost 500 pages? I don't really think so. Simply put, behavior-based robotics does not use an internal model of its environment. For instance, there is no programming in the robot of what a chair looks like, or what kind of surface the robot is moving on - all the information is gleaned from the input of the robot's sensors. The robot uses that information to react to the changes in its environment as those changes occur. State machines are at the heart of the design of any behavior-based robot. For example, a foraging robot would probably have four states describing its behavior in response to its sensors: wandering and looking for food, picking up food, homing towards the nest, and avoiding obstacles.This book is a very easy read, although at times it seems repetitive. It does not really require any particular technical background in order to understand it, although to really appreciate the concept you should already be familiar with robotic design concepts.Some really good implementations of the concepts in this book are at a website authored by Craig Reynolds. To find it, type \"Steering behaviors for autonomous characters\" into Google, and it should be the first address listed. Mr. Reynolds' site has a paper on his extensions of behavior-based concepts, as well as some Java applets demonstrating his methods.",

                    "Artificial intelligence research goes back to the 1940s as do the first developments in electronic computers. Perlovsky traces the history of AI in a thoughtful and scholarly manner, emphasizing his philosophy and his own generalization of the theory which he calls Modeling Field Theory (MFT). He also traces the study of intelligence back to the Greek philosophers beginning with Plato and Aristotle some 2300 years ago.The book however, provides more than just a philosophy for artificial intelligence. It mixes in some very important mathematics from the disciplines of engineering, statistics and computer science. Mathematical techniques and models have been particularly useful in the solution to problems in classification, clustering, pattern recognition, rule-based expert system development, multiple-target tracking, orbit determination and Kalman filtering, and time series prediction.Perlovsky, over the course of his career, has had a great deal of involvement in the development of this research in both his consulting work and his work at Nichols Research Corporation. I know a lot about this because, in 1980 I began working at the Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo California as a MTS (statistician). I worked on statistical problems including Kalman filtering, image processing, image recognition, orbit determination, rule-based expert systems, multiple-target tracking and target discrimination. When I moved over to manage the tracking and discrimination algorithm development for the Air Force's Space Surveillance and Tracking System I became familar with the work being done for us by contractors that included Nichols Research Corporation (NRC). I became very familar with the work of Perlovsky and his colleagues at Nichols Research who supported us from the Newport Beach, Colorado Springs and Boston offices of the company on the multiple-target tracking algorithms and the target classification algorithms. I found the work to be so interesting and of such high quality that I joined NRC in 1988.Perlovsky sees artifical intelligence as a very practical discipline and believes that computing machines can do a good job of at least mimicking human intelligence through the use of a priori knowledge (as rules preprogrammed into the computer or a priori probability distributions) along with experience (collected data from observational or statistical designed studies) combined using algorithms (Bayes theorem, adaptive neural networks) based on the mathematical foundation of uncertainty incorporated through probability theory and/or fuzzy set theory.In my experience, I have found rule-based expert systems to be one of the major successful developments in the field of artificial intelligence. At the heart of these systems lies the tools of mathematics and statistics, including the discriminant or classification algorithms based on multivariate Gaussian models (linear and quadratic classifiers) and the nonparametric classification algorithms (kernel discriminant algorithms and classification tree algorithms). Also, patterns can be discovered by computers through the use of clustering algorithms based on Gaussian mixture models or nonparametric techniques like nearest neighbor rules.The Bayesian approach to statistical analysis has been useful in many areas including the Kalman filter. In Kalman filtering prior knowledge plus current data is used to update the estimate of the current state and for the prediction of the future state of a dynamic system using a simple recursive algorithm that is easily updated in the computer. Many of these developments are well characterized and developed from first principles in this text.Perlovsky emphasizes his own work including the MLANS system which is a neural network system that incorporates important statistical ideas such as maximum likelihood, the Cramer-Rao inequality and statistical efficiency along with the neural network architecture.Some of this work was developed by Perlovsky under an Army contract that was coincidentally managed by my brother Julian. I have always viewed this research as being successful because it applied appropriate statistical models to the real problems. I think the crucial aspects of this work are the appropriate use of the Bayesian paradigm and teh indentification of appropriate models for construction of the likelihood equations. The fundamental and well established tools of probability and statistics are the keys. In his proposals, Leonid also included ideas from fuzzy set theory and embedded his methods in an artificial neural network framework. I always thought that these modern theories (fuzzy set theory and neural networks) were gimmicks to get military funding. This may not have been a fair assessment on my part as a careful reading of this book indicates that Perlovsky honestly views these tools as important.There are subtleties to concepts such as fuzzy set theory. Although I do not yet see its value as a substitute for measure theoretic probability theory for characterizing human uncertainty, it is possible that I just haven't thought hard enough about it. Maybe a continued reading and rereading of Perlovsky's book will help me.This is a very interesting and unique book on artificial intelligence from a perspective that is quite different from what one find in the standard books written by computer scientists (who often do not have the deep understanding of probability and statistics that Perlovsky possesses).",
                    "Perlovsky has published a large number of papers exploring limitations associated with today's main approaches to AI. This book captures the essence of those papers with the addition of developing and expanding Perlovsky's philosophy of AI.Perlovsky takes the reader through the development of AI from its behaviouristic beginnings through Minsky's &quot;revolution&quot; of purely symbolic AI. He then goes through some more recent methods of combining both methods with some adaptive learning techniques. For all cases Perlovsky clearly demonstrates the inherent limitations of all methods through analytic means.He then presents his view on a possible way forward though adaptive networks employing fuzzy logic, illustrated with some examples such as work done on SAR image analysis. Throughout the book he provides many examples and certainly this will make an excellent advanced textbook for the field of AI.I am particularly impressed by his good overview and development of his philosophical views. After years of books by people like the Churchland's, Chalmers, Searle and Hofstadter this is finally a great example of someone who is not afraid to cut through the fluff and expose the real problem to further progress. This should be required reading for anyone looking into philosophy, in particular the philosophy of mind and science. The references are very valuable and Perlovsky and done an excellent job of listing many.That said, there are a few points I would suggest for the next edition of this book. First, I find it odd that Perlovsky seems unaware of Chaitin's work in algorithmic information theory, particularly his book &quot;The Limits of Mathematics&quot;. Considering Perlovsky's many references to Godel and Turing this is a glaring omission. Also, he is missing a reference to Wilson's excellent &quot;Spikes, Decisions, and Actions : The Dynamical Foundations of Neurosciences&quot;, possibly because it is also a very recent publication. These three books belong together!Perlovsky also needs to answer the issues posed by Susan Haack (&quot;Deviant Logic, Fuzzy Logic : Beyond the Formalism&quot;) regarding the viability of fuzzy logic and better-define the methods that are the &quot;correct&quot; interpretation when applied to neural networks. I would hope to see an expansion on this theme in the future.There are some irritating small problems, the most major being the spelling of &quot;Plank&quot; throughout the text; someone's spellcheck was acting up I guess...The index is a bit thin as well.An excellent book and, as stated in the other reveiw, &quot;must&quot; reading for anyone interested in the future of AI. Perlovsky, Chaitin, Prigogine, Wilson and James H. Austin (&quot;Zen and the Brain&quot;) are to be applauded for breaking with the current strangling hold of ancient thought.",
                    "The book is a fascinating review of concepts in philosophy, semiotics, and mathematics of intelligence; it is interesting for a wide audience, not just for mathematicians. The author relates mathematics and philosophy and finds detailed and specific connections, suggesting that the evolution of mathematics of intelligence during the last fifty years paralleled the evolution of philosophy of mind beginning from Plato. The author develops mathematical techniques for semiotics, which reconciles the differences among concepts in classical semiotics. He argues that *symbol* as understood in general culture is a process relating conscious and unconscious, and he proposes modifications in semiotic terminology needed to bring in correspondence varying usages of this term. A most intriguing is a chapter that connects the mathematics to Kantian theory; an ability for perceiving beauty, concludes the author, is associated with learning. A useful feature of the book is the proposed course outlines for mathematically prepared students and for non-mathematicians.",
                    "The book offers a fresh view of artificial intelligence (AI). Particularly interesting is the drawn analogy between longstanding philosophical questions and problems of modern AI. Even though the knowledge of modern statistical and math concepts is required to understand technical issues most of the ideas are explained on the intuitive level. The key technical problem discussed in this book is multiple model identification from overlapping data samples. The problem is related to computer-based vision, radar target tracking, financial market analysis, and speech recognition. The combinatorial explosion of computational complexity usually is associated with this class of problems and present the great challenge for modern computational science. The author reviews contemporary mathematical approaches, argues that the problem is related to differences between Plato and Aristotle about origin of human intelligence, and explores various approaches among works of famous philosophers in human history. Finally a non-combinatorial solution is offered through the introduction of novel Modeling Field Theory, that combines fuzzy logic with learning and adaptation. This book is a must read for people working with AI.",
                    "While this book is not mainstream and would not be a good place to try to begin to learn AI it is thought provoking and presents a number of new ideas. Where Rod Brooks seaks to eliminate internal models Perlovsky makes them a part of his definition of intelligence. I rather liked the philosophical slant of the book. Perlovsky expects to overcome complexity using fuzzy logic. Looked at from Allen Newell's multiple levels or bands perspective fuzzy logic is an extension of classical logic and in any real computer is implemented by a lower level (underlying level) of ordinary Boolean logic. It would seem to me that different granularities at each level would accomplish the same thing. Rules in first order logic can represent subsymbolic entities just as easily as they represent macroscopic objects and actions. Perlovsky presents an interesting MLANS architecture but gives rather less detail on a hierachical version. The computational complexity of these recurrent networks looks rather high to me. Perlovsky's book is a good challenge to those who have already studied some traditional AI and connectionist literature. He criticizes nearest neighbor (and CBR) systems but it seens to me that they offer some very fast parallel implementations such as Kanerva's distributed memory and Stanfill and Waltz's memory-based reasoning.",
                    "This is an important book, but it would be more useful if it didn't have so many errors in the equations. Chapter 5, for example, states that the rates are a part of the model, but the equations on pages 210-213 only define the rates, but never use them. Equation 5.2-11 should have det(Cbar) in the numerator. There are many more errors like these in just the MLANS description in Chapter 5."

It's so simple and obvious, each side maintains, only a fanatic could disagree. Deciding where the truth lies between these two extremes is the main purpose of John Haugeland's marvelously lucid and witty book on what artificial intelligence is all about. Although presented entirely in non-technical terms, it neither oversimplifies the science nor evades the fundamental philosophical issues. Far from ducking the really hard questions, it takes them on, one by one. Artificial intelligence, Haugeland notes, is based on a very good idea, which might well be right, and just as well might not. That idea, the idea that human thinking and machine computing are \"radically the same,\" provides the central theme for his illuminating and provocative book about this exciting new field. After a brief but revealing digression in intellectual history, Haugeland systematically tackles such basic questions as: What is a computer really? How can a physical object \"mean\" anything? What are the options for computational organization? and What structures have been proposed and tried as actual scientific models for intelligence? In a concluding chapter he takes up several outstanding problems and puzzles\u2014including intelligence in action, imagery, feelings and personality\u2014and their enigmatic prospects for solution.",

                    "Don't judge this book by its cover-or at least by its title. Haugeland's Artificial Intelligence: The Very Idea does not adequately serve as a general introduction to the conceptual underpinnings and philosophical background of the quest to create an artificial mind. Rather, it focuses on one specific approach to how natural and man-made thought works: \"thinking...essentially is rational manipulation of mental symbols.\" (p. 4) Haugeland plows forward with this as his core assumption, barely noting that some AI researchers see thought from a very different perspective (for example, the connectionists) and others find the whole enterprise fraught with theoretical difficulty (such as Dreyfus).So Haugeland's story is that of a particular theory of mind that held predominance for several decades (what the author himself dubs \"good, old-fashioned artificial intelligence\" or \"GOFAI\", p. 112) but is now gradually being superceded. His introduction to this story concludes with a description of the Turing test and a justification for its use, and a brief statement of the efficacy of describing a system in different-even contradictory-ways through different \"organizational levels\". (p. 9) Of all the ideas presented in the book, this last one has the greatest promise for applicability beyond GOFAI.Chapter 1, \"The Saga of the Modern Mind\", is a condensed bit of intellectual history. Haugeland introduces the philosophical children of the Copernican revolution-Hobbes, Descartes, and Hume-and the ways they grappled with understanding the world of the mental with the ideas that had proven so effective in the physical sciences. We soon encounter the \"paradox of mechanical reason\": if reason is the meaningful manipulation of symbols, and meanings are not physical entities, then how can machines manipulate them? (p. 39)Chapter 2 serves as an extended definition of \"Automatic Formal Systems\", that is, computers. This material is the most challenging in the text, but the important concepts (formal games, digital systems, medium independence, etc.), are well-described, except for finite playability. The students I tutored through this work found it impossible to determine just what point was being made, and so did I.How does one assign meanings-connections to the \"real\", outside world-to the symbols that a computer manipulates? This question is taken up in Chapter 3, \"Semantics\"-and answered, it seems, by sleight-of-hand. Haugeland gives to this the name \"the formalist's motto\": \"if you take care of the syntax, the semantics will take care of itself\". (p. 106) Neither I nor my students found this simple resolution at all satisfying. In every example of a formal game that the author presents, whatever semantic interpretation it has is provided from outside the system.Chapter 4, \"Computer Architecture\", charts the milestones of computing. It begins with the analytical engine, and lauds Babbage's single-handed invention of programming without noting, however, that a human mind does not resemble the tabula rasa of a computer's memory bank. Moving quickly to the twentieth century, we get insightful descriptions of Turing machines, von Neumann machines (which turn out to be the kind of computer we are accustomed to), the mind-bending tree-structured LISP machines, and Newell's pragmatic production machines.Chapter 5, \"Real Machines\", might be better titled \"Real Problems\". Haugeland presents some of the brick walls that AI research has run into. These can be grouped into the phenomenon of the combinatorial explosion: in order to interact with the real world in a manner that demonstrates \"common sense\", an AI must have access to an impossibly large store of information (while accessing what it needs in due time), and be able to consider an equally impossibly large set of potential courses of action. (p. 178) Methods to restrict what the AI has to consider, such as the focus on \"micro-worlds\", result in a system with no sense. Haugeland acknowledges these problems, and offers nothing but hope in scientific and technological progress to answer them.Chapter 6, \"Real People\", develops means by which the sense that humans exhibit, and machines are far from realizing. Dennett's intentional stances and Grice's conversational implicatures are intelligent-if partial-characterizations of perspicuous reasoning. They are, however, frustratingly slippery for computer programmers, so it's not surprising that Haugeland, with some exasperation, groups them together under the \"nonasininity canon\": \"An enduring system makes sense to the extent that, as understood, it isn't making [a rear] of itself.\" (p. 219) I feel that, if a reader has followed the author this far, then he or she deserves better than this.Yet Haugeland and his colleagues are bound to feel frustration. Computers are electromechanical in nature, while humans are neurochemical. Computers can engage in numerical calculation with speed and precision, while most people find mathematics to be their most difficult school subject. Computers are tools that we devised to assist us. Human behavior was forged in the four-billion cauldron of evolution, and psychologists have barely begun to sort out the seething stew of vestigial loves, hates, and motivations that shape our behavior. And honest cognitive science will admit that humans and supercomputers are each masters of two separate, very different worlds. At the end, Haugeland finally admits this possibility-without contemplating the alternatives to the computation theory of might that this possibility demands.",
                    "The state of play in artificial intelligence has changed considerably since this book was written in the mid-80's, but that doesn't mean that this book has become outdated. Far from it. The subsequent changes in artificial intelligence have merely served to highlight the fact that the value of this book is not in its discussion of 80's technology. The value of this book is that it articulates, motivates, and then critiques an idea at the core of philosophical thinking about mindedness over the past 400 years: namely, the idea that cognition consists in the manipulation of inner representations. Although Haugeland himself went on to offer a radically different account of mindedness, according to which minds are essentially embodied and embedded, the value of this book does not derive from its articulation of an original view. Rather, the value of it derives from the rigor with which Haugeland motivates the attractions of a philosophical view that he himself does not accept.Buy this book if you want to understand the underlying philosophical motivations for the widespread view that thoughts are inner representations. Buy Haugeland's collection of essays, entitled \"Having Thought\", if you want to engage with Haugeland's own alternative view of the mind.",

The Handbook of Research on Artificial Intelligence Applications in the Aviation and Aerospace Industries is a pivotal reference source that explores best practices for AI implementation in aviation to enhance security and the ability to learn, improve, and predict. While highlighting topics such as computer-aided design, automated systems, and human factors, this publication explores the enhancement of global aviation security as well as the methods of modern information systems in the aeronautics industry. This book is ideally designed for pilots, scientists, engineers, aviation operators, air crash investigators, teachers, academicians, researchers, and students seeking current research on the application of AI in the field of aviation.",

                    "This book is interesting in that it attempts to cast questions of the scientific method into the language and concepts of artificial intelligence (AI), instead of in terms of philosophy, as is usually done. The two main camps of philosophy of science, namely inductivism, represented by Sir Francis Bacon, and that of falsificationism, represented by Sir Karl Popper are both discussed in the context of AI. Two examples, one dealing with the discovery of the laws of planetary motion due to Johannes Kepler, and the discovery of sulphonamide drugs, are chosen to illustrate the author's ideas. The author asserts that these examples do not entirely agree with either Bacon or Popper. Kepler used an \"intuitive induction\" which involved human insight and creativity, which is quite different from the \"mechanical induction\" of Bacon. The discovery of sulphonamide drugs was a more \"mechanized\" process, but the author believes it was more of a \"mechanical falsification\" rather than Baconian induction. In addition, this discovery, he asserts, has introduced the concept of heuristics, which of course is ubiquitous in artificial intelligence.The author is certainly correct in his belief that Baconian induction, as outlined in the Novum Organum of 1620, has been applied only sparingly in the development of science. He believes that this is changing though thanks to the advent of machine intelligence. Indeed, the existence of machines able to recommend and design experiments, analyze the data from these experiments, and then formulate hypotheses to explain the data was reported just weeks ago in a major scientific journal. These machines were based on inductive logic programming in the guise of a language called PROGOL, which performs relational learning and was just getting started as this book went to press. The author does discuss relational learning in this book, and details algorithms for machine learning that are based on inductive rules of inference and background knowledge and data in these rules. He also discusses the role of testing and falsification in the actual process of using inductive rules of inference in order to produce the final result.The specific machine learning algorithms that the author does discuss are ID3 and GOLEM, with ID3 being a \"top-down\" and attribute-based learning algorithm, and GOLEM a \"bottom-up\" and relational learning algorithm. ID3 makes use of rules that take the from of decision trees, begins with simple and general rules, and these are then modified or refuted to produce more specific generalizations. The author discusses the role that these programs have in negating the Popperian assertion that induction \"is a myth\". Even more interesting is the author's belief that these programs in fact illustrate the \"mechanical\" principles of induction that Bacon laid down in 1620. In fact, he states that he has been unable to find an example of the use of Baconian \"mechanical\" induction in the history of science before the advent of these languages.Naturally logic programming and its main example PROLOG will arise in any discussion of machine intelligence, and it does so here. PROLOG as a language based on nonmonotonic logic is discussed in detail along with the \"closed world assumption\", this being done in order to construct a \"new framework for logic\". This framework involves viewing logic as made up not only of inferences but also a \"control component\", the latter of which follows either its own autonomous control decisions, or those provided by the programmer. PROLOG is viewed as a language that introduces control into deductive logic, and its development an example of a process that replaced \"craft skill by mechanization\". Generation (and checking) of proofs in mathematics is given as an example of this craft skill, having been done to date by trained mathematicians who have the `craft skills' to carry this out. PROLOG is able to construct proofs via its control mechanism and has both a declarative and procedural interpretation. The author shows in what sense PROLOG can lead to what he calls a `new framework for logic', and consequently as evidence that logic is really empirical, and not `a priori' as is typically assumed. The empiricism of logic was argued in another context, namely that of quantum mechanics, but the author believes that `quantum logic' has failed to support the empiricism of logic. PROLOG, he asserts, is a better example of the empirical nature of logic.The author also addresses the possibility of constructing a detailed example of inductive logic, which he believes was not done in traditional circles of logic, these being concerned mostly with deductive inference. After discussing the history of the divergence between the schools of deductive and inductive logic, he expands further on his paradigm of logic as being `inference + control' in showing how ideas from conformation theory can be used as a control mechanism in deductive logic. To illustrate just how this could be done, the author draws on the work of J. Cussens, A. Hunter, and A. Srinivasan in a class of nonmonotonic logics called `prioritized' logics. These authors show that a prioritized logic will allow the inference of formulas that are `most preferred\", with preferences being accomplished relative to some preference criterion. The author shows how to use relative-frequencies to estimate conformation values. What is most interesting about the work of these three authors, and the author points this out emphatically, is that it may permit the differentiating of one system of logic from another using experimental criteria in the context of a particular application. The author discusses how these authors were able to carry out the empirical testing of different systems of logic using the GOLEM programming language. An explicit example in bioinformatics is discussed, and the author concludes from this example that the choice of logic will depend on the interests of a particular user. Empirical evidence can thus decide on the logic used in a domain, and this choice may also depend on the requirements of the user.I did not read the last chapter of the book, so its review will be omitted."

Also, like many strong players, there was no thought given to showing why a final position was balanced or may be good for black or for white. Still, a good book overall."

                    "During the 1980s, there were two main approaches to the computational study of human intelligence. The first, and largest, was the symbolic approach, derived from the work of Church and Turing, and later championed by two giants in the field, Simon and Newell. These researchers formulated the Physical Symbol System Hypothesis, according to which all of human intelligence can be expressed as a process of search in a symbolic state space transformed through the use of equally discrete operators.The other camp, mostly hiding in the shadows for much of this time, derived from control theory and the servomechanisms of WWII. They held that the human brain was not a discrete symbol-processing entity but rather something constantly in direct contact with a continuous world. Although this group found its closest computational champions in Rosenblatt and Rumelhart, it paled in comparison to the promises and research invested early on in the symbolic approach.Agre's book, Computation and Human Experience, was written as a call to arms for researchers in the symbolic tradition, a challenge to critically re-evaluate their own ideas and methods. In contrast to the \"mentalist\" juggernaut, Agre proposes an interactionist view of cognition, and shows how such an approach can be reconciled with the technical practice of constructing computational models. The book achieves a rare balance of philosophical argument with computational theory, though in both sides experts will be able to find holes in Agre's arguments.However, the biggest problem with this book is its relevance to the current state of affairs. Much of this work is based on the research that went into Agre's doctoral dissertation (completed in 1988), and in the 2 decades that have passed the situation in cognitive science has improved dramatically. Embodied cognition is not a dark art but an accepted and thriving practice, deictic representation is more commonplace, and even \"rule-based\" production system architectures like Anderson's ACT-R have found the representations and techniques necessary to interact with a dynamic and continuous world.Whether or not Agre's book has contributed to the current and improving state of affairs is a matter for speculation (my feeling is that it has), but it is most important that no reader today mistake this book's perspective (\"situated\" in the mid-1980s) as representative of the current status of cognitive science."

                    "Messer Frost and Morris delineate the key elements of \"quality\" intelligence. Quality requires prioritizing within each segment of the intelligence cycle-planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, and dissemination- balancing judgment in decisions using improvisation, freshness, and often quite original re-conceptualizations of the problem to find answers that are relevant to broadly understood issues. The intelligence product needs to integrate meaningful information, adding value from diverse sources, including knowledge of people, technology, culture, and current political/military strategies. Rather than using tried and true solutions, simplistic maximizations, or well-honed and comfortable decision rules, intelligence professionals need to employ creative and adaptive methods of collection and analysis suited to the unique features of the problem.Realizing there may be no 100% guaranteed right answer, or in most cases, even an answer that will endure, the intelligence community must seek to integrate a variety of scenarios (game theory) with their particular goals and strategies. Therefore, outstanding intelligence will be highly creative in identifying significant patterns from diffuse, tangled data and information. As has been recently determined, the benefit of intelligence lies in problem finding as opposed to problem solving, whereby problem finding depends upon uncovering trends, patterns, and interrelationships when they are not readily apparent and/or intentionally hidden from others.Therefore, the sub-elements of `Quality' are:Timeliness. The intelligence product must reach the consumer at the time of itsgreatest inherent usefulness. Within every level of consumption-strategic, operational, and tactical-there lies a unique and temporary combination of circumstances. A decision and subsequent action that is delayed is often rendered ineffective because the circumstances have changed.Accuracy. The merit of intelligence is dependent on the same principals as anyother academic, scientific, or professional endeavor, i.e. reliability and validity. The conclusion, in terms of precision or probability for recommended policy must have a high propensity for replication with the same results if reexamined. The primary criteria in evaluating either a document or oral testimony is the degree of reliability of the source, from which the information was obtained. Additionally, the information must address the actual subject at hand-validity. In other words, are we examining that which we intended to examine, as opposed to irrelevant phenomena? The intelligence industry utilizes the Modified Admiralty System to grade information in response to these issues.Relevance. The desirability of intelligence products today emanate from a wealthof fluid complexities and the analyst's ability to discern fact from assumption and then give it meaning. Within the context of low intensity conflict-transnational in scope, insurgent in nature, and asymmetrical in form-many quantitative and qualitative evaluations of certain aspects of the enemy's behavior, which appear to be numerically precise, are in fact number games that add up to precisely nothing. No statistical index or quantitative variable can properly be attached to some essential attributes of the enemy, e.g. surprise, deception, and mobility. Therefore, new means of measuring the relevance of the evidence must be explored.This is a MUST read for any student or professional with interest in law enforcement intelligence."

The world has changed since then. Today it is clear that \"good old-fashioned AI,\" based on the idea of using symbolic representations to produce general intelligence, is in decline (although several believers still pursue its pot of gold), and the focus of the Al community has shifted to more complex models of the mind. It has also become more common for AI researchers to seek out and study philosophy. For this edition of his now classic book, Dreyfus has added a lengthy new introduction outlining these changes and assessing the paradigms of connectionism and neural networks that have transformed the field. At a time when researchers were proposing grand plans for general problem solvers and automatic translation machines, Dreyfus predicted that they would fail because their conception of mental functioning was naive, and he suggested that they would do well to acquaint themselves with modern philosophical approaches to human beings. What Computers Can't Do was widely attacked but quietly studied. Dreyfus's arguments are still provocative and focus our attention once again on what it is that makes human beings unique.",

                    "Mr. Shallit compares the critique of cognitive science by Professor Dreyfus to 'creation science'. He remarks that Dreyfus is not a computer scientist. This is true. But many 'cognitive scientists' aren't either, cognitive science being an interdisciplinary pursuit engaging philosophers, psychologists, linguists, neuroscientists, anthropologists and sociologists. It is unfortunate that Dreyfus allowed himself to polemicize by using the word 'alchemy' to characterize his opponents, but he has, by far, been the victim of unargued diatribes against his work. The fact is: most of the salient issues in cognitive science are logical and conceptual, NOT technological. Here, Dreyfus broke new ground (although I would have preferred his treatment to have been more Wittgensteinian than Heideggerian). Phil Agre's brilliant book on computation and human experience (Agre IS a computer scientist) shows that SOME AI-workers have found aspects of Dreyfus's work very telling. But, of course, the issues are, again, not empirical but logical in this field. See, for example, Graham Button et al., &quot;Computers, Minds and Conduct&quot; (Polity/Blackwell, 1995) which picks up where Dreyfus left off. Shallit remarks that Dreyfus has been 'refuted': where? by whom?The fact is that cognitivism is hotly contested by serious thinkers in many disciplines, but Shallit's name-calling (and the comparison of cognitivism's serious critics to creation scientists) smacks of an abdication from serious engagement and argument.Dreyfus's revised edition is a fine piece of work, worthy of serious intellectual discussion and confrontation. His many aarguments against Fodor, Chomsky, Simon and others have great merit. It is unfortunate that some folks simply close their eyes and argue from authority. But appeals to (even 'scientific') authority wear thin when left to stand alone!!",
                    "This is an absolute classic that everyone interested in or working in AI should have read. It is one of the very view books on a computer related subject that is over 25 years old and still useful today. That alone might tell you something. I find it interesting that many AI-workers seem to be actually afraid of this book. They should not. It may give the reader a far better sense on limits, use and future of AI work.I would also recommend this book to people outside the AI world and who are interested in what role the digital computer may play in our lives. But the book is not about bits, so if you don't like technical mumbo-jumbo, this is still a book for you.The book is very well written. Some readers may find it a difficult book, as it also contains some philosophical issues. But some readers may find themselves in a bookstore asking for the work of Wittgenstein or Heidegger and actually understanding what they read (and like what they read) after having read this book.I have only one complaint. The introduction to the 1992 MIT Press edition is in fact an afterword. It assumes that you already are familiar with the history of the subject. So, if you read this book, you should start with the Introduction to the 1979 edition instead and keep the Introduction to the MIT Press edition definitely for last",
                    "It goes without saying that this book remains a landmark in the history of AI research: a sobering antidote to all the research hype.But what a patchwork it has become. Every ten years, the book has a new section and a new introduction bolted on to it. But not just bolted on to the end, or on to the beginning.No reader is given an easy path through the text: neither the reader who is new to the material (and who wants to read through the text in chronological order), nor the reader who has read the previous incarnation of the book (and who wants to pick up just the new parts).The message of the book, too, is unfortunately weakened by its subjective stance, and its invocation of the personalities from the debate.However, the book still remains a refreshingly different contribution to the world of AI research, an important warning, and a greatly worthwhile read.",
                    "I first read Dreyfus' critique of AI back in the 1970s, when I was an undergrad studying computer science. At the time, I rejected Dreyfus arguments, believing, as did most AI researchers, that all we needed to do to create a true artificial intelligence was a fast enough computers and enough information about objects, symbols, and representations. From that, intelligence would arise from the \"emergent properties\" of the system.A few years later I was a grad student in cognitive psychology, and thanks to my cognitive studies and a careful reading of Wittgenstein's writing on language, my opinion of both Dreyfus and GOFAI (good old fashioned AI) had changed radically. Meaning is not just labels and symbols. As Wittgenstein observed, meaning can only arise from a shared experience, something that a machine and a human cannot have- at least given our current level of hardware.The AI community has since come around (largely) to accept most of Dreyfus' critique, while never actually acknowledging his role in shaping the aims of AI, so the AI or cognitive sciences student reading Dreyfus today may wonder what much of the debate is about. But this is a book that all AI and cognitive science students about read, both to understand how the AI paradigm changed between the 1970s and the present, and to get a better idea of the philosophical issues that Dreyfus raised that still are salient today.",
                    "I would love to see a working \"HAL\", and still hope we progress in the development in AI. However, the discovery of a General Problem Solver has always been elusive, and never matched the corresponding development for the raw physical abilities our computers now have. Why is that? And why is this still true?Mr. Dreyfuss attempts to answer this with a refreshing accountability of the scientific method. He compares the historical development of AI to the theoretical expectations, and apparently not without resistance. He manages to challenge the \"salesmanship\" of following trends, and thus avoiding assumed results.The book provides many examples of its logic, and carefully draws the conclusions. When I first read it I was tremendously impressed with its (if I may) \"insights\". I feel it is a must read; not just for those in the AI world, but for those interested in the scientific method as well.",
                    "Dreyfus' book is about the history of failure of Artificial Intelligence researchers such as Marvin Minsky to embody intelligence at the human level. It is easy to read, but is rather exasperating. It is like riding in a truck driven by Minsky, and other AI researchers, where they are trying to make a long trek across a country without roads. They keep getting caught in swamps, blowing tires, and hitting trees, all the time shouting &quot;We're almost there!&quot; Meanwhile Dreyfus is a dog in the bed of the truck continually barking at dangers, and the folly of the drivers. Amidst Dreyfus' continuous cacophony of sarcastic cynicism there are some important points on what assumptions are doomed to failure, which he made quite clear by tedious repetition.Basically there are two types of mistakes made by Minsky and many others:1. believing they were getting close to understanding human thought,2. repeatedly announcing same to the world.The philosophy of Dreyfus in the first 300 pages is largely concerned with fallacious assumptions made by AI researchers. Finally in the last 50 pages (350 page book) he settles down and gives us some interesting concepts that should be understood if we are to seek AI at the human level. He develops the concept of &quot;nonformal behavior&quot; - which we humans usually learn by generalizing examples and following intuition without use of formal rules. Examples: chess at the gestalt master level, and disambiguation of broken sentences.Dreyfus acknowledges the possible importance of neural network architectures, but dismisses them as outside the scope of his critique. He touches on the poor idea of AI trying to program a full functioning adult, and further carries out a critique of machine learning (&quot;reinforcement learning&quot;).The most important point he makes is that of nonformal behavior -- the non-logical almost Zen-like process that humans must go through. The irony is that we have to struggle with our nonformal thinking to do simple formal tasks such as long division; whereas the computer must struggle with its built-in hard logic to attempt nonformal tasks such as pattern recognition.The book is for the most part quite dated, but nevertheless, it is very worthwhile reading for anyone in a serious pursuit of machine intelligence. My criticism of his style is just that. I have only a minor criticism of the intelligent content and his restrictions in scope.",
                    "Berkeley Professor Hubert Dreyfus assesses the predictions and subsequent failures of artificial intelligence from its inception in the 1960's with innovators like Turing to the present day with a detailed and honest account of why higher level AI is impossible. After evaluating the history of AI's minuscule progress, Dreyfus provides a compelling analysis of human intelligence, drawing on the philosophies of Heidegger, Wittgenstein, and Merleau-Ponty in order to demonstrate that higher level cognitive faculties are not reducible to computational representations. This book is an important reversal of commonly accepted assumptions within the cognitive sciences, from linguistics to psychology. It is also an important example of why the cognitive sciences would benefit from paying greater attention to the achievements of contemporary European philosophy.",
                    "Mr. Shallit, in a previous review, sounds exactly like a throwback to the previous era when glorified computer technicians started to take themselves seriously and bestowed upon themselves the bogus title of \"computer scientists\". When Dreyfus critique of strong AI came out they were enraged that someone was trying to punch the air (and as it turned out it was full of hot air) out of their over inflated clown balloon. After decades of sheer nonsense, and of confusing metaphor with the real thing (their preposterous proposition of the \"complexity critical mass\" for intelligence is akin to thinking that a sufficiently complex computer simulation of an atomic explosion will actually explode: I guess we should all be really worried...) strong AI proponents just gave up. Now they are much quiet and many have given Dreyfus some concessions after being proven completely wrong (old habits die slowly). No serious GCT (Glorified Computer Technician) of today would profess faith in strong AI.",
                    "Scientists have formulated at least 100 definitions of what intelligence is. (for a partial listing see www.vetta.org/definitions-of-intelligence/)Several computer programs exist which qualify as intelligent according to at least the vast majority of these definitions. (for instance my Asa, Trans. of the Kansas Acad. of Sci., vol. 109, # 3/4, pg 159, 2006,www.bioone.org/archive/0022-8443/109/3/pdf/i0022-8443-109-3-159.pdf) Not all creatures are equally intelligent so there is no need for an AI to be as intelligent as the average human. In point of fact, however, AIs exist which outperform humans at a number of important tasks.",
                    "Creation science is to evolution what this book is to artificial intelligence.Creation \"scientists\" often have no credentials in the field they attack; similarly, Dreyfus is a philosopher, not a computer scientist.Creation \"scientists\" often use inflated rhetoric and impute dishonesty to their opponents; similarly, Dreyfus has likened AI to alchemy and made scandalous allegations against AI researchers such as Simon.Creation \"scientists\" only attack evolution; they do not provide any scientific alternative; similarly, Dreyfus only attacks strong AI and does not offer any alternative line of research.The criticisms of creation \"scientists\" are based on religion; Dreyfus bases his critique on philosophy. Neither critique has any scientific foundation.Creation \"scientists\" continue to advance objections that have been decisively refuted, such as arguments based on the Second Law of Thermodynamics or the bogus Paluxy River tracks. Bogus claims are rarely retracted. Similarly, Dreyfus has rarely acknowledged that many of his previous claims have been refuted.Finally, creation \"scientists\" have had essentially no impact on evolutionary biology, but great impact among the lay public. Similarly, Dreyfus' book is popular among non-scientists, but has had very little impact among people who actually do AI...."

I do not agree. Newell studied how people reasoned,Boole was building a logic of how people think, and Rosenblatthad real neural nets in mind. It is also inaccurate to callgofai a failure. Sure there are lots of things that peoplecan do that computers can't. But there is also a long andgrowing list of what computers can do and people can not. AIsare good a modus tollens, humans are not. AIs are good atlong chains of reasoning and with negated terms, humans are not.Computers can handle spaces having many dimensions, humans findit hard to handle 3. Computers are good at probability andmath, people are not. And the list goes on and on.Freedman's &quot;nature AI&quot; does not exist as a real AI subfield.He has simply grouped together a number of new ideas, some good,some bad.

                    "Bio-inspired computing has taken the world by storm in the last few decades, going by the names of neural networks, genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming, and swarm intelligence. Another one has arisen has appeared in the last 15 years or so, is inspired by the biology of the immune system, and is the subject of this book. The authors of the book are aware that the approach is novel, but do a good job of presenting the field to newcomers (like myself), who want to know what it is all about and if it indeed has useful applications. They discuss their own work in the area and that of others, and extensive references are given for further reading.After a short introduction to the subject in chapter 1, the authors move on to a description of the biological immune system in chapter 2. They stress the need for understanding the mechanisms that regulate the adaptive immune response, so as to be able to control the transformation of an immune response from an &quot;aggressive&quot; to a &quot;benign&quot; state. The authors explain the difference between the &quot;innate&quot; immune system and the &quot;adaptive&quot; immune system. As the name implies, the adaptive immune response is a kind of &quot;learning&quot; ability that allows the immune system to improve itself as antigens are encountered. The innate immune response though remains constant along the lifetime of the organism. A short description of the T-cells and B-cells is given, some of which can differentiate into &quot;memory cells&quot; that remain circulating in the body and protect against a given antigen. Particularly interesting is the role of &quot;pattern recognition receptors&quot; that recognize molecular patterns associated with pathogens. The clonal selection theory of the adaptive immune system, along with the somewhat controversial immune network theory.Chapter 3 is an overview of how to to actually create an artificial immune system (AIS). The emphasize that anything deemed controversial in the biological framework need not be when viewed from a computational perspective, such as the immune network theory. Biology is used for the inspiration of the computational models, and as such they need not reflect entirely what is true in the biological case. They also emphasize that the various attempts to simulate the immune system on computers are not examples of an AIS. Also, an AIS is more than just a pattern recognition algorithm, even though it must employ this in its use. To give a framework for an AIS, the authors employ a model of immune cells and molecules called a &quot;shape-space&quot;. In this shape space one models the affinity of the &quot;molecules&quot; via a metric, which the authors eventually choose to be the Hamming metric. They then give an overview of various algorithms for modeling the immune system, such as bone marrow, thymus, and immune network models, in addition to clonal selection algorithms. For those readers familiar with dynamical systems, the immune network models are very interesting, due to the use of differential equations, and also the fact that such in immune network models the immune system is performing even in the absence of external stimuli.Chapter 4 gives a survey of artificial immune systems, such as spectra recognition for chemical reactions, infectious disease surveillance, analysis of medical data, and computational security. The latter was of particular importance to me, so I read the discussion and the references with more attention than other parts of the book. The issue with the approaches for network intrusion detection and virus detection lie mostly in the performance of the network. Agents that are cleverly designed may form a very accurate way of detecting this malicious behavior, but their deployment on a network may degrade the its performance considerably.I did not read chapters 5 and 6 so I will omit their review.In chapter 7, the authors discuss various case studies in artificial immune systems that shed more light on the examples of Chapter 4. The computer network security application is discussed again, and a low number of false positives is shown to follow after the artificial immune system is simulated. However, the performance of the network is not pointed out by the authors. The authors also give more details on the application of artificial immune systems to data analysis and optimization. The discussion is interesting, but it is still an open question as to whether this approach is indeed better than other ones in optimization theory, i.e. how does the immune approach compare with the &quot;free-lunch&quot; theorems so often quoted in optimization theory? The authors do make a brief comparison of their optimization algorithm with evolution strategies, and this is somewhat helpful to those who are familiar with the latter.The last chapter of the book looks to future applications of artificial immune systems, and in its connection with learning paradigms in artificial intelligence. The authors are open-minded about the future of AIS but also subject it to critical analysis.The book motivated me to investigate the use of AIS more fully, and to begin thinking about possible applications, such as 1. Event correlation in networks. 2. Network routing: Routes that are inefficient are viewed as &quot;antigens&quot;, and the network immune system will then cure the system of these routes, meaning that it will remember them as being antigens up to some practical time scale. The routing scheme in place will not implement these routes within this time frame. 3. The TCP/IP protocol in the context of the immune network theory where reliable connections are based on the epitope/paratope recognition capability. Any emergent properties of the network overlaid with the TCP/IP protocol such as learning, memory, and self-tolerance could be studied by viewing the packet network as an immune network. 4. Network QoS, with packets marked as low priority viewed as temporary antigens. 5. Using the function optimization capabilities of AIS do calculate the effective bandwidth of ATM networks. 6. Data analysis, particularly in the construction of algorithms to distinguish chaos from noise.",
                    "The book in general provides meaningful information about the topic. It give you a good start to design your own AIS based system. I recommend it for grad students in computer science.",
                    "I recently started my Thesis on Artificial Immune Systems, and this was the first place I looked. This book gave me the foundation that I needed to start my own AIS. I was a little disappointed with the fact that the book is outdated, and a lot of the sources that the authors use are no longer available, but if you know how search for people on the Internet then it isn't a problem.The first couple of chapters go through the history and the functionality of the vertebrate immune system. This is obviously important when it comes to creating your own AIS. However, if you already did your research on the immune system then it is possible to just skip these chapters. The next couple chapters explain how it is possible to convert biological functions to computer code. The book does bring up a lot of immune-inspired algorithms to the table, and it explains how they work. Some more chapters explain some examples of how one could use an AIS. For example, there are some explanations on how an AIS can be used for an intrusion detection system or optimization. There are many more, but I won't list them here. The later chapters didn't really pertain to me, so I didn't read them thoroughly. The chapters bring up the future of AIS and it's possibilities. Overall, I would highly reccommend this book to anyone who is interested in either AIS in general, or if you are starting out a project pertaining to an AIS.Some things to think about when buying this book:Yes, this book is the perfect place to start if you know nothing about AIS.Yes, this book does offer some pseudocode algorithms, and they do help.Not every chapter of this book is necessary to read.Yes this book goes over immune system algorithms.No, this book will not code your immune system if that is what you are thinking."

                    "This book gives a reasonable, detailed and seriuous account on expert system. A detailed presentation of the CLIPS expert-system language, along with the interpreter, is provided.Excellent for starting work on expert systems as part of integrated software packages.",
                    "Gary Riley was, for a long time, a NASA employee whose sole assignment seemed to be to work out the C implementation of the OPS language from LISP to C so that the military could use it. LISP, even the Symbolics LISP machine, was far too slow for practical applications. Dr. Girratano worked with Gary to produce a book that could be used as a text book in classes taught at the University of Houston and could be attended by the NASA personnel. All hand-in-glove situation that worked out quite well.But, The Book! I have used it to teach many of my classes on AI. The first five or six chapters can be applied to ANY rulebased system. The first two chapters can be read by any person who wants to understand more about AI. True enough, most of the vendors today have directed their efforts to Java, but the speed of CLIPS is now (since about 20008) one of the fastest in the world. The power of CLIPS is unparalleled in terms of subroutines and extensions that have been implemented over the past 20 years by NASA and others.The CLIPS language is free. The book is extremely inexpensive for a course in AI. My advice is to read it, devour it, consume it and understand it. Unfortunately, after that you won't be able to talk with your companions about AI since they will know very little except If-THEN-ELSE is part of a rulebased system. If you can find a university that teaches this book, TAKE THE COURSE!! If not, read it on your on your own and join a local rulebase group to help you grow. Above all, have fun.SDGjco",
                    "Just want to learn CLIPS: skip the intro. Just want a first introduction to expert systems: try a different book. Personally I liked:Introduction to Expert Systems (3rd Edition). You know expert systems and want more reading food: Go for this one. It contains endless material and references.\"Expert Systems\" is a great tutorial of the C based open source expert system shell CLIPS. It even contains patterns of usage. This part alone is worth the read of this rather expensive book. Also some nice examples of expert systems are programmed in a very instructive way. I liked the implementation of a system with certainty factors (MYCIN style) and the developer implementation of backward chaining in CLIPS (an only forward chaining shell).The first half of the book is a very thorough overview of expert systems. For each introduced concept the book names nearly all known terms to describe this very concept. For an introduction it is extremely important to name only the most common term and then after some time maybe one or the other more.Reasoning and reasoning with uncertainty is well covered. Each chapter has ample references. Here again a little more orientation would have been very helpful.The book itself is nicely bound and printed. It is a pleasure to look at and a little heavy to hold for a long time.I fully recommend the CLIPS part and I do recommend the general expert systems part as a second or better third book on this topic.",
                    "This is a good book to have on one's library for a beginner in the Expert Systems realm.Note that actual working, production expert systems may be a good bit more difficult than can be covered in a book like this.Dr Giarratano is (was?) a great professor at University of Houston--Clear Lake. Mr. Riley was an employ of NASA/JSC when they produced this book together based partly on work done at JSC to create the CLIPS rule-based programming language. It has apparently evolved a little over time.CLIPS is fairly interesting. But I have never used it in a production setting.The current listed price of this book seems WAY HIGH. ($203.16)",

Weaving together fundamental aspects of computer science, statistical physics and machine learning, the book provides sufficient mathematics and physics background to make the subject intelligible to researchers in AI and other computer science communities. Open research issues are also discussed, suggesting promising directions for future research.",

The idea of America losing technology, and magic returning to earth is brilliant. This is no generic hack and slash novel, and it isn't some boring philosophical treatise, either. The characters are real, and have both strengths and flaws. They get in fights, yet have to rely on each other for survival. There's plenty of action, but there's actual substance between the battles. Oh yeah, one more thing, the magic ROCKS. If you like Weis and Hickman, McCaffrey or Jordan, this book's for you.",

                "description": "This book focuses on the belief-desire-intention (BDI) model of rational agents, which recognizes the primacy of beliefs, desires, and intentions in rational action. One goal of modern computer science is to engineer computer programs that can act as autonomous, rational agents; software that can independently make good decisions about what actions to perform on our behalf and execute those actions. Applications range from small programs that intelligently search the Web buying and selling goods via electronic commerce, to autonomous space probes. This book focuses on the belief-desire-intention (BDI) model of rational agents, which recognizes the primacy of beliefs, desires, and intentions in rational action. The BDI model has three distinct strengths: an underlying philosophy based on practical reasoning in humans, a software architecture that is implementable in real systems, and a family of logics that support a formal theory of rational agency.The book introduces a BDI logic called LORA (Logic of Rational Agents). In addition to the BDI component, LORA contains a temporal component, which allows one to represent the dynamics of how agents and their environments change over time, and an action component, which allows one to represent the actions that agents perform and the effects of the actions. The book shows how LORA can be used to capture many components of a theory of rational agency, including such notions as communication and cooperation.",

Wooldridge brings the reader from an extremely non-threatening, non-technical treatment of the basics to formal modeling of individual agent properties and multi-agent interaction using (essentially) constructions of formal logic.This book is clearly intended to communicate a particular theory in a very effective manner. However, it does not (nor does it pretend to) provide a path to implementing any of the theory, so dilettantes beware."
