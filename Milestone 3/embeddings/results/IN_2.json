This book may feel cursory but it covers a large array of material. For those who are constantly suspicious about facing discrimination in the workplace, it may be especially enlightening. Though I gave my copy to a friend not involved in the law, I do worry about it being misused by laypeople. For example, you could be blatantly discriminated against, and this book may point to cases that reflect your own situation. However, if you missed a statute of limitations or your employer doesn't have a sizeable number of workers, etc., your case may be a loser. Still, filing with local anti-discrimination office is supposed to be free and of no prejudice to the worker. Since this summarizes the everyday law, it is not a cute, easy read. But it is useful.",

                    "This book reveals shocking statistics about Black males in Detroit and speaks of a Afrocentric school environment that can help them. It even seems like the first years have rendered positive results. What was most profound to me was that these educators were saying, \"You can't wait until their teen years to ask how we can improve these males' academic performance. You must start almost from day one.\" I would much rather folk try something to address a problem than nothing. However, I think this book might not be as true as it was during its publication a decade ago.The authors say, \"This type of school is in court, but so far we've won cases.\" I'm no lawyer, but I think those courts decided that male-focused schools like these are illegal as gender discrimination. This book doesn't say, but the problems that these males face is not due to females in the classroom. Yes, it's sad that some young Black males only get hired by drug-dealers, and not legitimate employees. However, their female classmates didn't cause that. I recently read a book about female-only schools published this decade and it said, \"Male-only schools [like Malcolm X Academy] have been deemed illegal, so can it's opposite still stand?\"I attended Berkeley during the years when California killed affirmative action in its schools. More professors and student groups tried to mentor youngsters hoping they would be Berkeley-qualified in the future. However, I don't know if those efforts have lasted to today. There's the issue of burn-out. Just because someone mentors a Black male one year doesn't mean they'll be doing the same every year to infinity. Due to my personal experience, I'm just worried that the excitement of the novelty of the Academy may not have lasted forever. Michigan is facing severe unemployment problems now and I would guess this could negatively impact this school and its promotion of mentors and parental involvement.This book was both scant and hodgepodge. If you already know about bad statistics facing Black males, you won't be surprised here. The reflection chapter was nothing like the national resources chapter which was nothing like the results chapter. It's just all over the place. The authors state that they work with the Nation of Islam and that is a controversial group that some in the Michigan public may fear.Too I think about how the incentives listed wouldn't have worked for me. The authors say students can't play sports unless their grades are up and \"citizenship\" is good. Well, I hate sports, so that would not be a carrot I would want to bite. I just wonder if this school is truly interested in helping ALL young Black males and not just certain ones."

                    "This is a brilliant book which goes far toward explaining why racism still exists nearly 150 years after the end of slavery. It explains that racism does not persist because of ignorant, uneducated white people, but because the capitalist rulers of America find racism too useful and profitable to part with. To prove this thesis, Camejo goes into fascinating detail about how Radical Reconstruction began to transform the American south, as Blacks, armed with guns and the right to vote, began to direct their own destiny. He then shows how the Republican Party abandoned Blacks as the Party consolidated its economic grip on the south, and \"reconstructed\" it in their own capitalist image. His analysis of the \"Myth of the 1877 Compromise,\" which historians have mystified for so many years, is particularly helpful. Finally, Camejo does a great job of showing how and why other historians have failed to explain these truths clearly to generations of students. Don't miss this book!!!"

I found her discussion of experiences in the family, community, school and dating that help or undermine the adjustment of interracial children particularly helpful. I enjoyed hearing about their longings, ambitions, social lives and love relationships. I was also very pleased that she challenged some of the myths that have tainted the image of interracial people. The stories of the people the author interviewed are extremely poignant and so is the analysis and interpretation of their accounts. I learned a lot of new information from this book.

This book, however, is an incredible mix of excerpts from dozens of interviews with interracial people, as well as an on-point analysis of the import of what they are saying. The book also speaks to many things that interracial people think and feel, but seldom discuss with others.I am glad someone wrote this book as it relates to far more than just black / white mixes. Indeed, it relates to any racial or cross-cultural mix.",

The book also sheds light onto many of the racial stereotypes and little-spoken of biases that pervade inter and intra-race relations in our society.I wish I read this book while I was growing up.

Where are no cultural diverse classes here for anyone here to take. This year we got a new program called Cultural Anthropology. I feel that it is necessary for everyone not just African-Americans to take a cultural diverse class to learn more about someone of another race or creed. I feel that as far as we have come as a society there are still some things we have yet to accomplish. Being the only Black in most of my classes I feel it is necessary for everyone to understand and comprehend how someone else feels and understand there history and why they, if they do, feel the way they do about certain subjects.

                    "I think that it is worthwhile to refute hate speech. And this book does a good job of that.As the author says, \"the Jews have had it better than the Blacks in America, in no small part because of the historical advantage derived from the biological accident of white skin.\" Well, lighter skin. However, \"if the Nation of Islam - in junior partnership with white racist antisemites - does somehow transform the U. S. into a country where Black-Jewish cooperation towards goals of minority rights and social justice becomes impossible,\" Jews and Blacks will both suffer.The author says that \"those who lie to us about the past foreclose our chance to shape the future.\"There are numerous untruths in \"The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews.\" Brackman exposes many of them in this book. The untruths include claims that Jews \"dominated\" the slave trade in Medieval Europe, Africa, Latin America, and New England. In fact, Jews played a minor role in all these locations, while Arabs seem to have been the biggest slave traders in Africa. \"According to the African historian J. E. Inikori, Arab slavers between the years 650 and 1900 drained Black Africa of 14.4 million people - more than most estimates of slave exports to the Americas during the 400 years of the Atlantic slave trade.\"What about Southern Jews? Yes, there were some Southern Jewish slaveowners. In 1830, there were about 225,000 Southern families who owned slaves, including 322 Jewish families. About 59,000 of the families owned twenty or more slaves, including 23 Jewish ones. About 11,000 of the families owned fifty or more slaves including 4 Jewish ones. By the way, the author points out that some \"persons of color\" owned slaves too. These colored slaveowners \"outnumbered the Jewish ones by fifteen to one.\"I want all humans to be happy and prosperous, not poor and miserable. And I think we'll have a better chance of that if we value truth, justice, and human rights. This book is to be praised for taking a step in that direction. I recommend it.",
                    "This book is a refutation ofThe Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jewsby the Nation of Islam.Here are some quotations from this 1994 book:\"Some anti-Jewish stereotypes have a kernal of truth underneath the grotesque exaggeration. After all, there were Jewish moneylenders in medieval Europe and Jewish slave traders in the antebellum South. But other charges against the Jews---e.g., ritual murder, well-poisoning---have no plausible basis in reality.\" (Pg. 31)\"'The Secret Relationship' is an anonymous production. 'The Historical Research Department' identifies no individual members, nor does it indicate their academic credentials. In other words, those responsible themselves remain secret---choosing to hide behind rather than stand behind their scholarship.\" (Pg. 45)\"Jacob R. Marcus is the leading authority on American Jewry during the colonial period. He is quoted twenty-seven times in 'The Secret Relationship' and cited on numerous other occasions. Never once is his conclusion acknowledged that 'Jewish participation was minimal' in the slave trade with Africa.\" (Pg. 50-51)\"Black Africa experienced a slow bleed over hundreds of years. The world Jewish community experienced a massive hemorrhage---six million of eighteen million murdered---over just five years.\" (Pg. 98)",

When an author disproves a noted religious figure's statements, and that figure's adherents demonstrate an inexplicable refusal to deny that the statements were made, you can usually be certain that the author is correct.Louis Farrakhan demonstrates that you don't have to be a white Christian to be a dangerous racist spreading lies and promoting genocide---he's actually the only non-white non-Christian that I know of who is doing so in this country---but that's about all.",
                    "I suspect, (and I am Man enough to say that I could be wrong) from the material presented here, that there is a huge degree of fallacy contained within the pages of this book. Let me point out a few things:1)It was stated that (European)Jewish slavers enslaved only pagan white slaves, and that Jewish slavers ceased to be involved in 1000A.D., 500 years before slaveships started carting off enslaved Africans out of Africa. Yes, there were some Africans who sold out their own African Brothers and Sisters, in service to their White Massa. Yes, there have been cases of white-on-white violence and enslavement, but if European Jews ceased to be involved in the slave trade, and if they were not involved in the TransAtlantic Slave Trade,and if European Jewish slave traders had no part whatsoever in enslaving Black people, as this book states, THEN HOW DID A LOT OF BLACK PEOPLE all over the African Diaspora END UP WITH EUROPEAN JEWISH LAST NAMES such as WALKER, WINKLER, TURNER, COLEMAN, KAUFMAN, AND CONE? Malcolm X (and other Black and SOME White Historians) was not lying when he talked about how European slavemasters forced their names, particularly THEIR LAST NAMES, on African people, to signify their status as property of their WHITE slavemasters. Therefore, the purpose of the X is to signify the UNKNOWN AFRICAN NAME that Black people originally had before being enslaved.2)There is a lot of emphasis on the Arabs enslaving Africans, and I've seen a lot of white people and IGNORANT Black people say, \"Why do you Black Muslims claim the religion of your Arab Slavemasters? Don't you know that Arabs were enslaving Africans before the TransAtlantic Slave Trade?!!!\" First of all, yes, there were, and still are some Arabs that are and were enslaving Black people. And there were some cases where some Africans had other Africans in bondage. However, this is NO COMPARISON WHATSOEVER to, and DOES NOT NEGATE OR DIMINISH the slavery that EUROPEANS unleashed on AFRICANS, ASIANS, INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, OCEANIC PEOPLES, and SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLES OF COLOR. Why?1)It was the EUROPEAN who developed and practiced CHATTEL SLAVERY, which is designed to reduce the enslaved to a subhuman state by nearly killing the slave - a state less than a dog. Howard Zinn even states this very same thing in A PEOPLE'S HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.2)And before anybody says, \"Well,there were Free Black people who enslaved Black people, or Indians who enslaved Black people brutally in places such as Louisiana\", let me say this: YOU CANNOT have Non-whites enslaving other Non-whites without first having WHITES ENSLAVING NON-WHITES.3)In the book, THE HISTORY OF SLAVERY, by Susanne Everett, she shows how GREEKS AND ROMANS were enslaving African peoples LONG BEFORE the Arabs even thought about it. The Arabs did not come into Africa until the 7th Century A.D. The Greeks came into Africa roughly around the 8th Century B.C., then the Romans came in roughly around the 3rd-2nd Century B.C. Obviously this would have been SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS (roughly around 1400-1500 some odd years) before the Arabs even touched African soil. Therefore, it is MATHEMATICALLY and TRUTHFULLY impossible and assinine to state, \"well the Arabs were enslaving Blacks before the Europeans\". Also:a)on pg.15, Susanne Everett states:It is an uncomfortable fact that the Greeks. . .were UTTERLY DEPENDENT on slavery. THE ABOLITIONOF SLAVERY IN GREECE WOULD HAVE DISRUPTED THEWHOLE FABRIC OF ITS SOCIETY. From the 6th centuryB.C. in ATHENS and otherGREEK CITIES, slavery effectively replacedother forms of dependent labor. For the Greeksof the classical period (480-338 B.C.) it wasUNTHINKABLE THAT SOCIETY SHOULD BE ORGANIZED INANY OTHER WAY. Plato's REPUBLIC was firmly basedON SLAVE LABOR, although he drew the line, in war,at enslaving his fellow Greeks - he advisedsoldiers to 'keep their hands off one anotherand turn their energies AGAINST FOREIGNERS'.b)On page 17, there is a picture of a Roman slavemarket, with 8 slaves. One of the slaves is aBLACK WOMAN; the other slaves are Whites ofdifferent ages, and genders.c)On page 12, there is an excerpt from THE ODDYSEY,dealing with slavery, and a caption which statesthat,\"Slaves in Ancient Greece . . .were none theless the absolute CHATTELS of their masters. . .\"d)On page 25 is a picture of a statue of a Nubian/Kemetan slave that was a house slave in a Greekhouse. The caption reads, \"The Household SlavesOf Ancient Greece\". A caption reads that thestatue is of, \"a black slave boy probably boughtFROM THE UPPER NILE\", and that he is leaningagainst an amphora, a Grecian vase.4)In the documentary, \"A Great and Mighty Walk\", The late great Dr. John Henrick Clarke talks about how the Ancient Africans were asking the Arabs to get their Greek and Roman slave masters off their backs. He says (and this is nearly an exact quote), \"They (the Arabs) did get their European slavemasters off the Africans' backs - but the Arabs also REPLACED them on the African's backs\". He goes on to show and discuss how the Arabs introduced Africans to Allah and the enslavement that they brought along with that.5)Michael Bradley, a white historian, talks about the Hyksos, a EURASIAN predecessor of White Jews, who invaded Kemet in the 15th Century B.C. and enslaved several of the Kemetan people (who by the way, WERE BLACK AFRICANS). He speaks of the hypocrisy of how the Exodus story has been taught to have us thinking that White Jews were enslaved in Egypt, when it was actually the other way around - the Hyksos, predecessors of White Jews, unleashed a brutal enslavement on the Black Kemetans, for roughly 400 some years (Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm............), until they were driven out by the Black Pharaoh Ahmose I. By the way, this would have been some 1500 years BEFORE the year 1000 A.D., when European Jewish slavers \"ceased to be involved\" in the slave trade, as this author would have people to believe.6)Before anyone yells out reverse racism or rants about this being \"Anti-Semitic\", let me quote Roman historian TACITUS who wrote this in the 1ST CENTURY (Hmmmmm. . .Who else lived in the 1st Century?Hint: he was hung on a cross):\"Many say that the Jews come from ETHIOPIA.\"7)Dr. Yosef Ben-Jochannon talks about the original Jews who were and STILL ARE of AFRICAN ORIGIN, in WE, THE BLACK JEWS.I don't agree with everything Farrakhan says, but he does speak a lot of truths that ameriKKKa refuses to deal with. I also doubt that the author of THIS BOOK has studied Farrakhan or the Nation of Islam with any serious depth to effectively critique what the N.O.I. has said, shown, and proved. I also doubt that he met with Tony Martin to discuss what Tony Martin published, either; or if he did, he probably had a MONOLOG instead of a DIALOGUE with Tony Martin. I also doubt that he has studied the ORIGINAL origins of the Jewish people, as I have stated in points 6 and 7, above. And I SERIOUSLY doubt that what I stated above, could be refuted, which in closing, would render Harold Brackman's book faulty. Find out for yourself.",
                    "Harold Brackman's work here brings several questions for a reader to deal with. What is/was the motive for even writing a refutation to the Nation of Islam's book? In analyizing the references and cross-referencing said references with the NOI book, it becomes apparent that Harold Brackman's sources are extremely faulty, outright distortions, with degrees of hyperbole mixed in.The main question a studious reader must ask is, what is it about the jewish people, both past and currently, incites so much examination? This examination includes the scisms within jewish culture, how jewish people conduct commerce, the defense of the nation/state of israel to name few. Harold Brackman's work, we come to find out has been paid for by his jewish employers. That fact alone is cause for some skepticism as to the acurracy of his sources and his motives for writing the book. Corrolatively, one has to ask a similar question regarding the NOI research department in writing their book.Since the jewish people's motives seemed to get attacked by various groups and individuals, it would be intelligent to answer the question, what precisely is anti-semitism, and is being jewish a racial category separate from the acrual religion of judiasm? Harold Brackman's work would have gone alot further in establishing a dialogue if the above questions had of been placed in his discussion, and answered cogently by jewish person's. Lastly, for the reader who is looking for a validation of vitrol against the NOI, Harold Brackman provides this activity. This work is not unbiased. As a reader of this work, I continually asked the question, is there a definition of racism clearly gleaned from this work or not. The answer was no! It would be much more sensible if jewish leaders convened an intelligent forum or conference, and addressed the NOI work to the public. If jewish leaders would do this, then this work might be taken a bit more seriously than simply a BLACK male scholar being used as a pawn in a very trecherous game.This book is not work it's purchase price!!",

                    "In this book, I believe Paul Laurence Dunbar used fictional characters to protray his thoughts about how the black race was thought of in the mid-1990s. He was accalimed for his way of bringing concern to the topic of racial discrimination through writing. The novel kept me interested, but wasn't something to make a movie out of.",
                    "Paul Laurence Dunbar's novel &quot;The Sport of the Gods&quot; describes the experiences of an African-American family in the years following the abolition of slavery. According to the introduction by William L. Andrews in the Signet Classic edition of the novel, &quot;Sport&quot; first appeared in &quot;Lippincott's&quot; magazine in 1901 and was published in book form a year later.After a disturbing turn of events, the Hamilton family leaves their home in the southern U.S. and makes their way to New York City, where they try to start a new life. But the pressures of urban life have serious consequences for each member of the family.&quot;Sport&quot; is a story about injustice, innocence, and temptation. As he follows this family's story, Dunbar looks at many different relationships: parent/child, husband/wife, black/white, etc. Particularly interesting is his look at the relationship between the media reporter and those who are the object of media reports. The book also presents an ironic view of artists and their connection to larger society.&quot;Sport&quot; is a dark, moralistic tale. Although the characterizations are fairly shallow, Dunbar's narrative moves along effectively. I actually found the most intriguing character to be Skaggs, a white reporter for a &quot;yellow&quot; newspaper. This novel serves as an ironic complement to those slave autobiographies (such as the &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot;) which depict a flight to the north as a liberating experience; the north in &quot;Sport&quot; is a cold, amoral place full of dangers for black people. Overall, this is a compelling book that I regard as a significant milestone in African-American literature.",
                    "Please disregard the comments on the review below. To begin with, &quot;The Sport of the Gods&quot; is not a commentary on the mid 90's! It is a novel from the early 20th century about the hardships of the negro race in the northern urban areas (NY in this case). The novel is a bit harsh in its depiction of prejudice but that is precisely what makes it most compelling. The lack of hope presented in it is a social commentary about both the white and the black trying to rise up from slavery. In general the book is excellent, sad at some points, funny at others, but mainly it is one of the jewels of American literature which needs to be read by all regardless of ethnicity.",
                    "Paul Laurence Dunbar (1872 -- 1906)is best remembered as a poet. He wrote in both dialect and formal English. His famous poems include \"We wear the mask\", \"Sympathy\", which includes the line \"I know why the caged bird sings\", and \"Frederick Douglass\". Dunbar wrote prolifically during his short life, with an output that included essays, journalism, plays, short stories as well as poetry. Dunbar was also a novelist. His final effort in this form \"The Sport of the Gods\" (1902) remains an impressive work, a minor classic of American literature.Dunbar's novel describes the fate of an African American family, the Hamiltons, which is forced to move from its home in the deep South (the particular State is not named) to New York City. The Hamiltons had seemingly achieved a degree of success and stability in the post-Civil War South. The father, Berry, had worked as a butler for a prosperous plantation owner, Oakley, for many years. Berry had lived frugally, and managed to save money. His wife, Fannie, also had a good job working as a housekeeper for the Oakleys. The couple had two children, Joe, 18, a barber to white people who had become a dandy, and Kitty, 16, her mother's darling. The peaceful life of the family comes to a startling end when Oakley falsely accuses Berry Hamilton of stealing. Berry is sentenced to ten years in prison. His family is ostracized by whites and blacks alike. Fannie, Joe, and Kitty move to New York City to find a new life for themselves.The heart of this novel lies in Dunbar's descriptions of the underside of New York City life -- the hustlers, bars, tawdry shows, raw music, and loose women -- that spell doom to the newcomers from the South. Much of the action takes place in a nightclub called \"The Banner\", frequented by African Americans and by a class of whites who, then as in later times, practiced what is now termed \"slumming\". Dunbar has no affection or sentimenality for \"The Banner\" or its ilk. He writes: \"[O]f course, the place was a social cesspool, generating a poisonous miasma and reeking with the stench of decayed and rotten moralities. There is no defense to be made for it. But what do you expect when false idealism and fevered ambition come face to face with catering cupidity?\" Some of the frequenters of the banner include a con-man and raconteur named Sadness, the best-drawn character in Dunbar's book, a chorus girl named Hattie, and William Thomas, a railway worker with designs on young Kitty.The destruction of the Hamilton family proceeds naturally and inexorably in this environment and becomes \"The Sport of the Gods\". Joe quickly takes to drink and becomes involved with Hattie. When she puts him out, Joe kills her and is sentenced to prison. Kitty succumbs to Thomas's advances and ultimately finds herself working in a vulgar chorus line. Fannie is persuaded by a gambler and criminal that her husband's long imprisonment is equivalent to a divorce. She marries him and endures and abusive relationship.For all his negativity towards it, Dunbar offers an effective portrayal of early African American life in New York City, particularly its music. For the most part, the book is written in a bleak, naturalistic tone which reminded me of Stephen Crane's \"Maggie\", a somewhat earlier work about the effect of a slum environment in the destruction of lives. After Joe's imprisonment, the patrons of \"The Banner\", including Sadness, reflect upon his fate and upon the fate of young Southern blacks moving to New York:\"This was but for an hour, for even while they exclaimed they knew that there was no way, and that the stream of young negro life would continue to flow up from the South, dashing itself against the hard necessities of the city and breaking like waves against a rock, -- that until the gods grew tired of their cruel sport, there must still be sacrifices to false ideals and unreal ambitions.\"Readers looking for high-quality writing that remains somewhat off-the- beaten path should explore Dunbar and this novel. He remains an author worth remembering and reading. \"The Sport of the Gods\" raises themes that would be developed in American literature throughout the 20th Century, especially in works written by African Americans. It is a short, bleak and effective novel by an American poet.Robin Friedman",
                    "Have you ever wanted to yell out to the heroes of your favorite movie \"DON'T DO THAT YOU IDIOT!!\"? This book is sometimes frustrating because you, the reader, can see where the plot is going and want so badly to help the story's characters avoid what seems to be the inevitable. A naturalistic picture of life, and an often-missed text which deserves more attention. It doesn't make you feel good-- but it does make you want to be sure that people have choices, that this sort of thing isn't allowed to happen, that life isn't a series of \"sport\" that the gods (a vindictive type of gods) play with us.

The story is a narrative of their actions and reactions to a new lifestyle in urban New York City.

I thought it was a good book and wanted to share with my students. Dunbar's piece is an excellent piece of historical fiction. It follows a family's plight during America's Reconstruction era. A good choice for literature courses or for personal reading.",
                    "I need to say that I read the latter portion of this book from the Paul Lawrence Dunbar Reader. I really enjoyed this story even though it was quite melancholy. The story of a falsely accused butler, Berry Hamilton, stealing money from his Southern employer, Maurice Oakley. Of course Hamilton was sent to jail without much of a thought and his family had to leave town.The family which consisted of Fannie(wife), Kit(daughter), and Joe(son) all made their way north to New York. When they arrived they were immediately confronted with the smooth talkers and wonders of the city. Fannie tried to keep somewhat of a grip on her children but it soon wilted. The \"city\" had much more appeal than Fannie's moral cautions. Fannie lost her grip on Joe first. The Banner Club and it's patrons feed his strong desire to fit in with the City. Kit's appetite for the stage blinded her relationship with her mother. They all soon forgot about Berry being in prison. Skagg's a Banner patron that had befriended Joe sought out to find a story and found the truth.The story is about how unfortunate circumstances and how the refuge of a new city ate away at a family like a parasite. The book ended in tragedy and redemption. Dunbar is so gentle with his characters. His gentleness makes the tragedy go down a little easier.",

                    "I read and studied J.A. Rogers books the most during a period of time when I was obsessed with blackness. As a black man in america, I don't think being obsessed with blackness is anything to be ashamed of however. It's simply a reaction to racism.In this second volume, Roger's focuses on the new world and shows that the inhabitants of the americas are far from being pure racially. As discussed in the previous volume, race mixing with blacks took place all over Europe. In the new world however, whites not only mixed with blacks but also with the indigenous peoples of the americas including the caribbean. Also, there is good reason to believe that some of the indigenous peoples of the americas were already somewhat mixed before the europeans arrived. The one thing which I really like about J.A. Rogers books is the fact that he is not afraid to confront certain issues which are embarrasing to most whites even today.Did you ever wonder why some black people from the caribbean and south and central america don't like being called black? Some will say because they aren't black, they are Spanish or Brazilian. Based on historical evidence Roger's points out that the blacks of the caribbean and south and central america are just as &quot;black&quot; as the blacks in america. It's just that some of them may look different because race mixing took place in different degrees in different areas.Unfortuantely, the issue of race mixing is a very touchy issue, so a lot that is in books like this cannot be talked about without angering people unless you're in some sort of &quot;radical&quot; black group. Therefore, much of what is contained in this book should be kept to oneself. Regardless of what country someone is from, they don't like being told that they are of black african ancestry. Most &quot;non-whites&quot; will say they simply don't care and are irritated by the topic.",

                    "The need to identify with others like oneself, and to be with one's own kind, is a major component of human nature and so ethnic identity is a powerful force in human affairs. Group members have \"ties of blood\" that make them \"special\" and different from outsiders. This is why patriotism is almost always seen as a virtue and an extension of family loyalty. It also explains why ethnic remarks so easily become \"fighting words.\" Culture builds on genetic similarity and is bound together by it. Patriotism is preached in kinship terms. Nations are the \"motherland\" or the \"fatherland\" and unions and churches refer to their members as \"brothers\" and \"sisters.\"Salter draws out the implications, however politically incorrect, for immigration policies, citizenship law, affirmative action, multiculturalism, and other ways of allocating resources within and between states. There are constraints on how much diversity can be appreciated.On Genetic Interests extends evolutionary theorizing, including my own Genetic Similarity Theory, to the new ground of interpersonal and ethnic relations such as within-group cohesion and between-group conflict. It discusses studies on likeness in social partners such as spouses and best friends. Most importantly, it applies genetic calculations and finds that the average coefficient of kinship within most ethnic groups is about as high as between half-siblings, aunt and nephew, or grandparent and grandchild. Thus, ethnic nepotism is no mere poor relation of family nepotism-it is virtually a proxy for it. Because we have many more co-ethnics than relatives, the aggregate mass of genes shared with the former dwarfs that shared with the latter.Frank Salter, a political scientists and ethologist at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, argues persuasively in this book that shared genes are the glue of sociality.On Genetic Interests goes so far as to refer to the mind as having an \"innate descent-group module\" (p. 102). It uses this concept to explain the universality of ethnic nepotism. This is heartening because many social scientists and sociobiologists alike have been reluctant to even consider applying gene-based similarity to ethnic and national preferences. Following World War II, few political scientists and historians have considered inter-group conflict from a Darwinian viewpoint. Partly in an effort to insure that they are perceived as in no way condoning racism, many evolutionists have minimized the theoretical possibility of a biological underpinning to ethnic, national, and racial favoritism. As the late, great, evolutionary biologist William Hamilton himself remarked in 1987, while noting why kin discrimination even among animals is not more readily expected, \"in civilized cultures, nepotism has become an embarrassment.\"Social scientists and historians have been quick to condemn the extent to which political leaders or would-be leaders have been able to manipulate ethnic identity. But the questions they never ask, let alone attempt to answer is, \"Why is it always so easy?\" and \"Why can a relatively uneducated political outsider set off a race riot simply by uttering a few well delivered ethnic epithets?\" On Genetic Interests provides an illuminating answer.",
                    "The importance of this book is that it explains that racism is rational. That is, by favoring people of one's own race, a person is increasing his fitness. This means that the anti-racists are trying to convince people to lower their fitness and eventually go extinct. In evolutionary terms, racism is adaptive and anti-racism is maladaptive. A further implication is that racists are in harmony with man's nature (indeed, the nature of all living things - to pass on the unique forms of one's genes), and that anti-racists, who go ballistic at any tinge of racism, are psychologically pathological.While there is some math in the book, it can be understood by the average person who thinks carefully about the definitions of the terms. The reader should consult the glossary in the back of the book and be sure he understands the difference between \"individual fitness,\" \"absolute fitness,\" \"relative fitness,\" and \"inclusive fitness.\" Chapter 2 is the most important and difficult chapter and should be read several times.",
                    "This book gives scientific legitimacy to genetic interests which can be protected by the ethnostate. It reads like a scientific journal and is a bit daunting to understand at times for the layman, but not overwhelming.Salter advocates putting more emphasis on preserving the ethny rather than just focusing on families or humanity. The three concerns involved are humanity, ethny, and family. Conservatives favor family and liberals favor humanity in their concerns. The mass immigration of genetically distant populations into America is displacing the European ethny here. He uses evolutionary sociobiology to make his arguments against alien immigration. He advocates universal nationalism for the world's ethnies. He reviews arguments against his ideas and the ethical considerations involving universal nationalism.He argues for the same thing that David Duke and Robert McCollough argue for, but his arguments are even more focused on scientifically justifying ethnic separations such as having ethnies monopolize a territory. This strategy would echo the tribal evolutionary strategy that has always existed and has built the nation state. Modern mass anonymous societies with all their technologies have made us confused about our genetic interests. He is against the multi-racial polities which favor minority interests over majority ones, although he does not forbid multi-racial states for those who desire them. Minorities are more motivated to defend their interests in multi-racial states because of alienation and the subtle rejection of the majority. Majorities are complacent about their interests because they deal more with their own kind everyday and do not feel alienated.He is against aggression in his model of universal nationalism; it is no longer worth it to take over territory because of population growth and the destruction war can cause. The age of empire should not be renewed.Unfortunately, ethnic polices are often decided by political cunning and will to power, rather than by scientific reasoning. I do not see that any of ideas will be implemented soon. Some states are based on ethnic solidarity such as in Germany, where only those of German blood are citizens. Still Germany has not sent many Turks back home because they do not have the political will, even though it is constitutionally legal for them to do so. Even such ethnic states will not always enforce their ethnic policies. But Germany is better off than the US and England, which have become proposition nations in which citizens supposedly attain solidarity by believing in liberal democratic ideals that deny the genetic interests of various ethnies. Multi-racial proposition nations are hard to hold together and require a lot of propaganda from the media, government, entertainment, and education to keep people believing in the proposition.",
                    "\"A tour-de-force. Absolutely astounding information about genetics you wont hear anywhere else. For example, he clearly shows how immigration into western countries is much worse than mass murder of members of our extended family (our racial genotype) in relation to or genetic interests. We have a lot to lose if immigration goes unchecked culturally and intellectually, but this book shows the specific genetic basis for our global fears in this regard. A very unique book pulling the true power of genetics out of the stone of natural sciences. Very unique, very well-written. A masterpiece.\"",
                    "I can hardly recall reading a book with so many intriguing new concepts per page as this one. The author makes a compelling case for counting group genetic interests amongst human rights. At the same time, he lays bare the ignorance, hypocrisy and bias of most of the \"scientific\" community when dealing with this subject. Yet he does so with great modesty and respect.We are shown how there is no qualitative difference between the connection between mother and child and the connection between an individual and his race. The difference is only in degree. We are shown this conceptually and mathematically.\"Until the discovery of our evolutionary origins, we were like blind men in pursuit of the adaptive life...now the enlightenment is illuminating our fundamental interest...\" Though the author was speaking of our overall scientific knowledge, the same can be said about the knowledge contained in his book. Most of us are like blind men prior to reading it. After reading it, we are blessed with sight. Thank you Mr. Salter. You have done all humanity a great service.I highly recommend this monumental work to anybody who has a genetic interest - which is to say, everybody!",
                    "the fact is, that the greatest hatred are amoung peoples who are genetically very similar through out human history. (German, English in WWII, Chinese, Japanese, Korean through out history etc). in the worst human conflict, WWII, American, English, Chinese, Russian on one side, German, Italian, Japanese on the other side. i can't see any \"genetic\" stratification in that. and now, the greatest nation(at least the most powerful one)-- America, have no genetic basis. and Germany, the country that advocated racial purity is not even a entity until a few hundred years ago.(before that, it is loosely connected tribal...)anecdote evidence aside, quantitatively, traditional ethnic division can only 1% explain human genetic variation(my estimation, no hard data), so if these is a genetic base for ethnic based thinking(racism), it must be a very weak third order effect. it is akin to rate attractiveness among individuals by the body mass based on newton's law. we know it is absurd, even through newton's law is correct."

This book describes many aspects of the movement. One part is about the Little Rock Nine. I admire them for having enough courage to attend an all white school. They were made fun of and even physically threatened by fellow students. The book also tells about the bus boycott, Freedom Riders, and all the laws passed to make a better life for African Americans.

One student recounts the time when he asked a white friend to sign his senior year book. the white friend wrote \"there was a time when I was a bigot and a racist... but knowing you changed me. I now know that people are people, black or white.\" He ended the entry by saying, \"We shall overcome.\" Annecdotes like these illustrate the profound effect young people had on the movement. This book is a rich resource, and I recommend it to anyone. Though some parts are quite depressing, enough to make you cry, in the end you will feel a respect and appreciation for what \"everyday\" young people did to contribute to the movement.

                    "Harwood spends the 167 pages here arguing for a definition and a defense of judicial activism. The literature needs a good and well-accepted definition of \"judicial activism\", since many use the phrase inconsistently. Harwood defends judicial activism by showing how judicial activism can and often does promote the same values opponents of judicial activism try to use to attack judicial activism, values such as democracy, justice and fairness, judicial efficiency and economic efficiency and stability. Harwood discusses in detail the views of Alexander Bickel, Robert Bork, Bradley C. Canon, Reed Dickerson, Ronald Dworkin, John Hart Ely, Gerald Gunther, Robert Keeton, David Lyons, Richard Posner, J.B. Thayer and many other jurists and legal, moral and political philosophers.Harwood argues that judicial activism can be either conservative, liberal or anywhere in between these parts of the political spectrum. Harwood argues that the arguments for respecting precedent (stare decisis, a major form of judicial restraint) are little or no better than the quality of the precedents themselves. Harwood argues that there are many democratic checks on the powers of judges and thus the risk of judicial tyranny is generally greatly overstated in the literature.Here's the table of contents:Chapter 1: A Working Definition of Judicial ActivismChapter 2: Activism and DemocracyChapter 3: Precedent and Passivism: The Weakness of Stare DecisisChapter 4: Taking Vagueness Seriously: The Void-For-Vagueness Doctrine Supports Judicial Activism Against OriginalismChapter 5: Defending Judicial Activism Against Posner's AttackChapter 6: ConclusionThe 4 appendices to the book chronicle how scholars have used the phrases \"judicial activism\" and \"judicial restraint\" in hundreds of articles, books and cases.University Press of America bought the rights to this book, so please contact them to encourage a new printing, if you wish to explore the book.

I also think it is important to note that while most of those profiled stand at the cutting edge of capitalism, they also remain sensitive to social and human values, a balance which I think all should keep in mind.",

At many times, I had to put the book down and just absorb a profound insight one of the achievers shared. I would strongly encourage all students entering or leaving college to put this on their personal reading list. I'd love to see a new edition of this book.",

                    "\"Up from Slavery\" is an excellent insight into the life of Booker Taliaferro Washington, and his life-long desire to better himself as well as both the black and white people of the South. This autobiography begins with Mr. Washington's childhood where he grew up as a slave, and continues throughout his adult life. Hard work is something that Mr. Washington believed in, and he felt it was essential that all students of the Tuskegee Institute must embrace.One of the things that struck me the most about this story was Mr. Washington's philosophy on how the black man could better his station in life. It wasn't through handouts or welfare, but by believing \"The individual who can do something that the world wants done will, in the end, make his way regardless of race.\" The story includes numerous examples of how Tuskegee students would do things (e.g., making bricks, efficiently growing vegetables, etc.) that would bring them respect and recognition in the community.One other thing I really liked was Mr. Washington's belief in teaching students how to be an overall better person. This includes everything from dental hygiene to hard work and it also focused on the moral aspects of being a good person developed through Christian principals.",
                    "The life story of Booker T. Washington was uplifting and inspiring. This shows that a person can arise from the ashes of their life, and make something worthwhile of themselves. Being born a slave was a major set back in their lives. Booker was determined to received and education at any cost, and he succeeded. Nothing was handed to him. Hard work and perserverance was the only way he could accomplish his goals.Through turbalent times after the Civil War, Booker united the white and black race. Together they worked to build one of the finest educational institution in the south-Tuskegee, renamed Tuskegee University.",
                    "Booker Taliaferro Washington was perhaps foremost in what he called \"bringing up the black race\". He did perhaps more than Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr., and W.E.B. DuBois ever did. Why? Because Washington did it softly, humbly, and quietly. The other black leaders attempted revolution and immediate change - both led to violence. Booker T. Washington's methods led to slow, but sure and sweeping change. He sought reform, not revolution. His life is clearly an example of Christian piety and firm faith in God. These two things also set his work apart as more successful than any other black leader. Perhaps modern black leaders should re-evaluate their philosophies for change based upon this great leader's model.",
                    "I greatly enjoyed this book! I admire Booker T. Washington for his endless pursuit of education. This book is a great inspiration to any student. The only thing that I was disappointed with was the fact that Mr. Washington did not get into his personal or family life. I agree that school can change a person, And I believe that education can greatly shape who a person is, but I don't belive that education is the only thing that molds us. I would have loved to find out as much about Mr. Washington's private life as I learned about his schooling, and his work for schools. Despite all this, I think this book is wonderful. If you know a high school student, or college student, give this book to them as a gift. It is a good read.",
                    "I have read this book over and over. We, certainly the entire world, have been given a resource(s) with Washington along with WEB Dubois. A check and balance regarding African Americans and the &quot;making of America.&quot;In my opinion, one must read DuBois when reading Washington.That's the check and balance.Up ... may reveal that these same attitudes and beliefs are still true of some African Amercans today. However, DuBois' counter better reflects the attitude, I beleive, of the majority of African AMercans. DuBois classic piece of work shows how, though they were physical &quot;slaves&quot; , they were free mentally, and some dared to dream, fight, and speak out even in the face of death. Oh how wonderful to know your history versus having others to tell you their side of your history.So, my response to this classic is to counter it with DuBois. Then, it can be better understood in the period in which it was written.African Americans have so much to be proud of, in spite of .... Still. what a better place this world called America would be if all people were respected and given the kinds of opportunities that America has to offer.What a classic. In countering this classic with DuBois, history definitely shows me that the old saying that all Blacks think alike is certainly nottrue. Not then, not now. Reading Washington alone, is just getting a glimpse of only half the era.Three Negro Classics- which includes DuBois and Up ... should be requried reading for all of education and educators- K-docotorate, law, medicine, etc., period.Now, that's telling the whole story!!!!!",
                    "A lot of things have been said and written concerning Booker Taliaferro Washington's book, \"Up From Slavery\". Some were hot, and some were cold. But one focus that unites all the varying opinions is that every critic or reviewer agreed that the book is superb. Also, most people acknowledged that Booker T. was a distinguished scholar (despite the overwhelming odds that weighed him down).However, one big fact that most reviewers of this work have consistently overlooked is the circumstances that surrounded both the book and its writer. In order to have an accurate perspective of this book, we must not fail to evaluate what life was like for Booker T. After all, the book in question is his autobiography: written in a country where he was born and nurtured as a slave, before becoming a freeman whose basic human rights were consistently denied.One fact that pops up in this regard is that Mr. Washington was never free in the real sense of the word. The type of freedom a typical Black American enjoys today was an unseen luxury throughout Booker T's life: (1856-1915).In the same period, the life expectancy of an average Black American was less than half of what it is today. This was not because the folks then were all HIV-positive, but simply because any White man could barbecue a Black man right on the street and nothing would happen.That Booker T. chose not to criticize the grievous atrocities that the ubiquitous racists meted on American Negroes is understandable. It was not a matter of choice per se, rather, the swain wanted to stay alive. He understood his environment well, and had a first-class knowledge of how racist America worked. Again, it is only a dummy who wouldn't know that the (first) publisher of \"Up From Slavery\" wouldn't have considered the manuscript if it contained anything that will embarrass or infuriate White America. And, Booker T. Washington might be made to pay a ghastly price for authoring an \"offensive write-up\". We must not forget that this book was written a century ago: when \"freedom\" and \"justice\" were very different from what it is today. In those days, many \"critical\" Black-oriented manuscripts ended-up in dustbins; and their authors were vilified and hunted down.Today's critics who relax in comfortable armchairs and bellow that this book \"lacked depth\" in this way and that way, weren't born as Booker T. was; and I forgive them each time they use that word: 'slavery', in vain. Booker T. died in 1915, and history will always attest that Black Americans continued to struggle for freedom more than fifty years after his death.An old adage has it that: 'A word is enough for the wise'. Thus, I will like to end my comments here. \"Up From Slavery\" is a very fine book. It is small: less than 250 pages. Hence, I don't need to review or analyze it with a thousand pages. Mr. Booker T. Washington did his best: given the insurmountable circumstances that surrounded his world.",
                    "Up From Slavery Booker T. Washington has been one of my all-time favorite American heroes -- ever since I first read about him in 4th grade. Washington had a gift for writing, and his autobiography, as well as his essays, are very easy to read, understand, and enjoy. The more I study and learn about him, the more impressed I am with his vision, his integrity, and his drive to improve his people and their lot in life.",
                    "Booker T. Washington had every reason to complain and be resentful. He was born a slave, and although national manumission occurred while he was still a boy, very few opportunities offered themselves to the newly emancipated. He fought against the odds to get an education and while he was away at school, his beloved mother died. His biological father was a slave owner who never expressed any interest in his son's life. When he was asked to be headmaster of the Tuskegee Institute, he found himself faced with empty land in a poverty-stricken area. Married three times, his first two wives died very young. His first spouse left him a single father with a young child, and the second time he faced widowhood he had three small children to raise all by himself.He could certainly have cursed fate and just given up; in stead his autobiography is the work of an unspeakably grateful and patriotic American. Washington could not find enough good things to say about nearly everyone he encountered in life or the country he felt blessed to call his home. He worked very, very hard and success followed all his endeavors. Rather than boast of his many accomplishments, he seemed to feel unworthy of the nationwide respect he earned. He humbly described his friendships with Presidents Grover Cleveland and William McKinley, talked of his constantly sought after speeches throughout the United States and Europe, and detailed his phenomenal money-raising skills that brought the Tuskegee Institute up from a converted hen-house to a campus of over 40 buildings.Throughout all his trials and successes, he constantly advocated forgiveness, humility, and gratitude. Not only did he recommend these three virtues, he lived a life that embodied them. Perhaps that's why a person born with no realistic chance at getting ahead, died one of the most admired and well-known individuals of his day.",
                    "The author was highly instrumental in bringing this process about. He was educated and completed his schooling at the 'Hampton' school with honors. He then built and directed the 'Tuskegee' school in Alabama, and devoted his whole life to service. While this book was very informative, and is considered a milestone by a true pioneer, it is a little bit monotonous, thus THREE stars. I would highly recommend it nevertheless. Many of the thoughts, attitudes, and sayings of Booker T. Washington have been used by modern authors and speakers, and will live forever. Our country and the black race are forever in his debt for the legacy he left behind. I certainly feel better about life after reading this book. You will too.",
                    "This book has an inspiring message, and gives a viewpoint that is not often looked at. I thought its content was instructional.",
                    "Good read for middle school kids as a homeschool or supplemental read. I found it interesting that Booker T advocates a clean lifestyle which is what so many of our current male youth need to learn - hard work, morality and education. A great man.",
                    "This is a very inspirational book emphasizing the success achieved through hard work, initiative, dedication, and self-reliance. Booker T. Washington was truely an amazing man with a mission to teach X-slaves the responsibility associated with liberty! This book needs to be required reading for all high school and college students!",
                    "The legacy of Booker T. Washington incontestably stands alongside other great Americans. Washington created the Tuskegee Institute to promote the education of his people who had only recently been emancipated from slavery. Much of it was literally built by his hands and those of his charges.In so doing they could take ownership and pride of their creation. Washington raises labor from its inferior status to a place of honor. He blames the institution of slavery for distorting the dignity of labor because it \"took the spirit of self-reliance and self-help out of the white people. My old master had many boys and girls, but not one, so far as I know, ever mastered a single trade or special line of productive industry.\" Everything was left to the slaves. As a consequence, the slave owners \"unconsciously had imbibed the feeling that manual labour was not the proper thing for them. On the other hand, the slaves, in many cases, had mastered some handicraft, and none were ashamed, and few unwilling, to labour.\"Paul Lawrence Dunbar, one of the great poets of the Harlem Renaissance, expressed some discordant opinions regarding this autobiography of one of America's most influential blacks. His tone is respectful, recognizing that, after all, Booker T. Washington created Tuskegee Institute.Dunbar echoed the resentment felt by blacks who felt betrayed by Washington's accommodating stance with the powerful men of his time. Indeed, there is something of the sell-out in his nave belief that \"the time will come when the Negro in the South will be accorded all the political rights which his ability, character, and material possessions entitle him to . . . the opportunity to freely exercise such political rights will not come in any large degree through outside or artificial forcing, but will be accorded to the Negro by the Southern white people themselves, and that they will protect him in the exercise of those rights.\"Fifty years later, it was painfully evident that this had not come to pass, nor would without an organized movement to force the issue.For all the criticism he has received, it should never be forgotten that he walked a precarious tightrope. On the one side he had to be painfully aware of the injustices of his own people. On the other, the need of funding meant that he needed to be far more circumspect in his criticism to promote educational opportunities for his aggrieved students.We have the benefit of hindsight. Cut him some slack. He did far more under the circumstances than a lesser man could.",
                    "Booker T. Washington: once a slave, beat down and told he could do nothing, accomplish nothing; now an example to all men, white and colored, raised above others. Why? Hard work and a desire to do good in this world. He accomplished more than a lot, from getting into a school by sweeping and cleaning a room, to teaching at a night school, to starting Tuskegee, to speaking at huge events at which no black man had ever spoken. He met great men, did great things, built a great community, and loved greatly.He wrote this autobiography about his truly great life. He wrote it simply, giving facts in a very interesting way (one thing that he felt was important while giving speeches). I had a hard time staying interested because I was very busy while reading it and felt like I had to rush to get it done. However, I liked it enough to know that I'll read it again in a less-busy time and really immerse myself in it. There's so much to learn, so much to discover in a life like Washington's. While reading it I couldn't help but be thankful for everything in my life. I was born with many luxuries given to me. Booker T. Washington started out with the clothes on his back and a dirt floor to sleep on. Education was a piece of paradise to him; food was a luxury beyond all comparison. I have always had both of those, in abundance.One word to describe this book would be thankful. Not the word I would normally use to describe a book, but really, it is. Booker T. Washington's thanks resonates throughout the whole story. Even when he was hungry and on the streets - I could almost taste his thanks whenever he'd receive a meal or a warm place to stay.Wonderful. Recommended to all who love a good autobiography, and even to those who don't.",

                    "I read this some time ago, combined with The Souls of Black Folk and The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man. Up From Slavery was the warm-up, I guess, since it was the least offensive. Of course one reader's \"least offensive\" is another reader's \"Uncle Tom\". However one can't fairly judge someone from that era using the criteria from the modern time- a fairly simple principle that is too easily forgotten.With that out of the way, let me say that as a southern kid in the late 60's reading this book I was tremendously inspired. We were hardly that far removed from Jim Crow, at least in years, so I think I was able to grasp a little of the obstacles Washington overcame. Still this is less a story of race than a story of faith, of vision, of the triumph of hard work, and the triumphs both in spite of as well as because of his fellow man.The history in not too debatable, as it is an auto-biography. By definition thus the history of the author, and this becomes one of the strengths of the books- the common sense, no-nonsense love of life thatcauses BTW to continually break through to the other side, and bring the reader with him. By the end of the book I wanted to start a college (as he did) and help my fellow man up from poverty any way I could. To not marvel at his accomplishments and to denigrate him with labels out of time is to do great injustice to the man, his relationship with God, and to his incredible achievements.To sum: it is inspiring and real, and it gives a glimpse into some of the peculiar hardships resulting from the peculiar institution, but the process is almost the polar opposite of the victimhood route of today- from someone who could most justifiably have claimed himself such a victim.",
                    "A riveting account of Washington's extraordinary struggle fueled by boundless optimism.However, Washington's faith appears overly buoyant when he writes the following about the Ku Klux Klan: 'To-day there are no such organizations in the South, and the fact that such ever existed is almost forgotten by both races. There are few places in the South now where public sentiment would permit such organizations to exist.'Of course, a hundred years later the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist organizations are alive and well in the U.S.I was surprised to discover that this book - although published in 1901 - employs British (rather than American) spellings for words such as &quot;labour&quot; (labor) and &quot;colour&quot; (color).This is an important document of its time that must be read by anyone with the mildest interest in world history and the human condition that shapes it.",
                    "This book provides a snapshot of the world of the US at one of it's most exciting times. The end of the 19th century was the &quot;Progressive Era&quot; when people came together and formed groups and associations that are still with us today. His metaphor of dipping into the cool clear water in which we are sailing for the human resources to build society is as true today as in 1890. His statement that the most pressing problem in America was for rich and poor to understand how each contributes to the whole and to learn to value each other is also timely.Besides the fascinating historical perspective of the thinking of the time, there is the insight provided by Booker T. Washington himself. His adulation of labor is reminisint of Kahil Gibran in &quot;The Prophet.&quot; The most repeated idea in the book is that any person that adds to the economic well being and comfort of their community will be sought out and cherished and that race has nothing to do with it. Coming from a person who started with so much less (he was a slave) that most of us have today and really practicing what he believed makes him someone that we all can admire. To put it in less academic terms, this is a book about an incredibly beautiful person that made me think deeply about myself and the world I live in.",

                    "Booker T. Washington has always been a figure that history teachers use, in my opinion, to support the so-called &quot;Good&quot; African-Americans. In other words, those who don't cause trouble. &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; displays this side of Mr. Washington. This book is worth reading because of Booker's determination that allowed him to rise above his former conditions. Yet, one can't help but get the feeling that he is all-to-ready to forget what has happened to him. Booker continues to explain, rather naively, in my opinion, how racism is to soon be erased. I feel it's unfortunate how things later came to contradict his predicitons, but he is foolishly optimistic. Overall, &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; is a decent book, but occasionally tedious.",
                    "Booker T. Washington wrote a lively narrative of his life that deserves our attention today. The first couple of pages are startling for the nonchalant way he relates that he doesn't know the year of his birth, nor the exact location, nor with certainty who his father was. He does, on the other hand, describe the tiny dimensions to the cabin where he lived and what life was like for the slaves. Washington went on from these humble beginnings to a fine education and a life of meritoriously helping fellow negroes to improve their education and vocational endeavors. This book is a good reminder of the stark conditions and large barriers present for slaves making the transition to free members of society following the Civil War.",
                    "What an outstanding autobiography regarding a true American heroe! This book details the triumphant acts of Booker T. Washington's efforts to not only develop the famous Tuskegee Institute, but to positively build bridges with America. A former slave who became a self taught, political mastermind came from the worst of what humanity had to offer to meeting and influencing American Presidents. What an honor it would have been to meet a man who provided so much to the African American man and woman. He was also willing and often did help southern whites in his community. It's ashame that in America, where education is offered legally, there is a 50% dropout rate among African American high school students. This man and his \"cadres\" fought for and provided educational opportunities in a country that treated them worst than second class citizens. This book should be a required reading in ALL schools, especially those predominantly filled with African Americans!",

His detailing of life as a young slave boy, and life during/after the Reconstruction, is heart-wrenching, but must be read in order to fully understand the era. At times, I felt that Mr. Washington was too \"kind\" in trying to understand and explain the motives of the white people. He was a visionary and tireless worker for the African Americans; therefore, this work is a must-read for all Americans.",
                    "It was a pleasure to meet this great man through this, his, book. A previous book I reviewed made me curious about how the black slaves in the south lived before their emancipation. This book satisfied my curiosity. More than saying that, I find it is difficult to review this book. Simply put, Mr. Washington tells you about his life and in so doing tells you about himself and the principles he lived by. I feel there are valuable lessons to be learned here. I'll just take two quotes, \"...the thing to do, when one feels sure that he has said or done the right thing, and is condemned, is to stand still and keep quiet. If he is right, time will show it.\" I believe Jesus sent the same message. I heard that the great scientist, Robert J Oppenheimer, became depressed after being condemned as a Communist. If so, I guess he hadn't learned this lesson. The second, \"Few things help an individual more than to place responsibility upon him, and to let him know that you trust him.\" This was illustrated over and over again in the book. Other great men have also said this, but if it has been heard by most people, in the workplace and at home, it is ignored so much of the time. This book is inspiring. I wish all young people would read it and heed it; then this would be a better world.",
                    "Up From Slavery is the classic autobiography of Booker T. Washington. Washington gives an interesting, alternative perspective regarding slavery and slave owners. This is what Mr. Washington stated regarding his boyhood owners: \"My life had its beginnings in the midst of the most miserable, desolate, and discouraging surroundings. This was so, however, not because my owners were especially cruel, for they were not, as compared with many others...........One may get the idea, from what I have said, that there was a bitter feeling toward the white people on the part of my race, because of the fact that most of the white population was away fighting in a war which would result in keeping the Negro in slavery if the South was successful. In the case of the slaves on our place this was not true, and it was not true of any large portion of the slave population in the South where the Negro was treated with anything like decency.\"Washington is here saying that although many slaves were mistreated by their owners, many were treated relatively well.Not only does Mr. Washington offer an interesting perspective on slavery, he was an early black educator. Washington believed that black people should have no privileges because of their color. He believed that it was the fault of the black man if he did not succeed and it was not because of the white man. He urged the people of his race to work for their living and not depend on others for help. When times were the very hardest for the black people, Washington helped lift them up and get them on their feet. He founded Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama. This school began as a small night-school for black people. Washington build a fine institution for the black race by the sweat of his brow.Booker T. Washington did not view his race as mistreated victims, instead he took a great amount of pride in the black race and wanted others to understand what a privilege it was to be a part of it, as this quote seems to indicate:\"From any point of view, I had rather be what I am, a member of the Negro race, than be able to claim membership with the most favoured of any other race.....This I have said here, not to call attention to myself as an individual, but to the race to which I am proud to belong.\"Booker T. Washington's Up From Slavery is an American classic. It is the true life story of a little slave boy who grew up to become one of the finest leaders for his race.",
                    "Booker T. Washington shares in this book his thoughts on education and work in such a beautiful positive way. Each pearl of wisdom is such a treasure, I wish that this book could be instituted as required reading for all students. I loved it and have since bought 6 books to give as gifts.",
                    "Booker T. Washington was born in slavery, and he describes the first seven years of his life as a slave in enough detail to raise the hairs on your neck. Suddenly emancipated after the Civil War, his life saw no improvement until he finally made his way, broke at times, to the Hampton Institute -- which changed his life.Others have mentioned his work ethic. He had one of the strongest work ethics ever seen in a human being. He graduated from Hampton with flying colors, and was subsequently chosen to found the Tuskegee Institute. On Day One, that amounted to a shanty next to a church. (!)Washington's message, repeated over and over, was \"learn a useful trade.\" As he correctly reasoned, human nature being what it is, if you are the best blacksmith, brick maker, or furniture maker in your community, your community is going to respect you and want to keep you.In the year 2012, this advice strikes me as eerily prescient. Certainly it's excellent advice for the American underclass, but suddenly -- with the explosive bubble in college charges -- it's beginning to make sense to a lot of Americans, whether they be black, white, or magenta. Which is the better path? Skip college and qualify as a first-rate plumber, electrician, carpenter etc. -- or go to college and wind up unemployed with $100,000 in student debt?There's a lot more in this book! It's an excellent portrait of America in the late 19th century, and it will surprise you at many turns.",
                    "I devoured this book on my newly purchased Kindle! I'm a Southern African American woman who can identify with so much of what was written. Our communities are in need of men of Booker T's caliber.I loved his description of life as a slave and then as a free man...his expositions on the virtues of the tooth brush and bathing...describing what it was like to sleep in a bed with two sheets...how to get along with Southern Whites and further the cause of the Black community.I can see how folks have pegged him as an 'Uncle Tom,' because of the tone taken in the book; almost too forgiving considering what he's been through. Nonetheless, I value his perspective, because in the end one cannot realistically expect to excel among those you bash every chance you get, even if the bashing is well deserved.I appreciate his repetitive statements on work. In this regard, it seems that things might be worse in today's society with modern advances possibly adding to the laziness--poor work ethic--spiteful attitude toward work exhibited by some folks regardless of race. We still have a ways to go. Book sense and manual (I'd add computer/technological) labor can still take us further as a race.Lastly, he spoke out against injustices in a tactful way that built bridges rather than destroyed them. I can dig that.Overall, this was a great read! A great start to my kindle love affair! :)",

Washington's as I have never read about a person in recent history that had as little resentment as he did, and according to him, he would not have been able to do the great work that he did if had spent any time being resentful. This book reads almost like a motivational book in many sections. Many of our problems with education today was understood clearly by Booker T. Washington, over a 100 years ago.Please read this book.",
                    "This is a must read for anyone interested in early American history.",
                    "The social confines of race are a self-imposed form of slavery, figurative bonds which may be loosed only through the merit of magnanimous work. Much has been discussed in recent years about the topics of racial equality, minority education, and our national history regarding members of the African-American race. It cannot be denied that a great injustice has been served this particular ethnic group, but the future is each citizen's responsibility, black and white alike. Booker T. Washington's reflective memoir, \"Up From Slavery\" positively affirms the virtues of equal parts work and study for a mutually successful society, race notwithstanding. As an autobiography chronicling Washington's humble beginnings in Confederate West Virginia among illiterate slaves to Boston society appealing to the socially prominent, \"Up From Slavery\" offers a contemporary view on race relations and the human condition. The narrative details Washington's childhood, contrasting the degrees of educational prosperity, domestic sanitation, and religious liberty with the unalienable provisions of slave owners. Washington illuminates the process of ascertaining an education against all odds, laboring in coalmines to afford night school, teaching eager black students, and finally dedicating his life's work to the renowned Tuskegee Institute. Rather tedious in these recollections, the book's plot is unnecessarily laden with exhaustive details and lacks depth in historical perspective. Given the time period in which it was written, there is margin for error in hypothetical suggestions for ethnic culmination, theorizing equal opportunities that did not materialize until seven decades later with desegregation. Individual statements are debatable, such as Washington's idealistic perspective on racial harmony being a non-issue directly after the Civil War, which seems highly unlikely given the past hundred years of civil rights conflict. Explaining the process of rising above local circumstances is the plot's best feature flowing smoothly into a chronological process, specific and concise. It plainly states the South's oppressive environment without delving into racial sympathy, lending remarkable strength. Written with commendable intentions, undue criticism of the white majority is withheld, replaced by cautious optimism and a hopeful spirit. The plot in general follows a logical sequence highlighting one man's endeavors to strive for a better life in impoverished circumstances and his inspiration to freed slaves. Typical of memoirs, the autobiography's focal point is Booker T. Washington's personal account and unique perspective. While other characters are not specifically elaborated, Washington is quick to credit his teachers, mentors, and benefactors in gracious tribute. Their admirable attributes are illuminated in model exemplification, deliberately but briefly identified. Not presenting thoroughly interesting characters for lack of breadth, the reader is focused on Washington himself rather than other outstanding individuals. His personal beliefs are well defined, confided in a trusting tone. Instead of feeling familiar with a cast of literary icons, the reader is acquainted with the author's own integrity and moral fiber. The main character is a sound representation of autobiographical focus, developed, interesting, and personal. In spite of race and social position, hard work employs utmost application in striving to reach full potential and earnest effort begets its own reward. \"The man who can do something that the world wants done will in the end make his way regardless of race My experience is that there is something in human nature which always makes an individual recognize and reward merit, no matter under what colour of skin merit is found.\" Washington introduces his commentary on physical labor's role in mental preparation with that solid statement, proven true the world over. People are generally more alike than different, united in faith, hope and love, set to the same toil with the same ultimate goal. \"Up From Slavery\" `s central theme corresponds with reality's unprejudiced outcome of individual prosperity through rigorous application. In a progressive attempt to improve society, citizens are bound not by the iron chains of a ruling majority's tyranny but a communal commitment to self-improvement. Although borders, language and culture differentiate ethnic civilizations, their people endeavor for the same fundamental mores. Education, religion, freedom, and a reasonable level of personal satisfaction are sought by all races. Black and white, Asian and Latin American. Catholic, and Jewish, Buddhist and Baptist. English and Spanish, Mandarin and Ebonics. Beneath any layer of flesh, colored or pale, blood runs red as slavery's symbolic rose. People share their humanity if not their race, undivided for the betterment of our society through collective ability. The continuing popularity of Booker T. Washington's \"Up From Slavery\" originally published in 1903 has fostered universal awareness for nearly one person at a time by appealing to the heart, the mind, and the common human soul. When an individual improves his mind, converges the efforts of bodily work and recognizes the plight of fellow human beings, his life is changed. The world glows with the amber of hope for a united future, one person at a time.",

Whoever he was, I never heard of his taking the least interest in me or providing in any way for my rearing. But I do not find especial fault with him. He was simply another unfortunate victim of the institution which the Nation unhappily had engrafted upon it at that time. - Booker T. Washington's Up From Slavery (Chapter 1)Booker T. Washington gives us all the blueprint for how an African man can succeed in the American system. He must forgive any person in power who wrongs him, his family, and/or his community. In the 21st century the African man must perform more acts than forgiveness. He must: erase the bass from his voice, tighten his lips and the rest of his body to minimize African features, show hatred of African people or an indifference to their suffering. If an African man shows any of the attitudes mentioned or a combination of those attitudes, he will succeed in the current American system. You do not have to look to the most famous examples to see African men twisting themselves out of their minds, just look around you, these men are closer than you think.",

I was fascinated and inspired by Washington's quiet and humble manner as he describes what it was like to be a slave as a youth. Washington traces his struggle for an education, and his later challenges and trials as an educator. His account of the building and molding of the Tuskeegee Institute is one of the most inspiring stories I have read in years. Washington did not want to have anything handed to him. He wanted to earn every goal he set for himself, and earn them he did. His influence was and continues to be incredible. This is an amazing book every American should read.",

Washington. I could easily recall reading about him in US history. Interested, I decided to buy it.. Well I ended up staying up all night reading this book... Washington entails his life story of endeavers and prosperity gained. He describes of how he raised himself up from slavery through sacrifices and struggles. With the self-reward of obtaining education he decided to develope the Tuskegee Institution to help further educate his peoples. As well he established a bond between, not only blacks and whites, but southerners and northerners (during post-civil war times). He talks on how as people, one should educate themselves not only in books but in labor as well. In doing so, one will achieve full-on success. &quot;Up from Slavery&quot; enlightened me so much more on Washington. I have gained an enormous amount of respect for this intriguingly compelling man. I really do feel a great sensation of pride in our history when I think about Washington and his achievements for this nation. Beautiful.",
                    "This is an excellent book. I am amazed by the insight and intelligence of Mr. Washington. He created a very powerful legacy. The autobiography shows the desire, of a man fresh from slavery, to succeed and in turn help others do the same. Many of his thoughts are applicable today. Throughout the book, he emphasizes the need to use one's talents and abilities to increase prosperity for not only the current generation but also for the next one. This is a necessary read for anyone desiring success and especially for those that find success in mediocrity.",
                    "If you feel like you have it bad and life has passed you by.... READ THIS BOOK! I usually avoid biographies and autobiographies because they often seem to boast and be egotistic. Booker T. Washington did not strike me as a selfish individual. His whole life centered around education (life-long learning). Think about what a wonderful world we would have if children (and adults) followed this concept. The majority of people never open a book (non-fiction) after they leave school! I have had a solid determination for the past four or five years, to improve my life through books and tapes, and I feel as though I've found my true calling in life... learning! This book is primarily about raising the black race from being enslaved to an educated and highly skilled race. The author was highly instrumental in bringing this process about. He was educated and completed his schooling at the 'Hampton' school with honors. He then built and directed the 'Tuskegee' school in Alabama, and devoted his whole life to service. While this book was very informative, and is considered a milestone by a true pioneer, it is a little bit monotonous, thus four stars. I would highly recommend it nevertheless. Many of the thoughts, attitudes, and sayings of Booker T. Washington have been used by modern authors and speakers, and will live forever. Our country and the black race are forever in his debt for the legacy he left behind. I certainly feel better about life after reading this book. You will too.",
                    "What is most striking about Washington's autobiographical account of his rise from slavery to revered statesman is his lack of resentment toward white culture. Rather than focus on what whites should do to uplift blacks, Washington encouraged blacks to take individual agency over their lives. He believed the best way for blacks to achieve social parity was to become indispensable members of the communities in which they lived. His absolute confidence in black resilience would probably be regarded as naive in today's political discourse. And yet the long list of his (and all black culture's) achievements during this period are unmistakable and nothing short of inspiring.It's a shame this book is on the African American Studies shelf. The lessons from Washington's life apply to all humans, not just blacks. This book would be an excellent addition high school reading lists as a model of the values consonant with personal success.",
                    "I found this to be a most amazing work. In telling the story of going from a child of slavery to the founder and president of the Tuskegee institute, Mr. Washington illustrates for us the life-lessons which can empower any individual or race in our free society today.Namely, look to your neighbor in love, not anger; recognize the nobility in working hard for something rather than expecting charity; be willing to give yourself to a greater cause; believe that people are capable of great things and they will live up to your expectations; recognize the importance of education, not just of the mind, but of the body and soul as well; recognize that any man who provides value to the community in which he lives will be accepted and even welcomed into that community; and above all, trust in God to care for your needs.I highly recommend this book as a testament to the positive result of thinking from a perspective of Love and Abundance rather than Anger and Scarcity. When Mr. Washington's humility is measured against his accomplishments, he becomes in my eyes one of the greatest Americans to have lived.",
                    "Let me start off by saying I'm a 16 year old female...Upon looking through the history section of the store I discovered &quot;Up From Slavery&quot;, the autobiography of Booker T. Washington. I could easily recall reading about him in US history. Interested, I decided to buy it.. Well I ended up staying up all night reading this book.Washington entails his life story of endeavers and prosperity gained. He describes of how he raised himself up from slavery through sacrifices and struggles. With the self-reward of obtaining education he decided to develope the Tuskegee Institution to help further educate his peoples. As well he established a bond between, not only blacks and whites, but southerners and northerners (during post-civil war times). He talks on how as people, one should educate themselves not only in books but in labor as well. In doing so, one will achieve full-on success.&quot;Up from Slavery&quot; enlightened me so much more on Washington and his role in shaping the free life we as americans, live today. I have gained an enormous amount of respect for this intriguingly compelling man. I really do feel a great sensation of pride in our history when I think about Washington and his achievements for this nation. Beautiful.",
                    "This is a very well-written statement of the conservative approach to the quest for Black equality. Written as Booker T. Washington's autobiography, it is important to keep in mind that part of the purpose of this book was to recruit donors to fund the Tuskegee Institute--which meant that Washington needed to emphasize that he was an accomodationist and not in any way a radical. That being said, some of the sentiments expressed in this book seem very over-optimistic in retrospect. For example, Washington says he believes that whites in the South will grant blacks full political rights of their own accord, when blacks are mature enough to deserve them, because people are innately good and will do the right thing. The end of Reconstruction and the advent of Jim Crow laws, along with the intensity of the battle for civil rights, showed him to be mistaken on that point--which is partly why he was eventually eclipsed as a leader by W.E.B. DuBois. Still, this book is a fascinating autobiography and a great statement of the moderate, gradualist approach to attaining equality.",
                    "Everyone should read &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; by Booker T. Washington. Washington was one of the most outstanding people in our history. If he lived today he probably would become President and be one of our greatest Presidents. He had an iron will to achieve his goals in life and to do something to help his people. He started in life in slavery, born to a single mother. Later on he was abused and exploted by his step-father. He overcame tremendous hardships to get an education. He then dedicated his life to helping other African-Americans to improve their lives. He is often criticized for compromising too much with the white establishment. I think however that people need to understand the difficulties of his time and also his way of trying to change people indirectly rather than through direct confrontation. &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; is a great example of this. It is also fun to read. I have a personal reason for liking Washington. In World War II my father was in the Air Corps. For some time the bomber he flew in was protected by the famous Tuskeegee Airmen who were trained at Tuskeegee Institute, founded by Washington. The Tuskeegee Airmen never lost a plane that they escorted. So you see, if it hadn't been for Booker T. Washington I might not be here.",
                    "Over the years, being aware of the great rivalry between Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Dubois I had grown used to Dubois followers saying Booker T. was an accommodationalist Uncle Tom, and other similar statements. I read Up from Slavery as a teenager, and I didn't get that impression from him at the time, so I usually dismissed people's negativity about him as misunderstanding. Having recently re-read the book, it made a far stronger impression on me as an adult and I feel compelled to give my own opinion, especially since the old \"accommodationalist Uncle Tom\" reviews are also on this site.The time period after the slaves were freed was known as Reconstruction. The former slaves were both scared as to what the future held and deeply excited to experience this concept of freedom with the fire and enthusiasm of the Newly Born. For the most part they were very ignorant of their past, of how to establish themselves as a thriving community, how to interact with their white neighbors in a way beneficial to all and how to best use their money and time to grow as individuals. The whites were equally scared as to what the future held (change is often scary) but they were also excited for the former slaves and 100% wished them well. Yes, this was also the time period that formed the KKK, but evil racists were always around and thankfully, then as now, are in the minority.As Booker T. explained, both the owner and the owned had been damaged by the chattel slavery institution. Because the lowest member of society was the slave to whom all menial labor was delegated to, both races saw work/labor as something to be avoided. The whites saw it as something that was beneath them, while the blacks felt they should rise up above it as free men. For them, \"freedom\" meant `I no longer have to work hard.' The blacks felt that if they could get an education they could \"live by their wits\" by teaching, being politicians, preaching or any other profession that required thinking for money, so that they would never have to perform physical work/labor with their hands again. They suffered from many misconceptions as to what made a free person successful, such as purchasing a very expensive item that they couldn't afford as a status symbol to show that they've \"made it\" even going into severe debt to have it. They felt that intensive study into Latin or Greek languages somehow made them superior to other people and that mastery in these fields also proved that they had \"made it.\"Booker T. and Dubois created two models designed to help pull the race forward as a free and successful people.1.) Booker T. Washington's model involved not only a solid education in academics and Qur'anic/Biblical principles (integrity, hard work and patient perseverance) but he also felt that each member of the race should be schooled in industry and the value of Sacred Work/Labor. As opposed to the work they were used to doing as a slave, Sacred Work was the necessary work put forward that not only made an individual indispensable to his community, but it built character, confidence, assurance, dignity and gave the valuable gift of the concept of \"a job well done.\" Each individual was to master a trade (or two or three) that was vital to a community's growth and do that trade to the utmost best of his/her ability so that not only would the community be successful and grow but the neighboring communities would also find that community indispensable. This would promote both a brotherly camaraderie between communities as well as help the economy by increasing the competition in free trade. Booker T's model would enable the average man to be a vital asset to his community which would become structurally solid and a vital asset to the nation's other communities. It is designed to build up the entire black community as a whole while allowing for exceptional individuals (like Booker T. Washington) to excel. This was indeed the American Dream model, that through hard work, determination, persistence and education you can achieve success.Booker T felt that because the black and white races went through slavery together, they needed to be healed together. Starting off with nothing, the former slaves needed help in order to get a foot hold onto their future. His model pulls the races together for their mutual benefit; as the black race builds itself up the white race will benefit in the proper symbiotic relationship between two businesses. Yes, Booker T. rightly saw the growing community of former slaves as a developing business and he recognized that no business achieves its ultimate success without the help of other businesses, in this case the southern and northern whites. Just like FedEx and Kinko's or Exxon and Ford work together and thus enhance each other, Booker T. knew that in order to really be successful both races needed to work together (Didn't Up from Slavery function as a business plan for investors, after all?). Of course for the grand scheme of things, for the sake of his race's success why would Booker T. (or any other black person) alienate whites by continuously putting in their faces the evils of slavery and colonialism? In other words, why would a struggling start-up business alienate the banking industry and other investors by pointing out their wrong doings? They would be cutting their own throats. Obviously, if ever there was a time to forgive and forget Reconstruction was that time. And once the ultimate success had been achieved both races would do whatever they needed to ensure the wellbeing of the partner. If some racist bigots burned a cross on Kinko's lawn and threatened to lynch the manager, don't you think FedEx would also be insulted and demand the practice stop?2.) W. E. B. Dubois was actually the spokesman for the blacks who felt that they shouldn't have to work hard anymore, now they should be free to live the way they watched the whites live for two centuries. In the Dubois model, the individual was encouraged to achieve the highest education he was able to. This would guarantee that the \"Talented Tenth\" (the small percentage of highly gifted individuals among every people) would attain the mega-success that was the American Dream. Dubois felt that it's the Talented Tenth among every race that furthers the goals of the community as a whole, and that the masses would benefit from a Reaganomics-like trickle down effect. This model, encouraging a work-o-phobic attitude and a individual's pursuit of success did nothing to build the black community but gave the hope that whites would accept the blacks into their communities \"because we are free like you and we demand to live equally with you because we say so\" which actually was the attitude that formed the KKK in the first place. Unlike the model of his rival, Dubois did not establish a system that would remove the slave mentality from the people so they would want to work hard in order to elevate themselves. Consequently, the concept of the \"educated fool\" was born, with the black academic full of dead languages and abstract principles with absolutely no practical way of using his education to enhance the quality of his character, dignity, morality, integrity or his community as a whole. His community is a raggedy shambles after only a few years of his living in it, because the slave mentality that the Dubois model perpetuates won't permit him even to take pride in slapping on a new coat of paint, mowing the lawn or cleaning up the trash and beer bottles littered in front of his house. Although the Talented Tenth's accomplishments have moved the race forward in very slow increments the average man, with the idea that work is bad and education only benefits a few, is free only to get in trouble or be used up for someone else's dream while he waits for the next minute advancement from the trickle down effect.Obviously W. E. B. Dubois won the debate. Seeing the Dubois model as the easy route to success, they simply labeled Booker T. as an Uncle Tom and waited for their Talented Tenth to do their thing and never gave another thought about the matter. How they felt about Booker T. was summed up by how actor Moses Gunn played him in the movie Ragtime. Does it feel better knowing that at the end of his life, Dubois admitted that Booker T. was right?No. The damage has now been done. People are fond of saying, \"But we've come so far!\" But have we? We would've come much farther much sooner if we had embraced Booker T's vision instead of Dubois' work-o-phobic, trickle down vision. They make that statement by pointing to the kind, modern white people that live among us today. But there have always been kind-hearted white people who've honestly wished us success! Look where all the money that helped found Tuskegee and the Hampton Institute came from. Look at the reality of our progress. As a community, after over a century since the Emancipation Proclamation, we have the same mentality we had as newly freed slaves. Instead of a household sharing a single fork and wasting all of their money on an organ that we can't play, now we've replaced the organ with a Cadillac Escalade or a Coach bag or some rims. Our communities are chaotic and scattered with no concept of leaving a legacy for our children. We lack the business savvy to own our own community shops and stores so that corporate predators can take advantage and just take our money out of our communities.Without Booker T's life training fundamentals we still are in need of therapy for the centuries of chattel slavery we've gone through and so are the descendants of our former masters. Just like we have made little progress past the legacy of slavery's inferiority complex so they are still suffering from the superiority complex slavery gave to them. For the whites, they don't see anything wrong with building up vast wealth off of the blood, sweat and tears of others and giving them as little compensation as they can get away with. They honestly don't see anything wrong with playing with the worker's minds to make them feel they are getting a good deal. Because of this, the old wealthy white families who've built their money through slave labor and their peers actually sought how they could continue to take advantage of black slave labor without breaking the new anti-slavery laws. I believe that Up from Slavery is an excellent model as to how the black race can pull itself together into an awesome community, but I also believe that the warped mind suffering under a superiority complex can \"reverse engineer\" the book and use it to prevent such a community from forming in the first place.STEP ONEDestroy all existing examples of strong black communitiesSTEP TWOPull out the wealthiest, most productive members of the community leaving the ignorant, defenseless poorSTEP THREEAllow drugs and alcohol to flow freely into the ranks of the poor so that their frustrations and stress will ignite into various crimesSTEP FOURPaint the picture in the popular media (both bluntly and subliminally) that these people are prone to criminal behavior anywaySTEP FIVEWith the public's approval, round them up and fill up the prisons with them. Now they are the property of the State, and can be legally contracted out as slave labor... continuing where we left off.If Dubois' model had not have been adopted, we would have been the ultimate success story, a strong and vibrant community making a major contribution to our nation's prosperity and our own people's legacy. Of course it's not too late to fix it. All we have to do is stop calling Booker T. Washington an \"accommodating Uncle Tom\" and get to work.",
                    "&quot;Up from slavery&quot; documents the rise of Booker T. Washington, from a plantation slave to the head of Tuskegee college in Alabama. Along the way his narrative details the squalor and humiliations of his childhood and ends with a number of journalistic adulations regarding his career and speeches. It is a wonderful book, yet curious.Unlike Frederick Douglass, the severe critic of the slaveholding South, Washington's outlook is decidedly postive. He refuses to get into any kind of individual or group bashing, but prefers to dwell on the successes of blacks, improving race relations, and the success of his school- and students. He becomes enamored of his own success on the stump, but such is the case with most ambitious, forward looking individuals. I would have liked a bit more criticism, and fewer excerpts from the newspapers of his time (regarding his speech-making ability.) His repeated refrains about service and merit (being the only true measure of a man), are sound. All in all, this is an upbeat, inspiring story from a man who truly defied the odds, and his winning attitude is sorely needed today.",
                    "&quot;Up From Slavery&quot; brought to light the real deal behind the man Booker T. Washington. Before reading it, I was taught to believe that he accommodated and assimilated himself and the African American race to that of the white race. It has to be made known that Booker T. Washington was born into an era where the slave mentality was not only prominent but socially acceptable. To understand his conservative efforts, you'd have to understand the fact that he achieved everything in life by hard labor. Therefore, in order to promote economic and social equality, he had to promote issues that led to these things. In other words, he felt that the newly freed blacks were not ready to integrate themselves into white society, a society that did not respect their freedom at all. He wanted African Americans to embrace a nationalistic attitude before asking white society to embrace it. If blacks were seen as the uncouf beings that we were thought to be...acceptance would never occur. So, in using every resource available including accommodation, Washington underhandedly promoted social and racial equality for all.",
                    "Booker Washington rose to fame as a great American because of his intense understanding of the American system of government and his ability to stay focused. Booker obviously understood the impact of slavery on his race and that freedom alone was not enough in a country that did not respect that freedom. Booker's ideology coincided with that of Frederick Douglas who would have made the speech at the Atlanta Exposition, but he died earlier that year.Booker's speech was &quot;nationalistic&quot; as he told his listeners to be as seperate as the fingers on the hand and to cast down your buckets where you are. It appears to me that he prefered separation, and individualized education geared towards economic empowerment of the newly freed &quot;negroes&quot;. 90% of all the black people in this country had been slaves and lived below the Mason-Dixon Line. The other 10% were free, yet not free. Tuskegee (Institute) University attests to his abilites as a monument builder. &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; is a story within a story. Booker T. Washinton, according to Louis Harlan was a &quot;wizard&quot;. Even W.E.B. Dubois in his latter years, prior to joining the Communist Party began to agree with many of Washington's philosophies. Booker T. Washington was a politican and a technicrat. He got the job done.",

Washington was born in Virgina at a slave hut. Washington attended the school Hampton. In order for him to get in this fine school, he had to sweep and clean the speaking room, one day the superintendent came by with a white glove and ran her finger across every piece of furniture, no dust. The superintendent was so impressed she enrolled him at Hampton, this just lets you know how much he wanted to learn.",

                    "I feel that I have met an extraordinary man of history after reading &quot;Up From Slavery&quot;. This book is an autobiography by Professor Booker T Washington (1856-1915). He was born into the deplorable condition of genocide which bears the euphemism of &quot;slavery&quot;. He found a way through iron will and determinism to &quot;do a thing that the world wants done&quot; enabling to &quot;make a living for himself and others&quot; through embracing the joy and love of labor. His greatest accomplishment was the founding and building of the Tuskegee Institute of Normal and Industrial Institute from a chicken shack to a school with assets of over $500,000 free from mortgage. He rose to national and international attention as the most influential African-American of his time with his famous speech calling people to &quot;cast down your bucket where you are.&quot; People who accomplish great things are controversial, and Professor Washington was no different. Dr W E B Du Bois in &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot; wrote of Professor Washington, &quot;His doctrine has tended to make the whites, North and South, shift the burden of the Negro problem to the Negro's shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic spectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation, and the hands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting these great wrongs.&quot; During the Civil Rights struggles of the 1960's Washington's philosophy was called into question by none other than the great Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who wrote in his book &quot;Why We Can't Wait&quot;, &quot;Be content [Washington] said in effect, with doing well what the times permit you to do at all. However, this path, they soon felt, had too little freedom in its present and too little promise in its future.&quot; These are the issues that continue to develop, and will, I suspect, for some time to come. I was most impressed by the capacity for Professor Washington to forgive. Of all his impressive accomplishments, this is one that spoke to me undeniably of his courage and strength. He forgives the man who sired him, a man worthy of the title &quot;father&quot; only in the strict biological sense. Professor Washington writes, &quot;Whoever he was, I never heard of his taking the least interest in me or providing in any way for my rearing. But I do not find especial fault with him. He was simply another unfortunate victim of the institution which the Nation unhappily had engrafted upon it at that time.&quot; Some contend that his attitudes were politically motivated, yet, I do not see what Professor Washington would stand to gain by forgiving the man who &quot;fathered&quot; him. With unblemished sincerity, he forgave his slave masters, (&quot;man-stealers&quot;, as Frederick Douglass called them). Professor Washington wrote, &quot;I pity from the bottom of my heart any nation or body of people that is so unfortunate as to get entangled in the net of slavery. I have long since ceased to cherish any spirit of bitterness against the southern white people on account of the enslavement of my race.&quot; He genuinely felt that he was far better off than his masters because, &quot;the slave system on our place, in a large measure, took the spirit of self reliance and self-help out of the white people.&quot; Why would he believe this? The epitome of his life's goal was to find and do something which was valued. The very thing his masters could not do. &quot;My old master had many boys and girls, but not one, so far as I know, ever mastered a single trade or special line of productive industry.&quot; Some may, after reading this book, still feel that Professor Washington's attitudes were politically motivated. I cannot accept that idea. I have never known any one nor do I believe it is possible to feign this level of forgiveness. It is my opinion that Professor Booker T Washington is a reflection of a love which is divine. This is one of the reasons I am so impressed with this man, and this book.",

Washington and his march from slavery to one of the foremost men of his time.His views may seem quite antiquated in today's world, given what has happened and not happened in the last 100 years in race relations and it is easy to see how Black leaders of today might be critical of Washington's views and perspectives.But to do so would be to make the all too common mistake of imprinting and transferring today's value system and experiences on a culture and time of long ago. Anyone can look back with 20-20 hindsight and criticize. What matters most is having a plan to move forward from where you are, and Booker T. Washington certainly had that. His is a remarkable story of courage, grace, and iron-willed determination, for himself and for his race.While today's leaders and purists might criticize Washington, it should never be forgotten that he took the first steps and led his race and the entire South in the first steps, no matter how imperfect they may be in hindsight, up and away from slavery.There had to be a Booker T.

Booker T was a master orator from his own accounts. Surely all the invitations received (with no marketing or self-promotion) is a testament to his skill as an orator. Slow but sure progress is made. The language is easy to understand yet the structure is complex because there are lessons to be learnt on many levels.

Given his start in life, he had uncanny insight and an innate understanding of the complexities of post-slavery race relations. I think every person on this planet would benefit from reading this book.",

It if wasn't for them, he would've never achieved the accomplishments he has.",
                    "i ordered Up from Slavery because I thought I needed to read it. However, I found I wanted to read it. I recommend it for all Americans. It was truely inspirational.",
                    "Booker Ts story really inspires. It just shows that with positive thinking and motivation, tremendous difficulties, odds and challenges are beatable. It's a message many of us would gain from if we would just stop complaining and blaming others for our lot in life, and just get moving on up!I've reviewed the CreateSpace edition, ISBN 1438268165. It's a clear, easy to read version, well designed and the print and binding are excellent. Highly recommended!",
                    "Wow! What an amazing story! It is fascinating to read Booker T. Washington's account of a childhood in slavery followed by his rise to national prominence as the founder of the Tuskegee Institute.While some may argue that Washington was naive and overly accomodating, I was amazed at his ability to forgive and see the best in people. He did not nurse grudges or let others bring him down. Whether or not you feel that he should have spoken up more for judicial equality, you have to admit that he was a strong, dedicated man of character.Everyone: white, black, brown, or any other shade, can benefit from reading the autobiography of this great American.",
                    "What a wonderful gift to give history buffs or African-Americans. Booker T. Washington began with nothing, not even a last name, and he drove himself to learn to read and become educated. I plan to read this book over and over, and I have highlighted several quotes that I intend to quote to my friends when they are complaining about trivial things. I also recommend the fictional The Journal of Darien Dexter Duff, an Emancipated Slave, The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo, and The Journal of Leroy Jeremiah Jones, a Fugitive Slave. All are chock full of history while being easy to read and fun. And they include photos. Read all of these fine books.",
                    "This book is hard to get into at first because Washington, in my opinion, isn't the greatest writer. He writes using many run-on sentences and MANY, MANY commas with phrases that can distract you from the meaning of the sentence (as a rule, notwithstanding, to such an extent, this is to say etc...) he seems to state his observations as if it is a fact. He tells how there were such great relations between blacks &amp; whites throughout the south and blacks held ABSOLUTELY NO resentment towards their slaveowners. I found that hard to believe (how would he know when he was just a slave?) Many of his &quot;facts&quot; didn't seem to agree with history and what I thought slavery and black/white relations were like. He almost seemed ignorant to what was probably happening around him. He goes on to tell about his life and spends at least 1/2 of the book talking about his school in Tuskegee...after a while it gets boring and you want to hear some interesting stories about HIM! I didn't think the book was too great or very informative at all.",
                    "I read this book as a part of a class. In this class we discussed Washington's work as written from the 'trickster' perspective. In this light it was quite interesting to see how he points out hypocrasies indirectly, while apparently stating the opposite. Thus, creating a self-aware hypocrasy within the text itself. I'm not sure that I am yet convinced, however. The work often seems a little bit on the acquiescent side to me.",
                    "This book was the most boring book I have ever read. There was no point to the whole book, because all he talked about was his accomplishments and things that other people wrote about him. This book has no suspenseful or interesting parts in it. I feel that no one could ever like this book.",
                    "This is the most boring book I've ever read. I didn't even finish it. Booker T. Washington is not a very good writer (which isn't surprising because he had very little education). Booker T. Washington was born a slave--interesting, was emancipated by Abraham Lincoln, then traveled from West Virginia to Virginia to go to school, graduated and then eventually got invited to start his own school in Alabama. So he started a school. That is not interesting or invigorating or special. Why would you want to read about a guy who started his own school? Is that that fascinating or interesting? He didn't escape a slave or anything like that, he was emancipated like everyone else and then went to school like many people did--nothing interesting. Why don't we all just write autobiographies about ourselves because we feel like it?",
                    "The original. He was kind of cool, but now he ain't; people using his backwardness against us. Forget this dude, or perish. 1896 speech was a total sell out to da man.Drop ya boots, dawg!!!It",
                    "I loved this book. It made me think about what it was like to be a slave and the challenges they faced and over came. I found this book extremely interesting",
                    "This book should be required reading in every high school in the U.S. We long for an end to racial prejudice, and Booker T. Washington points the way. If we grasped and applied his understanding of human nature and his work ethic, imitated his generous and forgiving nature, and practiced what he taught, what benefits we would reap! Many of our social ills would disappear. He sets a high and lofty standard for us all.",
                    "Booker T. Washington worked and learned and built and taught. Hard, every day.This is how a man lives.And his work is not finished yet. I am proud to join his cause.",
                    "the book gives you an outlook on slavery and how it was in those times. I find these books to be very interesting, just to give me a little more knowledge on my history and hope to learn something that i don't already know.",
                    "This is an excellent book. I enjoyed reading Mr. Washington's autobiography very much. His lessons on hard work and dedication to duty, God and to \"the race\" are timeless.",
                    "I think everyone should read this, especially children. He has a strong work ethic and positive attitude about life and relationships between races. I love learning about history. I really enjoyed reading this book and learning about post slavery life.",
                    "This book is a must for todays generation and for those who feel in a minority. It is a great encouragement as to what a person or group of people can do if they set the mind to it and are willing to exert some effort. There have been times that my wife and I cleaned toilets for a living and we determined to do the best job we could. This book helps me to have another reason as to why we did that.",
                    "I found this book at first hard to read but as I continued to push on I found that the works of Mr. Washington were making a deep impact on not only my intellect but also my inner spirit. My first interest in this book was to understand how the Tuskeege school started because I am one of the privliged americans that can trace the education of my ancestors back to the begining classes of the institute. As I continued to read I began to feel even more pride in the achievments on my grandfather, mother and myself. The only thing that puzzled me was the consitent mentioning of how the southern whites were so helpful in the rise and start of the negro's education. Personally the stories I have heard speak to the oppisdit actions and I am lead to ask the question - if the was such a united feeling amoungsdt the blacks and the whites in the northen and southern states addressing the education of the negro race then where on earth did it start to go wrong? For that answer I will have to continue to research and speak to the elder members of my family because I just can't understand how we went from one united beliefe of education to the fight of our civil rights.",
                    "Booker T. Washington tells his story in a compelling way that he never could have guessed would have affected the future generations in this way. This is a book that will put things in perspective and it contains a lot of life lessons. While in many ways we have moved forward as a country there are so many mindsets that are exactly the same as what is stated in the pages of 'Up from Slavery'. Read this book and then think about how you live your life. You won't be the same.",
                    "I picked this up recently and read it over the course of a couple weeks. This isn't a book just about the struggle of a single man or a single race. It is a book about what is possible with dedication to an idea. Few people could overcome the obstacles that Booker T. Washington overcame. It isn't that we are physically incapable, but that we aren't willing to sacrifice today for future benefit. Everyone can get something from this book.",
                    "Alina Stanton Nov.15Up From SlaveryThe author of this book is Booker T. Washington. This book is about Booker T Washington. It's an autobiography of how he grew up as a slave and as a free man. It shows the struggles that a lot of poor slaves had when they were freed from slavery.When Booker was young he lived with his mom on one plantation, his dad lived on another. He lived with his mom, half brother, half sister and step dad. Booker really wanted an education, so he started to teach himself to read. He had an English dictionary that emphasized on the alphabet and he read it all the time. Soon the slaves were freed. Booker started going to a day school once it opened up. He was not able to go to school later on because he had to work in a coal mine with his dad. He made a deal with his dad to work on the coalmines early in the morning till nine then goes to school. When he was a little older he decided to go to a school called Hampton Institute in West Virginia. You can live there and work as well as go to school.While he lived there he had to work hard. He had to make money all the ways he could. He worked as a waitress a maid and a janitor. He met a general by the name of Armstrong. He respected this man a lot because he was very important. Booker felt honored to meet such a wealthy man, he liked the general a lot because he was very kind. General Armstrong gave Booker a personal check, which he had been saving for his own use, to help Tuskegee. That summer after his first year in the institute he had to work to pay off a sixteen-dollar debt. His mother died during the summer, he knew that he would never see her again. He graduated that year and then went to teach at the school that he attended when he was a boy. In 1878 he entered Wayland Seminary in Washington D.C. for a year of study. While he was there he made speeches in West Virginia for General Garfields presidency campaign. He graduated first class in Tuskegee in 1885.In my opinion, this is a descent book. It shows how the poor slaves grew up in a white world and how they struggled. It has a lot of information on Bookers life and how he struggled to make a good living and get a good education. I think Booker T. Washington is a well mannered, honorable man.",
                    "As a 21st century African American, I must take issue with Mr. Washington's statement regarding how in all things social we can be totally seperate and unequal.Even though I can understand the practicality and expediency of making that sort of concession At That Time in history I still must question whether or not a statement such as that is a representation of true liberty and justice for all. In my mind it is not. It wasn't true then and it still isn't true today.Despite the tremendous Economic strides that have been made by people of color globally and particularly in the U.S., thanks in no small part to the efforts of great people like Mr. Washington, the society at large has remained very stratified. Attitudes though much improved have largely remained the same. Statements like the esteemed Mr. Washington's have too often served to dismiss the responsibility of offenders to remedy past wrongs which still have impact in the present day. They also serve to deny true equality of opportunity to all citizens. It also accomodates the offenders far greater than is deserved and does grave injustice to black and white alike. Mr. Washington makes reference himself to how injustices done to the black populace are just as injurious to the white population. Yet he does not view social seperatism as an injustice. With that I must take issue.All that notwithstanding it is an interesting, informative, and enjoyable read. Many of the principles by which he lived are as true today as they were during Reconstruction. However, certain opinions that he expressed could have the effect of limiting economic opportunity by confining Blacks to the ranks of laborers rather than entrepreneurs, managers, and other professionals if too stringently adhered to. These pursuits require concentrated study and effort by themselves.So read it but be sure to place it in the proper context.",
                    "Booker T. Washington never blames slavery for his problems. Instead he looks forward to the future, and works hard to create a school that helpsblack people.He has a positive attitude which attracts the help he needs to build his school. We can all learn from Booker T. Washington.Very inspiring.I loved this book.",

                    "Washington was born into slavery as a result of his mother having been raped by her master. This autobiography is a recounting of his struggle from slavery to freedom and on to getting an education and becoming a teacher and then an educational administrator as well as a \"Black politician.\"In American culture, this narrative is cast as the quintessential \"raise yourself by your boot strap\" kind of story. In fact when I was in the First Grade, I can remember my First grade teacher, Mrs. Pogue, singing the praises of \"the Great Booker T. Washington.\"And while there is a great deal to admire about Mr. Washington, there is also a side that only came to light after hearing the other side of his story. Washington was called an \"accommodationist,\" \"or \"the great compromiser,\" which in the context of the times were euphemisms for being an \"Uncle Tom,\" or the HNIC. He was good at maneuvering his way around in a racist white culture thinking that he was doing his people a great deal of good when in fact he was being taken advantage of, or when he was in fact consciously \"selling his people out.\" By making a \"virtue, out of personal necessity,\" Washington always had a good justification for his action and eventually became the prototype of this kind of black politician. Many Black preachers still use the Washington template for handling cross-racial situations. Plus how else were blacks to negotiate the difficult racist political terrain of those difficult times?In the book, for instance, he eschews and discourages blacks from seeking a liberal arts education and from attending college, as being frivolous. He argued for the more practical area of the \"manual arts,\" and \"the trades.\" While this may have been useful -- even good advice -- in the context of the times, there were others of his contemporaries, such as WEB Dubois, who saw Washington's approach as strictly a formulaic kind of Uncle Tomism. And the embarrassing treatment of him at the 1905 World's Fair, kind of sealed this image of him as a Black Uncle Tom by blacks and a \"stooge\" by whites.While the book is a good read, in retrospect, it shows Washington to have been very nave politically, and too trusting of \"the white man,\" who it seems never quite saw the world as he did and neither had Washington's, nor the black race's best interests in mind. Maybe it is a bit harsh to judge his action after the fact, but all other black leaders are judged by the same criteria and they come out unblemished, while Washington's accommodationist methods do not seem to have held up well over time nor have they bore any fruit.Three Stars",
                    "I feel that Washington's book was very much like he was, and that is two-faced. It may have been true that he needed white support in order to get money for blacks but I feel that he didn't tell the story the way it should have been told. Slavery was a lot harsher than Washington wrote it was, this book was too carefree in dealing with the harshness of slavery. He wrote the book for the white man to read so that he could get their support and their money. He was the Benedict Arnold of the black folk.",
                    "I read this book, here in Cear&aacute;, a state of Brazil.Even being an agronomist, I love to read books.This book is 100% available for free reading, on internet.This book was writen about 100 years ago, by an african-american , Booker T. Washington.Born in a slum, having as his mother, a black slave, as a child, Booker T. Washington became free.His father was a white man, and never recognized or create him.In fact, Booker T. Washington had a bitter childhood.Having a childhood cored in poverty, racism, prejudices, ignorance and hard labor; instead of becaming a neurotic, Booker T. Washington became a leader and teaching example for african-americans of his times.In fact many lessons of this book continuos to be usefull for every time, race or place.If you go to all my reviews that I writen before, just one autobiography that I gave five stars was, \"World of Yesterday\" by Stephan Zweig.To be sincere in an autobiography is very, very rare.One problem of this autobiography, is again his lack of sincerity.The author was writing about 100 years ago, and perhaps he couldn't tells us, what he was really thinking.To example, Booker T. never claims that segregation, racism/eugenics is/were by definition, bad.In fact, there's many good claims to some knowed eugenicists/racists at that times.The bitter author's childhood (a nightmare childhood), has very little space in this book.In fact, the sucess of Booker T. in education affairs has, big space in this book.Too much space, I think.If we were in 1906, I'll be giving five stars to this book.Being unsincere and having by today standards, some absurds, this book isn't useless, but we aren't in 1906.",
                    "I read Up From Slavery in an African American Lit class, and was totally applauled by it. Washigton is so complaicent, the man was not even angry with white people for four hundred years of slavery. The debate between Washington and WEB DuBois is famous: Wash. wanted black people to forgive and forget and continue to be the southerners work dogs. DuBois wanted the negro race to embrace higher education and follow in the footsteps of wealthy Americans like Rockefeller and Carnegie. Which plan was better for uplifting a race? It depends upon which direction the country was going at the turn of the century.",
                    "I thought this was supposed to be an autobiography! All he talks about is his school. He mentions his wife and kids only once or twice. I got the impression that he was a very selfish man. Plus, to top it off, the book was boring!",
                    "This book talks of slavery in a positive light. Two thirds of the book is telling about the school he opened, briefly mentioning his personal or home life.",

                    "In 1901, Booker T. Washington (1856-1915) published this autobiography. Born into slavery, after emancipation, Mr. Washington developed a philosophy that African-Americans needed to sweep away the ignorance that their subservient position had left them with, and earn the respect of the whites through hard work and excellence. In 1881 he founded the Tuskegee Institute to teach African-Americans how to study, how to work hard and intelligently (producing better results than the white businesses of the day), and how to have respect for themselves and others. This is Mr. Washington's story of his youth and his success at Tukegee.This is a fascinating and uplifting book. Though cognizant of the racism that often surrounded him, Mr. Washington never lost his faith in the basic goodness of the people of all colors that he met. The only problem I had with this excellent book was the knowledge I could not shake, that Mr. Washington's faith was not rewarded, and the white community of the day would not give the African-American community respect and fair treatment.That said, though, this is a great and wonderful book, which should rightly be considered an American classic. If you want to read a book that is a window on the America of the late nineteenth century, or if you want an uplifting book about a man of faith and love, then I highly recommend that you get this book!",

                    "What can I say! I was totally inspired and enthused by reading Up from Slavery! The insight of Booker T Washington, his undying faith and determination is inspiring to say the least! And the principles he speaks of are timeless and relate to people of all skin colors. He had a blue print for the success of a people. Regretfully, I believe we have lost the vision Washington shared! I can only hope and pray that we will regain that vision.",
                    "This book gives an excellent insight into Booker T's life. The unknowns, the lack of a childhood and the fear that existed then is unimaginable. This book gives inspiration to those who would be thinking of giving up.",
                    "I've long wanted to read this book and finally did in two days. It was a rewarding experience. Booker T. Washington was a great man born into slavery, into abject poverty, on a plantation in Virginia. He never knew his father or even his birthday. Washington was six or seven years old when the War Between the States ended. He lived in a slave cabin with his mother, his older brother John, his younger brother and sister, and an orphan boy. His mother, the cook for the \"big house\" was an illiterate as most slaves were, but a strong woman of common sense who cared for her family as best she could. Their cabin was primitive with a dirt floor no windows and poorly protected from the elements.After the war Booker moved with his mother and step father to West Virginia where he was put to work in the salt mines. Determined to get some schooling he did so at night with great difficulty.Washington heard about a school for Negroes in Virginia called Hampton. He set out on foot with 50 cents in his pocket. He eventually reached Hampton and went to school there working his way through as a janitor.Booker T. Washington met race prejudice, poverty, and illiteracy and overcame all of these obstacles.He went on to establish Tuskegee Institute in Alabama for his people. It educated boys and girls not only in academics but in agriculture and useful trades. He started the school from nothing raising all the money from contributions and the hard work of he and his students. The school still exists today and is thriving.\"Up From Slavery\" is an inspiring book. It should be on everyone's list as a must read.",
                    "I read this book with my 12 year old as part of a book club.I didn't know much about Booker T. Washington,and this book was very interesting.He was truly a remarkable man living in a time of extreme change for our country.I feel I now have a broader view of the post slavery South then I had,even growing up there.",
                    "This book is one in a vast library of African American literary history that I posses. It is academically written, yet very easy to read. The contents of this text continue to inspire my will to be a great humanitarian, world citizen, and advocate for African education, science, medicine, and unity",
                    "This is one of America's great books, and Booker T. Washington was a great American.Washington was born into slavery, freedom came when he was about six years old. As a child, he worked at farming and coal mining, while he sought an education. All of this time he lived in base poverty.After saving what little money he could, he set out from his home in West Virginia, for a black school in Virginia. The school was run by a retired Union Army officer, who recognized Washington's ability.Washington worked his way through school, graduated, and headed home to West Virginia to establish a school for blacks. There wasn't much money in it, but his dream was to help his people escape from ignorance and poverty.When the state of Alabama wanted to establish a school for blacks, the Tuskegee Institute, Washington was chosen to run it. His budget was pitiful, and he started teaching school in a dilapidated shanty and a hen house. His students tolerated these conditions, along with grinding poverty, because that's what it took to receive an education.The school always insisted that all students work while they study. They raised crops and animals, made bricks for sale, and built the various buildings which were needed to hold the school's ever expanding population.Money was always short, and Washington had to spend a lot of his time in the North raising funds. He was a talented speaker, and became famous on that account. He eventually formed relationships with a number of wealthy patrons, who provided funds to run and expand the Tuskegee Institute.By the time the book was written, the Institute had 6000 graduates working across the South, and had trained a large number of teachers to educate southern blacks.This book is valuable, both for the information it holds, and for the fine example of Christian love which Washington models.",
                    "For educational pedagogy, for philanthropical courage, for inspiration and motivation on how to be the best person, read this book. Washington overcame enormous odds with intense ambition; he wanted to do his &quot;level best&quot; everyday.I found his story to be the real thing, the real item in...get this...motivational literature. Of all the self-help books published today, Washington's autobiography reads realistic and true for courage, solid advice, and practical solutions.Washington takes the large view to the race problems of his day. He is more concerned with building better human beings, male and female, regardless of race. His strategies with his students involved enforcing basic health care, instilling focused, daily discipline habits, providing vocational and academic training, and always presenting an overreaching concern for helping others achieve their highest potential. THAT is the good life.",
                    "I found the book to be strange in some regards. Professor Washington seemed to harbor no bad feelings toward any Southerner, or even his former owners. That aside, the book is very interesting. His point of view on slavery and Southern race relations are unlike any other I've heard. Regardless of what another review says, he was definately not a selfish person in any way. He only seemed to care about his school and work, not personal life. He states that he doesnt play any games of any sort. Read this book if you want a refreshing view of post-Civil War race relations.",
                    "Up from Slavery, autobiography by Booker T. Washington, is a true classic in African-American literature. Washington opens Chapter 1: \"A Slave Among Slaves\" with his vivid recollections as a Negro child growing up in the South: a slave on a plantation in Virginia, a white father he never knew, illiterate and living in horrid conditions. After the emancipation of slaves, Washington's family moves to West Virginia where he labors at the salt furnace and in the coal mines. In his precious few moments of spare time, he learns to read and gains enough confidence to leave everything behind to journey to the Hampton Institute. Later, because of his success at Hampton, he is given the opportunity to start Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Tuskegee Institute is successful partly due to Washington's extensive travel to the North to solicit funds for the school. The students at Tuskegee, in addition to the day-to-day traditional class work, are expected to learn an industrious trade and to work at mastering that trade. Based on his own life experience, Washington believes that the most prudent way the Negro race will persevere is through this combination of education, hard work and service to others. He believes that the White race will come to appreciate the Negro race only if the Negro people prove their worth to society. Because of his passive stance, many, such as W.E.B. DuBois, et. al., labeled Washington as \"The Great Accomodator.\" In other words, accommodating those who were the enslavers instead of advocating for the rights of those who were enslaved. You can get a sense of this in Washington's most notable speech, the address to the Atlanta Cotton States and International Exposition of 1895:\"The wisest among my race understand that the agitation of questions of social equality is the extremist folly, and that progress in the enjoyment of all the privileges that will come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle rather than artificial forcing.\"This speech brought national acclaim to Booker T. Washington and, at the time, placed him in the forefront as one of the leading authorities of his race.",
                    "This book is a fascinating historical account of the atmosphere of America during Reconstruction. The opinions of an ex-slave on matters of racial relations, education, suffrage, and so forth are certainly worth considering in any study of this period. I loved Booker T. Washington's autobiography for this.But I also enjoy this book because it has character. Mr. Washington gives bits of advice on how to be a good public speaker - as he was a speaker of much renown - and this was quite delightful as I have often been somewhat confused by such matters. Add to this his endearing stories of the white and black races, and you have yourself an extremely worthwhile and enjoyable read.",
                    "Mr. Washington's book is facinating to me as an American history major. I found that learning from a black man what Reconstruction meant to a lot of former slaves was very enlightening. Mr. Washington offers up a point of view that in many cases, slavery served both black and white people well. The lines between slave owners and the slaves were often blurred; not just due to interracial relations, but socially as well.But, this book is not about slavery. Mr. Washington came from nothing and not only lifted himself up from poverty and ignorance, but determined that his life's work would be to assist others in their own efforts at bettering their lives. I found it terribly ironic that the former slaves, and children thereof, thought that their ultimate goal was to no longer do any kind of manual labor. That is what got this country into trouble. White men relying on others to do their manual labor. Mr. Washington's pragmatic approach to teaching black men and women how to care for themselves and learn a practical trade makes a lot of sense to me.The best parts of this book have to do with Mr. Washington's attitude toward life. His observations and attitudes are so positive and broad, that they are not defined by race. I found myself wanting to highlight and underline parts of the book; but the book I was reading was borrowed. Hence I am going to purchase a copy for myself. I do not buy many books; however, this book is one to keep for life. I am sure to refer to Mr. Washington's book in the future; Not just for historical content, but to keep me on track in life.",
                    "...Up From Slavery Booker T. WashingtonUp From Slavery is an autobiography by Booker Taliaferro Washington. Booker T. Washington was a great man who fought his way out of slavery to become an educator, statesman, and political power. He was born near a crossroads post-office called Hale's Ford, in the year 1858 or 1859. He does not remember the exact year, month or date because it was the time of slavery. He lived in a cabin with his mother, his older brother John and his sister Amanda until after the Civil War when they all were declared free. He does not know any of his history beyond his mother, and less beyond his father. For most of his boyhood life he lived in an old broken down cabin containing no windows and no beds. Almost everyday of his life was occupied by some kind of labor. He had no time for himself or sports. On several occasions he went as far as the schoolhouse door with one of the young mistresses to carry her books. The picture of several dozen boys and girls in a classroom engaged in study had always made a big impression on him. He felt that to get into a schoolhouse and study in the way they did would be about the same as being in paradise. After the slaves were freed there were two points that the blacks throughout the south agreed on: That they must change their names and they must leave the old plantation for at least a few days or weeks to feel sure that they were free. After freedom was declared Booker's stepfather sent for his mother and the whole family to come to the Kanawha Valley, in West Virginia. Booker always had an intense longing to learn to read. When he was young he determined that if he accomplished nothing else in life, he would some way get enough education to enable him to read common books and newspapers. He worked in a coal mine to help pay for his education. He overheard a few people talking about Hampton University it struck his interest. He set many of his goals to go there and get a good education. One teacher that influenced Booker T. Washington was Mrs. Ruffner. She encouraged and sympathized with him in all of his efforts to get an education. While working for her he was allowed one hour a day to go to school. While living with her he began to get his first library together. In 1872 he set out to Hampton Institute a school in West Virginia, he didn't know how much it would cost or where it was. His brother helped him out with the money. When he left his mother was very weak and broken in health he hardly expected to see her again, so parting with her was very hard for him. He had to sleep on the streets because the white would not let him stay in the hotel. He had many interactions like this one. He began working for a captain in a seaport unloading crates. Booker gained his entrance to Hampton Institute by cleaning a room for Miss Mary Mackie, the lady principal. Mr S. Griffths Morgan of New Medford, Mass. from 1872-1876 donated his tuition scholarship. Booker graduated from Hampton Institute in 1875. Booker returned to Hampton Institute and started the night school to aid deserving students. In conclusion this book Up From Slavery is a very well written book. It has many details on the life of Booker T. Washington. I recommend it to young kids who enjoy reading about history and how the slaves were freed."

                "description": "During & after the Civil War hundreds of Quaker women went south as ministers & teachers to the freed people. These women left comfortable homes & often deferred marriage or put aside the demands of families, if not careers, in response to what they perceived as a divine call. They faced prejudice, ridicule, abuse, & sometimes violence at the hands of Southern whites for whom education of black people was an unthinkable challenge to a racist political & social system that dated back two-&-a-half centuries. As Selleck shows, while by our standards these women were not always free from the prejudice they worked to overcome, they certainly were far in advance of the overwhelming majority of their contemporaries. Quakers may have recognized the evil of slavery earlier than their neighbors, but once they \"cleared\" themselves of it, their patterns of reluctance to admit black members, & their segregation of those they did admit, were little different from the practice of the larger society. This is also a contribution to women's history. In many ways, the women described were building a long-established tradition of feminine benevolence that was hardly unique to Friends; in others they foreshadowed the civil rights activists who went south in the 1960s.",

This book is so great because it lacks the ideological and political biases that permeate nearly 90 percent of the voucher books out there. Despite what the previous reviewer stated I wish to defend Howell and Peterson's book (which needs no defending from me). Their book which is put out by the Brookings Institute (hardly an ideologically driven think-tank Brookings is the model of centrism) Howell and Peterson formulate their empirical data from randomized field trials. RFTs are the gold standard in empirical research studies that seek to compare two groups of individuals while controlling for one factor. In this case Howell and Peterson are able to control for the much noted self-selection bias problematic to many voucher studies and show that African-American students from similar economic and educational backgrounds score significantly (1 standard deviation)higher when they are educated in parochial/private schools than in their neighborhood public schools. A wealth of research from 99.9 percent of all the other scholars studying this topic have in one shape or form supported that finding--that black students do improve upon going to a private school viz. a voucher. Only Alan Krueger and Zho (2004) of Princeton discredit parts of the study, but they refuse to control for baseline data which does not allow them to control the self-selection bias. Furthermore Krueger et al. uses a questionable racial classification scheme where self-identified black/hispanic folks are reclassified as African-American/non-hispanic. In the final analysis its hard to disagree with Peterson and Howell and the above reviewer does so at his own peril. These folks are professionals in the truest sense of the word and they work at the venerable Harvard Program on Education and Governance Policy--please don't try to mislead people into thinking they are overly ideologically motivated.",

This book explores that question by analyzing how the Planet of the Apes films functioned both as entertaining adventures and as apocalyptic political commentary. Informative and thought provoking, the book demonstrates how this enormously popular series of secular myths used images of racial and ecological crisis to respond to events like the Cold War, the race riots of the 1960s, the Civil Rights movement, the Black Power movement, and the Vietnam War. The work utilizes interviews with key filmmakers and close readings of the five Apes films and two television series to trace the development of the series' theme of racial conflict in the context of the shifting ideologies of race during the sixties and seventies. The book also observes that today, amid growing concerns over race relations, the resurgent popularity of Apes and Twentieth Century--Fox's upcoming film may again make Planet of the Apes a pop culture phenomenon that asks who we are and where we are going.",

                    "As a die-hard fan of the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; movie series, I eagerly snapped up this book. While the author makes good points in showing the cultural events that ended up in the &quot;Apes&quot; movies (the peace marchers, etc), he goes overboard in trying to read something into EVERYTHING the movies contained. Everything. Case in point: he tries to say that Taylor in the first movie being hosed down was tied to the use of water hoses on civil rights protestors. He completely overlooks the possibility that Taylor was hosed because animals are sometimes hit with water to stop frowned on activity. Since Taylor was seen as an animal by the Apes, that's the way they treated him. As Freud once said, &quot;Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.&quot; It isn't necessary for all of the strained connections to then-current politics. There are enough in the movies that could stand on their own but I suppose that wouldn't be enough to warrent a full-scale book. Another major drawback with the book is the pc, far left, psuedo-history of the Vietnam War era that the author constantly references (Exactly why does Nixon, the rightist, get the blame for Vietnam when it was for the most part leftist democrat Lyndon Johnson and democrat JFK who waded the U.S. into Vietnam? It was Nixon who pulled the U.S. out, not a leftist. And exactly why does Vietnam become an &quot;imperialist venture&quot;, when a sizable amount of the South Vietnamese supported U.S. aid?). Read this only after seeing the movies and reading an accurate history of the Vietnam War era.",
                    "It is sad to see this foolish &quot;deconstruction&quot; of a diluting (the movies) of a brilliant novel selling well while the novel itself is out of print. The author of this study has nothing interesting to say about the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; movie series, and the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; movie series is valuable only as an advertisement for the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; novel anyway. Read &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; instead.",
                    "I can see Eric Greene at a party. Someone asks him &quot;what would you like to write a book about?&quot; Eric replies &quot;the underlying messages of race &amp; politics in the Planet of Apes movies&quot;. There is a general stirring of nostalgia among the crowd. Comments like &quot;I loved those movies as a kid&quot;, &quot;That ending- wow!&quot; are heard. The crowd urges Eric to go on and share his ideas. Four hours later, Eric is still going on about minute hidden symbolic meanings in what were essentially B pictures. A few stragglers from the crowd remain, numb and glassy eyed.Would have liked the book more if it had about half the politicizing and twice the trivia. Shallow but true.",
                    "Greene also does the text commentary on the 35th anniversary DVD of the original PLANET OF THE APES movie, and you can see why he was chosen. His deep insights into that film, and the ones that follow, are an absolute joy to read. If only the producers of the dismal remake of PLANET OF THE APES had read Green's book, they'd perhaps have understood how deeply symbolic and profound the original was. Although this is a scholarly work, it is also just a whole heck of a lot of fun. Five stars.",
                    "I'm writing this review immediately after finishing the book and I have to give author Greene a rousing round of cyber-applause. This book is a refreshingly intelligent look into not just the Apes franchise, but pop culture in general. Anyone attempting a serious examination of film (of any sort) could do worse than study Mr. Greene's method.The real miracle here is that it's very entertaining to read while being so darn smart. Quite a trick.Unenlightened reviews on this page criticize Eric for reading too much into Apes, but I think he presents solid arguments for every one of his points and (more importantly) supporting interviews with the parties involved.There are scores of shallow, publicity-driven &quot;examinations&quot; on thousands of films and TV shows, but very, very few are this thoughtful and well-researched. I was delighted to read something substantial for a change.I say if this book is too deep for you, there are plenty of Apes coloring books on eBay...and please try to stay in the lines while coloring .I was disapointed to see no other books available by this author. A Greene-eye look at CLASSIC Trek, CLASSIC Outer Limits, Alien Nation, and especially Babylon 5 would be most welcome indeed.",
                    "Eric Greene's book is a thoughtful discussion of the ideas present in the Apes movies. Even if the makers might deny that they intended them to be social commentary, the Apes movies certainly inspire a review of the social scene in the 1960's from which these movies sprang forth.By comparison, how something like Star Wars can be praised as mythology and the Apes movies ignored is beyond me.",
                    "For anyone who asks the question &quot;What are these Apes movies really about?&quot; - here is the answer. Eric Greene's Planet of the Apes as American Myth is a thought provoking look at the movies and television series as a vehicle for explaining American social and political culture. His analysis of the internal class cultural cleavages which exist in &quot;ape&quot; society, i.e. the oppressive relationship between light skinned Orangutans and dark skinned Gorillas, as well as the external relationship beween apes and humans as a reflection of American race politics is brilliant and thoroughly convincing. From &quot;ape&quot; protests in the movies to American protests of the Vietnam war, the analogies to American politics and culture go on and on. Greene's arguments show that the choices which are made in telling the story are not separate from the political and social culture from which they are written. Through interviews with the writers and actors and behind-the-scenes anecdotes, the reader will be convinced that Greene's arguments are valid and, as a result, will gain a deeper appreciation for the Apes movies and television series. Greene shows there is a lot to be learned from the Apes films and T.V. series, not just in its examination of culutral and political problems, but also in its exploration of our futile attempts at solving them. A must read for anyone who goes to the movies - period.",
                    "Nothing is as interesting to me as human behavior, and it was a pleasant surprise to find that Mr. Greene feels somewhat the same.

An easy and enjoyable read about a difficult and confounding element of our society.At 17, when I saw PLANET, we were constantly aware of racial issues around us, and in the news. It's been an important film series to me, and it's message remains powerful. It's wonderful to have Mr. Greene's book as an addition or companion to the 'Ape' films. I am looking forward to see what Mr. Greene will come up with when Tim Burton's version is released.Politics and popular culture are handled in this book with an adept feel for the times the films were made. I wish the text books I read in college were as &quot;hip&quot; as what Mr. Greene has laid before us. I might have remembered more. I found his observations at times humorous and provocative...but always interesting. Well done.",

Eric has thoroughly researched and written about this particular aspect of American pop culture and its relevance to historical events that has been sorely neglected since Planet of the Apes hit the big screen in 1968. Given the tumultuous era in which the Apes series flourished, it is surprising that Eric was able to squeeze so much information and insight into one little book. Nice, breezy narration. Great wit!Good work, Eric. Hope to see more from you soon!",

                    "This book does a good job in explaining many of the subtexts that exist in the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; movie series. The major drawbacks to the book is 1) its constant PC mindset and 2) its overreaching to read subtexts where there are probably none. A good example of the latter is in chapter 4 and the author's (unintentionally) hilarious wrestling with what a school bus symbolized in &quot;Battle for the Planet of the Apes&quot;. Instead of going on and on trying to do all sorts of contortions to explain it, maybe the author should look at the possibility that maybe the bus was JUST A BUS!",
                    "In film and telelvision, very few things happen by pure accident. Although Greene may seem at times to &quot;read too much&quot; into 'Planet of the Apes', in reality he presents a clear and very detailed analysis of the series and films in relation to the time in which they were produced. The connections between the two cannot be overlooked, and whether or not you agree with all of Greene's points, it is necessary to have all possible ideas presented in this type of study. This is exactly what we do with Shakespeare, for example--analyze his &quot;art&quot; in historical context. Whether Shakespeare intended all of the possible connections is, ultimately, irrelevent. Television and film, as a modern art form, can be examined in the same way. This book is a fine example of such analysis. Greene is a talented young writer and I look forward to more of his work.",
                    "As far back as Aesop, the creative community has realized that talking animals can be especially effective surrogates for making social commentary. This book is an extensive treatment of this issue and therefore is especially for those interested in the mythical and social aspects of the Planet of the Apes series. Needless to say, if you want to know more about the movies as movies or you're interested in an apes price guide, you should probably look elsewhere. However, those looking here will not be disappointed with Greene's spot on ability to weave social analysis from the various naunces of the apes movies.From 1968 to 1975 the apes series produced five movies and two separate television series. This is a very prodigious production rate commensurate with the series' ability to key into the American psyche. Much like the Simpsons today, the apes series gave its writing staff a chance to touch on issues like the war in Vietnam and race relations from an artistically safe vantage point. Like our fast food the Planet of the Apes series was a uniquely American foray into the land of Aesop. It was, perhaps our American \"Animal Farm.\"",
                    "Eric Greene's Planet of the Apes as American Myth: Race, Politics and Popular Culture began its publishing history in 1996 as the finest offering to date of the small but noteworthy American Studies publishers, McFarland. Apparently, this did not escape the attention of the somewhat less small, even more noteworthy Wesleyan University Press (which has, among other things, an exceptional line in popular music studies going), who have kindly made Greene's excellent study of the vicissitudes of race across the Planet of the Apes oeuvre not only more widely available, but, in a new paperback edition, more affordable as well, though adding only a useful introduction by Wesleyan's own Richard Slotkin. Greene's brilliant, thoroughgoing analysis follows the shifting role of race in the films, television series, and even comic books inspired by Pierre Boulle's satiric novel, Planete de les singes, in light of their contexts in the shifting discourses and politics of the Civil Rights and Black Nationalist movements of the 60's and 70's. Interestingly, perhaps only Boulle's originary novel gets short shrift here, albeit undersatndably, as it was the American adaptations which explicitly layered the factor of race on Boulle's ostensibly more general social satire. Greene also reminds us that The Planet of the Apes generated the sort of transmedia merchandising phenomena more generally believed to have begun with Star Wars. An essential work for Apes fans and media students alike ...",
                    "Movies are, more often than not, more of a comment on the times in which they were made than the times they represent. Rod Serling and Michael Wilson established their incredible careers writing stories about how human beings treat one another. So it's no coincidence that the futuristic Planet of the Apes films reflect the turbulent times in which they were written and produced - the late 1960s and early 1970s. At the height of the civl rights movement and the dawn of the Black power movement there was alot to say about how people treated other people with different colored skin. And while there are certainly other social issues being addressed in the Apes films, Greene has placed his finger squarely on the pulse of, perhaps, the major ideological force behind the films and their popularity. And he does so with a great sense of what makes a book of this sort entertaining as well as informative. I found the pacing to be excellent and the presentation far from dry. This is no textbook or dusty college paper! In fact, Greene educates and illuminates while giving lots of juicy stories, interviews, and backstage politics. He insightfully diagnoses each film for its symbolic content (both subtle and blatant) and for my money, he's spot on - from the casting of Charlton Heston in &quot;Planet&quot;, to the use of School busses in &quot;Battle.&quot; It has increased my enjoyment of the films many-fold. Read the book, then watch the films again and you will experience Planet of the Apes with a fresh perspective - one you haven't had since the first time you saw them. Personally, I am glad someone took the time to write about a body of work that means so much to so many people. I look forward to the update after Tim Burton's version debuts.",
                    "I can count on the fingers (and fully-opposable thumb) of one hand the number of books that have impressed, entertained, and inspired me as much as this one.It doesn't hurt that I grew up as a hardcore Ape-o-phile. Still, had \"Planet of the Apes as American Myth\" been a mere nostalgic retrospective, it would not have riveted me as it did. Something strange happened as I read Greene's lucid, insightful and cogent commentary. I came to understand, finally, just why the Apes series and the world it evoked had, during my pre-teen and teen years, intrigued me on so many levels at once...and why the series' admittedly outlandish sci-fi premise always had to it the ring of truth. Reading this book, I felt vindicated. It was as if the author said, \"You were right all along, Paul. These films really DID matter -- and here's why.\"Like the final scene in the original 1968 film, Greene's book forces you to look back at all that preceded it (in this case, the POTA films & TV series) in an entirely new light. For Apes fans this is, quite simply, a MUST-READ.(Paul McComas is the author of UNPLUGGED, TWENTY QUESTIONS, and the upcoming comedic coming-of-age novel PLANET OF THE DATES.)",
                    "It's all too rare that I come across a book like this -- one that is profound and intelligent about popular culture. Greene makes you think about the Apes films in whole new ways, but unlike a lot of social analysis of movies doesn't overreach. This book is already in the library of most die-hard Apes fans, but it should also be read by students of film in general and in fact anoyone wanting to hear a fresh, original and intelligent thinker about popular culture and social issues.",
                    "The Ape movies were not just mirrors to show us our racial problems but also to show solutions to them. But it wasn't just about race, but also about foreign affairs such as the Cold War and the Vietnam Conflict, religion vs. science, nature vs. nurture, the fears of a nuclear holocaust, even our treatment of animals and how we treat women.The book really helped me to understand the movies with a detailed background about the times in which the movies were created. The book also has a touch of humor even while explaining about what the films were trying to say or show. Sometimes without even knowing it.",
                    "What an outstanding and comprehensive look at this phenomenal series! Eric has thoroughly researched and written about this particular aspect of American pop culture and its relevance to historical events that has been sorely neglected since Planet of the Apes hit the big screen in 1968. Given the tumultuous era in which the Apes series flourished, it is surprising that Eric was able to squeeze so much information and insight into one little book. Nice, breezy narration. Great wit!Good work, Eric. Hope to see more from you soon!",
                    "I think Eric Greene did a good jop on writing this book.Though it does not cover any behind the scenes imformation.Its main focus is the political themes of the apes series.It tells about how the movies,TV shows,and more are related about probems(like Veitnam)in the 60s and 70s.Its a good book over all.",
                    "Eric Greene proves in his book to be an intelligent, articulate, scholarly author--with none of the stuffiness than can often accompany scholarship. He has found a fascinating way to examine a genre of entertainment, the entire Apes series, from a new perspective that makes us consider more than just the surface while we're enjoying what we're watching. To paraphrase Taylor from the first movie, although not doing justice to Charlton Heston's delivery, would a scholar...write a thought-provoking book...that ENTERTAINS?? Thankfully, in this case, the answer is a clear &quot;yes.&quot;"

                "description": "One of the principal moral and psychological problems of our time is whether humane ideals can be defended. Loss of faith in the objectivity of ethics has encouraged a sense of hopelessness. The notion that no ideal is better than any other, that a humane commitment has no rational advantage over Nietzsche's contempt for ordinary people, has been accused of leaving our civilization without self-confidence or a purpose. James R. Flynn rejects attempts to salvage ethical objectivity as futile and counterproductive. Instead, he uses philosophical analysis to demonstrate the relevance of logic and evidence to moral debate. He then uses modern social science to refute racists, Social Darwinists, Nietzsche, and the meritocracy thesis of The Bell Curve. Flynn concludes that the great post-Enlightenment project-justice for all races and classes, the reduction of inequality, and the abolition of privilege-retains its moral dignity and relevance. A professor emeritus at the University of Otago, New Zealand, James R. Flynn is the author of Asian Americans: Achievement beyond IQ and Race, IQ, and Jensen. He has been profiled in Scientific American, and his research has been reviewed in Nature and Newsweek.",

                "description": "Popular images of women during the American Civil War include self-sacrificing nurses, romantic spies, and brave ladies maintaining hearth and home in the absence of their men. However, as DeAnne Blanton and Lauren M. Cook show in their remarkable new study, that conventional picture does not tell the entire story. Hundreds of women assumed male aliases, disguised themselves in men\u2019s uniforms, and charged into battle as Union and Confederate soldiers\u2014facing down not only the guns of the adversary but also the gender prejudices of society. They Fought Like Demons is the first book to fully explore and explain these women, their experiences as combatants, and the controversial issues surrounding their military service. Relying on more than a decade of research in primary sources, Blanton and Cook document over 240 women in uniform and find that their reasons for fighting mirrored those of men\u2014-patriotism, honor, heritage, and a desire for excitement. Some enlisted to remain with husbands or brothers, while others had dressed as men before the war. Some so enjoyed being freed from traditional women\u2019s roles that they continued their masquerade well after 1865. The authors describe how Yankee and Rebel women soldiers eluded detection, some for many years, and even merited promotion. Their comrades often did not discover the deception until the \u201cyoung boy\u201d in their company was wounded, killed, or gave birth. In addition to examining the details of everyday military life and the harsh challenges of -warfare for these women\u2014which included injury, capture, and imprisonment\u2014Blanton and Cook discuss the female warrior as an icon in nineteenth-century popular culture and why twentieth-century historians and society ignored women soldiers\u2019 contributions. Shattering the negative assumptions long held about Civil War distaff soldiers, this sophisticated and dynamic work sheds much-needed light on an unusual and overlooked facet of the Civil War experience.",

                    "This account of female combatants in the War Between the States is quite fascinating. The notion of women fighting for the Rebs and Yanks was something I had never even thought about, so reading this book served as a significant learning experience for me. Clearly, a great deal of research went into this monograph, and the authors do an excellent job of describing the significant limitations imposed upon the researcher into this topic. Military records are incomplete, especially in the case of the Confederate Army, and some women served without ever being discovered at all. In the case of many, there is no record of their real names. The best substantive evidence comes from those whose actual gender was ascertained while being treated for serious wounds or who really let the cat out of the bag by giving birth. It is quite amazing to me to learn that women in the late stage of pregnancy not only kept their gender a secret but actually fought fiercely in battle at the same time. Women soldiers were also captured and imprisoned along with men, many of them refusing to divulge their secret despite the fact it might well win them release from the terrible conditions of prison camps.Clearly, one must ask why women chose to fight. The authors devote a lot of attention to this important question. Many women took up arms in order to remain close to a loved one, be it a husband, fianc&eacute;, father, or brother; many fought for truly patriotic reasons, fuelled by the same motivations as men to defend their land and way of life. Some fought for economic reasons, knowing they could earn much more money as a soldier than they ever could as females at home; some loved the independence and removal of Victorian restrictions that a soldier's life offered them. Indeed, a small number of women had assumed male identities before the war began as a means of enjoying a better life for themselves, and some continued to live as men after the war ended for the same reasons.The aspect of this story that I found most interesting was the reaction of male soldiers and the citizenry to the role women played in fighting. To my surprise, contemporary men and women often celebrated these brave women who took up arms. The revelation of discovery often came as a shock to the female soldier's comrades in arms, but by and large they were very supportive of those who were unmasked; even years after the war ended, they lent a lot of support to female soldiers who sought the pension they truly deserved for their service. There was no shortage of newspaper stories about women soldiers during the war, and Victorian society was surprisingly supportive and proud of those women who were motivated to serve out of romantic or familial love or true patriotism. These idealized motivations appealed strongly to the romantic notions of Victorian society. Women who joined up for selfish, economic reasons, on the other hand, were often reviled. The well-known lore and widespread respect for female soldiers continued up until the days of World War I, after which society and historians in particular either ignored, ridiculed, or cast aspersions on the internecine women warriors, and it is for this reason that the history of these unique soldiers was largely forgotten over the course of the twentieth century, only reemerging as a substantive topic in the final decade before the millennium.There is much of interest in these pages: the means by which women soldiers managed to keep their real identities a secret, accounts of women in battle and the ranks several women attained as a result of their bravery and skill, stories of discovery and reenlistment(s), accounts of women captives in the worst of the prison camps, reports of children born on the front lines, information on the lives of several of these individuals in the years and decades following the war, etc. Numerous anecdotes are as informative as they are extraordinary. One of the slight issues I have with the monograph is the way in which information on each known female soldier was presented in piecemeal fashion-motivations, experiences, discovery, and the like are treated in separate chapters; I would have liked a continuous discussion of at least one prominent individual. As things stand, it is difficult to achieve deep insight into any one such person's motivations, experiences, and thoughts as a whole. This is a small criticism, however, because this book really is excellent. Featuring voluminous footnotes and an impressive bibliography, They Fought Like Demons is a landmark achievement in women's history as well as the history of the War Between the States.",
                    "Neither the Union nor the Confederate Army in the Civil War authorized women to enlist or welcomed women combatants. Indeed, they were actively discouraged from the traditionaly male preserve of combat. Yet a small number of women had the drive to assume male disguise and to enlist and fight. This book helps tell their story.The authors of \"They Fought Like Demons\" DeAnne Blanton, a military archivist, and Lauren Cook, of Fayetville State University spent more than a decade in researching primary sources to recreate the role of women as Civil War combatants. Their book tells us something about roughly 250 women soldiers, who fought either for the Union or the Confederacy.The book spends a great deal of space on the motivations that caused women to disguise their sex and enlist. It finds that patriotism and devotion to their respective cause was the chief motive, as it was with men; but also finds that in many cases women enlisted to be with a male loved one, whether husband, lover, father, or brother. This latter motivation seemed important in the accounts and it seems to me different from the motivation of most male combatants.The book gives good detail on women soldiers and, in the process, of Civil War military life. It describes how many women managed to avoid detection (of course, many were unsuccessful in so doing, particularly if they were wounded), the strength with which they fought, how they were regarded by their peers, both when they were assumed to be men and following the discovery that they were women, how women were treated as prisoners of war, in hospitals, and the extent of female casualties in the war. The book discusses the lives of some of the women after their career as soldiers -- one of the most interesting aspects of the book -- and it recounts some of the literature that was published about women soldiers during the Civil War era. There was more of this than I had supposed.At the most basic level, Blanton and Cook make a convincing case that women fought in the war and contributed as soldiers on both sides. Women soldiers fought and sustained casualties at every major Civil War battle. I am a student of the Battle of Gettysburg and learned that a Confederate woman soldier died in Pickett's charge and that there were five women soldiers who were known to have fought at Gettysburg. There were also women prisoners at the notorious facility at Andersonville.The organization of the book makes it difficult to follow the activities of most of the women in detail. This difficulty is also the result of the nature of the historical records. But two or three of the female combatants left memoirs or other records which perhaps could have been highlighted more effectively in this account.It is worth remembering that there were about 2,750,000 combatants in the Civil War, 2 million for the Union, 750,000 for the Confederacy. Blanton and Cook document about 250 women soldiers and accept the general estimate of about 400 women soldiers serving in the War. This is statistically a very small amount. (One percent of 2.75 million is 27,500)It is also, of course, a tiny fractional percentage of the available pool of women. Thus, one should be hesitant about drawing broad global conclusions from this evidence. Blanton and Cook generally use their data wisely and circumspectly.The Civil War remains the pivotal experience in our Nation's history. In many respects, it remains a shared American experience. Thus, it is good to have inclusive histories and to remember the role played by women in combat. Blanton and Cook show that during Civil War times, it was known that there were small numbers of determined women in the ranks. This book does a service by recreating this part of of our national experience.",
                    "Blanton gives us documented evidence of the many women who fought on both sides of the War Between the States, their motivations and how they hid their gender. Any reenactor who wants to portray a woman soldier should read this book, and it's also interesting for students of the war and those who insist women \"can't hack it in combat.\"",
                    "When authors dare to delve into the subject of women as soldiers during the 1860's, they are bound to run into roadblocks and resistance. So much of the information, even in the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, ends with the female in question being anonymous. This quite simply is a result of her enlisting under a male name and dying before she is \"found out\". Blanton and Cook have made what could be a dull study into fascinating reading. Any person can say \"I would have presented the information differently\" and perhaps they would; but the facts cannot be changed any more than one can change history.Thank goodness there are folks that care enough to study and tell HERstory as well as history.",
                    "I like this book. As a Social Studies teacher I am always looking for new information/interpretations of history to share with my students. To date, the subject of women as soldiers in the Civil War has been skimmed but no in depth information existed that I could find. This book is readable, informative and gives interesting information about how and why women fought and how they managed to avoid discovery. They Fought Like Demons provides that depth I've been looking for by providing the names and stories of many women within the context of the experiences of all soldiers in the Civil War.",
                    "Last year I took out a book of Photographs on Women in American History and the Photo of the female soilder on the front cover of &quot; They fought like Demons&quot; was included inside only there she was listed as anonymous and there was no story. The photo has haunted me.Less than a month ago I walked into the Public Library and this book was staring at me from the recently purchased shelves.I am still reeling from all the information that I had digested.In retrospect, I look at American History so differently and wonder why this is not part of our mainstream cultural history .How does this get placed into our American history books. Girls need heroines and here they are. Lets start writing about them,creating documentaries about them, making films about them.Lets put them back into the history books.",
                    "I have read They Fought Like Demons . . . and loved every word of the test. I,too, have spent 2 1/2 years conducting research on female soliders of the Civil War. Blanton's and Cook's book has provided much needed informtion for my research. Whereas, They Fought Like Demons, is written for adults, I am focusing on 5 key women in the Civil War in writing a book for children. I am a university professor who teaches elementary and middle school social studies methods and have found it truly amazing that children as well as adults have no idea that women disguised themselves as men to fight in the Civil War. I am also a storyteller and share many stories about these various women in schools, roundtables,churches, and other organizations.The point of Blanton's and Cook's book is to provide and enlighten the reader with information on women who disguised themselves as soldiers to fight in the Civil War. It is NOT intended to provide an INDEPTH review of women in the war. NO book can provide that information unless it is fiction. The authors have not attempted, but have done a great job of undetaking a monumental task of documenting as many women as possible who did fight in the war. Many of these women were unknown and it is virtually impossible to find out who they were or where they were from.I highley commend these ladies for their wonderful product and want to thank them for providing me with information that would have taken me another five or six years to complete.Dr. Judy C.

With this book you can learn about all of the women that were nurses, detectives, and even lutenents. Although if you are looking for a book that is only about the Civil War in general, this is not the book for you. Although They Fought Like Demons is an entertaining book, it also has its slow parts. The book goes from exciting to slow to exciting and back to slow again. But it is still a great book. One part I find interesting is the appendix. It shares information about other books such as The Lady Lieutenant, a love story, and Castine, Also a form of a love story. The appendix has a summary of both books and has encouraged me to read both of those also. All in all I think They Fought Like Demons is a wonderful book that expresses the acomplishments and hardships of woman in the Civil War, and also helps enlighten us about at least some of the women involved in the American Civil War.",

As stated in the book, women, under the disguise as men, fought for their country or to follow their male family members or husbands into war. Often the true identity of these women were not discovered until their death. For such a private and secret matter the book had a lot of information to give on a subject that you think would lacking.

I plan on donating this book to our local library for future reader use. It has some hilarious reading in there. Since it is required reading for a class I didn't think it would be that good. I was wrong. Learned a lot about women of our country back in the day.",
                    "Blanton and Cook's book about women soldiers serving in both the Northern and Southern Armies is entertaining. But be forwarned, it does have a halting style of writing. It drags in places and flies in others.Well researched, the book does advance the topic of women serving as men during the civil war. And it does cover a few battles. However, if you're looking for light reading or looking for a general book on the civil war, then you need to keep looking.As I worked my way through the book I did keep pondering the question of sister fighting sister, or mother fighting mother. We certainly make much of the brother against brother of son against father aspects of this conflict. I wonder how many woment really did fight during the civil war in both armies? I don't know that we'll ever know that answer, but not because Blanton and Cook didn't try to find out.",
                    "Women who fought as men in the Civil War, for whatever reasons, followed their own hearts, created their own destinies and, if a glass ceiling existed, they smashed it to smithereens.Blanton and Cook, superb researchers, present more facts about women fighting in the Civil War than we've had before, and in an interesting way.I went on to buy The History Channel's \"Secret Soldiers of the Civil War,\" available not in the History Channel's shop, but on Amazon.com, concerning two of the women soldiers written about in Blanton and Cook's book.[...]",
                    "This book was a hard read. I just couldn't wait to be done with it. The book would bring up women numerous times in different chapters but never clearly told any woman's story at once. All I really walked away with was \"There were women fighting in the Civil War.\" Exactly the same thing I learned from the cover. The pictures are exellent though. It would have been nice to have more of them, but I guess there aren't a lot of them surviving. It's interesting, I just wish things weren't repeated so much and that there was a little more information.",
                    "I reenact the War Between the States and I am constantly on the lookout for new books to read. I came across this book and decided it would be an interesting topic of study. When I picked up this book, I expected to read a book that would delve into the letters written by women who served in the Union and Confederate armies to illustrate their lives as soldiers. I was disappointed when the authors failed to rely on the letters as the primary source of their subject, and instead they decided to flaunt liberal feminism as the model which all women during the period of the War Between the States should have ascribed to.The facts that are brought to light by the authors are truly astounding, such as how these women enlisted, how they were able to live undetected in camp, but the book could have been much better if it had kept the letters of/about the women as the primary source of the subject.Another thing that bothered me was how the authors arrived at some presumptuous statistics with so few source documents. The authors admit that their is only evidence for 250 women who served in the War Between the States, yet they compare statistics from these 250 women against the statistics of the 3,300,000 men who served. These sort of statistics are dubious at best.I admire the authors for writing a book on such a topic. I just wish they would have let the source documents speak for themselves instead of flaunting liberal feminism as the ideal for women during the War Between the States.",
                    "The book was exactly as described and shipment was immediate. This buying experience could not have been better.",
                    "I'll read just about anything about the Civil War except Ph.D. theses, but the political agenda, constant repetition, and lack of significant detail make THEY FOUGHT LIKE DEMONS awfully tough sledding.The introduction and chapter one are about as readable as the phone book. I almost gave up. Chapter two is a little better because Blanton and Cook introduce us to such stalwarts as Sarah Emma Edmonds, Albert D. J. Cashier, and Sarah Rosetta Wakeman, for whom they have extensive information. Edmonds wrote a best-selling memoir after the war; Cashier, who dressed as a man prior to the war, served out her entire enlistment without being discovered until she was sent to a mental hospital as an old &quot;man,&quot; and Wakeman's letters to her family were preserved. The most entertaining of the three is the feisty Wakeman, who gets into a fight with a fellow soldier and wins. A picture section lets of decide for ourselves whether these women could possibly pass for men.Rather than rely on the letters, memoirs and newspaper accounts they unearthed, Blanton and Cook spend much of the book dispelling such notions that most women who fought in the Civil War were lesbians, prostitutes or camp followers. They maintain that most of the women fought for the same reasons men did: for the money, for adventure and because of patriotism. But only 240 women can be proved to have served, most under aliases which were almost impossible to track. Blanton and Cook use a sample of 153. From this number they arrive at some rather suspect statistics. Forty-four percent were casualties; eighteen percent were captured by the enemy; their promotion rate was eighteen percent, better than the ten percent cited for men. We're talking over two million men here; I doubt a statistician would allow this sort of comparison.Some chapters are rather funny. Take Chapter seven: &quot;A Congenital Peculiarity,&quot; Women Discovered in the Ranks. Two were detected when an officer threw apples at them; they were in uniform but reflexively tried to catch them with their non-existent aprons. Another was discovered because of her feminine method of putting on her stockings.There are certainly better Civil War books out there: CONFEDERATES IN THE ATTIC by Tony Horwitz and SLAVES IN THE FAMILY by Edward Ball to name two.",
                    "This was my first book I have read written by these authors, and I was not disappointed. Although it was a little hard to follow because they switched characters a lot, I did enjoy it. I thought only a few women participated in the wars throughout the years, when in fact there were many. The book was separated into different sections to make it easier to follow and go along with. One of the sections I enjoyed the most was when they described how women passed as men. There were also sections on \"Life in the Ranks,\" and \"Women discovered in the ranks.\" I learned that most of the women were not discovered as women until they were dead. This novel was very interesting, and proved just how far a women wold go to serve for her country. I admire the women who broke the mold and did what only men were thought to be able to do.",
                    "In the book They Fought Like Demons, the authors have made an effort to tell the story of female participants in the Civil War from a different perspective - that of women as soldiers.The book is not terribly long, and has numerous stories of women participating in the war, but it was evident to me quite early that the study focuses on only a few different individuals, with tidbits about other women added to make the author's points. I give the book only three stars because I do not think that the authors delve deeply enough into questions of how women fought.There is no question that this is a valuable book, and a story that needed to be told, but I do not believe that the book addresses the critical question of how valuable women were in the war effort. It does satisfy, in a strong way, the need to understand that women were indeed patriotic, and had a desire to fight to preserve (or create) their country. However, I believe that there are too many instances of &quot;this woman suffered an unknown fate&quot;, or mere mentions of an &quot;unknown woman&quot; participating in the battle and discovered as the burial detail performed their grim tasks.I recommend this book to anyone that is looking for an understanding of women's participation in the civil war on an &quot;outside of the house&quot; front, but I do not recommend the book if you're looking for an understanding of women's doings in the midst of battle.",
                    "this was an interesting book, but it does not contain hardly any information on women from the south. there are some opinions expressed that show the authors are biased toward the union. so if you are searching for information pertaining to the Confederate women, don't read this book.",
                    "I bought this book for my mother as she really likes to read about women in history. When I recieved it I thumbed through it and found it to read more like a text book and not something one would choose for an afernoon of pleasure reading.",
                    "I read this book because it was my book club's choice. The best thing about a book club is you sometimes read a book you might not have read otherwise and the worst thing about a book club is you sometimes read a book you might not have read otherwise. This one falls under the second. No continuity, no story, just a compilation of research results. It might work as a thesis to fulfill a degree program but not as general reading. Boring."

                    "Most books and reports on Civil War events come from white writers and voice white viewpoints. This one speaks with a black voice, as George E. Stephens wrote as correspondent for the (New York) &quot;Weekly Anglo-African,&quot; from the events of John Brown's rebellion (Nov. 1859) through September, 1864. Along the way he shifted from member of the press to acting patriot-soldier, recruiting and then enlisting in the Massachusetts 54th, that leader among black regiments depicted in the movie &quot;Glory.&quot; Donald Yacovone provides not only notes for the letters but also information on Stephens' family background. After the 54th disbanded Yacovone follows Stephens' ongoing struggles to educate freed slaves in Virginia; the story of many black patriots' efforts to move their people upward by finally granting them some education is not widely told or appreciated. These chapters fill a need today. So the life taken as a whole is both glorious and tragic: it's distressing to follow Stephens' hopes, from fresh optimism through disillusionment to despair, time and time again from the events of Fort Wagner to the last anguished efforts of his life. At its end he had to sue the government he'd served all his life to obtain the commission denied to him because of his race (though illegally), and provide for his wife with a higher pension. He never lived to receive it, dying in 1888 before the promotion came through. In this Stephens is typical of black men of his time, and it's deeply saddening.This is not a happy, but it is a useful, book, and a corrective for many cheap heroics about how well we treated our black veterans. We need to ponder its message today."

                "book_title": "Women in the Barracks: The VMI Case and Equal Rights",
                "description": "In June 2001, there was a decidedly new look to the graduating class at Virginia Military Institute. For the first time ever, the line of graduates who received their degrees at the \"West Point of the South\" included women who had spent four years at VMI. For 150 years, VMI had operated as a revered, state-funded institution\u2014an amalgam of Southern history, military tradition, and male bonding rituals\u2014and throughout that long history, no one had ever questioned the fact that only males were admitted. Then in 1989 a female applicant complained of discrimination to the Justice Department, which brought suit the following year to integrate women into VMI. In a book that poses serious questions about equal rights in America, Philippa Strum traces the origins of this landmark case back to VMI's founding, its evolution over fifteen decades, and through competing notions about women's proper place. Unlike most works on women in military institutions, this one also provides a complete legal history\u2014from the initial complaint to final resolution in United States v. Virginia\u2014and shows how the Supreme Court's ruling against VMI reflected changing societal ideas about gender roles. At the heart of the VMI case was the \"rat line\": a ritualized form of hazing geared toward instilling male solidarity. VMI claimed that its system of toughening individuals for leadership was even more stringent than military service and that the system would be destroyed if the Institute were forced to accommodate women. Strum interviewed lawyers from Justice and VMI, heads of concerned women's groups, and VMI administrators, faculty, and cadets to reconstruct the arguments in this important case. She was granted interviews with both Justice Ginsburg, author of the majority opinion, and Justice Scalia, the lone dissenter on the bench, and meticulously analyzes both viewpoints. She shows how Ginsburg's opinion not only articulated a new constitutional standard for institutions accused of gender discrimination but also represented the culmination of gender equality litigation in the twentieth century. Women in the Barracks is a case study that combines both legal and cultural history, reviewing the long history of male elitism in the military as it explores how new ideas about gender equality have developed in the United States. It is an engrossing story of change versus tradition, clear and accessible for general readers yet highly instructive and valuable for students and scholars. Now as questions continue to loom concerning the role of state funding for single-sex education, Strum's book squarely addresses competing notions of women's place and capabilities in American society.",

                    "Philippa Strum's sympathies clearly lie with those who argued for admitting women to the Virginia Military Institute. However, they haven't prevented her from giving us a comprehensive and fairly balanced look at the VMI case from start to ... if not finish, at least to the graduation of the first women to begin the school in the rat line.One area where Strum's analysis is particularly strong is in tracing the history of anti-discrimination and equal rights law in the United States. She shows the jurisprudential evolution of the idea that, rather than women requiring special protection, all people are entitled to the rights and benefits of equal citizenship, regardless of sex. Indeed, following the trend of relevant Supreme Court cases as the author lays it out for us, it's hard to see how VMI's defenders could have believed the Court would ever do anything *but* order the publicly-funded military academy to admit women on an equal basis.But believe it they did, and Strum shows how the two sides in the case were arguing fundamentally different points: VMI, that tax-funded single-sex education served a public good, and the Justice Department that, whether single-sex education is good or not, public funding of it (VMI being a government school) is unacceptable under the 14th Amendment. Neither side seemed fully to understand the other, and Strum does a thorough job of showing how the two sides in many ways failed to confront one another's arguments head-on.Strum frames VMI as a defender of outmoded stereotypes and anachronistic ways of thinking (notably the 'women-as-lady' myth, as she calls it). It's a portrait VMI's defenders no doubt resent, but it's clear that their focus on 'how men learn' versus 'how women learn' was based more on differences between men and women *as groups* than on what kind of system might be best for any given *individual*. After all, as Strum points out, if VMI's adversative system isn't right or attractive for most women, the undeniable fact (based on the number of male high school seniors who apply to VMI relative to their number nationwide, for example) is that it's not right or attractive for most men, either.This brings us to some areas I wished Strum had developed further. Most interesting was her assertion -- based on circumstantial evidence -- that the Bush Administration (Bush I) must have blocked the Justice Department from arguing that VMI's treasured adversative system was unnecessary for molding the kind of citizen-soldier leaders that VMI exists to produce. Certainly (as Ed Ruggero relates in 'Duty First: West Point and the Making of American Leaders'), the USMA ultimately decided its adversative system was actually counterproductive for that purpose, and so abandoned it. But Justice planted its flag on the (arguably weaker) ground that forcing VMI to admit women would not cause a fundamental change in the VMI system or ethos. The jury is still out about whether that's proven true.Another question this book raised for me that Strum left entirely unaddressed was the appropriateness of cause-activists pursing their agenda on the bench. Specifically, Strum titles her chapter on Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 'The Advocate.' Justice Ginsburg (clearly the hero -- can we still say 'heroine'? -- of this book) spent her pre-Court career promoting a certain understanding of law and pursuing specific social and policy objectives. Once on the bench, judges assume a mantle of impartiality -- in exchange for which they enjoy the 'procedural consensus' Strum defines as the key to translating Court decisions into social change. And yet, Strum makes it clear that Ginsburg's jurisprudence in the VMI case was of a piece with her earlier work. Strum quotes another legal scholar describing the VMI decision as 'the vindication for [Ginsburg's] legal career ... the opinion she hoped the Court would one day arrive at when she first started arguing cases of discrimination in the 1960s' (p. 295). Is it right for judges (of any philosophical persuasion) to continue as advocates once they're on the bench? Public acceptance of that idea would seem to threaten the very 'procedural consensus' the advocates rely upon to achieve their goals.That question aside, though, I enjoyed reading this comprehensive look at the VMI case. Despite clear indications of where she stands on the question, a few broad ideological brush strokes (conservatives are frequently described as 'angry'), and the occasional off-the-wall comment ('Nothing had been more central to the South than racism' [p. 102].) the author's presentation of both sides of this important case was, on the whole, equitable and balanced. As I said, it's hard to escape the conclusion that VMI's stand was doomed from the start. So long as government runs schools, they will be subject to the political process. And in 1996 as in 1864, VMI couldn't withstand the weight of Uncle Sam, no matter how much its defenders loved it, or how fervently they sacrificed to protect it.",
                    "As a girl, I very much wanted to attend VMI to study history, but was told that women were not accepted. Period. There was no understanding, no appeal, only horrified faces from parents, teachers, local politicians, and worst of all, other girls my age.Thirty-five years later, this book revealed the whys. The patrician Virginia old-boy network thought that its grip on societal mores would last forever. I am happy to report that it has not. Through no fault of my own I was raised there, and having left thirty years ago, I have no plan to return. This book helped me come to terms with my feelings about my adolescence and the differences between educational choices for women today and the non-choices offered to women in the past.Even better, I passed this book along to my father, who really sank his teeth into it, and challenged himself to look at his daughter's dreams and the goals of all women differently. When he finished it, I shipped it to my brother, a veteran of the U. S. Army. He loved it, too, from a historical standpoint and as raising awareness of gender bias. It resides now in his military history book collection, and I am happy that it will be there when his two sons are old enough to discover it.This book needed to be written, but the best news is how well-written it is. It covers all aspects - legal, emotional, academic and societal. It is not to be missed."

We can't get ever negro to vote for the same man, but just to get every negro to vote would be great. And in this book, this is brought up in some light. People being of the communist light, or in the rebellion stage. Well, you don't have to pick a party, but at least make sure you have the same cause. To this degree, the book had some thoughts",
                    "Thurman was not the most polished of writers, but he makes up that shortcoming by having a lot to say. I was enraptured with the number of ideas present in this book, and many times I paused to consider the weight of his words.Yes, the text is often clumsy, but the dialogue is sterling. So this is really what the Harlem Renaissance was about? I wish I could have been there. There are so many memorable characters in this book, and they all are real and possess unique personalities. Even the minor characters are fleshed out.Buy this book and read it. You won't regret it. After reading it, I have only one question: Why isn't Thurman's third novel, INTERNE, available? I can't think of any author to whom to compare Thurman. His dialogue reminds me a bit of Hemingway, but not really. Reading Thurman is a unique experience!",
                    "Politically incorrect, pedantic, with laughingly awful flights of &quot;serious writing&quot;, this novel nonetheless opens up a window to the past with an immediacy few novels match. Thurman was there and he lets you know how it was. Important both as a historical document and one of the earliest examples of black gay literature, it will fascinate despite the clumsy writing. A window into a lost world if you're willing to forgive the prose.",
                    "I put off reading this for years because of its leadenly Shakespearian title, and was surprised and pleased to find when I did finally pick it up that it was a pacey, barbed and entertaining read. It's not 'hilarious' (as billed in the promotional blurb above) but it is sharp. In its astute but cynical take on its characters & their situation it made me think of Chester Himes, (& Thurman has a similar 'banged off' style to Himes), & in its subject-matter - black & white bohemia, & the politics of race & sexuality - it's very much a precursor to James Baldwin's 'Another Country'. The debates around the role of the artist, particularly the black artist, in this book seem to me as resonant today as they were when it was written: does a black artist have a duty to represent the race, to engage politically with racial issues in an overt or didactic way, or is his or her duty to art as a force - or truth - in itself? Thurman provides no answers, but he shows how such tensions - combined with self-delusion, brittleness, lack of application and other human failings - lead people who are struggling to be creative to collapse in on themselves, with disastrous results. Thurman's style is jaunty and, although highly engaging, deters the reader from empathising greatly with the characters; yet I found the end of the book, which is on one level camp, strangely moving and upsetting.",
                    "I'm not an English major and I possess no talent for critically analyzing literature. However, I am a black man with a desire to know more about his heritage, and I gained insights from this book that I could never garner from a history class. From the conversations between the characters, to the pictures painted of Harlem in the 1920's, the author gives an intimate look into the thoughts, fashions, music, literature and themes of the day.Obviously based on facts, with names changed to protect the innocent, there is a truth to this novel that more than compensates for any writing flaws. This novel, more than Blacker the Berry, gives insight into the minds of the creative, genius, and often times tortured minds of those leading the renaisance.I would reccomend this novel to anyone wishing to learn more about the details of life in Harlem during the 20's.",
                    "Wallace Thurman's &quot;Infants of the Spring&quot; illustrates the lives and ideals of the &quot;New Negro&quot; of 1920's Harlem. In a loosely biographical depiction of the young generation of artists, who defined themselves as the New Negro artists like Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston and Thurman himself, Thurman interprets the role the relationship between the black artist and his art in a time of rapidly changing ideology. Like thier counterpart's of the white race, referred to as the &quot;Lost Generation&quot; by Gertrude Stein and company,Black intellectuals of the 1920's sought to find themselves in a reaction thier perceptions of the previous generation's failings. Rebelling against an older generation that gleefully supported WWI and retained the victorian ideology and rhetoric of the previous century, intellectuals both black and white looked to Art in order to recreate the world in terms modern and understandable to them. Thematically, the protagonist, Raymond, a talented writer who spends most of his time drinking and finding interuptions from his writing, attempts to break free from the boundaries of race on the art he produces. Raymond and his brethren in &quot;Niggerati Manor&quot; live in a world of white and black masks, Raymond's close friendship with the Nordic Stephen illustrates the Raymond's denial of racial differences. One of the main objectives of the young generation of writers in the Harlem Renaissance was to create for the sake of art alone. The young generation felt that to write only as and example of ones race constrained that art of the race aritst. Raymond's attempt to merge the two races in social settings, his attempt at integrating peacably and without issue, illustrates the pursuit of the artist's of the Harlem Renaissance to create art on a universal level, incorporating the knowledge of as Zora Neale Hurston put it &quot;Colored Me&quot;. The young generation of artists to whom Thurman belonged to wrote about thier lives as blacks, but they did not constrain themselves to writing only about black issues, they wrote for a universal audience. They wrote with a knowledge of the ancient and magnificent contributions of the black race, and also with the modern hope of creating a truer and more reliable world. Although many people view this book as a sharp critique of the Harlem Renaissance, to me it seems to suggest a bit of the optimism of the generation of black intellectuals who took it upon themselves to uplift thier race through art.",
                    "Wallace Thurman wrote INFANTS OF THE SPRING in 1932, just two years before his untimely death from tuberculosis at the age of 32. The tragedy for all of us is that if he had lived longer, he probably would have written a very fine novel if this one and THE BLACKER THE BERRY are indications of what he would have produced. What this novel lacks in depth of character development, it makes up for in the number and different types of characters: Raymond, Paul, Bull, Steve, Sam, Euphoria, Eustace, Pelham, Janet, Amy, Lucille et al. In fact there are so many characters in this small novel that at times it is difficult, at least in the beginning, to keep them separated. Mr. Wallace suffers from what English instructors used to call \"fine writing,\" in that he on occasion uses a five dollar word when a simpler one would have worked as well or better. The words \"persiflage\" and \"tocsin\" are good examples. Sometimes he writes beautiful descriptive language, for instance, his account of Raymond's visiting his friend Pelham in the Tombs, the local prison.What this writer does very well is hold up a mirror to that exciting period of America's literary history, \"The Harlem Renaissance.\" He asks a lot of questions-- but offers few answers-- about slavery, race, what is a fit subject for both the black writer and singer, the color bias in the black community, interracial dating, the difficulty of interracial friendships-- questions that still plague us eighty years later.",
                    "Infants of the Spring, by Wallace Thurman, is a novel of images. At first, the novel is written much like a play. It reads as a dialogue with stage directions. It's no wonder that it was later adapted for the theater. Nevertheless, as both Thurman and the reader become more in tune with the characters and plot, the dramatic quality of the work lends itself to the crazy, oftentimes shocking, images of Harlem during the roaring twenties and the Harlem Renaissance.Centered among these images is Raymond Taylor, a cynical budding writer in search of his voice among the many influences of the period: alcohol, women, white patronage, and lofty black artists. Thurman uses these four influences to round out a number of characters as they try to create a community of artists in a building termed \"Niggerati Manor.\" Bent on creating a cornerstone for artistic fervor and the defining of a period, what comes to pass is a falling apart of those initial ideals. As a result, the artists fall into pleasure seeking instead of production; drinking their lives away instead of making their statements about race and art.Infants of the Spring falls short in its dealing with racial and gender issues. Often times themes are brought to the fore by Thurman and as quickly dropped to the way side in the turning of a few pages. Shortened chapters intensifies the \"image\" idea, and in these images Thurman fails to examine the repercussions of actions. A woman's abortion is brushed aside. A rape and the fate of the accused is nearly forgotten. Art, the main reason these individuals are together, is replaced by parties and drinking. These images could be the reason for the main character's fierce individualism; however, the feeling is that Thurman, himself, almost forgot these things happened. It leaves the reader wondering why they were even brought up if the significance of these things are not examined fully.Surprisingly, an examination into role of women in the Harlem Renaissance is an interesting high point of this novel. It is worth examining the roles of Euphoria (Niggerati Manor's landlady), Raymond's potential love interest Lucille, and Janet and Aline who both fall in love with a white Nordic named Steven. What is the role of women in this novel?Ultimately, this novel is about black consciousness. How did blacks see themselves and their artistic role during the Harlem Renaissance? Contrary to the title, these characters end the novel in no rebirth of spring. Time is undeterminant, yet one gets the feeling that the death that fall represents has found itself imbedded in Niggerati Manor and the people that once filled it's rooms.",
                    "Needed this book for child in HS Honors English. They have read it in class, but she has not discussed it with me.",
                    "Like so many books documenting life during Prohibition, the characters in \"Infants of the Spring\" drink preposterous quantities of alcohol. Indeed, one of the couple of climactic events that occur towards the end of this book involves a particularly debilitating hangover that, perhaps, is a symbol of what was becoming of the Harlem Renaissance.But, okay, wow, what a book. It seems like many of the reviews here make the valid point that you have to make a few allowances for this one - the writing is a little brittle at times - but as the other admirers have pointed out, it's worth the trip. On the one hand it's so \"then\". A particular moment was happening in Harlem at that point, when a literary movement seemed to be on the verge of something big, and when Harlem was, temporarily, a tourist destination for white people. And of course it was the 1920s, and the love that dared not speak its name isn't speaking its name in this book either. But the closet door is being banged on quite loudly, you might even say with pizazz, and there are plenty of inferences to be read between the lines.in the end, the protagonist, a stand-in for the author, is the most interesting character, someone who refuses to let anyone, black or white, presume they know who he is or who he should be.",
                    "I liked the idea of the book, but Thurman almost spoiled this one by creating too many characters for the reader to keep up with? There were several characters in the book that had nothign to do with the plot, as a matter of fact, I think it is safe to say that only four characters were needed in the entire book. Infants of the Springs was a slow read, and pales in comparison to Thurman's other novel, The Blacker the Berry."

                    "This is a very interested book that tackles the subject of tensions and divisions within and among Latino nationalities in the United States - an issue that all Latinos know exist, but has received little academic attention thus far. The authors base their research in Chicago and focus on divisions between Puerto Ricans and Mexican immigrants to the city, arguing that differences in political/immigration/citizenship status between the two groups produces different ways that Puerto Ricans and Mexicans construct one another along racial lines.Overall, I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Latino studies. However, I have two primary critiques of the book. First, the authors use quite a bit of heavy, technical jargon so those lacking a background in anthropology may struggle somewhat with the writing style. Second, the authors focus on the divisions between Puerto Ricans and Mexicans but only pay slight lip service to the Puerto Rican-Mexican unity of college students who rely on one another as peers, companions, and support networks - particularly during college, when Latino youth often find themselves in a predominantly white environment. The authors acknowledge this trend towards pan-Latino unity exists among youth, but they don't delve deeply into it.On the whole, I strongly recommend this book.",
                    "Latino Crossings is an eye-opening study at a propitious time. The book helps dismantle generalizations about the \"latino\" population in the US, while also bringing the question of citizenship into a new light at a time of heated public debate on the immigration issue. The authors, in an ethnographic study in Chicago, look at issues of \"legality\" and social tensions between the Mexican and Puerto Rican populations there. For those already versed in such dynamics, the theoretical approach through the racialization lens offers new ways of deconstructing the institutional racism in the United States. Finally, for beginners like me, the introduction juxtaposes the migration of Mexican and Puerto Ricans into US society in an interesting way."

Faludi's reportorial and literary skills unfold with breathtaking confidence and beauty... She goes a long way toward eliminating the black and white, good and evil, male and female polarities that have riven the sexes in the past three decades...\" \u2013Time In 1991, internationally renowned feminist journalist Susan Faludi ignited a revival of the women\u2019s movement with her revelatory investigative reportage: Backlash was nothing less than a landmark, uncovering an \u201cundeclared war\u201d against women\u2019s equality in the media, advertising, Hollywood, the workplace, and government\u2014a war that is still being fought today. Stiffed may be even more essential than Backlash to understanding the cultural riptides that led to Trumpian America. Here, Faludi turns her attention to the so-called \u201cAngry Male\u201d politics plaguing the nation. Through deeply researched, nuanced, and empathetic character studies of distressed industrial workers, laid-off aerospace engineers, combat veterans, football fans, evangelical husbands, suburban and inner-city teenage boys, and Hollywood and porn actors, Stiffed goes beyond the easy explanations of male misbehavior\u2014that it\u2019s driven by chromosomes or hormones\u2014to lay bare the powerful social and economic forces that have shattered the postwar compact defining American manhood. Faludi\u2019s vivid storytelling illuminates the historic and traumatic paradigm shift from a \u201cutilitarian\u201d manliness, grounded in civic and communal service, to an \u201cornamental\u201d masculinity shaped by entertainment, marketing, and performance values. Read in the light of Trumpian politics and the #MeToo movement, Faludi\u2019s analysis speaks acutely to our present crisis, and to a foreboding future. Stiffed delivers a searing portrait of modern-day male America, and traces the provenance of a gender war that continues to rage, unabated.",

It used some words or phrases that had actually been used by Barbadian immigrants of the 30's and 40's, but she overused them. This and her unreadable colloquial spellings made her dialogue quite bad. The juxtapostion of her nonsensicle dialogue and her failled attempt at an elloquent narrative make this book an annoyance to read. The writing wasn't good, even though it did have it's moments, but what was even worse was the characters, every character in this book, including Selina to some degree was completely flat. Silla was bitter and underhanded, Deighton was lazy and after he joined the cult he was a souless religious fanatic. Ina was weak and Selina was independent, confused about growing up and immotionally strong. What made things worse was, none of these characters were likable at all, apart from Selina. However Selina was not likable most of the time because she seemed to be rebelling against Silla while at the same time Silla was the only reason Selina was remaining well and not dying of starvation. Besides being ingrateful to her mother she was completely unaware of what she stood for. She was a rebel without a cause (how original). In conclusion, besides having a depressing and exasperatingly slow moving plot, the book was so badly written that I couldn't wait until it was over. So, Paule Marshall, I apologize if you may have been offended by any of my statements in this review, but it is the way I feel. This book did had some good moments, but it was still not my cup of tea.No Hard Feelings,Andrew Nisinson",
                    "This is one of the best books I had ever read",
                    "Brown GirlPeer ReviewTo my Peers:I would recommend Brown Girl to all of my fellow peers. This is a story that shows many problems. One was that most of us do not have positive remodels to look up to. Therefore, we just go about our life without anyone to look up. To the same exact way, the character in this story grew up also. However, always someone came so that we can look up to. However, that does not always happen to us. So there are certain times or situations that are not the same as our life but most of the time we can relate to the work. As a person in life. So we can really understand what the character was going through so we would be able to say that we would have done the same thing. Therefore, we would under stand the story a lot better. In addition, like in the story, we could do better in receiving feedback and using it in a good way .so; we can use that to improve our selves. This would show that we understand what we are doing. And we can go further into detail in every problem in the book. And further understand what the character was going through.",
                    "I really enjoyed this book. Marshall proves to me once again what an excellent author she is!",
                    "Could the book move any slower? Or should I put that statement in words the author would use? &quot; The heartbeat of the book was buried under an ever so faint pile of descriptive nonsense that tore away at the very lining of my soul and left me empty, with only remnants of an unbridled fear of a sequel to bide me...&quot; And really, no matter how you look at it, the book is just that, descriptive nonsense. It was so hard to follow that I felt like I was reading a book that was written in French. The characters? Flat, each and every last one of them, especially that misguided Selena. There was no exploration into the motives of the characters whatsoever, for the life of me I can't understand the relationship between Selena and any of the characters, it was almost like the whole thing was a rough draft, and none of the characters and their paths were clearly established. And talk about boring! What exactly was the point in reading this? What in the heck was Paule trying to say through her novel? That Barbadians are similar to this? That this novel was somehow representative of Barbadian adolescent girls coming of age in New York? I sure hope not. I have written better things in my sleep. In the end I've read better, try The Bearnstein Bears, that is literary art at it's finest, this chick and her story can't compare.Oh yeah, the ending... What ending?",
                    "This is a worthy and ambitious debut novel about the Barbadian immigrant experience in Brooklyn, New York, by a little known African-American author, whose own parents emigrated from Barbados during World War I. The author herself grew up in Brooklyn. She attended Brooklyn College, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1953, a time when most Americans, much less a black woman, did not attend college. This drive to succeed is a testament to her Barbadian heritage.It is from that heritage that the author drew in creating her characters and developing their rich mix of personalities, as she re-created the early Barbadian immigrant experience in post-depression era Brooklyn. The book focuses on the Boyces, a nuclear family consisting of Silla, the ambitious, hard working, ever striving mother, Deighton, her charming, pie-in-the-sky dreamer of a husband, and their two daughters, Ina, the older and more passive one, and Selina, the bright, rebellious one. The novel follows the fortunes of the Boyce family from the late 1930s until shortly after Word War II. It tells of their lives, their hopes, and their dreams.The book beautifully details the experience of the early Barbadian immigrants in Brooklyn and their adjustment to their new environment. They brought with them their own ideas, their own ways of doing things, and a work ethic that is hard to beat. Quite frankly, Barbadians revitalized areas of Brooklyn that were dormant. Theirs was an almost traditional immigrant experience, but for the racism that they were to encounter here. Still, they did not allow that to stand in their way from getting ahead and going for the American dream.This book neatly encapsulates that immigrant experience through the Boyce family. One gets a very good sense of what the experience of the Barbadian immigrant was like through the interactions of the Boyce family with others in their community, as well as with each other. While Silla Boyce typifies the Barbadian community in terms of goals and work ethic, dreams and desires, with its focus upon material acquisition, her husband, Deighton, does not. Their separate dreams and desires conflict and act as a catalyst for a tragedy that would mar intra-familial relationships.It is also a coming of age story, as Selina struggles to find her place in the new society and rich community her people are creating. She also struggles to find her place in the larger community, as well, stepping out of the insular one into one where racism is a factor. She is also interested in exploring her roots and heritage. Still, being who she is, the reader believes that Selina will not founder. Though Selina would hate to admit it, she is the one who is most like her mother, a fact of which she is not cognizant throughout most of the novel. She is truly her mother's daughter, in thought and deed.This is a richly satisfying novel. The author captures the \"Bajun\" way of speaking in all its rich, expressive cadence. While some may find this \"Bajun\" dialect, which is interspersed throughout the novel, difficult to follow or distracting, it is this richness of language that give this book its very distinctive feel. Moreover, while the author may sometimes get too bogged down with overly descriptive detail, she paints a vibrant picture of a segment of society that has too long been ignored in literature. Those who like reading about the immigrant experience will enjoy this book, as will those who are interested in discovering worthy authors that have receded from public memory.",
                    "This book deals with an aspect of the African American experience which gets very little notice outside of the black community, namely that of the black immigrant. We hear a lot about immigrants from Europe who came here and helped build america. However, immigrants also came here from places like Barbados, Jamaica, Trinidad, Panama, etc. Most whites will identify themselves as irish, polish, italian, german, etc ancestry. However, African Americans seem to be allowed only one ethnicity. It's as if in the darkness only one variation can be discerned. Like most immigrants, the Barbadians described in this book are highly motivated towards material success for themselves and their children. As seen in this book, sometimes this quest occurs at all costs even at the expense of outward expressions of love and affection. For example, Silla is referred to as 'the mother' throughout. As in many families, the ambitions of the parents for their children don't coincide with the children's as seen in the conflicts between Selena and her mother. Unlike white immigrants, their ambitions also run afoul of racism.I found the narrative sometimes overly descriptive, especially in the preoccupation with sunlight and shadow. The brownstones and the streets often seemed like dark and brooding places.My maternal grandparents were from Bardados, while my paternal grandfather was from St. Eustacia. I also grew up in Brooklyn (in a brownstone). Therefore, the landscape and the characters were very familiar. In fact, Claremont Sealy and Clive Springer are probably my cousins! A most enjoyable and thought provoking book. I look forward to reading more of Ms Marshall's book.",
                    "To all of the misguided souls who slammed this beautiful book, I feel sorry for you. Brown girl, Brownstones is a wonderful book for so many reasons but too many to go into now. Paule Marshall's piece is unique in that it gives a voice to a community so often left out of fiction writing: the Caribbean community in the United States. As a first generation Caribbean-American who grew up in Brooklyn, I was blown away the first time I read this book and found such startlingly familiar portrayals of the culture I claim. The dialogue flowed naturally and, although the chracter portrayals of some (esp. Deighton and Silla) might strike some as too extreme, my own experiences and even the testimony of sociological studies show that Marshall was right on the mark. The fact that the book didn't have a bang up ending is totally natural in that the book is a coming of age story of a young woman (how many people have a conclusive grip on who they are at 18) who must figure out her multipe identities as a young woman, a Black woman and and Afro-Caribbean woman not tied to her parents' homeland but not completely of this country either. Marshall's work is too poignant to be dismissed at first glance. I would encourage all those who couldn't find the beauty in Brownstones the first time to give it a second chance. To dismiss this book is not only dismissing the premiere work of Paule Marshall but also to miss out a rare glimpse into the dynamics of a community that is within our gates.",
                    "i'm horrified at these reviews. marshall has put together a brilliant novel rich in prose and dialogue, an amazing work overall that should earn her the right to be identified with among the most important writers in the last half century. its funny how so much of our society is dumbed down to the point that a work of art is trashed because either people cant relate to it or dont grasp or understand it. if they dont understand words that the writer uses, they call that writer 'pretentious'. if the writer uses the language to its fullest capacity, they call the writer 'overly descriptive'. its quite a grim state of affairs when only these kind of comments prevail for such a transcendent novel. in today's lazy Western world of drive-thrus, TV dinners, and condensed 30 minute television shows with commercial breaks, people only want things easy, straight to the point. this is why our society is calcified.if you dont understand what Marshall is doing here, either take your loss silently and move on, or, better yet, research! read more! try and understand lyricism and poetics, the beauty of creatively accurate description. that's just the thing; we're so a-creative these days its opprobrious. to the self-professed white jewish girl in the suburbs who will probably never return to read this, there are cultures and worlds outside of your own that in fact do affect you. anyone who walks around thinking otherwise is foolish. immigrants havent played a role in the development of modern America? please. Brown Girl, Brownstones is not only important for its beauty, but also for its capturing of Barbadian immigrants in Brooklyn around the time of World War II. the dialect and cadence of their speech is vibrantly bottled in the novel; someone said its hard to read. thats because its a transcription of a different dialect! if you take the time to read it, you'll eventually hear it in your head. the ability to transcribe different accents and dialects is quite a skill, and one that Marshall is not without.anyways, if you're a true lover of amazing prose and writing in general, you'll appreciate this novel. if you aren't, at least dont embarrass yourself by haranguing others with ignorance.",
                    "A terrifically heartwarming story about a young girl's coming of age as first generation American from Barbados. The &quot;silence&quot; of Marshall's main character, Selina, resounds in this coming of age child of immigrants tale unfolds. Partially based on Ms. Marshall's own life, the story holds warmth, humor and tragedy for almost anyone willing to explore the human condition.A definite must-read for post-modernists.",
                    "Browngirl, Brownstones by Paule Marshall is a book about a young girl that grows up to be a beautiful woman not knowing exactly what she wants to be but as long as its not what her mother is she is okay. She lives day-by-day learning something new, but not able to trust her own family. Her father has always been her role model no matter what people thought about him not even what her own mother thought. It must be sad to know that your mother treats your father mean. Selina and her mother never did get along that well because they have so many differences that separated them day by day. Selina's mom is a strong woman and does not let anyone nock her down! She sets her mind to what she wants no matter what gets in her way. Selina's mother just wants what's best for her daughters Ina and Selina.The book is straight out forward to the reader there are some words that might be hard to understand, but you can always us the dictionary. It's sort of a long book, but it's easier and can go faster than shorter books. At the beginning, it's somewhat hard to understand what's going on because the writer is explaining the background of where Selina is at as well as what she is looking at.My interest in this book goes very far because it teaches me many things to always be what I want to be and not someone else wants me to be. Never let anyone stop you from accomplishing your dreams even if you feel like its taking up most of your time. Also, that you shouldn't rely on some one else because your not always going to have them around to help you.",
                    "This is an interesting look at the hurdles a young girl faces in New York City in the 40s and 50s. Not only does she come to terms with who her parents are as Caribbean immigrants, but she also strives to create her own identity in the face of conformist expectations. She also seeks to estabish her place as an African American among strong ethnic ties in the Barbados community. It resonates at many different levels.",

                    "I probably wouldn't have ever heard of Brown Girl, Brownstones if it hadn't been assigned for the African American Literature by Women course I'm taking this semester. However, it has a deserved place among novels about the immigrant experience and coming of age.Brown Girl, Brownstones follows Selina Boyce from girlhood into college. In this time, Selina struggles over her allegiance to her father, Deighton, who romantically tries on careers in which he has no realistic future, and her mother, Silla, whose pragmatic obsession with purchasing their leased brownstone causes her to act ruthlessly. Between them and the outspoken cast of supporting characters, Selina has many options for how to model her own life.The pages of Brown Girl, Brownstones fly by quickly, assisted by the realness of the characters' voices. I especially enjoyed Marshall's use of Barbadian dialect, which helps to locate the novel in a particular time and place.Brown Girl, Brownstones is certainly a good choice for teenagers, but also for adults who are interested in stories set between the depression and the '50s.",

                    "As an Afrikaner, I enjoyed this book because the authors allow their Afrikaner informants to tell their own story. The \"voice\" of the Afrikaner community (or at least, a segment thereof) is clearly heard in this book and is not drowned out by the authors' own narrative. In other words, reading the book, one learns more about the respondents and their everyday lived reality, than about the authors and their subjective perceptions (an approach that should typify any good ethnography). However, I was dismayed by the large number of factual errors, some trivial and some quite substantial. Afrikaans words in the text are often misspelled or used in an incorrect case and/or context. Afrikaner history also becomes rather truncated and overly defined in terms of 20th century events. The authors also exhibit an over-reliance on respondents who are theologists and/or theological academics. The political economy of Afrikaner Nationalism, and by extension Apartheid, does not get the attention it deserves. Apartheid was not primarily a religio-political phenomenon, even though religion was used at the level of discourse to explain, excuse, and justify the political system. More attention should be paid to the role of Afrikaner working class urbanization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.All in all, a worthwhile read for those outside Afrikanerdom wanting to gain a better understanding of some of its internal anxieties.",
                    "This was good reading, and an excellent resource for understanding the Afrikaner psyche. The Authors allow each interviewee to tell his or her own story, and offer just the right amount of interpretation and background information. The extensive bibliography bears witness to the outside research they did. The authors confirmed a great many of my own lay observations through these interviews of many both prominent and ordinary Afrikaners. The book is very well written, throrough, and highly recommended for anyone interested in South Africa.",
                    "Overall an excellent range of interviews that brings to light the complex psychology behind the complicity of the Afrikaners in apartheid. Somewhat tainted by the authors' obvious political agenda. They attempt to &quot;highlight&quot; the &quot;bad guys&quot; with unpleasant descriptions of interview settings and a highly sarcastic attitude towards those outside their own political sphere. Let the Afrikaners' words speak for them and let the reader decide for themselves what are the moral and political implications.",
                    "This books main focus is the Afrikaners and the question of the Dutch reformed church adn the shadowy organization known as the Broederbond. But this book is outdated. It gives far too much credence to the so-called power of the Afrikaners. If the Afrikaners are so powerful then why haven't they been able to protect the more then 1000 Afrikaner farmers who have ben murdered since 1991. The reality is that they are powerless to defend themselves against the ethnic cleansing taking place in the Orange Free State and Transvaal and the government has turned its back. Unfortunatly no text will do to illuminate the genocide taking place in S. Africa.Seth J. Frantzman",
                    "This book is in urgent need of revision. As the title indicates, the book was written almost a decade ago at a time when the only white tribe of Africa prepared for black majority rule. Revisiting the anxieties of a visible minority in Africa a decade after the internationally celebrated power transfer to the majority is appropriate.An update to this book could contribute to constructive debate on minority rights. A valuable contribution can be made to minority rights as a matter of principle, irrespective of race or ethnicity, by addressing the following matters:- A Genocide Watch Alert has been issued regarding the number of visible minority Boer farmers murdered in South Africa over the last decade (&#65533;Over 1000 Boer farmers in South Africa have been murdered since 1991&#65533;&lt; www.genocidewatch.org/BoersSlain01.htm >).- The murders of visible minority Boer farmers in South Africa have increased under majority rule and more than one in 40 has been murdered over the last decade. The 1400 farmers murdered over the last decade could be classified under the Genocide Convention (&#65533;A Bloody Harvest&#65533; :&lt; www.mnet.co.za/CarteBlanche/Display/Display.asp?Id=2265 >).- Most of the Government of South Africa and the Cabinet indulged in public incitement to murder the already most murdered visible minority Boer farmers under their jurisdiction (&#65533;DA Slams ANC&#65533;s double-speak&#65533; : &lt; www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,,2-7-12_1200601,00.html >).- The &#65533;Kill the Boer, kill the farmer&#65533; slogan invented by the majority party was defined by the Human Rights Commission as advocacy of hatred (&#65533;Kill the boer slogan outlawed&#65533; : &lt; www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,6119,2-7-1442_1388921,00.html >).The events above are only some of the incidents that illustrate the requirement that this book be revised. The present silence in the media of the violation of minority rights does not foster virtuous moral values. The authors will then have the opportunity to relate the pre ante anxieties expressed by Afrikaners to a reality check and also champion the rights of all minorities as a matter of principle, irrespective of race or creed.Given these new realities, as long as this book remains outdated, it only serves a prejudiced purpose. I look forward to your revised edition.",
                    "This book thoughtfully uncovers the philosophies and social constructs within the Afrikaner community of South Africa, through interviews with Afrikaners and the reflections and insights of the author. Like all books, the positioning of the author is glimpsed through the narratives, but it does not detract in any way from the fact that the accounts and interviews reflect the realities of the dominant thoughts and the racial and social ideologies that created a system as morraly abhorrent as apartheid. This is apparent to any honest researcher or observer of the apartheid and post apartheid state.Like several of my colleagues and students, I found this to be a compelling and powerful work, using Afrikaner voices that contribute to our understanding of the construction of the apartheid state and provide a sobering framework through which to assess the options for social change and racial co-existence.It is ironic that a couple of reviews of this work reflect the same dominant thought patterns that the Afrikaner interviewees reflect in much of the book. Yet these same reviewers have the audacity to accuse the author of seeking to manipulate the reader by her \"own personal and hidden agenda's\"According to the vitriolic outpourings of one reviewer, the writer did not produce the \"real truth\" , \"she tried really hard to trash them [Afrikaners](based on her own pre-conceived ideas) and practice the \"bad old habits\" of western countries of waging propaganda wars against them....\" etc (sic)It is hard to be moderate in responding to this review which reeked of obvious biases, racial antagonisms and limited analytical capacities. I simply suggest that future readers should apply a very critical lens to the previous reviewer who revealed his innate moral and racial limitations by insisting that the world should not criticize the Afrikaner aapartheid complex but be grateful that they did not blow up the entire African continent.In his morbidly racist fashion, the harshly critical reviewer of this book informs us that : \"after all: if SA was as racist and as bad as the book depicts them to be, and if they so wished, they could have destroyed every single Sub-Saharan country, let alone just the blacks in their own country...but why didnt they?...they certainly had the power and already had the \"bad boy\" image from the international community - the challenge is to write a book that will credit them for not doing so, and also explain fully WHY they chose to maintain the blacks rather than \"do away\" with them - that's a book I'm still hoping to find!It is a pity that his trip to South Africa did not make clear to him what the rest of the world knows: the Afrikaners sought to \"maintain\" (or rather oppress and exploit) the blacks in South Africa in order to maintain their social, economic and power-oriented agendas. Apartheid was no philanthropic enterprise, but a focused search for self aggrandizement at the expense of the other. This is made clear through the unvarnished interviews and the statements of members of the AFRIKANER COMMUNITY in this book.So the reader wishes to read a book that praises the Afrikaner community for not blowing up the entire African continent, I suggest you turn to works of fiction or to the haranguings of the previous reviewer. If, however, the reader seeks courageous insights into the minds of selected members of the Afrikaner community, and a better understanding of the philosophies, social constructs and religious mindsets that made possible the creation of an apartheid state, then this is an excellent book choice.",
                    "The author's idea to interview the Afrikaners were probably good, but (just like apartheid) the writer's own personal and hidden agenda's became so obvious and frustrating that it depreciated the book and caused the reader to doubt the author rather than the topic at hand. She should have let the Afrikaners speak for themselves without putting her own stamp on it. The biggest frustration is her pre-conceived ideas with which she approached South Africa. I think the very last thing that we got from this book was the real truth. We definitely got to see the human side of Afrikaners, but she tried really hard to trash them (based on her own pre-conceived ideas) and practice the &quot;bad old habits&quot; of western countries of waging propaganda wars against them....make one wonder who funded her book and why... Her attempts to discount even the beauty of the country with political murder themes is a cheap and weak attempt to trash even the land. In her spirit of antagonism one could also say: &quot;Manhattan is a great place...but try not to think of the Indians that was cheated out of the island with $20 worth beads, and all killed after that&quot;....I wonder if the author also thinks about our country that way. I've been to SA before and I know that Afrikaners are far less racist people than what the book tries to depict - the book fails to explain that Afrikaners understand that &quot;not all blacks look the same&quot;(the perception in America) and that they understand the different tribes and their cultures. They're not given credit for trying to respect that and trying to maintain the tribal people of the land - in a however misguided way - rather than merely &quot;doing away&quot; with them the way America or Australia did. After all: if SA was as racist and as bad as the book depicts them to be, and if they so wished, they could have destroyed every single Sub-Saharan country, let alone just the blacks in their own country...but why didnt they?...they certainly had the power and already had the \"bad boy\" image from the international community - the challenge is to write a book that will credit them for not doing so, and also explain fully WHY they chose to maintain the blacks rather than &quot;do away&quot; with them - that's a book I'm still hoping to find!"

                    "My purpose for writing this review is by no means motivated by any intent to slander the author in any way. In fact, after reviewing the author's website and other books, I think my review can be applied to all bookstore shamans. Unforunately, it seems that many of you non-natives are unable to distinguish authentic native spirituality from this type of material. My concern is for the interests of the reader. The approach that most Native Americans have taken in response to this type of misrepresentation of culture has not been a peaceful one. There is no shortage of protests and lawsuits against mispresentation in Indian country. There are many people today who are taking advantage of Native American people through their presentations of bogus teachings. I implore you to use common sense. You must know that today, in this modern age, there are many charlatans at work, especially in this genre. I do not mean to insult the intelligence of the readers but what you have here by &quot;Wolf Mood Dance,&quot; is a romanticized version of Native Spirituality. In a sense, maybe this book's information is what you &quot;want&quot; to hear. If it adds something positive to your life, ..fine. But for those of you who are genuinely interested in learning about Native Spirituality, you must approach these presentations in a skeptical manner. Real Medicine healers are few and far between. Again, you must use common sense on this one. Authentic Native spiritual leaders usually keep to themselves and live a simple life usually among their own people and not in a corporate headquarters. It would seem very fishy to my people if our spiritual leaders were to suddenly begin to write books and create websites in order to promote an image. For those of you who seek spiritual guidance from an authentic leader, I'll leave you with a few points to contemplate. In short, you must seek the authentic healer in the proper place, and that is NOT in a bookstore. Also, each tribe has its own cosmology and heirarchy of deities and spirit helpers. It is not a case of lumping a Native practices in to one group and labeling it &quot;Native Spirituality.&quot; As I seek to bridge the gap between non-indians and my own people. I am willing to share what I have experienced and how a genuine Native American percieves life. I do not &quot;KNOW IT All&quot; but I do know my culture and offer my hand for the sake of helping another in life, however I can. yellowrobe@hotmail.com",
                    "The author does many things right and I only have two minor nitpicks.Nitpicks first.1 In a few places the author seems to go down to a children's level.2. She associates the elemnts with other directions than I, but on page 39 she does allude to other traditions for casting a medicine wheel.My praise for this book.1. the text is clear and easily understood.2. On page 20 and other locations the author makes it abundantly clear that Shamanic practitioners should abstain from mind altering drugs. (a refreshing departure from Carlos Castaneda!) She prefers meditation to enter the shamanic state of consciousness, and I concur!3. The author teaches that you only need a few items to practise real shamanism, and more importantly you should have no difficulty finding them at the nearby store if you do not already have them.4. The ceremonies are extremely simple to perform.5. The importantance of the proper frame of mind (a feeling of thanksgiving and gratitude)6. the importance of giving small gifts (cornmeal, tobacco, small stones, etc) as a way of saying thank you to mother earth.and other reasons",
                    "This book is a contemporary teaching tool to reach out to all people that strive for a better life. Many would say that this isn't &quot;traditional&quot; material or that shamans don't write books. The idea of this book is to reach out to the public in a contemporary Native American spiritual way, and allow people to find happiness in a difficult world. This book accomplishes the goal, and succeeds in being an excellent healing tool. Doubt or anger is not what this book is about. It is about sharing a vision (contemporary) and helping people to have a guide for self healing and happiness. No, this isn't &quot;tradional&quot; Native American writing, but it IS great contemporary Native American writing. We are all on this earth to share our ideals and culture, so do yourself a favor and read all of Wolf Moondance's work. Native American's do write books and they also share their visions with the rest of the world. Remember anger and negative opinions do NOT mend the hoop. The book is a great beginning to help people get acquinted with spirituality whether it is Native American or a personal experience. The book is a quality experience and I recommend it highly.",

                "description": "A revealing look at how independent voters have been upending the political establishment for thirty years \u2013 and how they'll decide the future of American politics. In a political system where two parties reign supreme, 40% of Americans consider themselves neither Democrats nor Republicans, but independents. Independents elected President Barack Obama in 2008 and then, in a seeming reversal, gave control of Congress to the Republicans in 2010. But who are these independents? Angry moderates? Frustrated ideologues? The base for the third party? Reformers or revolutionaries? Jacqueline Salit has spent 30 years as an insider in this growing movement of outsiders. She recounts the little-known history of this volatile force as old political institutions and categories are becoming irrelevant \u2013 even repugnant \u2013 to many Americans. An architect of unorthodox left/right coalitions within the Perot movement and Reform Party, and manager of Michael Bloomberg's three New York mayoral campaigns on the Independence Party line, Salit explores how these unclaimed voters are not only deciding elections, but reshaping the political landscape. With a surprising cast of characters \u2013 from the famous to the unknown \u2013 Salit argues that the failure to heed this movement against partisanship (and even parties) puts political careers at risk and damages essential features of American democracy. She reveals how independents underestimate their own power and how they can make the most of their newfound moment in the sun.",

                    "Once again Ralph Nader steps up to the plate that few others will approach. In &quot;The Good Fight&quot; Nader again challenges the status quo, voter apathy, and citizens who have forgotten that THEY run the USA, not corporate interests. As with his previous books, Nader presents an unnerving mix of dispair and hope. He awakens the reader with the progressive view of the problems with America. Such claims of corporate corruption of politics, disregard for human rights, dwindling consumer rights, a failed health care system, and wanton destruction of the environment assail the reader and provoke a sense of hopelessness. But then just as quickly, Nader offers insight, strategy, encouragement, and hope to turn things around and put the PEOPLE back in DEMOCRACY.Neither a Republican nor a Democrat (difficult for some people to comprehend), Nader points out the shortcomings of both parties and how they have both surrendered to corporate interests. Corporations donate millions of dollars to candidates. Upon election the candidates subsequently act in the interest of their corporate donors, not in the interest of thier constituency. Corporations with no allegiance to the USA then expand their rights, while all-too-often weakening the rights of the people. With so many people obsessed with hot-button issues, they fail to see this undermining of democracy at a fundamental level.&quot;We are a nation of, by, and for the people, not corporations.&quot;Regardless of your partisanship, I recommend this book as a superb eye-opener. If it fails to provoke constructive thought, clear your mind of political bias and read it again. Since completing this book (as well as previous Nader books) I have passed it on to friends and family across the political spectrum. All have agreed that at the very least, it will make you think twice about what you think you know.",
                    "Anyone whose intuition is telling them that &quot;things aren't quite right&quot; in the governence of our democracy, I totally recommend this read. The Democrats like to project their party as the Party of the People, but my own experience is that doesn't jive anymore, but I couldn't put it into words. Nader's book was quite helpful in beginning to see that the Democrats & Republicans are more concerned with winning and maintaining power than addressing the pressing needs of the country. I found myself sad at certain passages, realizing that we Americans are losing our capacity for self-governence, and the political class is quite willing to hurt average folks if it means re-election for them and $$ for their corporate friends. Nader's book, as well as his campaign, is shedding light on some ugly facts about our two-party system. After reading the book, I find current news events more alarming, especially how the Democrats are subverting democracy by keeping him off the ballot and away from the voters. Republicans, in a public display of inconfidence in Pres Bush, are also guilty of gaming the ballot access laws. Both parties refuse to acknowledge that their are 10s of millions of Independents and non-voters who no longer support them or their practices. The most alarming realization is this: The Democrats & Republicans are failing the American people in huge ways and causing a lot of human pain, and yet they will not yield to any grassroots solutions. Nader is quite eloquent on this point: any solution to the Nation's problems outside of the two-party framework will *not* be considered. It dawned on me how limited our options have become if we continue to invest all our energy in participating in this endless two-party fight. Nader is doing what he's always done best -- expose the oppressors of average people by fighting the good fight. For all the crap he's taking from the &quot;anybody but Bush crowd&quot;, he has the high road in this debate -- he's mostly right. After reading his book and his website, I admire his courage for sticking to his principles and truly defending democracy and, along with that, the interests of the American people.",
                    "I expected this to be a book about HIS 'good fight' and was somewhat surprised that it was his challenge to ME. To me to be a good citizen and put up a good fight - a fight for justice, fairness, open debates, free elections for third parties...maybe with instant runoff voting. Most candidates are always saying vote for me, vote for me ... but he doesn't do that. This isn't a one-campaign book.I have been active in civic affairs before but not with his perspective. The book gave me much to think about.One thing I wish he had spoken about is how his theme song &quot;If You Gotta Ask&quot; got written and what his connection is with Liquid Blue but he seldom talks much about himself. (&quot;Man, if you gotta ask you'll never know.&quot; -- Louis Armstrong) Nader certainly has the best theme song of the campaign. I purchased the album &quot;Super Nova&quot; a few months ago and would recommend it. Lyrics and samples are athttp://www.liquid-blue.comI'm eagerly waiting for Nader's book &quot;In Pursuit of Justice&quot; due out soon.",
                    "I think the biggest thing to come away with from this book, is that we need to fight back as every day citizens, and if we choose not to concern ourselves with the process of democracy, we will continue to lose it. We need to be involved, discuss citizenship with our children over the dinner table, and take active steps as patriots to ensure we have a democracy. We have been hijacked by our own corporate CEO's and politicians for over 40 years. We are powerless to the corporate greed that infiltrates every aspect of our lives, from our heath, our standard of living, even our sexuality. And we are all to blame for being way to complacent. Democracy is not a spectator sport. If you don't fight for it daily, you will not have it. The internet is a tool to bypass biased media and put power in the hands of the average person...if they choose to use it.Admittedly, I did not know much about Ralph Nader when I voted for Gore in 2000 and blamed him for Gore losing to some extent. I realize now, that is another corporate lie. In checking the FEC.GOV elections results for 2000 and comparing them with MSNBC exit polls, it turns out the Democrats caused Bush to win by voting for him...8 million of them. Clinton's own moving the party more toward corporate ownership and less for the people was part of this. When you talk to the average voter whether republican, democrat, or other, they all seem to agree on wanting more value focus in our America and less corruption. Ralph Nader has led a life against corruption. If ever there was an advocate for the people it is Mr. Nader.I don't know if the American public is smart enough to get involved and/or to vote for Nader. Maybe the decades of brainwashing from the media and corporate elite have turned us into the George Orwellian 1984. The two major parties have long since stopped serving the people. I believe if the republican and democrat VOTERS would seize the opportunity to take the steps Mr. Nader has outlined in his book, we could take back ownership of this country and put it in the citizens' hands once again. All the blaming of George Bush for the current state is just what is wrong with our mentalities. The problems with our political process and corporate ownership started long before him and under both republican and democrat administrations, and, will continue long after him regardless of who wins this election...unless people stand up and fight against it.Imagine if those 100 million people in America who do not vote would stand up and vote this year, and not for a republican or a democrat. Imagine the power! And imagine if each of the 200 million voters took it upon themselves to actively do something each week in their communities to fight against our decaying society.The American dream has been dead for the younger generations. I think Mr. Nader is challenging us to revive that dream once again. Democracy is not a spectator sport. Get involved!",
                    "Another marvelous book by a great author and a warrior of the truth !Nader as always is brilliant, decent, and incorruptible.Nader's high ethical standards and great ideas should be a guiding torch to our government.Thanks to him, there is some accountability in Washington. His persistence to fight for the public stands strong in defiance of the black out by the media and the dirty smear campaigns by the politicians. If Nader was corrupt he would've been recruited by the elites and could've occupied the White House or other high positions in government and top corporations.Nader is never for sale and will continue to stand for the little people as an icon of truth and integrity.I would highly recommend his book for every citizen that has concerns for his country, and for every person that values ethics in business, government, and life in general....",
                    "I had heard of Mr. Nader in 2000 and did not do much research on him, his name came up this year also so I decided to buy this book a couple of weeks ago to see what he is all about.I was blown away. This guy is an actual \"public servant\" in the sense of the word. He fought with GE to make cars safer which saved numerous lives, he founded 100 civic organizations (to help out the American people), and he devoted/devotes his life to help Americans.Have you ever wondered or felt frustrated that no matter how much money you make, it is not enough or you just don't feel peace? Well this is a great book for you. This book will inspire you about how to make America an excellent place.Think of Erin Brokovich and how she helped out people who were being abused by PG&E;, Nader is the same type of person, except he has helped thousands or even millions of people.Does anybody feel like our senators, congressman, president, etc. are our employees? Probably not, you probably feel like you are their employees even though you pay their tax dollars and elect them to represent you to act in their interests. Wouldn't it be nice to elect people who actually care and listen to you - make you their number one priority? - I really get that kind of feeling from Mr. Nader.- Finally a quote from the book - you may think you won't make a difference but each of us is like a few drops of water and if all the water combines it makes a great river.",
                    "This is one of those must-read books that should be required in schools and for everyone. Great reading and important lessons in how a democracy should work, and why the US falls short. But this is not to say that Ralph offers only criticism, for what he really offers are solutions. Solutions that are not imposed from above, enacted by some party or person, but solutions dependent upon the activism of the peoples who make up these United States.",
                    "Ralph Nader is about the only person I can think of who will be interviewed by Sean Hannity one day, and Amy Goodman of Democracy Now! the next. I hear so many &quot;dittoheads&quot; on talk radio say that they voted for him in 2000 that it makes me wonder if maybe some votes of conservatives disappeared down some Diebold rabbit hole.I didn't realize that Nader was the force behind the auctioning of seats when airplanes are overbooked. And his efforts to make cars safer here, made cars safer all over the world as foreign producers had to increase their standards to enter our market. So, Nader isn't just a national treasure, but an international hero.I just started the book, and it will be helpful in figuring out how to be a better public citizen myself.",
                    "Ralph Nader, the personification of social justice in America, is a learned man with an encyclopedic knowledge of what is going on in the America of today. His decades of service to an ungrateful nation translate into a book packed with a litany of wrongs transpiring day-in and day-out in America.The Good Fight, Nader points out, just happens to coincide with his candidacy for the US presidency. As such, the book avoids overt political campaigning either pro or con - the book's sub-title notwithstanding - and focuses on listing, detailing and offering solutions for the endless catalogue of what ails America. The book urges civil action, education and participation in response to the predicaments facing the USA in every respect. Be it foreign policy, safety concerns, food or drugs, schooling and science, voracious corporate greed or the media Nader points to the problem and offers a congruent solution in an easy-to-read (hint hint, middle America) and concise manner.In the corporatist race to the bottom The Good Fight fingers politicians and big business as the betrayers of the American ideal and the media as the happy-go-lucky accomplices to the treason.Will Americans strain away from their TV sets long enough to listen and regain mastery of their nation? Probably not, for after all this is the exact same deluded citizenry that needs Nader, but frankly deserves Bush.",
                    "Many people have mixed emotions when it comes to the tenacious Ralph Nader, but truth be told, Ralph Nader proves time and time again what an amazing intellect he really is.After reading this book I'm thoroughly convinced that this man should be president of the United States, and that we should start considering third party alternatives. I've also come to the conclusion that the Republicans and the Democrats don't have our best interest at heart, and they can't be trusted with our well-being.With that said, most Americans feel the same way since many of us don't participate in these farcical elections. And if we had a real democracy we'd be exposed to many alternative viewpoints, and candidates such as Nader would have been permitted to participate in the presidential debates.Many Green Party candidates weren't allowed to debate in the 2006 elections. Michael Berg (who ran for congress in Delaware) wasn't allowed to debate; when he tried he was escorted off of the stage. Senator Hillary Clinton refused to debate Howie Hawkins in New York, and in Seattle Washington Aaron Dixon was arrested for trying to participate in the senatorial debate. For this reason alone this book is an important read. We as Americans need to ascertain that our constitutional rights are in jeopardy.The \"Good Fight\" is a true magnum opus of bona fide leftwing opinion backed up with facts, facts that should scare the heck out of us.Fact 1: HIV/AIDS infects forty million people worldwide and life-sustaining drugs are not available to a large majority of people because these drugs cost more than $10,000 a year in the U.S. and other first world countries. Nader said that the drugs are extremely expensive\"because the brand-name companies have patent monopolies that prevent price-lowing competition. And our government (under the Clinton administration) was acquiescing with The World Trade Organization (WTO) over these patents.Countries such as India began manufacturing generic medicine, but the larger drug companies still hold the patents to the original medications and sell them for quadruple the price of what they are really worth. Meanwhile, \"countries in the WTO will not be allowed to exercise their own safety standards. In addition, drug companies themselves lobby and threaten governments in developing countries. Often such countries suppress the generic cheaper competition that could save millions of dollars and help control HIV/AIDS,\" said Nader.When governments and corporations interfere with peoples' right to live, it's not only unethical, but it can be construed as murder. Think about it: Nader is not saying that pharmaceutical companies don't have a right to make a profit; they just shouldn't have the right to make it at the expense of peoples' lives when a pandemic such as AIDS threatens the entire world.Fact 2: Both \"political parties received $9.3 million from convicted criminals during the 2002 elections,\" according to the \"Corporate Crime Reporter.\" Corporations such as Pfizer and Chevron were part of the scandal. Pfizer contributed $1.1 million to the Democrats and Republicans and Chevron gave $875,400 to both parties. So, what the American people really need to inquire is; do our votes or opinions really count when powerful companies can purchase politicians at a whim? When democracy is for sale to the highest bidder then it's an oligarchy.Fact 3: \"The foreign policy and intelligence agencies operate in secrecy and rarely have to explain themselves, even to each other. (The 9/11 Commission provides a welcome exception, but received a chilly reception from the Bush Administration),\" said Nader. The truth is the 9/11 Commission report is a fraud, but Nader did say that, \"the U.S. Constitution requires publication of the governments budget, but when an American citizen challenged the secrecy of the CIA's budget in federal court, the case was dismissed.\" Nader didn't name the citizen in question but Article I of the Bill of Rights does guaranty \"a redress of grievances.\"Nader's book also covers the issues of corporate fraud, Bush and Cheney's obliquity over 9/11, globalization, decimating of the world, plus environmental issues.I don't agree with everything Nader has to say and you won't either, but that isn't the point. The point is he was a presidential candidate that should have been heard in 2004 and had the right to run on equal terms against Bush and Kerry. And we should be mighty angry that he wasn't given the opportunity to do so.And as much as people would like to believe that if Nader didn't run for president, 9/11 would not have occurred. I'm afraid to inform those people that 9/11 was in the works all along. Just ask yourself how the USA Patriot Act became law so quickly and ponder on the fact that John Kerry wrote the money laundering provisions in the act. And according to Alex Jones, John Kerry and Bush are distant cousins. Think about it? Our last presidential election was bogus! We need to take our country back and the only way to accomplish it is by voting for alternative candidates.Excellent Read!",
                    "Ralph wrote to express what he observed politically. He is a prophet with a vision.He covered a variety topics ranging from government to corporation, consumers, foreign policy, globalization and justice. He pointed out the rights and wrongs, success and failure, use and abuse, have and have-not. American people paid the price to the reality of economic meltdown. He elaborated chapters by chapters in great details so that readers can comprehend the invisible hands working. This kind of information usually are not covered in depth as newspaper are syndicated.He is a patriot to bring America back to the ideals of the fore-fathers. He joined the presidential race and staged a good fight. In this 2004 book, he highlighted to regulate derivative trading (p.188), too big to fail (p.192), single payer health insurance (p.210).Are we better off if Ralph wins the Presidency? Can Americans use this book to evaluate Lincoln's famous \"of the people, for the people, by the people\" and motivate citizens to declare independence in this great democracy?Last week, on January 21 2010, Supreme Court Judges vote for unlimited corporate sponsored political campaign. Why a corporation, a legal entity, unable to run for office or to vote or to jail, has such powerful giant freedom of speech against American David? Will such voice intimidate and drown out congressmen and voters? Is it evolution after a hundred year based on this \"campaign finance reform\"? Is it the golden rule - whoever has the most gold will dictate the rules? Do we expect a plutocracy to offer universal health care, regulation of banking, environmental protection, help to the middle class or the poor?This book is a good state of the states address from the heart of Ralph who loves the country.",
                    "In The Good Fight, Ralph Nader, long-time consumer rights crusader, presents startling figures about the corporate-dominated United States. There is an essential difference between what the people want for the U.S. and what multinational corporations are currently doing. This book not only highlights those differences, it inspires the reader to take action. Peaceful protest and determined activism can (and will) change the country. Mr. Nader has been doing it for decades, and this book will help every reader to join him in \"The Good Fight.\"If every person in the country reads this, we will be one step closer to overcoming the 'manufactured consent' into which we have fallen. By restoring citizen activism and honesty to politics, democracy can eventually return to the U.S.",
                    "Mr. Nader provides an idealistic and sensible approach and criticism to how things are done today.He offers solutions, which is refreshing and is not afraid to say unpopular things. This was a good book.",
                    "This was a pretty good read, however somewhat dissapointing. It is standard arguments against the party duopoly. However, Nader does not stick it to the Democrats enough. They are a big part of the problem as well, and I feel that he may be holding back because of the complaints coming from that side.If Nader gave it to eveyone equally it would make for a much better book. Being that this is my first real experience with Nader's work I wished I would get more. However, it does serve to demonstrate most of his major arguments and criticisms regarding our corporate government.",
                    "This book is a must read for every American. It is written in a clear and consise manner. If you are a republician, this book will change your way of thinking. The truth hurts but it is a pill that was needed. Thank you Ralph Nader.",
                    "I have not been a supporter of Nader but was interested to read his opinions and proposed solutions on the problems of the day. Unfortunately this book is a 272 page stream of consciousness rant that offers lots of complaints but very few solutions. The few solutions offered are not even well thought through (For example, ban advertising of unhealthy food to kids. Why is this a government responsibility? Is there any evidence it would it solve the obesity problem? Exactly how would you do this? Any constitutional issues?) This book is an extremely light weight effort and very disappointing. Nader should be ashamed to accept money for this empty diatribe. If you're looking for an alternative for the major parties don't stop here.",
                    "Ralph Nader has exactly the same visual problem as George Bush; he sees everything in terms of black and white and is unable, or at least unwilling, to distinguish between different shades of grey.This blindness is what is causing him to destroy his legacy by becoming an agent for Karl Rove in sabotaging the campaigns of Al Gore and now John Kerry.Naderites can spin the 2000 election any way they want, but the undisputable fact is that if Nader had stayed out of the election Al Gore would have won Florida unambiguosly, Gore would be President, we would not be in Iraq, and all those people, U.S. troops and Iraqis, would not have been killed and injured.",
                    "I just saw Al Gore give a truly remarkable and inspiring talk on the realities of Global Warming, and couldn't help thinking what a great, green (though not Green Party) President he would've been.So, I re-read sections of this book to see if I could yet understand Nader's rationale for running in two super-tight (537-votes in 2000) presidential races, knowing he'd likely hand the election to GW Bush. And, once again, I can't see it.How cool would it have been if Nader had joined Gore (or Kerry) in return for a top post at the EPA, Agriculture, or other consumer-related federal post? Then, he'd really be making progress.As it stands, the world is going in the exact opposite direction of Nader's proclaimed platform, and his book doesn't make a strong argument for running. Not to mention, the rambling semi-coherent nature of this book makes it a tedious read.This book is conceptually and stylistically flawed.",
                    "After reading through this latest offering from Mr. Nader, I am amazed how far a once great man has fallen---thanks to his own delusions of grandeur. At one time I had liked his ideas, but sensed a stench of removal during the infamous 2000 elections.At least with this title he is no longer pretending he had a deep loyalty to the Green Party (who are really nice people) and is only interested in marketing himself. All of the genuinely laudable career achievements like seatbelt laws are diminished under the weight of personal screed. Despite obvious evidence to the contrary, he maintains there are no differences between the Democratic and the Republican Parties----and his independent candidacy is the only pure alternative.The problem is that this aforementioned process is not (and never was) social justice. Precisely because of his own historical notoriety, Mr. Nader envisions fair wages, reproductive choice, and GLBT rights as abstract policy issues---while the rest of us are currently working in the trenches for these very causes with relative obscurity and poverty.Nader's rhetoric curiously apes the same actions undertaken by the Republican Party under the homeland security mantra. To reach his point, Nader had to openly ignore significant policy research on the Bush administration and relatively recent news releases because Bush allegedly stands against everything he has worked for---and has made no secret about the ideological allegiances.The superficial courting of the Log Cabin Republicans, which had occurred during the 2000 campaign season, has openly been replaced by strengthened alliances with the social conservatives who are uncomfortable with GLBT rights. While I also marvel at LCR's naivet&eacute;, surely Nader realizes (in his own oft-invoked conscience) that who is elected president does make a big difference for public policy---and the fate of the nation.Because a party is not carrying him this time, Nader (if somehow elected) would have an even more difficult time getting anything he wanted passed into law-while stopping opposed policies. Legislators of different parties and/or ideologies would easily be able to summon enough votes against a chief executive who was that disdainful of the process. For a one-time political insider, this environment would be especially disastrous because he would have nothing to show the very few lingering supporters. Finally, this gridlock would be largely grassroots (instead of ideology or interest-driven) in the ultimate irony.I also don't think this book did enough to address voter fraud and discrepancies existing in the United States electoral system. Having a serious discussion about democracy when people are unable to experience it in their own communities is irresponsible. In a globalized publishing market, ideas within this book must also ring hollow for the Iraqi people whose country is being colonized under fabricated evidence.The best way to close the Democracy gap is to recognize Nader is now only interested in electing the most radical of Republicans---and actually does not care what communities are disenfranchised in the process",
                    "I've always admired Ralph Nader, but in recent months I can't help but think something is deeply, truly wrong. Attacking Moore, the Greens, the CBC... who's left? Who is he still friends with?He knows this is probably the last time he'll be running, and I suppose wants to go out in a blaze of incoherence.Enter this book, a strange tabletop game far removed from reality, a plan for action in the Bizzaro World that exists only in Nader's fevered brain.I hope someone close to him ends up writing a book about his strange slide into irrelevancy, it would make for more interesting reading and possibly serve as a warning.",
                    "What to make of Ralph Nader?For the record, his main arguments - that on non-hot button issues, the two parties are so close together as to be inseparable, that corporations are subtly perverting every facet of our lives, and that civic apathy is the main problem our country faces politically - are absolutely on target.I might not agree with some of his ideas on reforming government - a 100% tax on incomes over $100,000 is a ludicrous idea, for example - but I have no argument with his fervent wish to see it reformed.Therefore, in an abstract sense, this is a useful book, even if you don't agree with Nader's ideas. But the problem with Nader is that his ideas and actions have not been abstract; indeed, they've caused our government to be taken over by ideologues who line their pockets, and say \"liberal\" ten times a sentence to excuse their actions. Worse yet, these ideologues have made the problems Nader mentions far more serious.Any thoughtful discussion of Nader and his ideas has to take this into account.There is an argument that in order to truly reform government, it has to crash and burn first. By running in 2000, Nader ensured just that. Whether that was his intent or not is unclear (I suspect it might have been), but the outcome was not in question. Putting Bush in the White House and the GOP in charge of Congress has been an unabashed disaster for this country, in ways obvious and subtle...and worse yet, in ways that we probably won't really understand for another 20 years.One can't judge this book, and Nader, without giving thought to the consequences of his actions. That is why I give it one star...and if I could, I'd give it zero stars. There is a better way to improve our government than to have George W. Bush and the GOP take it over and destroy it, and whether this is what Nader intended or not, that's what happened.That is why I give this book zero stars...not for Nader's ideas, but the unforgivable consequences of his actions.",
                    "Ralph, you hypocrite. Blast corporations then seek them out when it's time to publish a book and make some dough off those corporations. Come on, Ralph! Publish an e-book, save the trees, stay away from the corporations. Have a little self-respect. Sheesh!",
                    "Nader is nothing more than a sanctimonious accomplice fore everything that has happened over the past five years. The blood of nearly 2,500 American soldiers and tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians is on his hands. This cannot be ignored when discussing this book. A book that will get absolutely no attention from the goons he actively helped put in the White House."

George Takei has captured hearts and minds worldwide with his magnetic performances, sharp wit, and outspoken commitment to equal rights. But long before he braved new frontiers in STAR TREK, he woke up as a four-year-old boy to find his own birth country at war with his father's -- and their entire family forced from their home into an uncertain future. In 1942, at the order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, every person of Japanese descent on the west coast was rounded up and shipped to one of ten \"relocation centers,\" hundreds or thousands of miles from home, where they would be held for years under armed guard. THEY CALLED US ENEMY is Takei's firsthand account of those years behind barbed wire, the terrors and small joys of childhood in the shadow of legalized racism, his mother's hard choices, his father's tested faith in democracy, and the way those experiences planted the seeds for his astonishing future. What does it mean to be American? Who gets to decide? George Takei joins cowriters Justin Eisinger & Steven Scott and artist Harmony Becker for the journey of a lifetime.",

                "description": "In May 1937, seventy thousand workers walked off their jobs at four large steel companies known collectively as \u201cLittle Steel.\u201d The strikers sought to make the companies retreat from decades of antiunion repression, abide by the newly enacted federal labor law, and recognize their union. For two months a grinding struggle unfolded, punctuated by bloody clashes in which police, company agents, and National Guardsmen ruthlessly beat and shot unionists. At least sixteen died and hundreds more were injured before the strike ended in failure. The violence and brutality of the Little Steel Strike became legendary. In many ways it was the last great strike in modern America. Traditionally the Little Steel Strike has been understood as a modest setback for steel workers, one that actually confirmed the potency of New Deal reforms and did little to impede the progress of the labor movement. However, The Last Great Strike tells a different story about the conflict and its significance for unions and labor rights. More than any other strike, it laid bare the contradictions of the industrial labor movement, the resilience of corporate power, and the limits of New Deal liberalism at a crucial time in American history.",

                    "Mary Heaton Vorse, author of \"Strike!,\" had been a labor reporter and activist off-and-on for 17 years when she ended up reporting on the Loray Mill strike in Gastonia, North Carolina in 1929. There were many strikes during the 20s and 30s, and the reasons for this one was typical of the time: low pay, the \"stretch-out\" system - which forced them to double their work load for small increases in pay - and 12-hour work days. Before it ended, a strike leader was murdered, a police chief was killed, and several organizers and workers were tried and convicted under dubious circumstances.The Gastonia strike wasn't the bloodiest, nor was it even successful. But it was unusual because it happened in the South, where unionism was weak, and because of the number of women and girls involved in it. Not only did women make up nearly half the work force at the mill, but many of the strike leaders as well. One of them, Ella May Wiggins, was a 29-year-old mother of nine who'd written a number of ballads about the union and the strike. After she was killed, the strike collapsed.Within four years, six novels were written about the strike, now collectively known as the \"Gastonia novels.\" In addition to \"Strike!,\" the novels were:\"Beyond Desire\" by Sherwood Anderson\"The Shadow Before\" by William Rollins, Jr.\"Call Home the Heart\" by Olive Tilford Dargan\"To Make My Bread\" by Grace Lumpkin\"Gathering Storm\" by Dorothy Myra PageVorse's book is a fictional version of the events in Gastonia, and the first of the six to get published. The story is told through Roger Hewlett, a Northern reporter who's been sent by his newspaper to cover the strike. Through him, we meet Ferdinand \"Fer\" Deane, the Northern organizer leading the workers, and Irma Rankin, another organizer. There's a sexual tension between these two, and because Fer is idolized by the workers, Irma resents him and the attention he gets.Roger gets to know the striking workers, and over time becomes not only a supporter, but a collaborator. Because he grew up affluent and well-connected, he was able in the beginning to mingle with the upper classes in town, where he hears first hand their views of the mill workers. Most of the \"comfortable people\" see the workers as ungrateful, wasteful, and easily manipulated. They also feel the strikers are criminals who should be run out of town, or worse.Many of Roger's colleagues from the other papers mention a \"lynchy feeling\" in town early in the novel, which foreshadows the legal and vigilante violence that comes later.During the strike, the workers face months of abuse and attacks from the townspeople. After the strikers started a food storehouse, masked vigilante's break in and destroy everything, including all the food. When workers come to fight them off, the vigilantes' rush off just as National Guardsmen arrive on the scene. But, in a perversion of justice, the guardsmen arrest the workers and allow vigilantes to walk away.Later, the mill starts evicting workers from mill-owned housing - most workers lived in mill houses - but instead of giving in, they band closer together and start a tent city on the edge of town.The harassment continues until one night, for unknown reasons, the police chief and some of his officers try to force their way inside the tent city. All of them are drunk, and at some point one of them starts shooting. The workers fire back, and in the gunfight that follows, the police chief is killed. After a mob attacks the striking workers, 72 of them are arrested and held for murder.The heart of the book, nearly a third, is dedicated to the trial, and Vorse describes it in detail. But, the climax comes after the trial, and it lives up to the \"lynchy feeling\" some reporters had noticed earlier in the novel.Throughout much of the book, Vorse describes the strike as a living being. After the workers had resisted the evictions, she describes the strike as, \"A living thing which had a life of its own. It was strong and lusty, it almost bled to death, it grew feeble, and again it became stronger.\" But, on the other side was the mob, which a preacher called, \"A raving, witless thing.\" As Vorse writes, \"Collectively human beings are at their best or their worst. They climb perilous heights of beauty and sacrifice together. And together they revert to the hunting pack, creatures aslaver for blood.\" It's clear who she sees as being at their \"best\" and who's at their \"worst.\"The one weakness in the book is the number of mill workers Vorse juggles. Getting to know so many of them helps the reader see the workers as people, as opposed to simply a faceless mass, but most are not important to the main narrative and at times it's hard to keep them straight. Fortunately, it doesn't distract too much from the story or the climax.The book this review is based on contained an excellent introduction by Dee Garrison, a historian who's studied Vorse and her work. Garrison gives a general background of the period, of Vorse's life, and the facts of the Gastonia strike in just 12 pages. I recommend buying a book with this introduction."
