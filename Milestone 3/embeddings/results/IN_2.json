The book conducts a thorough evaluation of current methodologies for a wide rage of circumstances in which racial discrimination may occur and makes recommendations on how to better assess the presence and effects of discrimination.Excerpt: In the United States, large differences among racial and ethnic groups characterize many areas of social, economic, and political life, including such domains as the criminal justice system, education, employment, health care, and housing. For example, racial differences-which generally disadvantage minorities-exist in arrest and incarceration rates, earnings, income and wealth, levels of educational attainment, health status and health outcomes, and mortgage lending and homeownership. There are many possible explanations for such differences; one explanation may be the persistence of behaviors and processes of discrimination against minorities.In this context, the Committee on National Statistics convened the Panel on Methods for Assessing Discrimination in 2001 to define racial discrimination; review and critique existing methods used to measure such discrimination and identify new approaches; and make recommendations regarding the best of these methods, as well as promising areas for future research. Because of wide interest in this topic, several funding agencies sponsored our study: the Ford Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Department of Education.The work of this panel is a direct outgrowth of the project that resulted in the two-volume report America Becoming: Racial Trends and Their Consequences (National Research Council, 2001a). Several of the panel members who were involved in producing these volumes held conversations around the question \"What do we need to know to understand more about the role of race in American society?\" At least one answer was\"We need better methods to identify and understand the effects of race-based discrimination.\"The panel comprised a diverse group of experts in the fields of criminal justice, law, economics, psychology, public policy, sociology, and statistics. This diversity added a great deal to the creative debates among the panel members but also added to the difficulties in writing this report. It took time to develop a language and an intellectual framework with which we were all comfortable. In our report, we provide an extended discussion of definitions of discrimination and race, consolidating many aspects of a large social science literature on these topics. We also discuss various approaches to modeling and measuring discrimination in different fields. The interdisciplinary and diverse nature of the panel helped broaden these discussions, and we hope that our presentation of the definitional issues provides insight to those interested in the conceptualization of discrimination, just as we hope that our discussion of the methodological issues introduces new ideas to those engaged in measuring discrimination.The breadth and complexity of the topic of discrimination and its effects posed a challenge for maintaining a tight focus on our charge, which was to define discrimination and review methods for measuring it. To keep to that charge, we spend no time discussing policies intended to alleviate discrimination (such as affirmative action or programs to build recruitment pools). We acknowledge, however, that the panel members have diverse opinions about appropriate policy options to address problems of discrimination, and inevitably our debates over policy issues at times crept into our debates over methodological issues.Because of the charge and constraints on our time and resources, we focus our analysis on racial discrimination, particularly discrimination against African Americans, for which there is a very large literature. We do not address discrimination on the basis of nonracial factors, such as gender or age, nor do we discuss so-called reverse discrimination. Under the rubric of racial discrimination, we do include discrimination against ethnic groups, particularly Hispanics. The reasons have to do with the discrimination that has affected them coupled with the blurred nature of the definition of race and ethnicity for many Hispanics.All of the panel members recognize the difficulties in defining racial discrimination in a clear way and in finding credible ways to measure it. There are different types of discrimination, different venues in which it can occur, and different ways in which it can have an effect. This report cannot address all of these topics comprehensively, but we have attempted to focus on at least some of the more important definitional and measurement problems. The measurement issues we address are relevant for understanding and measuring other types of discrimination. Despite the difficulty of ourtask, the panel members are all persuaded that accurate methods to identify and measure discrimination are highly important, and as scholars and re-searchers, we were committed to carrying out our charge in the best way possible.",

                    "Readers looking for an impassioned tirade against racial quotas will be disappointed. Readers who are fed up with all the impassioned tirades against and all the fanatical polemics in favor of giving certain people Most Favored Race status will find this book a welcome relief.Chapter 1 (pp. 1 - 20) makes the point that prejudice by any other name is still prejudice. It doesn't cease to be prejudice depending on which race it is directed against.Chapter 2 (pp. 21 - 38) sketches the history of the America's insistence on no discrimination based on \"race, color, creed or country of national origin.\"Chapter 3 describes the about-face the nation did in the 1960s. \"It is hard to find in the speeches or statements of civil rights leaders prior to the early 1960s any sustained interest in `preferential treatment' for blacks.\" (p. 42). In 1961, CORE, then a small splinter party, began to agitate for racial preferences. One thing that helped cause the about-face was rioting. \"The traditional response to a riot had been to hold the rioting individuals responsible.\" (p. 44). A commission appointed by President Johnson in 1968 held that \"white racism\" was responsible. (p. 45). This began the now-accepted practice of holding the victims responsible for the crimes of racially ennobled individuals.Once the crack had been opened to preferences based on factors other than skills and performance, the dam burst and many other groups were granted Most Favored Group status until by 1990 the only group not eligible for preferential treatment was white American heterosexual males.As legal challenges were mounted and public opposition swelled, the wording of laws became more cagey: race, ethnicity and country of national origin were to be \"one factor among many\" in determining who was preferred. This protected the preferred groups from legal challenges and allowed them to go on doing preference-as-usual in college admissions, hiring and contracting.What most Americans do not realize is that this rather bizarre program and its rationale was only one among several that has placed this nation in great peril. If you want to read the whole story, get While America Sleeps: How Islam, Immigration and Indoctrination Are Destroying America from Within. All of these threats were started and are allowed to continue because of a change in the mind-set of American leaders and media people. The only way to save America is to change this mind-set.",
                    "This is another in a growing wave of anti-affirmative action books. It is also one of the best.It focuses on the twisted history of affirmative action and how the original purpose of the civil rights movement was respect for individual liberty without the \"group rights\" philisophy intrinsic in affirmative action.Bureaucrats looking for short cuts and easy solutions pushed affirmative action - without democratic legislative approval. Minority groups behaved as anyone receiving a state-sponsored benefit does - they adopted the \"philosophy\" and began to protect their newly discovered \"rights\". The fact that these \"rights\" had no legal basis and questionable pedigree in the cast and race-obsessed systems of India, Malaysia and Yugoslavia seemed of little consequence at the time. The term \"Balkanisation\" (a sad relic of Old World ethnic hatred) now has a disturbing echo in the affirmative action policies of the New World.Other reviewers may argue that affirmative action policies cannot be \"unjust\" because, although discriminatory, they are not designed to humiliate or alienate whites - only to benefit that amorphous group called \"underrepresented minorities\". The argument turns to dust when it is realised the biggest losers in the affirmative action contest are Asians. But no one wants that little secret revealed.",
                    "The fatal flaw in Terry Eastland's book is his interpretation of Justice John Marshall Harlan's famous dissent in the case Plessy v. Ferguson. Indeed, this is the same flaw that can be found in the arguments many of the opponents of affirmative action.Astonishingly, Mr. Eastland's book refers to Justice John Marshall Harlan as Justice John Paul Harlan.Mr. Eastland argues that Justice Harlan, in his dissent in Plessy, wrote &quot;that government should not have the authority to engage in racial regulation of any kind.&quot; Mr. Eastland uses Justice Harlan's now famous statement &quot;Our constitution (sic) is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens\" to build a case that affirmative action violates our Constitution. Mr. Eastland, along with other opponents of affirmative action is mistaken. Contrary to the assertions of Mr. Eastland affirmative action respects Justice Harlan's &quot;color-blind&quot; Constitution. Like other opponents of affirmative action, such as Stephen and Abigail Thernstrom who in their book, America in Black and White, have the same flaw in their argument, Mr. Eastland misunderstands Justice Harlan's dissent in Plessy.Plessy v. Ferguson was the Supreme Court case decided in 1896 which upheld the 'separate but equal' doctrine. It was this doctrine that formed the Constitutional justification for the set of racial laws known as Jim Crow. The case arose as a result of a Louisiana law which required equal but separate accommodations aboard passenger trains for the black and white races. Justice Harlan was the only Supreme Court Justice to dissent in the Plessy case.Justice Harlan made it very clear in his dissent that he opposed Louisiana's law because it was &quot;conceived in hostility to, and enacted for the purpose of humiliating, citizens of the United States of a particular race.&quot; Justice Harlan acknowledged that the white race was the dominant race in wealth and in power. This dominance, Justice Harlan noted, did not give the white race a superior position with regard to the rights protected by the Constitution. The Constitution, according to Justice Harlan, recognizes &quot;no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens. There is no cast here. Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved.&quot;Justice Harlan did not object to the Louisiana law because it recognized the social, political, and cultural reality of race. Justice Harlan found the Louisiana law contrary to our Constitution because the action of the Louisiana legislature proceeded, according to Justice Harlan, &quot;on the ground that colored citizens are so inferior and degraded that they cannot be allowed to sit in public coaches occupied by white citizens?&quot; Justice Harlan's &quot;color-blind&quot; Constitution is &quot;color-blind&quot; precisely because it recognizes &quot;every right that inheres in civil freedom, and of the equality before the law of all citizens of the United States without regard to race.&quot; Thus, Justice Harlan argued, laws that would allow individuals of one race to degrade and put into an inferior position individuals of another race notwithstanding any inequalities in the actual social, political, and economic positions of these individuals, would be unconstitutional.Regarding affirmative action the issue is whether these programs conform to or violate Justice Harlan's &quot;color-blind&quot; Constitution. To find out, I have formulated the following questions that are based on the reasons Justice Harlan used in finding that the Louisiana law violated the principles of the &quot;color-blind&quot; Constitution. The words in quotation marks are the words used by Justice Harlan in his Plessy dissent.Are affirmative action programs &quot;conceived in hostility to&quot; the white race?Are affirmative action programs &quot;enacted for the purpose of humiliating&quot; the white race?Are the effects of an affirmative action program such that it &quot;practically, puts the brand of servitude and degradation upon&quot; whites?Do affirmative action programs proceed on the belief that white &quot;citizens are so inferior and degraded that they cannot be allowed&quot; in our schools of medicine and law?Do affirmative action programs violate any &quot;right that inheres in civil freedom&quot; and deny &quot;the equality before the law of all citizens of the United States without regard to race?&quot;The answers to these questions are no.Affirmative action, therefore, conforms to the principle of the &quot;color-blind&quot; Constitution and does not violate the rights of whites. Mr. Eastland and the other opponents of affirmative action are seriously mistaken when they insist otherwise. I agree with the other reviewers, such as Linda Chavez, who note that \"Terry Eastland puts forth the best argument to date\" for opposing affirmative action. But I have shown that this argument, though it is the best that the opponents of affirmative action can make, is fatally flawed."

FINALIST FOR THE FINANCIAL TIMES AND MCKINSEY BUSINESS BOOK OF THE YEAR AWARD \u2022 LONGLISTED FOR THE PORCHLIGHT BUSINESS BOOK AWARD \u201cLivingston has made the important and challenging task of addressing systemic racism within an organization approachable and achievable.\u201d\u2014Alex Timm, co-founder and CEO, Root Insurance Company How can I become part of the solution? In the wake of the social unrest of 2020 and growing calls for racial justice, many business leaders and ordinary citizens are asking that very question. This book provides a compass for all those seeking to begin the work of anti-racism. In The Conversation, Robert Livingston addresses three simple but profound questions: What is racism? Why should everyone be more concerned about it? What can we do to eradicate it? For some, the existence of systemic racism against Black people is hard to accept because it violates the notion that the world is fair and just. But the rigid racial hierarchy created by slavery did not collapse after it was abolished, nor did it end with the civil rights era. Whether it\u2019s the composition of a company\u2019s leadership team or the composition of one\u2019s neighborhood, these racial divides and disparities continue to show up in every facet of society. For Livingston, the difference between a solvable problem and a solved problem is knowledge, investment, and determination. And the goal of making organizations more diverse, equitable, and inclusive is within our capability. Livingston\u2019s lifework is showing people how to turn difficult conversations about race into productive instances of real change. For decades he has translated science into practice for numerous organizations, including Airbnb, Deloitte, Microsoft, Under Armour, L\u2019Oreal, and JPMorgan Chase. In The Conversation, Livingston distills this knowledge and experience into an eye-opening immersion in the science of racism and bias. Drawing on examples from pop culture and his own life experience, Livingston, with clarity and wit, explores the root causes of racism, the factors that explain why some people care about it and others do not, and the most promising paths toward profound and sustainable progress, all while inviting readers to challenge their assumptions. Social change requires social exchange. Founded on principles of psychology, sociology, management, and behavioral economics, The Conversation is a road map for uprooting entrenched biases and sharing candid, fact-based perspectives on race that will lead to increased awareness, empathy, and action.",

                    "The previous reviewer's commentary is both biased and flawed, and his words reveal anger and probably latent racist beliefs as well. This book is a nice collection of various viewpoints in social science studies of prejudice, discrimination, and racism in the job market, higher education, and American life in general. Most of the readings are written by sociologists, so there is a heavy reliance on statistics and numbers to support the contributors' arguments. The single best article is written by Bob Blauner and is called \"Talking Past Each Other: Black and White Languages of Race.\" In this article, Blauner deconstructs the VERY type of rhetoric that the previous reviewer employs, rhetoric that is very characteristic of many whites in the post-Civil Rights Era (read the article for more information).Blauner's article, and the book in general, stress the importance that personal upbringing and experience plays in shaping one's views about race or anything else for that matter. That is the key point. A white multi-millionaire who grew up in a condominium on the shores of Long Island is simply not going to have the same outlook on life as an impoverished black female living in the slums of Chicago's South Side...period. The sooner Americans of all racial backgrounds realize that, and the sooner people accept and understand that their personal experiences have shaped their worldviews - and realize that NO ONE has an \"objective\" or \"unbiased\" worldview - that better off we will be.Books like this emphasize this crucial idea. For some reason, those who find themselves in relatively advantaged positions in society have a very hard time facing this music. This is a great book."

                    "Having read a number of books on the racial problems in the US including \"Paved with Good Intentions\", \"The Dispossessed Majority\" and \"My Awakening\", I was expecting a book which would be both lengthy and difficult to read. Instead, lawyer Edgar Steele's book \"Defensive Racism\" is both entertaining and easy to read. Mr. Steele's exposition of the racial situation is laid out for the reader in a simple, logical style which takes the reader on a survey of the racial questions which are current in America. The first thing the book takes on is race: is it real, is it OK to recognize that racial differences exist? The conclusion is that race does exist, the evidence is overwhelming and that it is OK to see that this is true. There are differences in skin color which aren't really very important but which are obviously inherited. There are differences in intellectual capacity which are much more important and are inherited. Most important of all, there are differences in character which are inherited. To Mr. Steele, these are the most important differences because they determine how we interact with the people around us. Steele discusses how animal breeders select for character in their dogs, in their horses, how the breeding for character and personality has a long history in the selection of domestic animals. He then shows research to support the contention that human character is also inherited and has been selected in different populations and, to use that word, races. Unlike other books on these topics, Mr. Steele's writing style is light and entertaining, yet very to the point. I was surprised to see my teenage daughter reading the book at a friend's house and complaining because we didn't have a copy so she could finish reading it. Now that's an endorsement of an engaging writing style! Unlike a lot of books on the racial problems in America, \"Defensive Racism\" isn't just about race. The book also discusses related national problems such as the true cost of unrestricted third world immigration, our current middle eastern wars and why we are there (Israel figures large in this discussion), a history of past wars with an explanation of the motives behind those wars (it wasn't just because we we were good and the other guys were bad), a chapter on economics that even a teenager can understand along with a prediction of an economic meltdown as the costs of racial problems overwhelm our ability to pay. The book ends with a discussion for \"New America\" one based on facts rather than racial fantasy. This is not a book about racial intolerance but rather a plea for racial understanding, a realistic look at race and what we need to do to make our country better. I can see why lawyer Steele was so successful in the courtroom, he is very understandable and very persuasive. I highly recommend this book.",
                    "\"Each man must for himself alone decide what is right and what is wrong, which course is patriotic and which isn't. You cannot shirk this and be a man. To decide against your conviction is to be an unqualified and excusable traitor, both to yourself and to your country, let men label you as they may.\" ~Mark Twain\"This nation will remain the land of the free only so long as it is the home of the brave.\" ~Elmer Davis\"If you are ashamed to stand by your colors, you had better seek another flag.\" ~Author Unknown\"If you don't know your rights you don't have any.\" ~Edgar SteeleThe Georgia Supreme Court unanimously threw out the hate crimes law this past Monday, calling it over-broad and \"unconstitutionally vague.\"Too bad this has not happened in Idaho in regard to the Lonny Rae case or in Canada in regard to the Ernst Zundel case. Or what about the Ray Brent Marsh case? That was really a hate crime, but of course he is not being charged.What? You don't know about these cases?Men like Alex Jones, Henry Makow, Jeff Rense, and Edgar Steele are true patriots and they are fighting to bring us the truth and inform us.Edgar Steele is an attorney who believes in free speech-a right given to us not by the Government, but by our Creator, ie natural rights. He is a brave man who has suffered from terroristic threats and harassement because he will not back down from what is right and true.Now, Steele has written a book that explains what racism really is, and if it is natural, and what is in store for America.I highly recommend this book. I found his writing style very easy to read and understand, and basically, I believe that he speaks and writes the truth. And that is something not heard in the mainstream media, in my opinion, of which I am entitled.",
                    "Five years ago , I would have dismissed a book of this nature out of hand . I would not hear of anything that even remotely had to do with racism . So why am I now writing a review on a book that is almost certain to soon be banned here in Canada and giving it a very favourable rating ?I watched as Ernst Zundle was deported after a secret trial in which prosecution witnesses offered anonymous testimony . The judge's comments clearly insinuated guilt only on the basis of association . He said nothing about the veracity of Mr Zundles claims nor did he implicate him in any violent act . What was being hidden here from public view ?Why does our media constantly harp about Islamic terrorists while completely overlooking a brutal occupation by Israel ? One has only to read Ha'aretz ( an Israeli newspaper ) to see constant examples of reprehensible behaviour by IDF soldiers . We hear nothing of that here and it seems that when someone's dog gets hit by a car , Islamic exteremists are to blame . Our media is constantly trying to involve our nation in the mideast conflict and the scary part is they want us on the side of those who caused the wars in the first place .Those issues made me question things but the event that made me understand there is a serious problem that is not being addressed happened a few weeks ago . My daughter was denied funding for college strictly because her father is WHITE ! The funding officer even stated that to her outright . I have always taught my daughter that people are equal and to never make a decision about someone because of their race . I no longer say that as I am no longer asleep .Mr Steele's book explains some of the contradictions of affirmative action without resorting to hate mongering . This book is very important and raises issues that must be addressed . It is very readable and covers a diversity of topics . His main theseis is that there are more differences among the races than mere colour of skin and these differences do not make any one race better than another .He goes off in tangents at times such as a lucid account of our current money system and it's fraudulent nature . That alone is worth the cost of the book and Mr Steele still effectively ties it into his central argument . He suggests that the inevitable collapse of our economy due to the excess of debt that our money system propagated will lead to conflict between those who produce ( pay taxes ) and those who consume ( gov't entitlements ). There is clearly a racial distinction between the two aforementioned groups . A bleak outlook for America's future and implications for Canada as well .A very worthy read overall dealing with sensitive issues from a realistic perspective rather than simple minded political correctness . Every Canadian who may wonder why we have been invloved in recent wars and why the push for us to get involved in the latest ( war on terror ) will find the answer here . There is an element within our society that is bent on destroying our peaceful values by infecting us with hatred .I found Mr Steele's scenario of North America being divided into areas based on race somewhat implausable . A very minor point when taken in the full context of the book .",
                    "If you've been as bewildered as many people as to why this Nation has gone so far down the tubes in the past forty years or so, this book will open your eyes as to the who, the why, and the where. This book not only makes mincemeat out of the current \"politically correct\" approach to race relations, but also correctly places the finger squarely on those responsible for the attacks on every traditional American institution fromAmerican history to Christmas. Prepare to have the blinders removed when you read this one!",
                    "Steele hits the nail on the head with his description of the real controlling factors in the United States we currently live in. He is unabashed and clear in his explanation of the intolerance that people of northern European descent have to endure as a result of the current political conditions in the United States. His descriptions of the predominantly Jewish contingent that controls American politics, American news media, and American entertainment industry are a real eye-opener. I recommend this book to anyone who is searching for honest appraisals of current reality in America.",
                    "This book is a good read for everyone. It will prompt fear and loathing in the opposition has it exposes the outline for the takeover of the US and the responsible parties (you guess who). It is the inside scoop for long time citizens overwhelmed by the onslaught of foreigners and wondering what happened to the country they used to love, and what is in store for the near future. For the younger generation it is a useful foil to the constant barrage of multicultural hype that they are exposed to everyday and new hope that things will improve. It's your country, hear the real story, not the Fox news party line. Since most of the past authors that exposed the big lie are now blacklisted and/or banned it is refreshing to get some new work from a reliable source that pulls no punches.",
                    "An excellent read, very revealing of the type of information that \"they\" don't want you to know. Facts and figures, with references, that demonstrate that not all in our society is as it seems. We are being lied to by our government for reasons that become obvious as the story unfolds. There is ulterior motive; power and money, greed and hate, that drive the very souls that are charged with leadership and caring for this country, it's people and it's history, to betray to the depths of hell the naive, average Joe Citizen that trusts and believes in it. We are at a precipice, awaiting the nudge that will send us over it's edge. Edgar Steele names those who are intent on providing that nudge that will send this country to it's irreversible decline for their own selfish, vile reasons. This is a book that every American of European ancestry needs to read to learn about the truth that has been kept secret by the real controllers of this country.",
                    "Edgar Steele is a rare breed of attorney. I am case hardened (pretty much literally) and very difficult to fool, maybe even impossible, and as we corresponded and I read his online articles, Steele got past me eventually. For me, Steele is a rare lawyer that passes the \"smell\" test, and my nose is pretty much infallible. Before he wrote Defensive Racism, I strongly suggested to Steele that he write a book, as he has so much sterling information and rare leadership qualities to share with the world at a direly necessary interval of time. Accordingly, I was not disappointed when I received my autographed copy of Defensive Racism, which I read in one sitting. It was just that interesting and timely. I recommend it highly. Anybody that needs a wakeup call needs to read and study it, and those that don't need a wakeup call, well, they need to read it even more.",
                    "The cause of most of mankind's problems is easily identifiable. A minority race claims it has a mandate from God to rule the world and enslave its supposed inferiors as its servants. The problem is, the minority race bears the earmarks of God's nemisis, a nasty little devil named Satan. Ed Steele is one of the rare living writers who has the raw courage to call a spade a spade; i.e., a Jew a Jew. Go, Ed, go!",
                    "I so wanted this book to be great. His website is brilliant and I wanted him to further develop his themes in a more rigorous way. But unfortunately it's just more of the same old stuff. This book is great fun for those already on his wavelength, but it won't convert anyone. Much better is David Dukes' My Awakening, which at least provides notes. The strange thing is that Steele writes in this book that if you want to convert someone to the cause you should behave conservatively and try to persuade rather than rant. Then he goes and blames everything from World Wars 1 and 2, the JFK murder, 9/11 etc etc on the jews. He may be right, but just laying it all out on the table like that with no notes on his sources won't convince anyone.",
                    "The book, \"Defensive Racism\" is a literary educational masterpiece. A hot arrow, a fiery dart, whose target is sure to be squared, bull's-eye and should be read by every free thinking White man, woman and child all across the globe. Indeed destined to be, the cure for blindness.Pastor Morris L Gulettwww.churchofthesonsofyhvh.org",
                    "Very eye opening. Ed Steele brings out points that few are willing to do so. I can see how the white male has been subjected to criticism and has cowered over the years. I can see his point of Western Civilization diminishing in importance and the Asian influence to take over. Well written and not at all offensive. He did not point out things that are not true. But I can see how the Liberal Establishment would attack him for what he said, but cannot refute his ideas. Ed Steele won me over.DP",
                    "Edgar J. STEELE is a lawyer, who specialises in politically incorrect clients (recently he was spokesman for white pride twin girl singing duo PRUSSIAN BLUE). Knowing this and having also occasionally listened to his internet web radio show, his book was mandatory reading for me.Make no mistake, this book is not for the politically correct. Mr. STEELE dares to speak out unpopular facts, which are more often than not suppressed by the controlled media. He challenges the popular conception of racial equality with irrefutable facts, for instance regarding the huge gap in IQ among the various human races. But IQ is not the only difference between the races:\"Blacks have demonstrated markedly lower levels of empathy, personal responsibility, behavioural inhibitions and parental investment in children, among a great many other things.\" (p.77)As the author correctly points out these differences are evolutionary responses to different climates (e.g. harsh winters in the Northern hemisphere helped to advance intellectual capabilities among Caucasians and Northern Asians, while the hot African climate favoured physical strength over intellect) and were inherited over thousands of generations.Also crime rates are scrutinized in the book. Did you know that according to official US government figures* 64% of all violent crimes arrests are of Blacks?* 60% of all Blacks are armed with a weapon at all times?* Black neighbourhoods are 35 times as violent as those of Whites?Or that the overwhelming majority of hate crimes are not white-on-black, but the other way around? Of course this is not reported in the politically correct media, as these facts contradict the popular cliche.Mr. STEELE also details the other ills of White America (and European civilisation in general) like unfettered illegal immigration and its tremendous toll on the population, globalisation (with high level jobs outsourced and physical jobs given to cheaper illegal immigrants), the price of Empire (cf. the enormous human and economic loss during the current Middle Eastern adventures), the effects of hate crime and thought crime legislation (used to silence political dissidents), reconquista (millions of illigal immigrants from Mexico and the demand from Mexican nationalists, that south western US states be seceed to Mexico or a new Hispanic state called Atzlan be constituted), the Federal Reserve Bank system and the overwhelming Jewish influence. I particularly liked how Mr. STEELE exposes Jewish supremacy and the cost of the US support for Israel (circa 2.5 billion dollars since 1973 WITHOUT the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and also not including hundreds of billions caused by the Arab oil embargo in the late 1970ies, which of course was a response to the ongoing US support for Israel - see pages 93 and 94 of DEFENSIVE RACISM).DEFENSIVE RACISM is overall a good book. Although I am Austrian I could relate well to it, because while the situation in the USA may be worse, we face exactly the same problems here in Europe.Unfortunately the book is not without flaws. I do not want to nitpick, but there are a few errors. For instance, while it is absolutely true that Communism was a Jewish invention, contrary to the authors claims (p. 103)the Russian revolutionary leader LENIN was in fact a gentile (and not of Jewish descent). Once the author quotes former US president Theodore ROOSEVELT to support his views (see p. 349), although in effect the quote contradicts Mr. STEELE's position.More importantly, it is necessary to note that many of the arguments of the book are also voiced by other authors and politicians like the great David DUKE (and, it has to be said, better sourced and formulated.)I also do not buy into the author's 9/11 conspiracy theories. Last not least I have issues with the author's views regarding governmental role and welfare (which obviously is not a bad thing in itself), though an in-depth discussion of these issues is beyond the scope of my review.As a final remark it is important to note that the book does not promote violence or supremacy, it just argues for racial separation.",

                    "He doesn't hedge his bets, makes bold perdictions. He wrote most of this book in 2003. He totally saw the realstate market as the bubble it turned out to be. Explains how the international bankers extend credit to anybody, then turn around a pull it away form everybody. They did this to cause depression 1. Their doing it now to cause depression 2. It's errie how right on his predictions are. There happening right before our eyes now. With this in mind his thought on WW3 make the book well worth reading.",

                    "It surprises me just how many people still don't have 'it' figured out. Edgar J. Steele does have 'it' figured out.",
                    "All who are not afraid and truthfully seek what others may be thinking should consider reading this book.",
                    "It should be known that this \"honorable man\" has been has been charged by federal prosecutors for hiring a hit man to kill his wife and mother-in-law. If this is the reality he is espousing, he can keep it. Real men of any color can exit a relationship without murder.[...]",
                    "There is a deep seated need in all people to justify, our conduct with our beliefs. Not too long ago racism was socially acceptable. Edgar J Steele is attempting to take us back to that time. \"Defensive Racism\"'s content is not new nor particularly original. It is simply a rehash of what was called eugenics in the early XXth century. Back then a pseudo-science was built to justify the hatred of, not only Blacks, but Italians, Eastern Europeans, Hispanics and Asians. Even the Irish were considered culturally inferior because of their mostly Catholic heritage.Steele selectively takes what are perhaps accurate numbers, for instance the high incidence of Black against Black violence, and uses them to establish a false 'cause and effect' relationship, a Non-Sequitur. The fact that he has an engaging and persuasive writing style is an issue related to form not substance. A lie is lie no matter how beautifully it is stated.If one wants to see the terrible consequences of this ideological venon one can read \"War Against the Weak\" by Edwin Black. If one wants to see what genetic science has to say about racism check out \"Journey of Man\" by Dr. Spencer Wells (DVD format). Another excellent book, perhaps one of the best, on the subject of DNA science and human diversity is \"The Great Human Diasporas\" by Dr. Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza.One knows that an ideology is lacking serious scientific support when it gets its science from lawyers instead of scientists. That is the unfortunate case of \"Defensive Racism\". If the information that Steele presents is removed from its historical, political and social context it can be easily manipulated to say whatever one wants it to say. This is what this book does. This is the tribal mentality that is tearing humanity apart.",
                    "I enjoy reading wiewpoints that vary in scope since all stories have two sides. This author's pretext leads us into his ideology with surreptitious restraint. But, the anti-Jew, brown, and black sentiment is pouring out by the second chapter. Steele writes well and his ability to put together thoughts and list supportive data offers compelling credence to his white separatist resolve...especially if you're a white man.The book is an enlarged pamphlet, a trojan horse designed to broaden the whole \"White\" defense idea and get it out on the coffee table.Personally,I find it too much to digest without chocking on some of the strong anti-everyone else sentiment that takes over by the second chapter. I like middle-ground. I'm an optimist and not a fatalist. I dislike having extremists sneak up on me whether they be pro-white, anti-white, pro-God or anti-God, pro-meat, or vegan. I felt that way after turning a few pages of this book which turned me off to it.Since I paid for the book, I guess I'm entitled to an opinion.",
                    "Steele writes well. His political analysis is fairly shallow, though, and the chapter that decribes in detail a near-future USA balkanizing along racial lines is hilarious - sort of survivalism for rightwing history geeks who've grown out of dressing up for civil-war re-enactments. If you want cogent analysis of racialist thinking, read the bell curve (which is just bad science rather than comically awful attempts at social analysis by someone with no training in the field...). If you want a summary of how the poorly-educated racists would sum up their views if they were as well-spoken as a California trial lawyer, this is the book.",
                    "Author minces his words and equivocates as one would expect of an attorney. Good description of multiple seemingly complex problems. Deals with secondary aspects of problems, but failing to understand the underlying unseen material cause [physical contamination] of the low level of perception and concomitant behavioral patterns which has led to the present situation, no solution which eliminates root of all problems simultaneously is offered. Author fails to understand that spiritual degeneration is rooted in physical degeneration. What is needed is Spiritual Regeneration which is only accomplished through Physical Regeneration which is accomplished by purification, i.e. Fasting. The Bible clearly shows that nations under judgement, as is our country, are spared, at least for a time, when the nation as a whole turns to fasting.",

                "description": "The Constitution of the United States, writes Bryan Fair, was a series of compromises between white male property holders: Southern planters and Northern merchants. At the heart of their deals was a clear race-conscious intent to place the interests of whites above those of blacks. In this provocative and important book, Fair, the eighth of ten children born to a single mother on public assistance in an Ohio ghetto, combines two histories\u2014America's and his own\u2014to offer a compelling defense of affirmative action. How can it be, Fair asks, that, after hundreds of years of racial apartheid during which whites were granted 100% quotas to almost all professions, we have now convinced ourselves that, after a few decades of remedial affirmative action, the playing field is now level? Centuries of racial caste, he argues, cannot be swept aside in a few short years. Fair ambitiously surveys the most common arguments for and against affirmative action. He argues that we must distinguish between America in the pre-Civil Rights Movement era\u2014when the law of the land was explicitly anti-black\u2014and today's affirmative action policies, which are decidedly not anti- white. He concludes that the only just and effective way in which to account for America's racial past and to negotiate current racial quagmires is to embrace a remedial affirmative action that relies neither on quotas nor fiery rhetoric, but one which takes race into account alongside other pertinent factors. Championing the model of diversity on which the United States was purportedly founded, Fair serves up a personal and persuasive account of why race-conscious policies are the most effective way to end de facto segregation and eliminate racial caste.",

Based at the University of Alabama and familiar with the administrative practicalities of implmenting affirmative action programs, Fair gives a wake-up call to all those white males who seem to think that affirmative action's time is past and it's finished it's work.Fair points out that we'd be creating a minority underclass without AA, and how this would increase tension and make society worse for everyone, minority or not. Most tellingly, Fair inserts his own personal experience as a child in a family with 10 kids. With no AA, people like him wouldve been left behind. An important read."

Through microagressions, stereotype threat, underfunding and defunding of initiatives/offices, expansive commitments to diversity related strategic plans with restrictive power and action, and departmental climates of exclusivity and inequity; diversity workers (faculty, staff, and administration of color along with white allies in like positions) find themselves in a badlands where identity difference is used to promote institutional values while at the same time creating unimaginable work spaces for these workers.",

Nowhere is the convergence of race and culture felt more acutely than in our public schools. Face to Face, therefore, is critical reading for anybody -- teacher, administrator, parent -- who recognizes the role, potential, and responsibility of our schools in fostering racial reconciliation. I highly recommend this book!",

Waller tells us to face the truth about ourselves and open our eyes in order to diminish the impact of racism in future generations. It took guts to write this book.",

His unique way of presenting the information enables the reader to help understand one's own biases which is the first step in recognizing racism. He focuses on discrimination from an introspective point of view. The author interviewed eight different people from various backgrounds. One of which is Brian Swann, who experienced racism with his renowned brother pro football hall of fame and Gubernatorial candidate Lynn Swann. The Swann brothers filed a civil lawsuit against the San Francisco Police Department for discrimination and won their case. I believe the average reader will find his work insightful and captivating. I would highly recommend this book to anyone whether or not they have experienced racism in their lives.",

I know I'm doing some reading between the lines, but I believe it's because the author himself has spent a good amount of time reflecting on his own predjudices and experiences, and I commend him for doing so. I hope those who read his book will be inspired to do the same."

It's argument for, on the one hand, a rethinking of \"race\" as a fixed category of socio-cultural identity while also interrogating the continuing existence of racism is hardly new in the early 21st century. Yet, this book may well be the best current humanistic monological presentation of these ideas. In this regard, it provides a welcome antidote to reactionary \"end of race\" or \"end or racism\" debates that have arisen among both black progressives and conservatives alike. Well done.",
                    "Darder and Torres's book makes a simple yet powerful claim: \"race\" is an ideological construct that progressives must dismantle and debunk if they are to understand and to combat the racism that continues to damage society. The book thoughtfully explores the colonialist and pseudo-scientific genesis of the ideology of \"race\" and argues that, while the term \"race\" has no actual referent, the term \"racism\" most certainly does: processes of racialization continue to reproduce oppressive structures in the United States, even as the major institutions of that society claim to embrace diversity and multiculturalism. In an accessible yet highly sophisticated way, the book delineates both contemporary political impasses and ways forward for progressive thought and action.",
                    "This book clearly calls for a serious engagement of racism, within the context of the deep economic impoverishment still experienced by working class communities of color in the United States. The issue here is not that \"race\" does not matter, but rather that it is not the color of one's skin that should be the central or sole focus of our struggle! Rather, the actual problem is the disgraceful manner in which racism and other inequalities are perpetuated within an unruly political economy. Racism here refers to the inherent structures and systematic relationships of power within institutions and society, predicated across a variety of differences, including \"race\", to disempower and undermine communities of color. The truth is that this is a book that must be carefully read, particularly those chapters that contend with linguistic genocide, the destructive impact of neoliberal testing policies on student's lives, or the deep historical ideologies that created the current social conditions---conditions where the intellectual abilities and capacities of entire populations are collectively signified within schools and institutions by the color of our skin.The manner in which the media spun racialized rhetoric within President-elect Obama's campaign, well-illustrates that racism is still alive and well in the U.S. Not to mention that, in no way, does Barack Obama's presidency mean that the quality of life has fundamentally improved for the majority of people of color who live in the lower economic rungs of U.S. capitalist society and all those whose economic well-being has plummeted in the last decade. Lastly, the authors' long histories as serious, engaged scholars and activists belie any reading of this text as \"neo-conservative propaganda\" or \"neoliberal (talking heads) scholarship,\" given that the book is a formidable critique of precisely those political traditions and how their disabling policies of inequality manifest themselves within racialized educational institutions. Moreover, the central message of the text is this: We cannot fight racism, outside of a serious and sustained critique of capitalism and its gross inequalities. And as such, racism must be understood beyond simply race relations or notions of psychological dislikes or fears of skin color, but rather as sustained social and political oppression, intimately linked to the control of material conditions within this society and around the world.",
                    "Basically this is neo-conservative propaganda disguised as neo-liberal scholarship, in my opinion it is not helpful if you want to develop a full understanding of the role important race still plays in America...it basically dismisses that it matters anymore, an argument that unqualified talking heads are fond of but that pretty much every other credible academic that has any expertise in the issue has dismissed."

                    "Because our society publicly proclaims that all people have fair opportunity, and insists that the days of slavery and segregation are behind us, the thesis presented in Carol A. Horton's masterpiece is going to raise a couple of eyebrows.The more rabid critics of this book are going to accuse her of living in the past. During the 1960's, new left activists from the Black Power movement formulated a civil rights analysis concluding the entire American system would have to be reformed, even with non-discrimination laws on the books, socioeconomic structure would effectively keep many people oppressed and equality an empty gesture.Yet, to effectively have a non-racist future we must understand and the actually undo the past. That critique assumes new significance today when the gap between America's haves and have-nots is reaching unprecedented proportions. It is more relevant than ever.An independent scholar and Research Associate at Erikson Institute, Chicago, Illinois, Horton postulates that race has more socioeconomic dimensions than we previously had admitted. Some African Americans (realizing their own stake) are going to actually support the maintenance of the status quo.Such wide experience discrepancy explains how we get people like JC Watts, Condoleezza Rice, Barack Obama, and Jesse Jackson. They are all black, but each has a different opinion on how well the `American way' is working for everybody.Horton gives civil rights movements their due credit for having implemented a more consistent practice of democracy than prior models, but questions if the current system is still the best that we can do. Our society presently uses those progress markers as justification that we now do not have to critique anything any more, and thus are stunting ourselves from realizing a truly equitable outcome for all members.She also calls for a more elastic conceptualization of racial and class identity. Traditional categories are woefully inadequate for describing the contradictions of a 'democracy' where wealth and political power is concentrated in the hands of an elite few."

Lothrop Stoddard predicted in 1920 that the West would be overrun by the rising tide of color if we lost our will and the sense of identity that all other races take for granted. Of course, he was correct.Future historians may wonder why we did not heed his warning. The question, as he seems to see it, is not whether there will be &quot;racism&quot; or equality. The question is whose race will prevail in the struggle for power.Though it is usually dismissed as &quot;racist&quot; the book is actually a broad combination of foriegn affairs, world history and racial realities. While it is not very flattering to blacks, Stoddard actually urges whites to stop thinking of Asians as &quot;inferior.&quot;In fact, he was one of the first to realize that Asians could understand Western science and technology and use it to their own advantage.",

Changing dermagraphics mated with Pavlonian &quot;PC&quot; conditioning will allow them to ban this book soon. My advice is to get this book and read it while you still can.",
                    "Lothrop Stoddard's _The Rising Tide of Color Against White-World Supremacy_ is a notorious &quot;racist&quot; book published in 1920 in the aftermath of the inter-European slaughter of WWI. This is about as stereotypical, and non-PC as can be imagined, making it a amusing and rebellious to a reader not totally indoctrinated by the multicultural-inclined Establishment. Stoddard outlines the different races of the world and focuses on the position of the White, especially the &quot;Nordic&quot; race and its dominant position in world politics. After the fall of the Roman Empire, whites, centered in Europe, have been on the defensive against outside invasions of Asiatics and Moslems until the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. European and expansion brought most of the &quot;colored&quot; world under the control of white nations in Europe, America was established as a colony of Britain in North America, and Russia extended its empire all the way across Asia crossing over to Alaska. Some non-white countries, such as China, Japan and Persia maintained a form of independence but their trade policies came to be dominated by European nations. Against this white hegemony arose during the later 19th century nationalist movements against European imperialism. Stoddard divides the world into five general categories, based on races (White, Yellow, Brown, Black and Red (in Latin America). The book's biggest shortcoming is that it is based on an evolutionary theory of human origins and it views the entire field of human conflict on racial terms alone. It is true that racial differences do exist and &quot;good fences make good neighbors&quot; but there are other factors at play in the world's affairs rather than race by itself. Also, since this was written in the twenties it is very dated regarding some of its predictions. However, it is clear that the breakdown of racial barriers and the slow but steady cultural-ethnic assault on former Christendom is one of the many factors to cause chaos in the world.",
                    "Although Dr. Stoddard's text is a perfect thing of its kind, no one should come to it seeking factual history or enlightenment. His thinking reflects the misinformation and ethnocentrism of his time as well as the fears and neurosis which plagued Western Civilization after the First World War. The sweeping statements he confects about the Black &quot;race&quot; are preposterous and totally inaccurate in every respect. His adherence to the very concept of &quot;race&quot; is as incredible as it is absurd.

                "description": "Few individuals have had as great an impact on the law--both its practice and its history--as A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr. A winner of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, he has distinguished himself over the decades both as a professor at Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard, and as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals. But Judge Higginbotham is perhaps best known as an authority on racism in America: not the least important achievement of his long career has been In the Matter of Color, the first volume in a monumental history of race and the American legal process. Published in 1978, this brilliant book has been hailed as the definitive account of racism, slavery, and the law in colonial America. Now, after twenty years, comes the long-awaited sequel. In Shades of Freedom, Higginbotham provides a magisterial account of the interaction between the law and racial oppression in America from colonial times to the present, demonstrating how the one agent that should have guaranteed equal treatment before the law--the judicial system--instead played a dominant role in enforcing the inferior position of blacks. The issue of racial inferiority is central to this volume, as Higginbotham documents how early white perceptions of black inferiority slowly became codified into law. Perhaps the most powerful and insightful writing centers on a pair of famous Supreme Court cases, which Higginbotham uses to portray race relations at two vital moments in our history. The Dred Scott decision of 1857 declared that a slave who had escaped to free territory must be returned to his slave owner. Chief Justice Roger Taney, in his notorious opinion for the majority, stated that blacks were \"so inferior that they had no right which the white man was bound to respect.\" For Higginbotham, Taney's decision reflects the extreme state that race relations had reached just before the Civil War. And after the War and Reconstruction, Higginbotham reveals, the Courts showed a pervasive reluctance (if not hostility) toward the goal of full and equal justice for African Americans, and this was particularly true of the Supreme Court. And in the Plessy v. Ferguson decision, which Higginbotham terms \"one of the most catastrophic racial decisions ever rendered,\" the Court held that full equality--in schooling or housing, for instance--was unnecessary as long as there were \"separate but equal\" facilities. Higginbotham also documents the eloquent voices that opposed the openly racist workings of the judicial system, from Reconstruction Congressman John R. Lynch to Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan to W. E. B. Du Bois, and he shows that, ironically, it was the conservative Supreme Court of the 1930s that began the attack on school segregation, and overturned the convictions of African Americans in the famous Scottsboro case. But today racial bias still dominates the nation, Higginbotham concludes, as he shows how in six recent court cases the public perception of black inferiority continues to persist. In Shades of Freedom, a noted scholar and celebrated jurist offers a work of magnificent scope, insight, and passion. Ranging from the earliest colonial times to the present, it is a superb work of history--and a mirror to the American soul.",

The Black O is a fascinating, behind-the-scenes story populated with many unforgettable characters, including civil rights lawyer Tommy Warren, the former college football star and convicted felon who took the case; Ray Danner, the ironfisted former CEO who developed the Shoney\u2019s concept; and Justice Clarence Thomas, former head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which sat idly by for years while complaints mounted against Shoney\u2019s. The Black O speaks to an issue that continues to have great urgency, serving as a stark refutation that the civil rights movement eliminated systemic discrimination from the workplace.",

I was left with a better understanding of the role black officers play as a bridge between predominantly white law enforcement agencies and black communities, building trust by earning it. While the authors do not sugar-coat the difficulties involved in being a person of colour and a police officer, they highlight the fact that these police officers do not regret walking such a difficult path. Reading this book provides an insiders view of racism in contemporary police work, and that makes it a rare breed. I would strongly recommend it to anyone."

                    "A fasinating look at race and color.Well writing and obviously lived by Eugene Robinson. As a White 57 year old male I found his account of black life in Brazil to be educational and interesting. Its a shame that there has to be divisions between the races. I could only wish to live to see a colorless society. What then would they all fight over?",
                    "African-American Washington Post reporter/editor Robinsonrecounts how he was posted to Brazil. He initially likes how there isno sharp color line based, as in the U.S. where &quot;one drop&quot; of African blood makes you &quot;black.&quot; However, he eventually notices that it doesn't seem to make much difference in terms of who succeeds in the country. The people at the very top are all white and at the very bottom (leaving aside the Indians) are all black, and for all those in between, where you end up in life seems to correlate fairly closely with skin color. The most notable exceptions, as in the U.S., are star black athletes and entertainers. One might think that the fact that two separate social systems generate the same racial pattern of accomplishments might spark Robinson's curiosity, but that topic is left untouched. It's a pity he was never assigned to any black-ruled African countries. That might have opened his eyes.He becomes convinced that black Brazilians are being held back by their lack of racial consciousness. If they organized themselves as a racial pressure group, like African-Americans have, they could demand racial quotas (of the kind which presumably have benefited the author's career at the Washington Post).Unfortunately, besides the usual problems caused by affirmative action, there's a specific reason why it wouldn't work well in Brazil: because the races aren't so easily distinguished there, it wouldn't be clear who &quot;deserves&quot; to benefit from quotas. Due to the one drop rule and social pressures against miscegenation (including lynching), there really aren't that many people in the U.S. who are mostly white but a little black. (Most of the ones you can name are actresses or models like Jennifer Beals, because long hair and other white features tend to be more in demand on women than on men.) Down through the generations in the U.S., people with any African blood have been socially discouraged from marrying whites. This has tended to mean that a mulattos' descendents seldom get whiter and normally get darker. As the line against miscegnation deteriorated in the last three decades, the number of young mostly-white American people has started to grow, but it's still small. Thus, in America you find two easily distinguishable groups: whites (who very rarely have any African blood) and &quot;blacks&quot; (who normally have white blood, but seldom much more than 50%). Thus, here it's not hard for bureaucrats to decide whether somebody qualifies for affirmative action or not.In contrast, in Brazil, you have a whole bunch of people who are at least mostly white but may or may not have some black blood. Do they qualify for affirmative action? Ultimately, millions of individual decisions about who gets the special privileges would have to be made by bureaucrats. If I know anything about Brazil, bribery would be rampant. Thus, a great amount of the quotas will end up being filled by wealthier near-whites, at the expense of impoverished blacks.",
                    "In response to the first reviewer. Why does he assume that Eugene Robinson got his job by Affirmative Action? How can he assume that White people have no Black Blood in them? Look at the descendants of Thomas Jefferson. He seems to be bitter about Affirmative Action programs.If we did away with people like him there would be no need for Affirmative Action programs.No one would assume people of color to be incompetent.The majority of his review is about quotas. Not about the book. I hope he gets some counseling. I think he needs a hug.",
                    "In spite of my better judgement, I really like this book. As a quietly emotional, introspective and beautifully written report of one Black American man's reactions to Brazilian notions of race, it has no equal.Why do I give it only two stars then? It upsets me that people across the U.S. will use this as some sort of &quot;text book&quot; to decipher Brazilian race relations. It is not. In fact, for an intelligent, sensitive journalist, Robinson shows a shocking lack of knowledge of Brazilian history and culture, especially as viewed through Brazilian eyes. This fatally undermines his analysis of race relations in Brazil.To hear Robinson tell it, Brazil is in some kind of racial purgatory. Brazil's concepts of race never change. Or rather, its /lack/ of concept of race never changes. Brazilians, as we are told again and again throughout &quot;From Coal to Cream&quot; simply don't believe in the idea of race: they only see colors relative one to another. This theory of race in Brazil has a long and hallowed history in American academia. Unfortunately, Brazilian social scientists have pretty well demonstrated it to be full of enormous holes. There has been quite a long and well-documented tradition of seeing things in &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; in Brazil - a tradition which the Brazilian public ideologies of race would prefer to ignore. That this tradition remains alive and well in our quotidian world, however, is a fact that's brought back to me everytime I see some light-brown skinned kid wearing a &quot;100% Negro&quot; t-shirt here in Rio de Janeiro.Ironically, the years that Robinson spent as a journalist in Brazil saw some of the greatest historic changes in afro-descended Brazilians' perceptions of themselves and their nation. These changes were perhaps best (but not exclusively) symbolized by the 1988 Constitutional Resolution to give land to Brazil's surviving quilombo residents - a law which was only won through large-scale mobilization of Black Brazilian grass-roots groups. None of this exciting ferment and activity is touched upon by Robinson, whom, I suspect, is unable to read a daily newspaper in Portuguese. From what I've gathered in the book, he didn't know anything of this sort was occuring among Black Brazilians. If he did, he certainly didn't follow it up, prefering to maintain the old, thread-bare dichotomy of a Brazil which ignores race and doesn't progress opposed to a progressive, race conscious United States.Robinson would probably be quite suprised that, as regards his conslusions on race in Brazil, he is travelling the same path that many hard-core racists once tread. The French philosopher and scientific racist Gubineau (SP, sorry...) also believed that as a mixed race nation, Brazil was a contradiction in terms which could never, ever progress. The real question, of course, is why Robinson finds it necessary to do this and how does he have the power to be more widely heard on this subject than any one of hundreds of Brazilian journalists and scholars (of all colors) who are infinitely more well-informed than he is.Robinson needs to look into the mirror and realize that even though he's Black, he's also a U.S. citizen and thus inherits a certain degree of imperial power along with that status. Perhaps then he'd be capable of writing about Brazilian racism with a new degree of sensitivity - not only to his personal feelings, but to Brazil as well. What is scary to me is that &quot;From Coal to Cream&quot; is so convincingly written that even many Brazilians, ignorant of their own history, will buy into its precepts.When a journalist who barely speaks the language of a country attempts to tackle one of its deepest, most perenial problems based upon a few superficial travels, we should take his conclusions with a large grain of salt. Though it attempts to address Brazilian racism, &quot;From Coal to Cream&quot; is yet another in a long series of fantastic projections of Anglo-American fears and desires upon Brazil. Nevertheless, one should buy this book if one is interested in how Americans perceive and react to Brazil. /That/ is it's true value, and in this sense, Robinson has crafted a masterpiece.",
                    "I read the book immediately after hearing Robinson on NPR's &quot;Diane Rehm&quot; show and found it one of the most quietly intelligent books I have read on the subject of race and color. Having been to Brazil recently (and speaking some Portuguese), I was eager to see how he analyzed the socio-racial scene there. This book is not a sociological tract--it is a highly personal book, the story of the author's own odyssey through his personal history and the various societies in which he has lived. By thinking about Brazil, he really does see issues of American society and history in a much clearer light--and helps us see them too. There are a string of revelations here. I would want to argue with him about some of his conclusions, but I thought Robinson came through as a man of great integrity who has put a lot of himself on the line here. I recommend the book highly.",
                    "Having returned from my first trip to Brazil recently, I was angry when I saw Mr. Robinson on C-Span discussing this book, angry that he had stolen my idea! This work offers a great introduction for someone who has never been to Brazil, but I was extremely shocked at how skin-deep Mr. Robinson's assessments were. He, over and over again, refers to the &quot;black&quot; people that he encountered in Brazil without ever offering a deeper investigation of what it means to be &quot;black.&quot; His perceptions are entirely influenced by his own culture and he seems unable, or at least unwilling, to step away from his own experiences momentarily in order to objectively experience Brazil. The simple fact is that in Brazil, as in the USA, and England, and many other places around the world, light-skinned people receive a disproportionate amount of privilege regardless of what race they claim to belong to. I was really surprised that a seasoned journalist didn't go a bit deeper with his analysis. At best, this book will spark a national conversation amongst people of all races in America, a conversation that we have before but desperately need to revisit. AND SHAME ON THE FREE PRESS FOR ALLOWING SO MANY ERRORS INTO THE FINAL PRINT!",
                    "As a white man, I'm sure I'll never really understand what it's like to be black in America. It's simply not possible. But Gene Robinson does his level best to give me a glimpse into that dilemma. The truth is, I think I was hoping for more of an in-depth memoir from Robinson, a man I grew to like and admire during the just completed presidential primaries and elections when I would see him often on Hardball or other cable news programs, offering his opinions. Robinson seems to me to be a man who has a pretty good sense of self, and also possesses a healthy sense of humor in the way he looks at life. I like that in a man. Some of that came out in COAL TO CREAM, but not enough, probably because it is, of course, about such a deadly serious topic: race and color barriers. Robinson's tales of his job assignments in South America (particularly Rio, in Brazil) and London are eye-opening, and he makes his case well about the continuing skin-color spectrum and how it operates in those countries. His initial enchantment and final disillusionment with how color is handled in Brazil is very reasoned and well thought out. But I'm most interested in personal stories, so I kept wishing throughout the book that there were more about his boyhood in South Carolina, his college years in Ann Arbor, and how he met and fell in love with Avis, his wife. Because they sound like such warm and interesting people. But maybe he'll get around to all that some other time, or at least I hope so, because he's a very good writer. - Tim Bazzett, author of Pinhead: A Love Story",
                    "Robinson uses his own personal sojourn through South America as a framework to discuss broader issues of race relations and racial identity. When Robinson first visits Brazil, he views it as a utopia for black individuals, a place where unlike America race was not an immutable construct but rather a broad spectrum of possibilities which ebbed and flowed: \"[t]he emphasis on the more mutable issue of color (rather than the rigidity of race) was at the heart of what I loved so much about Brazail--the absence of racial conflict, the ease of coexistence.\"At first, Robinson's exulation of Brazil as a paradigm for issues of race appears naive and simplistic. However, as Robinson's journey continues, he realizes that Brazil also suffers from its own insidious forms of prejudice and problems of racial conflict though manifested differently, exist there as well. Robinson's meditations on race are interesting and emerge from a well written and engaging story.",
                    "i would recommend this book to any reader that wants a good perspective on how race and class abound our world. As a 18 year old Afro-American female,I too like Robinson, initially believed the myths of a Brazilian racial democracy, but later on I sadly realized the truth. Racism is just as explosive in Brazil as the US but only it is done in a more subtle and hidden fashion.Compare neiborhoods like Ipanema and the favelas(ghettos) of Rochina and Mangueira and see what colors are most dominate. And also see the racist killings of street children (80% killed are Black), and why the most dominate workforce for Blacks is domestic service(i.e. maids and butlers) The affirmation that Robinson made of saying that he was told he didn't have to be Black shows how in Brazil race is not soley based on heritage, but social status and education.Euguene Robinson digs into the reasons why the Black Brazilian Movement is finally starting in Brazil. Trying to find a voice in a racist society and have the series of &quot;race&quot; categorizations to seperate Blacks be removed so that Blacks can identify and work against racism in a country where they are dominate (UNESCO reports Blacks are 70% population) but used to be counted only as 6% in 1973 and then 44% in 1992 by the government, these figures do not show a boost in Black births, but a boost in Black identity and pride.Many will argue how Brazil can have Affirmative Action, but with a predomite population and predominte population of poor Afro-Brazilians, it is needed in Government and TV. I disagre with reviewers that claim that Black race identity leads to race &quot;wars&quot;, it unifyies us, the only reason why people do not think racial conflict happens in Brazil is because most Blacks haven't been saying anything(ending that is Senetor Benedita da Silva).Even though I think that this book could have dug deeper in the realities and myths of race in Brazil, I belive this is a honest and well written work",
                    "Dispose of the initial David Duke review. This book captures the essence of the approach/avoidance dilemma that a black man encounters in the racial minefield in the US. Well written and personal, Robinson bifurcates and reconstructs the schizoid realm of racial politics. Ties to the plight of Indians in SA connect with the economic undertones of oppression. Robinson strikes at the heart of irrelevance of race, while simultaneously demonstrating its brutal impact. The racial gap in the US is still broad on both sides. This book is must reading for any non-African descendent who seeks to bridge the racial gap, and for any African descendent who wants to continue the racial dialogue. Soul on Ice it aint, but the 90s aint the 60s.",
                    "Having read the book, I remain startled by its lack of intellectualism and rather naive viewpoint. I would, however, recommend it for perusal. As far as commenting on my fellow reviewers' comments, I can only shake my head in consternation. There were African slaves in England during the time of Shakespeare who, consequentially, had mixed children and gradually disappeared into Britain's greater society. In the United States, white-featured children of racially mixed &quot;Black&quot; families have &quot;passed&quot; as Caucasians and married into White families for many generations. In my own family of Creole descended French speakers, the usage of &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;White&quot; is a subjective term. My family is only one of many families who have more than 50 percent White heritage but who are aware of their &quot;Black&quot; heritage as well. I strongly suspect there are many &quot;White&quot; families who remain unaware. The only difference between Brazil and The United States is our foolish inability to accept miscegenation as a historical fact and the nonexistence of racial purity among any given population in this country. (Having been to Brazil, I can vouch that the so-called &quot;White&quot; upper echelon would be considered light-skinned &quot;Blacks&quot; in the United States.) For that reason, Coal to Cream is a timely commentary on the insanity of the &quot;one drop rule&quot; though I wish this particular book had not been such a disappointment.",
                    "Eugene Robinson's book is an admirable work of reportage by a talented journalist. So much writing on race is tendentious - informed either by prejudice, anger or political correctness. Robinson's work is superior because he is honest about what he doesn't know and understand, and because his narrative is driven by genuine curiosity. Bravo to Robinson for offering a truly original contribution.",
                    "I enjoyed this book because it is a thought provoking book. Too often the topic of race is avoided. The truth is that race may be the topic of the next decade in the US. The country is starting to have a substantially higher percent of population of non-whites. The largest California is already mostly non-whites. The author compares and reflects on his upbringing in the US with his experiences in Brazil thru the eyes of a dark Black man. I agree with the author that Brazilians do indeed think about race and are certainly not color blind. In my travels to Brazil I noticed from looks that some people certainly acknowleged the fact that I was Black by giving me a certain look or holding their look a little longer. However the lack of malice was apparent among my Brazilian contacts. In the US sometimes I have created static by simply showing up as a Black man at an all white affair or business meeting. The average Brazilian is actually quite a laid-back person. The American in comparison tends to be aggressive and highly opinionated. I hope to one day spend some time living in Brazil. I think that the author also overestimates the number of Blacks (by US standards) in Brazil. I have the number at around 50%. I actually prefer the terms AfroBrazilian and AfroAmerican. The author actually made it a point to study race. In Brazil race is certainly not one of the top conversational topics. Although this book is only around 4 years old, plenty has change in Brazil. Global changes have had an impact on Brazil and the people have adapted. Foreign films and TV shows have had an impact on Brazilian culture. Inventions such as cell phones and the internet have had a profound effect of reducing Brazils isolation. I can't wait to go back next year!"

In this winner of the Lannan Cultural Freedom Prize for an Especially Notable Book, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor \u201cnot only exposes the canard of color-blindness but reveals how structural racism and class oppression are joined at the hip\u201d (Robin D. G. Kelley, author of Freedom Dreams). The eruption of mass protests in the wake of the police murders of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City have challenged the impunity with which officers of the law carry out violence against black people and punctured the illusion of a post-racial America. The Black Lives Matter movement has awakened a new generation of activists. In this stirring and insightful analysis, activist and scholar Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor surveys the historical and contemporary ravages of racism and the persistence of structural inequality, such as mass incarceration and black unemployment. In this context, she argues that this new struggle against police violence holds the potential to reignite a broader push for black liberation. \u201cThis brilliant book is the best analysis we have of the #BlackLivesMatter moment of the long struggle for freedom in America. Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor has emerged as the most sophisticated and courageous radical intellectual of her generation.\u201d \u2014Dr. Cornel West, author of Race Matters \u201cA must read for everyone who is serious about the ongoing praxis of freedom.\u201d \u2014Barbara Ransby, author of Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement \u201c[A] penetrating, vital analysis of race and class at this critical moment in America\u2019s racial history.\u201d \u2014Gary Younge, author of The Speech: The Story Behind Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Dream",

Edna Pontellier wakes up from a life in a dream and fights for self and independence- a struggle that anyone, especially adolescents, can identify with. I can't emphasize enough how beautiful and moving Chopin's prose is. Reading it was pure pleasure, and when self-realization and introspective thought comes along with that, you know the book is a winner."

                "description": "White Americans, abetted by neo-conservative writers of all hues, generally believe that racial discrimination is a thing of the past and that any racial inequalities that undeniably persist\u2014in wages, family income, access to housing or health care\u2014can be attributed to African Americans' cultural and individual failures. If the experience of most black Americans says otherwise, an explanation has been sorely lacking\u2014or obscured by the passions the issue provokes. At long last offering a cool, clear, and informed perspective on the subject, this book brings together a team of highly respected sociologists, political scientists, economists, criminologists, and legal scholars to scrutinize the logic and evidence behind the widely held belief in a color-blind society\u2014and to provide an alternative explanation for continued racial inequality in the United States. While not denying the economic advances of black Americans since the 1960s, Whitewashing Race draws on new and compelling research to demonstrate the persistence of racism and the effects of organized racial advantage across many institutions in American society\u2014including the labor market, the welfare state, the criminal justice system, and schools and universities. Looking beyond the stalled debate over current antidiscrimination policies, the authors also put forth a fresh vision for achieving genuine racial equality of opportunity in a post-affirmative action world.",

                "description": "That discrimination exists in courts of law is beyond dispute. In American murder cases, for instance, studies show that blacks who kill a white are much more likely to receive the death penalty than if they kill a black. Indeed, in Georgia, they are 30 times more likely to be condemned, and in Texas a staggering 90 times more likely. Conversely, in Texas, of 143 whites convicted of killing a black, only one was sentenced to die. But how extensive is discrimination in the courtroom? Is it strictly a matter of racial prejudice, or does it respond to a wide range of social factors? In Sociological Justice, eminent legal sociologist Donald Black challenges the conventional notion that law is primarily an affair of rules and that discrimination is an aberration. Law, he contends, is a social process in which bias is inherent. Indeed, Black goes well beyond the documented instances of racial discrimination to show how social status (regardless of race), the degree of intimacy (are they family members, friends, or complete strangers?), speech, organization, and numerous other factors all greatly influence whether a complaint will be filed in court, who will win, and what the punishment or other remedy will be. Moreover, he extends his analysis to include not only the litigants, but also the lawyers, the jurors, and the judge, describing how their social characteristics can also influence a case. Sociological Justice introduces a new field of legal scholarship that will have important consequences for the future of law: the sociology of the case. Black discusses how lawyers can use the sociology of the case to improve their practice and, for those interested in reform, he suggests ways to minimize bias in the courtroom. Beyond this, Black demonstrates that modern jurisprudence, with its assumption that like cases will be treated in like fashion, is out of touch with reality. He urges the adoption of a new sociological jurisprudence, with a new morality of law, that explicitly addresses the social relativity of justice. A major contribution to legal scholarship, this thought-provoking volume is essential reading for anyone interested in law and justice in modern society.",

                    "While most educators and textbooks in the US would have us believe the polarization of oppression and race along lines of skin pigmentation is the natural, inherent, and historical condition of ethnic interaction, Dooley's book suggests otherwhise. _Black and Green_ looks at the common link forged by oppression and the struggle for liberation between white Irish and black Americans since the 1800s.Dooley examines the political, social, and ideological connections between the civil rights struggle in Ireland and America. His analysis results in a picture of reciprocal interchange with both sides influencing, shaping, and supporting the other. The end result is that this &quot;other&quot; demarcated through pigmentation was hardly an &quot;other&quot; during the historical moment. Angela Davis and Bernadette McAliskey support each other while in prison. When McAliskey later receives the keys to the city of New York for her work in Ireland, she gives them to the Black Panther Party. Frederick Douglas and O'Connell heavily influence each other's political thought and speak out in support of each other's cause. Marcus Garvey claims the color scheme of his movement reflects the struggle of various liberation moments of different races all over the world, including the Irish (Red for the reds of the world, green for the Irish struggle, and black for the African American, or, as he puts it at the time, the &quot;Negro struggle.&quot; )Dooley's writing is lucid, engaging, and often narrative. As his innovative and perhaps contentious claims demand, Dooley's research is heavily documumented, often cites primary sources, and features hundreds of foot notes at the book's end. Educators and researchers may use this book with the confidence that they can ascertain with some degree of certainty the primary sources from which Dooley's arguments arise. Further, Dooley's writing is eminently accessible and multi-layered. I have used sections of chapters in my middle school classroom in the Bronx and cited Dooley extensively in papers for graduate school. _Black and Green_ is an invaluable resource for race studies, American or Irish history, and civil rights seminars.",
                    "The key to understanding who the oppressed are and who the oppressors are is determined by looking at who the domestic workers are and for whom they work. Who is it that picks up after whom? Bernadette Devlin McAlisky's keen political sense with activists in the civil rights struggle and affluent Irish-Americans is very revealing. Catholic women pick up after Protestant families in Ireland. African-American women pick up after affluent Irish-American families in America. She felt more at home with members of The Black Panther Party than with these affluent Irish Americans. The support of the abolition struggle by Irish republicans such as Daniel O'Connell is of historic import. The support the Irish struggle by fighters such as Frederick Douglas and Marcus Garvey is also of historic interest. However, the interchange of tactics by both struggles is most revealing. The historic Belfast-Derry March in January 1969 was modeled after the Selma-Montgomery protest four earlier. The Montgomery bus boycott got its name from Captain Boycott an avaricious Irish landlord. Michael Farrell set up the Young Socialist Alliance in Ireland modeled after the Young Socialists Alliance in the United States. Black and Green has much more of interest for American understanding of the Irish struggle and is must reading for fighters struggling against oppression and bigotry.",
                    "This book is essential reading for anyone interested in politics and civil rights generally. For those with a specific interest in the Northern Ireland or American civil rights movements of the 60s, this is one of the best books written on this subject.A very unique book that credibly draws parallels between the concurrent campaigns.Highly recommended."

This collection of essays written at the time of the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas hearings holds every bit of relevance now as it did nine years ago. Highlighting earlier civil rights legal battles and connecting their influence to the hearings themselves, each essayist examines in progressive detail just how pervasive--indeed, how dangerously latent--racism and sexism are in our society. How the volatile and often avoided issue of race can blind the equally volative and often dismissed issue of sexism in any race. In these essays, we are given a shockingly clear image of the circus that was the mishandling of the hearings. Explosive, revealling, and thought-provoking, this book yanks the proverbial rose-colored glasses from our collective American conscience and dares us to think for ourselves."

Instead get into the real world, treat others as you would be treated, earn things, and don't take things from people because they say you're disadvantaged and essentially not as bright as others, so your test score gets a curve.So many things are sensationalized and uber-hyped today and given more prominence to all the empty-headed know-it-alls that fill classrooms throughout our great nation, but let's face it, if you continue to teach with a one-sided agenda, continue to teach one small part of a story as the whole story then you brainwash people to blame others for their problems.

                    "This book is far more a manifesto than a textbook. The only good thing I can say about it is the author said he was biased in his introduction. Reputable authors present information in a responsible, unbiased manner. Schriver presented his information in a judgmental, biased manner. He tried to explain how things really are, but most people don't think as he does -- thank God. For a textbook designed to teach students who will work in a field which pretty much demands that biases and preconceived notions of people and how the world works be foresworn by the practitioner, this book fails to meet the most basic need for social work students: appropriate guidance. I immediately sold this book after my class ended. I remember feeling sorry for the person who ended up purchasing it. Physically, it's in great condition. I cannot say as much about the content. CSWE really needs to examine this book a bit further. This \"textbook\" is simply inappropriate for social work education.",

The text is full of interesting and useful information that a student of Social Work would find compelling. Because the field is so dynamic, I would hope that this particular text would update it's editions regularly. Since this is the 5th, I'm guessing the authors know something of this already.",

The book is not constructed in a clear way, topics run together with no clear transitions, and is poorly written. The author will introduce a theory or define a term by quoting other authors' definitions. Not just one per term, but many for each new term explained. By the time you finish reading that paragraph you have multiple views on a definition, and none of them are clear. I have read over 40 college textbooks and this is by far the worst I have ever had the misfortune to read. The writing style of the author is so atrocious it appears to be a research paper gathered by a fifth-grader!",

If all my texts had been like this, I'd never have made it through school. Not at all appropriate for undergrad work. It's the only text I sold back, and was glad to get rid of it. A total waste of money. I had to buy another HBSE book just to figure out what this one was trying to say.",
                    "Arguably, this is one of the worst textbooks I've ever had the displeasure of having to read. For the life of me, I can't understand why my instructor would select such a terrible book when there are others that are much better. Schriver uses an annoying technique of citing other people's work to try and explain terms when he should simply define them himself. In fact the book is rife with citations that attempt to explain theories, methods and research but instead of clarifying points, this method makes it more confusing. Somebody forgot to tell Schriver that citations are meant to support his points, not make them for him. All in all, it's an extremely choppy read that ends up saying nothing. He also uses multiple paragraphs to explain what he is about to explain and when done reading, I couldn't help but wonder what point he was trying to make. I have no idea how Schriver got this book published, but it's a crime that a qualified editor allowed such tripe to make it into the hands of students that are actually trying to learn. You won't get much out of this book; take a pass unless you are required to buy this book for a class.",
                    "I had to purchase this book for my MSW program. Unfortunately, since the book was just released this year, there were no \"used\" copies available. This book is AWFUL!! By far the worst textbook I have ever had the misfortune of owning. It's so bad I can't even force myself to read it. Schriver (repeatedly) talks about the origins of words [who cares] and lists 3-4 definitions for each one. \"Smith says it's this.... whereas Jones defines it as...\" and so on. Pick one already! Rent it if you can. Not worth owning.",
                    "Schriver's is a text whose reach exceeds its grasp. The theoretical premise and the structure for the text are good. Schriver argues that there are biases in traditional approaches to various systems and that alternative paradigms exist. However, the writing is often dense. The classification of some theories as \"traditional\" vs \"alternative\" can be disputed. Many theories seem to have characteristics of both. On a positive note, many of the readings included in the text are very interesting.As a faculty member who has used the book in a BSW course, I find that I need to guide students through this text. I distribute a guide to each chapter. Essentially I \"translate\" Schriver with more concrete examples. Other texts I have use require fewer translations. Schriver's focus is perhaps too sophisticated for the average undergraduate.",

Predictable in its attempt to create a 'scathing' rebuttal to the hideous 'Bell Curve', this book offers little to anyone versed in the incredible variety of contemporary feminist discourse. For those prepared for some *real* thinking, try more transgressive/radical voices, such as Patricia Williams, bell hooks, Mary Daly, and many others; also, see various radical works related to Lacan. The Assault on Equality is simply too simple, a statement of the obvious racism and stupidity of Charles Murray et al., and it cannot be said to contribute orginial thinking on the issue of race. Feminists in particular will find this book a bit simple-minded. Well intentioned, but dull, even as the authors are trying to sound angry."

My assumption was correct.In this book, Asante adds new and pertinent points of perspectives not before considered in debates or discussions dealing with race. He also discusses the very important issue of reparations. This book is a must-have for those interested in courageously addressing the issue of race in the United States and throughout the world.BNS FOREVER.Tarikh Bandele",
                    "This is an excellent book. Dr Molefi Kete Asante has written a brillliant book on a very complex issue in the American society and the world: race. How does one erase racism from one's mind? As Pr Asante writes, only by a better knowledge of its past that America can better deal with such a very sensitive and complex problem.The U.S. likes boasting itself of being a great defender of democracy and justice but it is incapable of defending that same justice and equality for its citizens of African descent. America -and the whole world for that matter- will not be a peaceful place if it doesn't seriously tackle that corny issue: racism. Whether one lives in Paris, London, New-York, Madrid, Brussels, Rome, Beijing, Tokyo or Moscow, to name but a few, racism is always present. We have to erase it if we want to live peacefully with our fellow human beings.This book by Dr Asante is so well written that I more than recommend it to all the people who put humanity first.I give it five stars because it more than deserves it!Go get it!",
                    "Although sometimes long-winded and with way too many wild examples for me to handle when it came to brutality (which was precisely his point), I liked this book a lot. I read it for a class, but I would've read it for fun. It goes into the depths of how racism has affected our country as a whole, be it through riots, murder, job prejudice, lack of progress, lack of companionship, lack of trust, poverty, and through celebrities. This author goes into all realms of racism and in the end, proposes the same argument I supported for years. I thoroughly agree with every point he has made, and I like his unique way of spreading about Reparations.I heard him speak at my college and he was phenomenal. My teacher said he was humble. I don't know where she got that idea from because he was very in-your-face and I love that about him. Any time someone speaks on a controversial topic, they have to be willing to stand by what they say and have relevant examples to back themselves up. One of the ladies in my class said before he spoke that she felt this book \"disrespected white people.\" I totally disagree. I think this book is just the truth that some are not ready to read.",

                    "This is an excellent book for anyone to read. It reallys shows the reality of what racial discrimination was and is occurring. This amazing true story goes through the life of a man who, like most whites males, will never be in a situation of being a true minority. It is astonishing the reactions this educated man gets because of a simple change of skin color. I think everyone can learn a lot from this book and make those who don't see it ,realize the racial tensions this nation has. I garauntee if you read this book (not being a minority) you will feel shame for what we cause minorites to go through for simply being a minority.",
                    "Black Like Me Tyler 8-16-99My first reactions:Moments ago I finished the novel Black Like Me and was left with the unwavering sense of a consitency in the problem of racism all over the world. I have come to realize that while there is ignorance and while there is hatred there will always be racism. Racism is nothing that anyone is born with. Racism is instilled in a childs mind throughout his or her childhood just like manners or putting on your seatbelt when you enter a car. On the last page of the book Mr. Griffen explains the seemingly everlasting trend of racism. \"Whites teach their children to call [blacks] \"niggers,\"\"(p. 159) said the negro boy that was helping out Mr. Griffen. The little boy had fallen victim to this early teachings many times and now said that \"he would not even go into white neighborhoods because it sickened him to be called that.\"(p. 159) Today in most parts of the country we have done away with the unmerciful \"hate stare\" and the blatent insults that have scarred so many african-americans still alive today to tell about it. But until we teach our children to love all and to not allow hate and prejudices to become a part of them the issue of racism will still be around in many different forms.",
                    "So great and on time, one of the easiest ways to get a book online. Definitely would buy more books from these guys.",
                    "We purchased the book so my son could finish a summer reading report for school. The library didn't have enough copies for the students and it was hard to get it completed in a short amount of time. Renewals were not possible. It accomplished the task we had.",
                    "Black Like Me is about John Howard Griffin a white newspaper writer living in Texas in 1959. He is very preoccupied with the growing racism among whites towards blacks. He recalls reading a report about the growing rate of black suicides, especially in the South, and realizes that as a white man it is nearly impossible for him to know what life is like for blacks. He comes up with the crazy idea to go to a dermatologist to alter his skin color so that he may pose as a black man in the South. This book shows in detail what happens to him while in the South as a black man to being refused to sit at the soda fountain or order a soda in drug stores to not being allowed off a city bus to use the bathroom to the extreme of being stalked by a black man and threatened to be mugged. This story tells the true hostility that whites had for blacks in the South and calls into question the term \"separate but equal\". This is a gripping tale of a man who would and does do everything he can to gain insight into a race so foreign to him. It is an excellent read if you are interested in the history of America and I would definitely recommend this book to a friend.",
                    "Although the events author John Howard Griffin recounts in this short book took place over 50 years ago, they still provide important lessons to those wondering what life was like for African-Americans during a dark period in our country's history. In 1959, a white journalist decided to change his appearance so that he could see firsthand what it was like to be black in the South. He shaved his hair, ingested a substance that would darken his skin pigment (and applied another topically), then headed to the streets of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. What he found was that even some of the persons who behaved quite civilly towards him when he was white, behaved badly when he was black. During the month that he was disguised, he experienced firsthand the hardship his fellow (non-white) Americans were forced to endure when wanting to do such things as: use a lavatory, ride the bus, and engage in transactions with merchants. Sometimes, even when he thinks that a white person is being helpful (a man at a park for example), he realizes he's mistaken.He experienced racism not only in Baton Rouge (his first stop), but everywhere else he goes (Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia). Traveling by bus to these other southern states, he finds things even worse. Eventually, he realizes he's had enough and outs himself to a journalist friend who helps him obtain photos of some of those he's interacted with along the way in order to help document his experiences. He recounts what happened in a sort of diary/journal format in this book. In summary, Black Like Me is a must read for anyone who needs a reminder (or not) about how far we've come...and how far we've yet to go in improving race relations in America. Also good: The Autobiography of Malcolm X by Alex Haley, No Higher Honor by Condoleeza Rice, and Roots by Alex Haley.",
                    "talk about walking in another's shoes!this a truly remarkable account. IMHO, John Howard Griffin is on the same level as the likes of Mother Theresa and Nelson Mandela",
                    "I thought I understood racism but boy was I wrong. This man was brave and insightful. I feel a greater understanding of what it might be like to be black, especially in the South during the 50s and 60s. Things are not a heck of a lot better now , but slightly. Wow.",
                    "I found this book very interesting. I lived in Canada in the 60's and 70's and I knew nothing of how life really was for black persons in the south. As a kid in the 50's our family traveled a lot throughout the states and I guess us kids were too nieve to see. Funny, I am white, born in Nigeria though, and grew up thinking that all people are quite equal. I am glad to have finally read this book and have my eyes opened.",
                    "This book was so educational, yet so entertaining! I could hardly put it down. I often felt like I was there, and could feel what he was feeling. LOVED it!",
                    "The book was informative and it got the point acorss but it was a bit boring.",
                    "This book was very monotonous. After awhile it was the same thing over and over. I liked the idea more than the book. It just wasn't very interesting. I think it would have been better if they'd made the whole story up. It tells you the things you already know. It's just a black man walking around doing nothing interesting.But it is classic. So I suppose you should read it whether you want to or not.",
                    "What if you blackened your skin to pass as a negro during the 1960's? What this fictional story showed us what was going on in racist America and moved millions for a change that we now, in a good part, enjoy.",
                    "This book was very informational on how the race situation was in the south during the late 50's. It was a real eye opener into the emotional side of racism back then. The book was important in that it really showed both sides of the story. One of the weak points of the book was when he started to struggle with not being emotionally attached. Also towards the end it got really repetitive and boring. The strengths of the book was how well researched and accurate it was on both sides. I think that every one should read this book. Whether or not you have racial prejudices or not it was a great read and look into our not so distant past. It also is a very good example of how words and actions can effect people.",
                    "Even though a lot of time has passed since this novel was written, some of the same prejudices are still around today. I can't understand how after all this time that this can be true. As a resident of a small town in KY, I wasn't even around any Black people until I went out into the world of higher education and work. I was lucky enough to expand my mind and circle of friends. But there is still a lot of prejudice around that I just can't understand.This book really opens you eyes to the people that are stuck in the past and the brave ones that are trying their best to move our Country forward.",

                    "My son recommended this to me as it is required reading at his college. I would urge people of all color and religions to read this book. It gives us the unique opportunity to actually put ourselves in someone else's shoes!",
                    "I was fascinated by this book. It's perfect for anyone who loves historical non-fiction. I had never heard of it before I purchased it on the Kindle Daily Deal awhile back and I'm glad I did.",
                    "This book was a good read, it was relatively short and very straightforward. There are many parts of the book that shocked me but most of it was saddening because it illustrated the mentalities and motifs of the 1950s which a lot of America still hold on to. The misunderstanding, stereotyping and discriminative practices towards the black culture is no different than today.",
                    "Very interesting! I was born about this time and remember a lot of these stereo types as a child. Mr. Griffin was a very brave man!",
                    "I was given this book to read in high school over 10 years ago and still remember most of it today. I believe the age range could be lowered to 15 or 16 years. It's an easy read and kids need to realize that it wasn't long ago that people thought this way and how it is still relevant today. I recommend this to any one.",
                    "Excellent and still pertinent perspective on the challenges America faces due to racism. I also saw a tie to the economic injustices that are still being debated today (e.g., Occupy Wall Street).",
                    "I read Black Like Me in college, and it summarized all that I knew about the deep south, and southern resistance to letting black people live their lives in American freedom. I reread the book last year, and put it on my reading list for a social psychology course. The students who read it were stunned with the story, and with the writers bravery. I recommend it highly.",
                    "I feel like ive read nearly every book there is on racism. It is rare for me to feel as if ive read something of that nature with a new angle, but this book suprised me. What I love is that Griffin writes with little to no favortism, the style is very objective. A minor classic.",
                    "Great book. Really gets at the heart of a lot of social justice issues by putting faces and names to the ideas. Definitely recommend it.",
                    "This is an amazing story of a white man who darkened his skin and traveled the deep south as a black man, in a time of segregation and other racial unrest.This is an amazing tale and one that is as relevant today as it was when it was written. The racism of today's world might not be as open as accepted, but it's still there and, like it or not, all of us are judging people all the time. Because of this, I think there are some amazing lessons within the pages of this book, which will challenge your thinking and make you reevaluate the way you deal with people.Would love to see somebody do this today. I think it would make an excellent companion to how things have (or haven't) changed.",
                    "An unbelievable experiment turned our racial preconceptions upside down. What would you do if you woke up one day and you were a different ethnicity? A courageous man actually did this. He turned his skin black to see what it was like to live in their world. The results were startling. There was no end to the cruelty and unfairness. He also gained insight into the everyday life and attitudes of African Americans during that time. It was a really groundbreaking novel.",
                    "This book was recommended to me, and i bought it and it sat on my shelf for a time. I got it down the other day and started reading and could not put it down. It was amazing.I was brought back to so many memories of the deep south and the attitudes, (that still are now today) prevailing in that time.I admire this man's courage so much. I despaired at the attitudes the white people had tword him. The look, the tone of voice, the lonliness.When he looks into the mirror for the first time, he is greeted by, himself yet a stranger.To walk in another man's shoes is indeed a gift of God, and to be able to have compassion for that experiance is great.This will be one of my fave. books along with Watership Down and several others i have read over and over again.This would be a book you could read over again and get more and more from.Amazing book.",
                    "'Black Like Me' by John Howard Griffin was bombastic when it was first published in the early 1960s. It brazenly articulated the differences on how people, in particular the author, are treated in the Deep South based on the color of their skin. The author had his skin darkened through chemicals and ultraviolet light. He traveled from New Orleans to Atlanta by road (mostly bus) and chronicles how people looked at him differently just because he was black. For a white man he found the experience utterly appalling. It was also staggering how various white men approached the author to discuss very crude sexual matters, thinking that African-Americans are only of any value based on their sexual prowess.This book should easily be considered five stars by most reviewers. However the book is flawed. The author is not a particularly fine writer; he has a tendency to ramble. And I feel the author has taken some journalist liberties. I wanted more of the facts about people, what they look like, what they said and did, etc. But the author seems to be inconsistent; sometimes he wants to lecture us on racism, other times he delivers a documentary on his travels.Bottom line: an important and very shocking read. Recommended.",
                    "Before there was comic \"Soul Man\" etc., there was this 50's investigative memoir about a white male 'passing' as a black man to 'experience' black culture. Also, try Philip Roth's \"The Stain\" movie and book based on a real life BM passing for WM.",
                    "This book is the account of a white man, named John Howard Griffin, who turned himself black to study the real extent of racism. It starts out with his experiences in New Orleans as a black man. He knew about some of the things that are done to black people, but didn't know the full extent of how much white people try to degrade the sense of value or self-worth of all black people. He experiences having to walk miles ot get a drink of water, working for hours and having just eough money to eat that day, and the whites attempts at lowering all black's self worth, including the \"hate stare.\" However, New orleans is relatively nice for Bkacks. When he reads that in Mississippi there was a lynching case the FBI had found tons of evidence for and the White grand jury wouldn't even open the packet of evidence. The mississippe folks claimed they had wonderful relationships with the Negros. Griffin had even met some of them before, and talked about there relationships with the Negros. He saw a whole new side of them when he went as a black man. He was horrified at how inhumanely people could treat other people and shares very insightful thoughts ion what racism was really like.I would highly reccomend this book for someone to read, although it's not for younger children. it''s more for tenns and audults. It has a plethora of large words that some with smallish vocabularies might not understand. Otherwise this is one of the best boos I have ever read and I highly reccomend you read it.",
                    "Originally published in 1961, Black Like Me is the account of how white journalist John Howard Griffin had his skin medically darkened and traveled through the Deep South as a black man in an attempt to explain the hardships black people in the South faced. It also covers the backlash against the publication of his story.Black Like Me is a concise, fast and engaging read. The reader is often able to see things through Griffin's eyes, even as Griffin tries to see things through the eyes of others. He does an excellent job communicating the cultures of fear and despair he encountered. The entire account of his travels as a black man is riveting.If there is any nit-picking to be done, let it be for this: at times, particularly early on, Griffin's descriptions of mundane, everyday objects and details seem forced and do not aid the narrative.While today's racial tensions are much less overt (and much less publicized), Black Like Me still has quite a bit to say about the universal elements of human nature and the culture of racism.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",
                    "John Howard Griffin is a man of deep thought and deep feelings. He wants to know what it's like to be separated from a priviledged world. As his skins becomes darker and darker, the less respected he becomes. He no longer is able to find a bathroom or even a glass of water because of the way he was \"born.\" People treat him like a slave. This book will convert you into a person who speaks out for Negros, even today. You will no longer be able to tolerate racial jokes.",
                    "The book BLACK LIKE ME is about the author John Howard Griffin who wanted to somehow turn himself black for a little while to see what it was like to be a black man in the late 1950s. Griffin got together with a doctor who artificially darkened his skin by medication. John traveled through parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia while he was \"black.\" While he was a \"tenth class citizen\" he sometimes had to go all the way across town to go to the restroom or get a drink. Griffin even had a hard time cashing travelers' checks because he was black. The white bus driver wouldn't let him get off to go to the bathroom. One night he was followed by a white man who threatened to stab him. On Griffin's journey he found out that blacks will do anything they can to help each other out. Strangers would pull him off the street into their homes. The way the book ended was Griffin stopped taking medication until he was white again. Then he saw blacks in a different way.I suggest this book to people from 13 years old and up because there's some bad language in it. I liked this book because it taught me that if you were black back then, you were treated like garbage by whites, but blacks would treat others really nicely. I would give this book four stars. It went into detail, but a lot of the whites he met acted the same way, mean.",
                    "Honestly before reading this I use to get mad that there was so much racism around and that I thought that as a mixed woman I had it bad because I had two different colors in me. After reading this you will change your view.Its starts off that John Griffin decides that he wants to know what it's like to be black and goes to get surgery on his skin color. The doctor doesn't think it will happen but tries it anyway and soon John's skin begins to get darker. He then decides to see what the average white man will do since his color and the opposite of his and turns out to be very disappointed. He tries to by a train ticket in the middle of the book and the things that the people say to him made me shiver. He travels to Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia and still nothing changed. After he collects his data on this mischief he starts to write about it for the newspaper and gradually things changed. You must read this book to find out what really happens. It will make you view our world a different way and make you think about every time you had called someone something mean or were racist towards them. When the book first came out in 1964 there was nothing but controversy about wither they should ban the book or not. Personally Im glad they didn't or I would've never known what respect was. If you haven't read this book yet you should it will teach you a lot about the past and make you appreciate the future.",
                    "Though approaching the fiftieth anniversary of the events in this book, reading BLACK LIKE ME today shows both the inroads America has made towards erasing the blight of racial intolerance, as well as the limits that America has in truly educating itself about all kinds of Hate. Indefensible Hate still exists here, and there is no indication that it will make as great a stride in the next fifty years as it has in the last fifty.Without question, this book should be required reading for all teenagers (and adults) across the country. To understand another's perspective is the first, primary step in eradicating intolerance. This book (which is a slight bit didactic at points) is the remarkable journey of a man who bothered to really try to understand the life of the black man in the American South as best as he could. Of course he could never truly KNOW, but he certainly took pains to do what he could to understand the experience better than anyone before.Students (eighth-graders) in my Honors Language Arts class are required to read this book, and I hope they will discover from where we as a nation have traveled. Those who easily bandy about epithets or think unkind thoughts about others (whether because of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, heritage, or ability) might get an honest sense of perspective by taking the trip with John Howard Griffin.Better yet, after reading this book, ask yourself these questions (and I will ask my students): \"If given the opportunity to change my appearance so dramatically as to appear to be from a different race for six weeks, would I do it? What would I fear going into it? Suppose I was told after four weeks that it was impossible to change back; how would it make me feel?\"For a country that falsely prides itself on equality for all, I believe that our conversations about racial equality are sorely lacking in our public dialogue. BLACK LIKE ME would be an excellent place to start a meaningful conversation.",
                    "Read for the first time in the early 1960's when the only contact we had with Black people in Small Town, Wisconsin, was an occasional Nat King Cole record, this book had a profound affect on me. It was the only book I ever read, flipped back, immediately, to the beginning and read again, so great was it's impact. Griffin's story of his encounters with Southern Whites (first as a White Man and then as a Black) in the days of segregation really opened my eyes to a kind of behavior with which I, as a young reader, was not familiar. While it's for certain that racism in Northern Wisconsin existed,it took the form of the \"out of sight,out of mind\" variety (but God forbid that they ever got any farther north than Milwaukee...). It was not mentioned, but it was there simmering. Griffin's expose, for me, knocked any practice of racism, benign or otherwise, flat on its ass; it made very real the kind of hateful hypocrisy that lies behind an otherwise respectful U.S. of A. citizenry. As I traveled through the South with Griffin, I began to feel the same sense of revulsion the author feels; how could such a thing be? To my young mind it was a mystery. Would Nat King Cole, who everybody loved, be treated like that? And so the seeds of empathy for the oppressed were planted within me (along with a dose of healthy skepticism regarding the nature of man). As I looked at the book again recently, I thought about how lucky I was to have read the book when I did; if I hadn't read it when I did, I might be a very different man today.",

                    "In 1959, John Howard Griffin temporarily abandoned his privileged life as a Southern White male, medically darkened his skin, and posed as a Black man in the deep South. Some reviewers rightly question whether a short period of immersion such as this can allow the pain of racism to etch onto one's soul. Of course it cannot. It cannot allow for the decade after decade after decade build-up of racist attitudes and history. Nor can it allow for the day after day after day of soul-numbing hatred. Still, for its time, this book was revolutionary. And even for our time today, \"Black Like Me\" can at least provide Whites with some small slice of the horrors of racism.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction , Soul Physicians, and Spiritual Friends.",
                    "Black Like Me was a great book and taught me how the black person who lived in the South had such a hard life especially in the Deep South of Mississippi or in New Orleans, which is the setting of the book. In New Orleans the white person is nice to the black man but the white man does not respect the black man just tolerates him. In Mississippi the white person is very degrading to the black man. You cannot even look at a white woman in Mississippi without getting lynched. John Griffin who was on a bus ride in Mississippi was not allowed to get off at his stop because the bus driver was a white man and a horrible racist and he just wanted to mess with John Griffin. John Howard Griffin was a courageous journalist because he was a white man who wanted to turn himself black to see how the black man lived in the South. He wanted to see what the real hardships were for the everyday black man. For example how hard it is to find a job or a place to live; everyday things that we take for granted in today's society. The book showed me that racism is a real thing that blacks even in today's society have to deal with. The book was great and I would recommend the book to anyone who wants to learn about the South and how black people really have to live their everyday lives.",
                    "I just read this book having taken an interest in it for some years and I must say it does give a very glaring eye at the Deep South at the end of the 50's. It's completely heart wrenching and I was very much into reading it but I did feel it was a bit rushed. It would start describing how he felt at certain situations and I would think \"break through, he's shedding his persona of a reporter and letting his story take him into itself\" but then it would stop. I felt there were a lot of details that could have been added that would have made it so much more powerful. All and all said though it is an American classic that gets its point across and for that I truly respect it. I just wish there were more in it... It really did seem rushed an unfinished, which I thought was even more depressing then the story itself.",
                    "Black Like MeBy John Howard GriffinBlack Like me is a great book to show the true meaning of racism. In this book, the main character, John Howard Griffin, undergoes a temporary medical treatment that turns his skin dark. When he does not take the medication, he turns light again. While he is black, John Howard Griffin finds the experience to be much worse than he expected. Though fellow black people treat him with warmth, white people treat him with hostility and contempt. He never expected the comments on every street corner and the constant dirty looks. When he was white again, he found that white people then treated him with respect and were courteous. On the other hand blacks gave him weary looks filled with fear. John Griffin was soon discouraged within a few weeks and could see the exhaustion on his face just as well as the next black person. In the end, this experience brought him to the conclusion that racism was simply a huge misunderstanding between the different races.I really like how this book shows not only more than one point of view, but from one person and one mind set. So he has taken his same views, and applied them to both worlds. It is interesting how John Howard Griffin goes takes the initiative to actually try and understand the other side of racism. He goes all the way through with his deal to write an article and finds how hard it really is to be black because of the reality of it all. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. The story is a true reality check for the main character, and, though it seems slow at first, it is a really eye-opening book for someone to read.Shannon",
                    "The 1980's movie, \"Soul Man\" uses a premise similar to the basis for this book. In the movie, a white man darkens his skin color so that he can obtain a scholarship to law school that is reserved for blacks. It is a comedy and is very funny, although there is some serious social commentary. John Howard Griffin did the same thing in the late fifties in an attempt to learn the plight of black people in the south. It was a time of extreme racism and he took a great risk in doing so. Once he wrote of his experiences, the most extreme of white racists would target him for death.It is a very powerful book and is the strongest possible commentary on how absurd racism is. By taking a chemical and changing the color of his skin, he goes from a respected member of society to a demeaned object. You also learn how much power the radical racists had in the south at the time. There were many whites that were disturbed by the intense racism in the south, but were terrified of the potential for violent retribution if they spoke out. Griffin also writes very well about the despair of the blacks and how it manifested itself in many of the behaviors used to justify the perception that they were inferior. It is clear that only the Federal government had the power to destroy racism and the actions taken by the courts to overturn the racist laws will forever rank as one of their finest hours.I first read this book as a class assignment in high school and have reread it three times since then. Fortunately, we are decades beyond the type of events Griffin writes about. However, these events should never pass from the public consciousness and I strongly encourage everyone to read it.",
                    "This gripping book helps whites to experience life from the other side of the racial divide. In 1959, author John Howard Griffin (1920-80) used special medication to darken his skin, and then traveled the Deep South as a black man in the latter days of legal segregation. The \"Negro\" Griffin encountered separate facilities, hate-filled stares, assumptions that he was over-sexed, and job options limited to menial labor. He found conditions slightly better in big cities like New Orleans and Atlanta, but never free of rudeness or indignities. Griffin also met a small number of whites that apologized for racism. When Griffin switched his skin color back to white, blacks became surly, and whites became friendly. Unfortunately, Griffin never ventured outside the Deep South, depriving us of a chance to compare racism between regions. In this sense, his stirring book is too short.BLACK LIKE ME angered white southerners when published in 1960. Griffin (who'd once recovered from blindness) received anonymous death threats, and soon developed health problems associated with his special medication. Too bad we cannot step into each other's race the way Griffin did - it might make for a better society.",
                    "Anytime you that you think your life is bad, pick up &quot;Black Like Me&quot;, a riveting expose on how black people were (are?) treated in the Southern U.S. in the 1950's/1960's. You think you've got it bad? Has anyone ever prevented you from using the restroom facilites when your bladder was full, just because they could? Has anyone hung you from a tree just for looking at a white woman the &quot;wrong&quot; way?What white America did (and still does to a certain extent today, they just aren't as obvious about it anymore) to the black community is revolting, disgusting and stomach churning.I found myself closing the book in several passages because I couldn't bear to continue reading about the absolute delight white men and woman took in berating, insulting, ignoring and torturing black people.You will be distubed and sickened while reading &quot;Black Like Me&quot; in which a white man uses pills to darken his skin in order to pass as a black man while traveling through the deep South. What he experiences pure evil behavior from whites (with a few exceptions). However, time and time again, he is amazed by the kindess and courtesy shown by his &quot;fellow&quot; black man.Perhaps faith in humanity can be restored by witnessing how kind your fellow man can be, but you will be appalled at how cruel others can be.A must read for everyone.",
                    "John Howard Griffin's \"Black Like Me\" is probably one of the most important works of the Civil Rights Era. Sadly, it's not important so much for what it says (although, what it says is quite powerful), but for the fact that a white man said it. Griffin doesn't say all that much that black writers hadn't been saying for decades, but for a variety of reasons, white people - even well-intentioned white people - couldn't hear it until it was said by one of their own.One of the biggest obstacles in the Civil Rights Movement was that most black people had long been conditioned not to tell the truth of their experience to white people for fear of angering them and suffering reprisals. In turn, because of this silence, whites could comfortably wear their blinders and assume that \"separate but equal\" was working just fine. After all, most whites interacted with blacks at least from time to time and most didn't harbor any ill sentiments. Most were courteous and pleasant, and most were genuinely - albeit naively - unaware of any real suffering by blacks. It was just the way things were.The only way to breach the barrier between blacks and whites, and thereby bridge the communication gap, was for a white man to become black and live in the \"Negro\" world. The important thing to note about Griffin's transformation is that, while he was scrupulous about altering his appearance, he specifically chose not to alter his name, speech patterns, mannerisms or any other fundamental aspects of himself. This gives the lie to the oft-repeated rationalization that blacks were judged by the \"content of their character\" rather than the color of their skin.Perhaps the greatest strength of Griffin's book is his ability to simultaneously sink himself fully into his new persona while at the same time consciously and carefully observing and critiquing his responses thereto. Griffin makes passing reference to \"when I was blind\". We don't know the circumstances of either his blindness or his recovery, but it shows that Griffin has had previous experience entering into and returning from an alien world.The first time Griffin sees his new \"Negro\" self in the mirror, we, the readers, experience the shock and alienation right along with him. As he learns to navigate as a \"Negro\", we too learn things before that we'd never even thought to think about before, let alone experienced before. We feel Griffin's fear as he is stalked by a young, threatening white kid. We squirm in disgust as white man after white man probes the \"sexual character\" of the \"Negro\". And we sigh in gratitude for the small and large kindnesses he receives along the way. Most of all, we too lose touch a bit with our comfortable white existence and sense, perhaps for the first time, what it feels like to be literally uncomfortable in our own skin.My only regret about the book is how short it was. I, in my own selfishness, wanted the experiment to go on so I could experience more of that alien world which I thought I knew. But the fact that Griffin could endure the experiment for only a few weeks speaks volumes. Certain places he is only able to stay a few hours before fleeing or being rescued. Fortunately, he had the resources and connections to do so. Imagine being poor and black, consigned to such places having to struggle like an animal to survive, and then having that very animal-ness flung back in your face as the reason you are not worthy of equal citizenship?Griffin's 1979 epilogue is also immensely important as it gives a context and understanding of the development of the Civil Rights Movement. Many of the same patterns which existed pre-Civil Rights - the \"Negro\" as an ignorant child who needed to be led and controlled by smarter, \"benevolent\" whites for his own good - persisted throughout the movement. Well-intentioned whites were understandably upset to be pushed aside after putting their time, money and reputations on the line, but seen from the black perspective, it made perfect sense. It wasn't about separatism as much as it was about empowerment, which blacks could (and can't) achieve so long as whites are in charge of deciding what rights will be fought for and how.Finally, many will argue that this book may have been important \"back then\" but it's dated now because things are different. After all, we have our first black president, don't we? But the very rise of that black president has made it crystal clear that the struggle isn't over and that the movement still has a place. From the documented rise in overtly racist \"hate\" groups to the perhaps nave ideas of people like Rand Paul who thinks that private businesses should be legally allowed to discriminate, it is inescapable that \"Black Like Me\" is as relevant today as it was then. If anything, perhaps we need a new John Howard Griffin to cross racial barriers and compare the lives of today's blacks to those whom Griffin encountered. I do believe we've made progress, but I'm sure today, just like fifty years ago, many people would be shocked to hear the truth.",

                    "As a human, I don't think anyone can 100% relate to another person's situation, unless they have the same experiences. So when I heard about the book Black Like Me, I was amazed anyone would put themselves into a different culture so they could understand it from an insider's perspective. What I got out of this book was amazing.The book Black Like Me is about a white man by the name of John Howard Griffin. He grew up during a time when Blacks were poorly treated by Whites in the South. Griffin goes out of his way to create an appearance and environment that is authentic to the one that most Blacks dealt with during this time. He goes through an operation that turns his skin black. Griffin discovers how easily people judge and label others by their appearance.It is a powerful book that gave me a good perspective on the hardships that minority cultures face. It was interesting to read, and it is definitely at the top of my list. I strongly recommend it to everyone, young adults and adults alike.PR 15",
                    "This is a non fiction book but it reads quickly like a novel, partly because its told in I narrative and instead of concentrating on facts and statistics John Griffen focuses on his emotional journey as a white man traveling as a black in the deep south.Before reading it i knew what racisim was of course, and i've read books on this time period and since about racisim but this was the first book that really made it real for me. This has to do mainly because he had a white man's perspective, or a perspective of being one of the opressors and switching to one of the opressed.It is also amazing what John Griffen did- turning his skin color black, traveling through the south, and then later reporting on what he found even though he knew he would jeopardize himself and his family. It took a lot of bravery and not many would do it. He changed his whole identity at the cost of losing it.This book can relate to any situation where one group is being degraded because of their skin color, religion, etc. John Griffen's views of how racisim plays out and how it affects the whole society are timeless.Everyone should read this, it only takes a short time, its not a long book, but the book's impression and story will stay with you for a long time after.",

                    "Books written by individuals who intend only to write, as truthfully as possible, of their experience or discovery can be boring. For many, researching a specific topic or seeking out the studied experience and speaking of the results, irrespective of the response is a matter of moral integrity, for others it is fodder to be used in order to espouse one's cherished opinion. Typically, these type of books are read by individuals who are interested in the specific subject studied, the reverberations are limited to a relatively small discipline where the findings are discussed, studied and incorporated into the discipline or quickly ignored. When such a book is penned by a \"common\" writer about his experiment in changing his ethnicity (in this case, a White man becoming a Black man), plunging into the world inhabited by that ethnic group (the segregated South of 1959) then writing with explicit truthfulness of that experience, the result can be historic. Black Like Me is a historic book, celebrating its Fiftieth anniversary, which is just as relevant today as it was when published in 1961.John Howard Griffin was a respected author living in Texas in 1959 when he choose to surrender his privileged life in order to speak with authority to those of his white community of the plight of their black neighbors. He did so by literally changing is skin color and spending five weeks living as a part of the Black community in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. Those states at that time were the center of Segregationist laws and behavior. It was well known, within that region, that a white person could do any harm, including murder, to a person of color without fear of legal retribution. Mr. Griffin found the racism of a much more insidious, pervasive and expected reality than even he had expected. He quickly discovered that he was on the receiving end of this evil for the single reason of his skin color.Reading of the pain he suffered, indignities demanded of him and the realization that this was \"as good as it would get\" for those whose daily life he was experiencing for a short time was an encounter with my own ignorance, prejudice and arrogance. Mr. Griffin shares his epiphany of seeing himself as a black man was a transformative one,\"I looked into the mirror and saw nothing of the white John Griffin's past. No, the reflections led back to Africa, back to the shanty and the ghetto, back to the fruitless struggles against the mark of blackness. Suddenly, almost with no mental preparation, no advance hint, it became clear and permeated my whole being. I had gone too far. I knew now that there is no such thing as a disguised white man, when the black won't rub. The black man is wholly a Negro, regardless of what he once may have been.\" (p.31)The remainder of the book is his detailing, often in horrid detail, of just what being black in the segregated South was like. Mr. Griffin's looking into the mirror for the first time and seeing a black man looking back shook him to his core, reading this book has caused a similar response within me.This Anniversary Edition includes an epilogue written by the author in 1976 which speaks of the repercussions of this work, the results of the Civil Rights struggle of the 1960's and was very educational as to how race relations turned out so differently than was \"The Dream\" of that time period. It also includes an essay by Mr. Griffin, \"Beyond Otherness\" one of his last, which speaks of the power of the individual within the culture. The book ends with an Afterword by his Biographer Robert Bonazzi and it speaks to the timelessness of this powerful book.As I read, sometimes fighting nausea, then tears, then finding myself smiling, this book, I saw how Mr. Griffin's experience applies to our present culture. Then as now all are \"accepted\" as long as \"they\" comply with \"our\" expectations, do not have a name that's sounds as if it originated in the looks Middle East or skin color that is \"too dark\" or appear to be attracted to people of one's own gender or . . . .

Being actually white and enjoying the privileges Caucasians enjoyed during the era of segregation enables the narrator to realize the kind of discrimination black people had to deal with when he colors his skin to look like an African-American, and is actually a pretty insightful look and a fascinating glimpse at a bygone - and thank goodness it's gone - era.",
                    "Racial prejudice has long been an issue in the United States of America. What irony that a nation titled \"United\" should go through so much division! In his poignant narrative Black Like Me, John Howard Griffin chronicles his experiences in America's Deep South during the 1950s as a white man dyed black.Griffin's journal entries are easy to breeze through and intense enough to keep your eyes glued to the book. I basically read this book in 2 days.Although this story did not surprise me, it profoundly impacted me and added to my personal convictions that no one should mock, scorn, or humiliate another individual solely because of appearance. It is pure ignorance to say that because a man is black, he is less deserving of basic human rights.I feel that this book has given me great insight and is another astonishing example of how important it is to treat others, no matter what they look like, with respect, dignity, and honor. Not doing so can cause them to feel unwanted, ashamed, and desolate (as Griffin so aptly points out).Overall this book has stirred up a myriad of emotions in my heart: anger, repulsion, anguish, outrage, and amusement. It pains me to see how some people justify their cruel treatment toward others. It pains me to see others being treated with utter contempt and disrespect. The fact that a person can degrade another human being merely for the color of his skin is ridiculous and utter foolishness.This book is an honest telling of a time in our American history.I say, definitely go read it!",

It's a fantastic book in the way it takes you to the deep south and shows the bigotry, kindness, and fear so present in that time period. while it painted a dark picture of what existed in graphic detail, it also gave a fair and surprising account of the good-minded people who felt the injustices should be corrected but didn't have the power or courage to take a stand. They were not vested and the risk was so high. in terms of the author, what an incredibly courageous way to get to the truth given the hostile environment.

                    "I enjoyed re-reading this book, a nonfiction kind-of-documentary by John Griffin, a white journalist who reports on his travels throughout the South of the US in 1959. During this era of Jim Crow, segregation of Blacks and whites was commonplace in the South, and institutionalized discrimination against Blacks was too. However, what makes Griffin's book very unique is that he traveled in disguise as a black man in the South.The book is an excellent study of many sociological issues and concerns of that time period in the US, and I was particularly struck by the compelling information of racism and sexism that Griffin objectively presents. Griffin introduces the reader to many stereotypes which were used to describe African-Americans during this journalistic odyssey. As with most stereotypes, the stereotypes presented in the book are based on ignorance and misunderstanding of African-American culture.Griffin reports of a certain perverse curiosity that many whites had (and may possibly still have) regarding African-Americans. Unfortunately, Griffin chooses to present the reader with certain stereotypes without attempting to explain them. Such stereotypes, however, need to be carefully examined, in my opinion, to illustrate the dynamic interaction between racism and sexism, and to clearly see how racism and sexism are utilized in Black Like Me and in everyday life as mechanisms used by whites to discriminate against,and often times, victimize African-Americans.Griffin, as a black man, speaks of the numerous encounters he experiences with white people. The vast majority of these interactions occur at night. Griffin writes, \"A man [white] will reveal himself in the dark, which gives an illusion of anonymity, more than he will in the bright light.\" [Griffin, p. 85] Griffin refers to his encounters with white people as pornographic. In conversation, white men interrogate Griffin in hopes that he would reveal some mystic information concerning the lifestyle of sexual behavior of black people. From these experiences with white people, Griffin posits that these individuals believed that blacks were \" an exhaustible sexual machine with over-sized genitals and a vast store of experiences, immensely varied.\" [Griffin, p. 85]Griffin's nocturnal encounters with white men suggest that such sexual perverse curiosity was one means by which white men subordinated and exploited the black male. Centuries-old white mythology is also employed in the book to victimize blacks. That is, fearful white men established untruths which have been used throughout American history to impede African-American progress.White mythology has been used to explain the unexplainable as well as to place the white man above other non-whites. History chronicles how white men used to portray the black male as an animal, a horse, a stallion possessing physical prowess, inexhaustible sexual appetite, and uncontrollable passions. In support of such mythology, Griffin recounts an incident when a white man asked him if he had ever had ever been with a white woman. When Griffin responded that he had never been with one, the white man states, \"There's plenty of white women who would like to have a good buck Negro.\" [Griffin, p. 86]Another established mythological portrayal is of the black female by white people. black women were perceived to be sensual, exotic, and extremely provocative. \"...NOTICE!...it was only another list of prices a white man would pay for various types of sensuality with various ages of Negro girls.\" [Griffin, p. 81] Griffin reports that black women were greatly used and abused by white men, and frequently black women were also mistreated by their own race. Sadly, some black men, when paid a certain amount of money, would even assist white men procure black women and children.In mythological terms, the black man was viewed as Apollo, the black woman was viewed as Venus, and the white woman was viewed as the Virgin Mary. These stereotypes which were devised by white men have not only caused significant problems for blacks, but also have caused problems for white people. Two more frequently employed stereotypes created by white men and given to blacks included the aggressive savage beast, and the docile child inferior to whites in all aspects. Many other stereotypes have been created and utilized by whites in the US to describe blacks, however, the previously mentioned ones are perhaps the most ingrained in the American psyche and the ones which surface in Griffin's work.Although Griffin painted himself black on the outside and experienced many things which African-Americans experienced at that time, his interpretation of his collected data was from the perspective of a white man. Griffin's cultural orientation, ethnic heritage, gender and race were constantly with him at all times even if they were not always visible to the naked eye. Therefore, Griffin was only able to draw a conclusion from his darkened `white' feelings, reasoning, and senses.Griffin's experiment stands as a testament to the wrongs which had been done to African-Americans during the Jim Crow era. I would recommend Black Like Me to anyone interested in investigating how white people perceived and treated African-Americans in the South prior to the Civil Rights Movement in the US.",
                    "BLACK LIKE ME is a classic in every form and needs to be a mandatory read in today's high schools. It totally mirrors the struggles we, as african-americans, face even today. My sister gave me this book when I had nothing else to read, and I'm glad she did. I bought my own copy to have and share with others. If only others would put themselves in our positions, as Mr. Griffin did. Then, at least, the understanding could begin, and that is a great beginning in itself.",
                    "this book made me realize that there was more to the civil rights movement than what was taught to me in my years of history class in elementary, middle and high school. its a really good book that tells of john griffin's personal experiences as a black man in the south. i never would have known of the many things blacks went through if i hadn't read this book. i strongly reccommend this book to everyone.",
                    "John Howard Griffin's Black Like Me is the best book that I have read in years. I admire his nerve for being so gutsy. He now knows what we dark skinned people have been putting up with for 400 years. I learned something valuable: The white people were more afraid of their friends, peers and family members than they were the dark-skinned people. He took a risk of losing his health to feel what we have always felt.I admire him for his courage and compassion for the love he had for others.Now, do you know if Mr. John Howard Griffin is still alive?The ending left me wondering what happened to his family after they were forced to move to Mexico.",
                    "John Howard Griffin's nonfiction story Black Like Me tells of this white man's firsthand account of dealing with racism in the deep south. This experiment of changing from the white race to the black race took place in the 1960s' when the United States was facing severe racial conflicts. He migrated to southern cities in search of knowing how it feels to be hated and discriminated against just because of his color. He encountered hate that he never knew existed changing from one race to another in a matter of several minutes. He soon learned what real hate feels like, and that it was not easy being a Negro in the south during this time. John Griffin's experience taught him many important lessons. He learned that their ministers preach sin and hell just as much as his, have the same puritanical background as his, and many more of the same qualities and ethical thoughts about life. He is trying to say that we are all equal, no matter the color of our skin and flesh. You should not judge a man by his race, but by the quality and depth of his true character and soul. He is stressing that Negroes should not be treated badly or unfairly just because of the simple fact that they are a Negro. Overall, he wants people to know that a black man is just as much of a man as a white one, and one day he has a dream that whites and blacks can live together without discrimination and hate. This firsthand account happened in the late 50's and early 60's in the deep south of the United States. It took place in several cities such as New Orleans, Louisiana and Jackson, Mississippi. It was experienced when the US was having racial problems such as the assassination of a Negro leader, and the morbid conflicts between the two dominant races. This book keeps the reader interested by making you wonder what will happen next, strange settings, and unbelievable encounters with racists. By embarking on this journey with Mr. Griffin, the reader feels as if they were rig! ht there, and they may even feel sympathy for him. At the end of the story you feel as if you know John like a close friend. After all, he shares with you an experience of a lifetime. I recommend this book to anyone interested in true stories and history. Though, I would not recommend it to children because of its profane language. Overall, I enjoyed this book because it tells of a man's pain and triumphs dealing with this hatred of the south. It also tells of a man's struggle to defeat this terrible fear that Negroes had to deal with. Finally, this story touched the depths of my heart because it made me realize that people really do endure this kind of unfair and unjust treatment.",
                    "Although some of the things that Griffin faced as a &quot;black&quot; man have changed (we no longer have separate drinking fountains or different lavoratories for blacks and whites), the subtleties of racism still pervade our culture, so Griffin's book remains pertinent. I was intrigued, among other things, to see Griffin changing shades of skin color to flip back and forth from the &quot;white man&quot; to &quot;black man&quot; appearances, recording the marked differences in the way apparently polite people displayed their true feelings when they suddenly saw him as a member of the &quot;other&quot; race. This is an easy book to recommend, and I only wish Griffin were still around to update his comments and give his observations of how America appears now compared to four decades ago; (his experimentation as a negro took place in 1959).",

This really happened folks.",
                    "Black Like Me is an incredible true story. The author, John Howard Griffin, conducted an experiment in which he found out what it was like to be a black man living in the south in the 1950's. Griffin went through some medical procedures to turn his skin color from white to black, and traveled to the south with no plans but to examine the day-to-day life of an African American, and to keep records of his experiences. Griffin's experiences are educational and very shocking. I read about aspects of African-American life that I never even would fathom. For instance, Griffin often saw examples of African Americans who obviously despised their God-given skin color, and this was evident through the choices they made and the ways they treated other blacks. The accounts were so real that I was scared to think that parts of our country, namely the Deep South, were so corrupt only fifty years ago. Also, it was riveting to read the comparison between how the same people without knowledge of Griffin's experiment would treat him first as a white, then a black. The \"African American Griffin\", if you will, was treated with complete hatred and contempt from the majority of the whites he associated with. Griffin also became a target by white supremacists once they found out what he had done, calling him a traitor against whites. Not only was Griffin's experiment was just as physically exigent as it was mentally. Griffin was constantly under an immense amount of stress in the mental power struggle between whites and blacks at the time. I would recommend this book for anyone readers interested in African American literature. This book was definitely an eye-opener for me and was an incredible depiction of Southern America's views on African Americans in that era.",
                    "I loved black like me. It was a wonderful story that really opened my eyes to what life used to be like, and made me thankful that life has changed so much since then.",
                    "Here's something that often makes me laugh...People who seem to have no Black friends, don't know any Black people other than at a distance (say in another department at work), have none in their social circle and who have no knowledge of 'Black' history, the history of racist thought and practice or its persistent legacy of discrimination are quick to say those magic words:'I'm not racist'.I've observed this many, many, many times. It often precedes 'but...' and someone saying something that often reveals staggering ignorance. Now I'm no mind reader but I would ask the question of anyone who says 'I'm not racist' - how do you know?We all have opinions that we would do well to examine from time to time. I've heard people from different ethnic groups, countries etc say the most stupid things imaginable about 'other' people and even themselves. Men say stupid things about women, women say stupid things about men. Let's face it - stupidity is common currency all over the world.This book, if honestly read and understood, is an antidote to the abject stupidity of racism.",
                    "I picked this up completely on a whim after hearing someone mention it online. It is absolutely an amazing work. To really get a feel for how far this country has come in 50 short years, and to really understand how far we have left to go, you need to read this.As a white male, I've always been offended by the term 'white privilege', because it implies that I somehow didn't work for what I have. But having read this, I can finally appreciate it. My 'white privilege' has nothing to do with me not working hard and not deserving the things that I have accomplished. I have worked hard, and I do deserve those things.But these are things that blacks never had the opportunity to do. No matter how smart they were, no matter how well dressed, or well spoken, no matter how *white* they tried to appear to blend in, they would never be given the opportunity to prove themselves on their own merits. Their opportunities were taken away before they ever had a chance to even attempt to do grab them.And while I can definitely appreciate how far we have come in a relatively short time, I am now able to see with a fresh new perspective the things that are still wrong with our thinking today.",
                    "As I write this review I have my old copy of Black Like Me in front of me. It's a Panther paperback, printed in 1964, bought by my parents, and found by my sister and myself on their shelves a few years later. I can still remember the shock when I read this, at the age of perhaps eleven, at realizing just how inhuman people could be because of something as seemingly trivial as skin colour.Griffin spent a little over a month--parts of November and December, 1959--with his skin artificially darkened by medication. In that time he traveled through Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, finding out at first hand what it is like to be treated as a second-class citizen--or, as he says, as a tenth-class citizen. Everyone now know the story of the big injustices, the lynchings, the civil rights cases, and for most people those are now just another page in the history text book. Griffin's experiences take the daily evils of racism and thrust them in your face, just as they were thrust in his--the rudeness of the clerk when he tried to pay for a train ticket with a big bill; the difficulty he had in finding someone who would cash a traveler's check for a Negro; the bus-driver who wouldn't let any blacks off the bus to use the restrooms; the white man who followed him at night and threatened to mug him.I've heard people worry that this is the white experience of racism: that whites can read this book and feel good because a white person felt the pain too. I'm white, so I don't know that I can judge that argument completely impartially, but I can tell you that this book profoundly shaped my views on racism, and that any book that can do what this book did for me is a book that is good to have around.One more thing. I've said a lot about how powerful, and how influential the book is. I should add that it is also a gripping story. Though Griffin only spends a month with dark skin, by the time you finish the book it feels like an eternity.A wonderful read, and a truly amazing story.",
                    "John Howard Griffin offered one of the most important contributions to the Civil Rights movement when his work Black Like Me was published in 1960. Griffin approached his study on race relations in the South by asking a very poignant question: &quot;If a white man became a Negro in the Deep South, what adjustments would he have to make?.&quot; To answer this question, Griffin shaved his head and had his skin temporarily darkened by medical treatments and stain in order to travel through parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia as a black man.Griffin had a deep understanding of discrimination even before he began this ambitious project. As a medic in the French Resistance Army, Griffin helped evacuate Austrian Jews away from the advancing Nazis. During the Second World War, Griffin lost his sight and was forced to live with this disability for over ten years. By 1959, Griffin was a published author and a specialist on race relations. Despite such credentials Griffin &quot;really knew nothing of the Negro's real problem.&quot; Only by becoming black did Griffin understand what it was like to live as a second class citizen in &quot;the land of the free.&quot;As a black man, Griffin described the variations and similarities of race relations in different areas of the South. Although some states were more &quot;enlightened&quot; than others, blatant acts of racism were found almost everywhere Griffin went.In Alabama, where Martin Luther King first introduced passive resistance, Griffin endured the hate stares from whites and observed that even graduates from Tuskegee Institute would not be allowed to climb the social ladder in the South because, &quot;whites cannot lose to a traditionally servant class.&quot; Finally, while traveling to the otherwise enlightened city of Atlanta, the simple act of a bus driver saying &quot;Watch your step&quot; as his passengers filed out was only reserved for whites.Even more interesting than these experiences was the way in which Griffin was allowed to converse with blacks and whites on racial matters. Understandably, blacks were highly suspicious of whites and were often inclined to play &quot;the stereo-typed role of the 'good Negro'&quot; when around whites to survive in white southern society. As a &quot;black&quot; man, Griffin enjoyed a rare glimpse of how blacks really regarded segregation beyond the white propaganda. He also discovered the ways in which blacks assisted and supported each other against the perils of racism. In other cases, Griffin observed blacks who were ashamed of their race and who would denounce other blacks for their darker skin or shabby clothes. As a &quot;black&quot; man, Griffin also saw a side of whites that would otherwise be hidden if he had met them as a fellow white man. His experiences with whites while hitchhiking through Mississippi are particularly intriguing.Despite his experiences, Griffin was surprisingly fair in his analysis. While the reader may despise the hate-filled whites in his story, Griffin did not stoop to the racist's level by denying them their humanity. Instead, Griffin made it a point to see the whites in other roles-as a parent, grandparent, church leader, and loyal neighbor. He also realized that whites who may have been sympathetic towards their African American neighbors, were pressured by southern society to continue segregation. In his epilogue, Griffin was even critical of fellow white freedom fighters who often failed to consult with black community leaders on the race issue.Griffin's work was a landmark for his time, but weaknesses in his study were present. Griffin visited the larger cities of the South; however, a comparison of race relations between the major cities and the countryside may have created a more complete study as would a visit to other states in the South. A better explanation was needed regarding Griffin's practice of alternating his role as a black man and a white man by scrubbing the stain off his skin. At first, the reader may assume that the author could no longer handle the discrimination and longed to enter the South as a first class citizen again. Later, Griffin maintained that he was studying how the reactions of blacks and whites reversed themselves as he changed his skin color. Both reasons are valid; however, if a need to be white again was the primary explanation than an important point was made: An educated and worldly white man could barely survive in six weeks what a black person must endure every moment of his life.",
                    "It is said one cannot understand or empathize with someone else unless &quot;you walk a mile in their mocassins.&quot; John Howard Griffin did just that, darkened his skin and took a walk into the Deep South to see how it would feel to be a member of a despised minority during 1959, the height of the Jim Crow years, when water fountains and rest rooms were separate for the races, when a black man or woman couldn't eat in a restaurant or get a hotel room. (It is said Bessie Smith, the great blues singer, died after a car accident because she couldn't be treated at a nearby hospital, for whites only.)The book is of course dated, but it is unique in that it is a viewpoint that is undeniably credible. Here is a white guy, saying: &quot;It happened to me, just because my skin was dark. Believe it.&quot; He suffers the indignity of finding everyday tasks that become almost insurmountable--to find a restroom, a bus seat, a park bench, someplace to eat, to be left alone with out fear of harrassment. And it's this harrassment and outright fear that changes Griffin to the point he had to finally abandon his project. He was changed by it.The question I have is what would someone who chose Griffin's experiment find today? While Jim Crow is gone, the cultures still have a gulf between them. And since today, you won't see the &quot;whites only&quot; sign on drinking fountains that I saw as a child traveling in the Deep South, you should be sure to read this to get perspective on our history and culture. This is a brave book.",
                    "Originally published in 1961, Black Like Me is the account of how white journalist John Howard Griffin had his skin medically darkened and traveled through the Deep South as a black man in an attempt to explain the hardships black people in the South faced. It also covers the backlash against the publication of his story.Black Like Me is a concise, fast and engaging read. The reader is often able to see things through Griffin's eyes, even as Griffin tries to see things through the eyes of others. He does an excellent job communicating the cultures of fear and despair he encountered. The entire account of his travels as a black man is riveting.If there is any nit-picking to be done, let it be for this: at times, particularly early on, Griffin's descriptions of mundane, everyday objects and details seem forced and do not aid the narrative.While today's racial tensions are much less overt (and much less publicized), Black Like Me still has quite a bit to say about the universal elements of human nature and the culture of racism.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",
                    "There are only a few books that have really given me a deeper understanding into the issues of the world around us. This book is one of them.John Howard Griffin penetrates into a world that seems almost beyond belief and yet is undeniably and startlingly real. Realizations await on every page to show that the generally sheltered cultural perspective of the typical white (like myself) could not conceive the situation which confronted blacks in the south every day just a very few years ago -- as experienced by a white man who changed his skin color and dealt with the consequences.The book is made even better by a series of stories about his experiences after returning to the world of caucausions and going on the lecture circuit about the plight of blacks in the south. He demonstrates the rationalization and close mindedness that characterizes even those who consider themselves &quot;good people&quot;.This book would probably be too much to accept if not for the authors remarkably unassuming and explanatory style. Rarely has such a sore subject been confronted so directly and yet so plainly.Highly recommended. I keep having to buy new copies because people will read a few pages and want a copy.",
                    "Black Like Me by John Howard Griffin should be required reading for America. It challenges and troubles the reader. Mr. Griffin's bravery in embarking upon such a strange quest is most appreciated yet puzzling. The information he gleaned about the deeper aspects of African-American life in racially-divided America is on target. Instead of glossing over the realities of the plight of a brown-skinned person in America, he confronted it head on. I wonder if I will ever see an America that could read and discuss such a book with a deep desire to understand another person's world?Barbara Peters, Author (Adulterous Heart ISBN:978=1442188105)",

                    "&quot;Black Like Me&quot; has to be one of the most accomplished books of all time by John Howard Griffin. This nonfictional piece of literature begins with Griffin, a Caucasian, pigmenting his skin to a darker brown, a color resembling that of an African-American, in order to feel what it's like to be an African-American. His destination proceeds throughout the South where he records his real-life experiences and encounters with other African-Americans as well as Caucasians. The transformation of his skin pigment leads him to face the discrimination and prejudice from Caucasians yet allows him to feel a sense of unity among the rest of the African-Americans. The differences of Griffins &quot;two lives&quot; (one being white and the other black) contrasts greatly. As a white, Griffin automatically had the opportunity of entering restaurants, shows, and other places without a problem. He remained healthy, physically, emotionally, and mentally. On the other hand, his life as a black made him lose the opportunities of a white, and therefore, Griffin became emotionally, physically, and mentally unhealthy. What does the large contrast between two lives of the same person with a different shade of skin show about human beings? Even though Griffin's experiences took place forty years ago, this book allows us to question whether society has improved and changed or not. In some ways, I believe it has, but in others, the traditional ways have dominated improvement. Unless you are a victim of prejudice today, one can finally perceive how brutal and painful prejudice and discrimination are through the mind of a white man battling the everlasting war of racism within society. -A.H., 16, IL",
                    "I read Black Like Me because the picture on the cover intrigued me. I think now I am a better person for having read it. Just like Mr. Griffin confronted his own prejudice when looking at his reflection in the mirror, I realized too that I might be harboring baseless stereotypes. The fact that a white man darkening his skin color meant that he had to walk miles to eat or drink just forty years ago is astounding and sickening at the same time. People that are easily angered by acts of segregation or intolerance may not want to read this book because there are several instances of blind hatred. White truckers would offer John rides at night only to ask inappropriate questions about his sex life. A bus driver refused to let the black passengers off to use the restroom on a trip. I am not sure I would want to experience what life must have been like for a black person in those times. However, I am glad that John Howard Griffin did. The fact that the author happened to be extremely talented at his practice makes the reading that much better. I think everyone should read this book at some point in their lives...black, white, brown, old, or young. There are few books that can alter your day to day living, and this is one of them.",
                    "John Griffin takes a big step in braking the barrier between the blacks and the whites. He put his life on the line in an attempt to bring the two races together. What Griffin learned quick as a black man was, \"An important part of my daily life was spent searching for the basic things that all whites take for granted: a place to eat, or somewhere to find a drink of water, a rest room, somewhere to wash my hands.\" When a white person is using the rest room or washing their hands, they never think about how hard this is for a black man. Another thing that the white people do not realize is how hurtful their stares are, and how much those stares say. Griffin learned that the color of his skin was the only thing that made a difference.John Griffin formatted this book in the form of a day to day journal. This helped show a day in the life of a black man. Black Like Me showed what it was like in different areas of the Deep South, and how actions changed in different areas. This book was a lot different from other books about the Deep South because the author experienced it from both sides. Not only did John Griffin's skin color change, he was also changed on the inside. One thing that makes this book even more startling is that he could have been killed in this whole process.",
                    "I read Black Like Me for an American Literature class at my boarding school and really enjoyed it. The reason I picked this book was because the very concept caught me and interested me and I had not heard of something like this before, so I chose it to find out exactly what it was like. The topic was interesting, which right away can account for a good book but that is clearly not the only reason that I thought that Black Like Me was good. John Howard Griffin, the author, Narrator, and main character of the book goes further than most people would even think to go, especially for someone in his period of time. After the publication of the contents of Black Like Me Jack was terrorized by people who called him a 'traitor to the white race'. John Howard Griffin is a writer who decides that the best way to show people that there is heavy racism is to experience it for himself and then report on it. So he does, at probably the most dangerous time period to do so, and with permission from some magazine people undergoes a process to become black and then travels throughout the south, experiencing black life.The part that sets Black Like Me apart from other novels like it is some of the points it makes clear to the reader. The most noticable of which to me was the idea that no matter how aware a person thinks that they are in regards to racism in the south, they will never even begin to fathom such a horrible experience unless they go through it themselves. And the reader comes to notice that even while John Howard Griffin is a black southerner he cannot completely understand the pain that black southerners experienced as a result of racism. From the start of the book Griffin at least aknowledges the existence of racism in the south and even believes that he might have a grasp on what it would be like to be a black person living in the south. But what he finds is what makes this book interesting, the things Griffin experiences just as result of the change of pigmentation in his skin are startling and shocking and provoke some pretty startling revelations. I would probably reccomend Black Like Me to any one who thinks they know what happened in the south in regards to african americans, and I also would reccomend it to anyone who has any doubts as to what kinds of horrors african americans experienced in the south. People who read this book will probably need somewhat of a sence of empathy in order to be able to understand this book, and the people that need this book the most would probably not care or not understand that any of the events in this book should not have occurred, so this book's purpose may be long lost. This book will probably change the way you look at life and increase your respect for other people.",
                    "I live in the midst of Detroit, a white male, and I cannot imagine the horrors that this book reveal. It's an astounding read. Buy it. It's an eye opener to the way things WERE in the old south (still are in some respects) ~Andy",
                    "Black Like Me written by John Howard Griffin was a very captivating novel. It brought to many people's attention the extream condition of segregation, and discrimination. Griffins way of getting into this inside world was something that no one had ever done, this in my eyes took a lot of guts and not to mention research. Like a few other authors Griffins way of explaining this owrld to his readers was astonishing. Griffins use of dialect and blending in with the local color was the first think that cought the readers attention. Right away to blend in with the Black community Griffin took on their dialect, he began using slang and other forms of speech. Also he started to blend in culturaly, Griffin attempted to find the places in the French Quarter of New Orleans where the locals went. This right away brought me into the story because it made it so real and life like, you almost forgot that he was originally white and just assuming a role to get a story.Another interesting part of John Howard Griffins novel was his ability to define sybolism. He would find little things along the way that would mean something to him, and even in the end he would never forget them. For example the shoe-shiner who on the first day of Griffins being in New Orleans made him feel right at home by sharing with him the little food he had with him and teaching him how to grill it. To Griffin this symbolized the black communities ability to allow any person in to their culture unlike the white who shuned that kind of behavior. This showed how well Griffin was at looking at things deeply which helped the reader to further understand what was going on in Griffins novel.Finally John Howard Griffin's Black Like Me showed realism extreamly well. He was able to take a story plot that most people could not think of being real. I mean come on, someone dying their skin to become black and blend in with their culture, ya right. But Griffin did, and did it well. It was almost too beleivable, he fit in like a real black man visiting on vacation. He acted like the townspeople, spoke like them and yes looked like them too. He looked so much like a black person that when he went home his family could not recognize him, and his neighbors began to treat him poorly because they believed he was black. I have never read anything as amazing as this novel.John Howard Griffin I believe started a revolution and helped further the compleation of the civil rights movement by proving to people further just how bad our society had gotten about discrimination. I belieave that everyone should read this book to get a new perspective on minority groups. This book will amaze everyone who reads it",
                    "I got my hands on the book when I was in high school 11 years ago. Because of its relevance to South Africa's race issues, it was stolen from me. I invested in another copy because I could not get the message contained in it off my mind. If you are a South African, this is an ABSOLUTE must!!!",
                    "As a caucasian American, I don't know what it is like to live as an African American in the United States, day in and day out. I have rarely experienced direct or indirect racism. Perhaps I never will. And for that reason, I can never truly relate to the racism experienced by people who are not caucasian. This book provides a place to start, however. Without it, I think many may be tempted to say, \"surely that never happens,\" or \"I'm sure it's not that bad.\" It is a sad testimony to our country that it took a white person writing a book like this (instead of just listening to those already experiencing racism) to wake us up, but at least it has served its purpose. As I read the book (which is a very quick read) I felt like I was riding along with Griffin in the South and walking the roads with him. I don't know how he maintained his composure during some of the situations he found himself in. I respect what he did, especially considering the hate he experienced both during and after his \"experiement.\"In conclusion, I wonder what would happen if someone did this again, in the year 2000. Given what I've read by African American authors and heard from black friends, I don't know if it would be all that different. Perhaps the racism wouldn't be as blatant. But all in all, not very different.",
                    "It was the best book i ever read. it was good when it came to the parts where black and whites were not treated equal and it make me feel like i was in the book. I reccommend it to everyone!",

I picked up Black Like Me and stated reading it. I couldn't put the book down for a second! It made me feel ashamed to be a &quot;white&quot; person and relise just how cruel the human race can be. I have been researching the topic and discovering many terrible things &quot;whites&quot; did - and still do sometimes - to native people, immigrants, even our neighbours.",
                    "I am a 13 years old, and we read this in school. It is usually difficult to find a book I will really be interested in, but I couldn't put this down until I finished the assignment! I had to read, read, read, but then I read all I was allowed to, so I stopped. This book in one word I will describe as EXCELLENT!",
                    "I read this book for the first time as a teenager in the 70's. As a young white boy living in the south, I don't think it would have been possible to come close to understanding the fear and hatred that blacks experienced on a daily basis without this man's book bringing it to life for me. For those who have made racial comments of hatred concerning this great work, I (and many others) can simply pity their ignorance and pray that God will grant them the enlightenment that could change their lives forever. I recommend this book to people of all color.",

                    "Black Like Me was easy and hard to read. Easy in terms of its length and writing style, hard because of the issues it dealt with. Every time I read it, it left me feeling a little unsettled, but in a good, constructive way. Though many people say that Griffin writes about a time long past, and that much progress has been made today, it is undeniable that racism still exists to different degrees, and also against other minority races. Most people do not have the courage to do what Griffin did in order to try to understand the situation. My only regret is that I would've liked to know more about how his wife and children dealt with the situation, especially in the aftermath of the publication of this book.",
                    "Black Like Me by John Howard Griffin is a book that explores racism in the deep south of America in the 1960's. I thought that it was very thought provoking. It really hits your emotions. Whenever someone starts being rude to Mr. Griffin just because he's black makes me so angry. This book really shows it how it is. It is a true story of a real man who temporarily turns himself black. During the book so many people treat him like dirt, and it's all because of his skin color. They don't even know him, they just take one look at him and categorize him. I never realized how much of a problem racism was. Mr. Griffin goes to so many different places, and I thought that was the hardest part of the book. I got confused on where he was and when. I don't think where he is, is as important as the experiences though. I think that this book is great for any race and gender. It teaches you valuable lessons. I think that people should start reading it in middle school. Eighth and ninth grade is about the age when everyone starts to form their own opinions. That's a good time in life to be taught that racism is wrong. Everyone should read this touching journey at some point in their lifetime.",
                    "I'm teaching this book to my high school literature class. I believe this book should be required reading for all high school students. The author's willingness to expose himself to this difficult experiment and his vulnarability in writing about it should not be missed. We should all be so willing to \"walk a mile in the other person's shoes\".",
                    "5+ stars for this true story of a man who dared to reveal the horrors of our nation we try to hide. What a heroic task for a man not only to investigate the truth behind the racism toward the black race but also to publish the entire investigation and findings. This book aroused more emotion in me than any other book I've read. The fact that this horrific story is non-fiction makes this book a necessity to be read by all Americans. Truly a righteous attempt to bring the truth of racism to light. A victory for all who oppose racism!!",
                    "I've read this twice--once in high school, once in my 40's and had the same reaction both times! I was in total awe of Griffin's bravery of taking on this challenge to become &quot;black&quot; and letting us share his experience and &quot;awakening&quot; us to our social problems still alive today. I've been in the south in the early in the mid '80s and the early '90s and was totally upset with the attitude of prejudice and bias. I see this almost daily where I live in different forms and don't appreciate it.I wish Griffin was still alive today as this well written novel could yet be updated still.I found in &quot;Black Like Me&quot; me cheering for Griffin, verbally advising him not to go into this area or that one, wanting him to &quot;rescue&quot; as many of his brothers and sisters and bring them to safety, out of prejudices way.The only question I have is, &quot;Is there such a safe place?&quot;",
                    "Black Like Me extracted a gamut of emotions from me; at times I was extremely proud that John Griffin wanted to understand the reality of living in black skin. While on the other hand I thought why what are we (black people) a science project.Clearly as you read the book your questions change and your initial emotions are either magnified or remain the same. One question blanketed me throughout the book, why leave your privileged life to walk in the shoes of a black man or any minority?This classical non-fiction journal of the writers experience was captivating and educational. Walking behind Johns' eyes allowed me to see my people and the actions of others in a different light. The author captures the accents and slang in such a way I could hear the characters speaking.It is my hope that many different people will read Black Like Me, and realize that people are \"human individuals\" the actions of some or one does not represent the total race.Missy",
                    "The intro of this book was quite slow, but the pace started getting faster as it got into the experiment and the problems got harder for this author. It is so realistic how this is the only way to learn about another race. That is if you actually become the race.",
                    "Black Like Me was an incredibly true story about the auther, John Griffen, who decided he wanted to find out how black people live. So, he changed his skin pigmentation to black. Then he went down south to places like St. Louis, and all over Texas and Louisiana to see how southerners have changed there opinions about racism. Every three pages showed a new story on how his life was changed and how people judged him about his color instead of his character. This is a classic novel, and it obviously takes a real dedicated author to go through changing his skin, leaving his family, and moving from the rich life to the poor life, to write good book. Although sometimes it droned on, it usually caught my attention enough to keep on reading. I would recomend this book to anybody who enjoys American History and Biographys.",

I found the plot to be interesting, but if your mind wanders while you read, don't read this book. The plot of Black Like Me takes very careful thought and comprehension, but to the reader who can shut out all other thoughts and sounds, this book will be excellent!!",
                    "I just finished Black Like Me. When I picked up this book I thought that the title was a very strange thing. I know Griffin is white so why would the book be called that? Well after I read the book I can totally understand why he did what he did and why the book is called what it is. I think that the book is a way to really show what it was like for blacks in the US so long ago. It is a horrible thing. The book teaches a lesson of horrible brutality on the part of Americans. Why be horrible to people just because of the pigment of their skin? Well that is what happened. When I read the book I thought this discrimination is horrible and I am hope it never happens again. Then I realized we have discrimination today all the time. The biggest example is gay people. When you read this book think of why Griffin did this. He turned his life upside down just to tell people what the blacks had to live through. All I had to do was read the book but he lived the book. If you read it then think about that. It was an eye opener and is very well written. My advice for the book is to read it slowly and you will love it. Believe me, I did.",
                    "I have read a lot of books some I liked, some were okay, and other I would never tell anyone to read it. I feel that black like me goes into all three areas. Some parts more then others I really liked the book. It showed how life is different between blacks and whites. John shows that it has to take a lot out ofa person to change their life like that. It must have taking a lot of weeks even months to come to the decision of changing your skin color, home, and family. Near the middle of the book John really starts to show how much he miss his family, and mainly miss his old life. Threw out the book John meets all different people. Some white, but must are black. The reason for John doing this is because he wants to find out why blacks and whites do not get along mainly so must in the south. Really going down and digging up dirt. After John is there for just a few weeks he starts to see all the hate with in the whites. Hate on how blacks can only go into a few restaurant, and only use bathrooms that have signs on them saying that blacks cna use that bathroom. The real challenge comes when John get back from his trip. It starts right before the book is going to come out. John wanted everyone to know what he did and how he felt and get through it so he want on talk shows to talk about everything. John get a lot of support for all around the world. The one place that you think would gave him the must support did not, his town. John's town hated him for what he did. the people threaten him and everyone in his family. Local stores would not help or serve him. People in the town, neighbors, and some friends will not talk to John. One group of people planned to attack John ans his family. So they had to stay with one family who would still talk to them. At John's daughter's school the same group lite a cross on fire. John saod that he wishes they would have burned the cross when he was home just so that the children would not have to see that. John trys to get on with his life but things just keep on going. No matter what he does he can not get passed it. there caomes a time when John has had all he can take so him and his family moves. I think that the book is good. I feel that everyone should read some part of the book just to see how things are different. A lot of thing have changed from that time and our time. It is good to see just how hard it was for people to get along.",

Nobody can deny that it is priceless, a first-hand historical account of what it's like being black in the Deep South--by an outsider, a white man turned black by artificial and deliberate means. This book is about suffering, so I cannot say that I enjoyed it. I am, however, glad that I read it. The major downfall, however, is that it is in diary form at not as poignant and moving as it could have been.",
                    "This book was hard to get into. I was surprised at the difference in how people treated him when he was white vs. when he was black. I think it is so sad that racism is still alive. I know we don't live in a perfect world, but I just don't understand how people can continue to treat certain people with less respect only on the basis of skin color.This book was recommended to me by a professor from my graduate program. I think everyone would benefit from reading this book and taking time to reflect on your own beliefs, attitudes, and actions.",
                    "This book offers a unique perspective of racial tensions in the 1950s. John Griffin did the only thing that could be done, in order to capture views from both sides. However, the concept was more interesting to me than the actual story. Of course the main reason for this was that ,as Griffin mentions, he decided to stay out of the most hostile areas of the deep south so he wouldn't be risking his life. Anyone would have made the same decision, but I believe the choice to stay in better areas also cost him parts of the story. The last couple of chapters of aftermath are also disjointed and lead up to a weak conclusion.",
                    "This book was very compelling read, it really helped me understand what it was like to be black in the 50's. Anyone who has difficulty understanding how the black race was treated needs to read this book because it is wonderful and very accurate in telling of how people were treated in that time. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone!",

How could these products be safe! Where there after effects?2. Sometimes the book comes across as an endorsement of Catholicism. Griffin often argues that blacks were more accepted in his view in Catholic communities in America. Although I disagree with this argument, as evidenced by Catholic communities in New York and Boston.",

At several points in the book the author would have one believe that he was able transform from black to white and back to black again in a single day with only the help of some dye and some soap. Not believable at all. This is just one white man's perspective about what it was like being black in that time and location. I think I'll look for a similar book written by a black man/woman.",

He dyed his skin black, shaved his head and took some medicine to protect his skin from the dye. His whole book is a journal. I thought it was pretty good. I never knew that there was that much racism in America. I liked the book because it is uncut and really full of history. I think that if an 8th grader likes History or is interested in black history, this would be a good book for them. It is a great book for a Social Studies teacher who is making their class study the 1950's and/ or black history.",

What would it be like to trade places with someone that is completely opposite of you? How would life be, if people treated you differently because of your color? ... This man made a big sacrifice, but at the same time a discovery. He left his everyday life, family, and home to go and see what it was like to be treated differently because of race. He didn't go walking down the streets just as he was. He had gotten his skin darkened to fit in. He went from being white to black. He did something that not many people would do.

                    "\"Black Like Me\", originally published in 1960, is an autobiographical diary written and narrated in first-person by novelist John Howard Griffin. In the book Griffin, a white middle-aged journalist and specialist in race issues, chooses to leave his plush and privileged life-style in Texas to tour the Deep segregated South as a \"Negro\". His quest: to find out, \"What is it like to experience discrimination based on skin color, something over which one has no control?\" (p.7).Griffin, the protagonist in this true story, undergoes a medical treatment to temporarily darken his skin in order to disguise himself as a black man in hopes of \"learn[ing] the truth\" and \"bridg[ing] the gap\" (p.7) between the two races. Making several stops in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Georgia over a six-week period of time, Griffin chronicles his enthralling saga and gives his readers his personal, firsthand accounts of the struggles and prejudices that he and many \"nameless Negroes\" encountered in the infernal world of racial segregation in 1959.Griffin's nonfiction prose is one that cannot fit precisely into any particular category: His knack for turning a rather didactic documentary into an engrossing \"non-fiction novel\" ebulliently fortifies my love for him as a writer and entices me to read more of his work.Noting the author's creative writing style as a definite strength, I would have to say his weakness was the usage of big ambiguous words, which did not contribute to the author's message. For example, on p.68, the author writes, \"Canned jazz blared through the street with a monstrous high-strutting rhythm that pulled at the viscera.\" Viscera, is just another way of saying gut or intestines. If it were not for the context clues present in this book, I would have been lost in translation.",

As I look around at our society now, I wonder that we have come from that mindset to the election of President Obama. I applaud the courageous beings who have pushed for the betterment of all mankind.

                    "Published in December 2011 by AudioGORead by Ray ChildsDuration: approximately 7 hours.In 1959, John Howard Griffin (1920-1980), an author and journalist decided to go check out the serious rumblings of the Civil Rights movement for himself. Griffin was white and he decided to medically darken his skin (and smooth out the rough spots with dye and shave his head) and go as a black man. His plan was to see if things truly were different on the other side of the color line.The book is a novelization of his experiences (meaning things were edited and re-arranged to make the story work better) and it starts with him pitching his idea to a publisher and his family. Once he gets funding and permission from his family (after a lot of serious talk about how dangerous this could be) Griffin heads off to New Orleans for his medical treatments. He picks New Orleans because of its more liberal racial attitudes, figuring that it would be easier for him to learn the new rules and expectations (if there were any) in a more forgiving environment. He tours the city, both black and white areas as a white man and once his transformation is complete he makes the same trips as a black man.Griffin discovers that the world was indeed a different place for a black man in the south in 1959. He was denied entry to most places. He was routinely given what he called the \"hate stare\" by complete strangers, and had great difficulty with the basics of life such as getting something to drink and finding a restroom. He was coached in the basics by a shoeshine man named Sterling that he had befriended as a white customer. Sterling was astounded by the change and fearful for Griffin's life if he was ever found out. But, Sterling's lessons become the first real introduction that Griffin and the readers get to the differences between life as a black man and life as a white man.Griffin spends quite a bit of time in New Orleans and details a lot of inequities in housing, eateries, stores, hotels and so on. In fact, just about the only place that gives Griffin an even break is a Catholic book store. Griffin decides to travel to Mississippi to visit an area that had had a recent lynching. He also hitchhiked across Alabama, visited Atlanta. He experiences city life, rural life and everywhere there is the pervasive presence of racism. Griffin's prose is oftentimes moving. He commented at the beginning of the book that this book was written quickly and not very polished. Griffin completely underestimated the power of his writing - it may have been quick, but it was very well done.This edition includes an epilogue written for the 2nd edition of the book printed in 1977. The epilogue details the dangers suffered by Griffin after the publication of Black Like Me in 1961 and his usefulness as an intermediary between white and black members of communities throughout the U.S. However, the epilogue does not end on a hopeful note as Griffin is quite frustrated with the slow pace of racial reconciliation in America. He died in 1980 so we do not know what he would have thought about how things have gone in the last 30 years.The audiobook reader, Ray Childs, does a masterful job with dialects, creating new voices (voices of different races and different sexes from different regions - all done perfectly). He reads the text with great effect and helps to make many poignant scenes even more profound.With the exception of just a few minutes of the description of Atlanta (not being from Atlanta, I found the recital of African American neighborhoods and the lengthy listing of their community leaders a bit dry) this is a moving book that pulls the listener in and keeps the listener listening.",
                    "This book was read by a teacher to the class when I was in elementary school. Never did I forget the impact this book made on me. When I found it for my kindle, I had to have it. So pleased to have this and to reread it again.",
                    "This is a view into a world that I cannot know any other way. Sadly, although there have been many improvements since this was written, the same struggles remain. I wish every adult in the USA would read this and refelect on the changes that they can make, within themseleves and the community around them.",
                    "The events in this book happened in my lifetime. And in my country.That a little bit of dye could turn a productive, accepted citizen into a sub-citizen is just amazing. John Griffin's tale of his life in the South as a white and black man gives the best glimpse of what life was like for blacks that I have ever read. His impressions of New Orleans and Mobile as a white and black man are the simple words that will pick up the reader and shake him.Even more shocking- after all the books I was forced to read in high school and college, this was never on a reading list. I have been assigned books and articles that dealt with man's inhumane treatment of his fellow man in Germany, Africa, Asia...but never stuff that happened right in my own back yard.So if you are interested in this topic, read this book. If you are not interested in this topic, definitely read this book.The kindle edition had a few pictures that added to the experience, and a few essays added in more modern times that I could have just as soon skipped. Not that they weren't of a high quality, but they paled in their ability to communicate when compared to the main text.",
                    "Growing up in a small rural all-white Missouri town in the 1960s, I had no experience of understanding of racial issues. Blacks, or \"Negros\" as the polite word was then, weren't a part of my world other than showing up occasionally on flickering TV images. In fact, I can remember a grade school field trip to a larger city about 40 miles away that marked the first time some of my classmates ever saw a black person. (One even posed the question \"Are they that color all over?\")So what was it that inspired me to pick up a copy of John Howard Griffin's Black Like Me back in junior high school? My memory is a little hazy, but I'm sure it must have had something to do with the TV coverage of the Civil Rights movement. I remember the scenes of marchers being beaten with batons and having police dogs and fire hoses turned on them. Like many people, those are the images that first introduced the struggles of blacks in the Southern U.S. Black Like Me was the first encounter many of us had to the horrible injustices of segregation.On its surface, Black Like Me is the story of one white man who, with the aid of drugs, sunlamps and dye, managed to turn himself black and find out first-hand what it was like to travel through the Deep South as a black man. On a deeper level, the book was an indictment of the soul-killing system that turned blacks into second-class citizens and forced whites - even those who understood that segregation was wrong - into a silent complicity with the bigots.Griffin's book can still inspire today. I was afraid that the book would not stand up well over time, but it remains relevant. In fact, it's difficult to read the book and not feel echoes and reverberations from the days of segregation even today. To read it again is to simultaneously feel pride at how far we have come and shame at how far we still have to go.Besides Griffin's powerful journal of his time spent as a black man and the immediate aftermath of his story, this edition of Black Like Me also contains a 1976 epilogue by the author that focuses on the Black Pride movement and black separatism and the author's 1979 essay, Beyond Otherness.What I found most revealing was an afterward written in 2006 by Robert Bonazzi that outlines Griffin's fascinating life story (of which Black Like Me was only one facet). I had no idea that Griffin, who studied in France as a young man, was active in helping refugees escape the Nazis. I also wasn't aware that he lost his sight during the war in the Pacific, but after several years of blindness his sight returned. Griffin's life sounds epic in scale and almost mythic.Black Like Me is one of those books that stand out as a watershed in the history of the Civil Rights movement. It can - and should - be read today and into the future for all those wanting insight into what that terrible time was like.",
                    "This was a fabulous book! A great read on race relations and the experiences of both black and white. Great learning tool for a class or for your own personal knowledge. It really puts things into perspctive!",
                    "Black Like MeBlack Like Me is a story of a white man living in Texas, who decides to go far into the Deep South. He wants to experience and write about what it was like to be a black man and how white people treated them. As a person who is of mixed race, I found Black Like Me an interesting book because it was like I could understand from both sides. What I liked about this book is that he as an individual white man actually wanted to be black and wanted to show his own race how it was like for them to treat black people that way. What I also liked about this book is how the friends that he had before did not look at him in any different way even though the color of his skin was darker then theirs. The things about this book that I like the most is that he was okay with everything that would come at him regardless if it was bad or good. He also didn't really let white people talk bad about black people. I believe that he realized that even though he is white he also believes that he is black too. For me being a mixed race with both black and white I feel he knows what its like to be a mixed race as well. What I didn't like was how some white people would try to be his friend and then after a certain discussion point they would say something ignorant or nasty about a black person. What I also didn't like was when Griffin (the main character) had gotten a ride from a white man and while they was talking the white man says that white people think that they are doing black people a favor by putting some white in their blood. Other than some down falls in the book where it was racist a lot, I believe that this was a very good book. I would recommend this book to seventh graders, because when they get into middle school and start realizing that they are from different social statuses that racial comments start to interact. I would also recommend Black Like Me to older people who want to read an interesting book. I don't think that I would change much of anything in this book because everything is real and talks a lot of how they used to live and how they were treated back then in the Deep South. I also don't think that much had changed since the 1960's up until today.",
                    "This non-fiction book is based on the experiences that John Griffin had in the deep south in the late 50's early 60's. He was a white man that had his skin artificially darkened to the point that he look like an African American. This was a very bold move of him considering how \"tense\" things were racially in this period of time.He wanted to see if and/or how he would be treated differently by his friends, family and strangers if he looked like a black man. Also to see if a white man could learn the truth about Negro. This book is kind of like a journal that he kept day by day describing his trials and tribulations. He finds it more difficult to find a job, find somewhere to eat and sleep, traveling around and even cashing his travelers checks was even becoming hard to do. People that he talked to all the time and saw just about everyday didn't even recognize him as one of their friends.Griffin was very glad and kind of amazed that he got along well with the other black men and even started to take a liking to them.If you like books about racial discrimination and personal events this book is definitely for you.",
                    "Scooter Jones' (age 13) Review of Black Like Me\"Rest at pale evening...A tall slim tree...Night coming tenderlyBlack like me.\"--Langston HughesIn 1959, John Griffin, the author of Black Like Me, used ultraviolet rays and stain to make his white skin darker. He shaved his head, took some traveler's checks, bade his wife and children goodbye, left his Texas farm, and boarded the nearest bus to Mississippi. Griffin wanted to learn whether African-Americans really had a \"'wonderfully harmonious relationship (p.7)'\" (as the Southern legislators put it) with the white people of the Southern states. He visited Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Georgia. Griffin was amazed at the things he discovered. He traveled as an African-American man for about half a year before returning home and writing Black Like Me.When I read this book in 2005, I was blown away. I had always assumed our country is one of the world's most advanced in treating all citizens equally-and I had believed that it had been this way for a long, long time. You know, there had been slaves and everything, but we'd taken care of that, like, 150 years ago. But John Griffin showed me that I was dead, dead wrong. It was like he took me by the hand and we both plunged into an alien world, quite unlike the one I know now. He led me into the segregated South. Along with him, I felt the \"hate stares\" on my back. I felt the discrimination. I felt the loathing faced by African-Americans just 45 years ago. People in America today need to read this book so that they can understand a shameful, but educational, piece of our nation's history.I really liked Black Like Me. I experienced powerfully how segregation made so much of our society off limits to to the African-American Griffin. I analyzed people's true natures based on how they treated Griffin first as white, then as black. I learned how young children had their hopes for the future robbed from them, just because of their skin color.As a white upper middle class man, Griffin never had to worry about finding simple public things such as a bathroom, a water fountain, or a park bench. After darkening his skin, Griffin asks a black man about where to find a bathroom and a church. The man says, \"'Well, man, now just what do you want to do-[pee] or pray?....Lordy, Lordy...if you stick around this town, you'll find out you're going to end up doing most of your praying for a place to [pee]...you can go in some of the stores around here, but you've almost got to buy something before you can ask them to let you use the toilet (p.24).'\" At one point, Griffin has been walking all over town and needs to rest: \"My legs gave out. At Jackson Square, a public park, I found a long, curving bench and sat down to rest for a moment...I looked to see a middle-aged white man across the park...get to his feet and amble toward me...With perfect courtesy he said,'You'd better find yourself someplace else to rest. (p. 45)'\" At this moment, Griffin and I are both amazed at how white people feel that black individuals are lower class, and forbid them to do something as simple as sit in the same park as themselves.As a black man, Griffin quickly learns that people will not give him the same courtesy he has taken for granted before. People he had always interacted pleasantly with when he was white now refuse to speak a civil word to him, and sometimes even try to hinder him. When Griffin tries to cash one of his traveler's checks, he becomes painfully aware of the discrimination. \"I took the bus to Dryades and walked down it, stopping at the dime store where I'd made most of my purchases. The young white girl came forward to wait on me. `I need to cash a traveler's check,' I said smiling. `We don't cash any checks of any kind,' she said firmly...I went into one store after the other along Dryades and Rampart Streets...It was not their refusal-I could understand that; it was the bad manners they displayed...they would have cashed a traveler's check without hesitation for a white man. (p. 51)\" Griffin feels upset that these people will treat the exact same person differently just because of his skin color. As a reader, I feel the same sense of outrage, and though painful, this remains my favorite part of the book--because it show the \"double face\" of racism so acutely.Growing up, Griffin had always assumed his right to hope for a bright future. If he was smart enough, he could get into a good college, earn his degree, get a good job, and make a lot of money. He hadn't realized that African-American children could not do the same. One black man says that the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of the African-Americans become postman or pastors, and that is only if the family can raise enough money for the child to go to college. Today's generation needs to understand the hopelessness faced by African-Americans just one generation ago.After reading Black Like Me, I see why it is a classic. I recommend it for people ages 13 and up, because this book showed the injustices from an insider's perspective. In 2005, when our society hasn't left racism as far behind as many of us would like to think, people need to learn how it feels to face segregation, discrimination and hopelessness. John Griffin was a brave man; he could have been killed by hate groups for writing this controversial book. Americans everywhere should honor his efforts by having this book in their bookcases. It will remind us of the shameful irony in the statement: \"all men are created equal.\"",
                    "&quot;Black Like Me&quot; by John Howard Griffin is truly a magnificent book. All his life, he has seen the ridicule and hate towards African - Americans, but no he decides to journey into the life of a black man. With his skin tempoaririly darkened due to medical treatements, he says goodbye to his family and journeys into the life of an African American in the deep South. This book truly touched me. Me, being a young black woman, have exerienced minor events such as recorded in this book, but nothing ever this major. This is a book that all people need to read, wether you be white, black, chinese, asian.... ANYTHING!!! This book may only seem to focus on the love / hate relationship between whites and blacks, but really it reaches out to all types of racism.... girl / boy, chinese / japenese.... evendog / cat! This is definitely as must - read, page - turnin, &quot;gimme just five more minutes, mom&quot; type of book. I definietly give it two thumbs up!",
                    "You only have to be human for a short period of time to know the unjustice out world has. Black Like Me takes John Howard Griffen's life and puts it in an inthralling and delicious true novel. An unbeliecable tale that is inpredictable in nature and thought.John Howard Griffen was born a white man. In the late 50's he darkened his skin through the use of creams, sun and medication to become a black man. During this extremly scornful and racist filled society, what was Griffin's thought process for this life-altering change, albeit a short one? To see how the segregated black man lived, communicated and were treated. But, most of all, he wanted to know the truths and the false accusations placed upon 'their people'.What John Howard Griffin found was more than a group of people who were treated unfairly; he found people treated disrespectfully and with unjust fear. Above all, Griffin found a community of people who understood one another with a smile, touch or with few words spoken. As Griffin explained, it is obvious that a black man is deeply changed inwardly when subjected to conditions as the ones he lived in.Griffin chose the most southernly places in which to reside, as the Southern blacks were treated the worse. Griffin wanted to get to know the culture and later referred to himself as mulatto.His writings posess great tragedy, heart, horror and happiness. To have done this was very brave. Something that many more persons should have done. The horridness of then American democracy was clearly shown. It takes a brave man to do what Griffin did. He speaks of the squalor with such despise and love. What you read, you wish was unreal and was a piece of fiction. Although we do not 'see' segregation today, this is a chilling book making the reader look at people differently and with due respect.",
                    "I'm in the middle of reading this book right now and it is amazing! There are things in this book that I've never heard of through history books. This is a true story about this man that decides to color his skin and go to Alabama &amp; Mississippi in the 1950's to write a book of what it is really like down there. He finds out things are worse than he even thought. I'm about half way through and it's just wonderful! So interesting to see how things were that could only be told in this way.",
                    "I found the book Black Like Me a great example of how the color of skin can change the world for a person. Griffin did a great job of keeping his accounts intact. His stories of how he travled as a black man in a white mans body display the sometimes harsh consequenses for a black man in the South. I would recommend this book for a person of either race and of any age.",
                    "Yes I am A 14 Year Old. I have Been a avid book reader for the past 7 years. I think this is the best Non-fiction look into society Classic of All Time. This will tell you like it is.",
                    "I really liked this book. Griffin's experience opened my eyes to what life is really like for someone who is black in the South. Everyone should read this book. It will change their way of thinking.",
                    "Black Like Me showed the plight and injustice done to African Americans as I never saw it before. John Howard Griffin made me realize how much discrimination a person can go through just because of the pigment of his or her skin. He made me realize that the \"colored people\" were oppressed to the point where they couldn't trust anyone of the white race. Griffin makes it clear of how it felt being denied things others take for granted, such as getting a cup of water or even the privilege of using the bathroom. His honesty is what I enjoyed the most in reading this novel. The way he describes how it feels to be given the \"hate stare\" made me feel as if I felt the anger and frustration that had boiled from within so many others. It's hard to understand how the mere sight of a person's color could repulse others so violently. However, Griffin doesn't try to cover up the \"evils\" of American society. He doesn't try to defend the actions of his white counterparts either because he suffered the same injustices that only the colored could understand. Unlike other books, Black Like Me has given me a different perspective. His experience made me see a part of America that I could have never imagined existed until now. It saddened and shocked me of how inhumane humans can treat one another. It also saddens me that this racial inequality is still prevalent in today's society, although not to the same extent.",
                    "This book was assigned to me for an English essay, and I did not expect it to be so fabulous. John Griffin walked the streets as a completely different pigment, yet he was always the same man. He made startling discoveries of how tough it actually was to be a black man in the deep South, and how almost equally hard it was to be a white man.",
                    "black like me is my all time favorite book. when i was in fifth grade, my teacher recomended it to me. ever since he gave me his copy because i like it so much, i have read the book over eight times. i have an original copy, and every time i see a copy of it, i buy it and give it as a gift. it is a wonderful work of art. being a wealthy white girl, always interested and totally apposed to slavery, this book helped me to really see how people just like me could be so vulgar, and dusgusting. i really recomend you read this book, if you have not. it is a wonderfully true story.",
                    "my literature class just finished reading this book i was not sure if i would like it or not but i really did. I think it was good how he did this to experience true racism in the south. i wonder how the book would differ if he did the same experience five years later? I think it was a good book and i recomend it to anyone who wants to sit down and read a good book about the truths of racism in the south during 1959.",
                    "This book, about a white man darkening his skin to see what it was like to be black in the southern United States, was fascinating. I did not want to put this book down. I was horrified to learn of his experiences. How I wish that everyone, regardless of their colour, would read this book.",
                    "Black Like Me, I just finished reading in my 8th grade English class and just today we were discussing it. The book was wonderful and I never knew that is what went on in the South back then. I only knew little bits and pieces until I read the book. I cannot believe it was a real account. I really think that everyone should read this book becuase it deals with racism and prejudice towards people of an &quot;inferior&quot; status. I mean, they are talking about racism against blacks, but it is not really that much different than if it were racism towards a Jew or Hispanic. This book is must read to anyone who has ever wanted to know what really went on behind closed doors in the South way back when.",
                    "John Howard Griffin's Black Like Me is a powerful book which reveals the small, hidden bits of racism in all of us. Griffin, a white journalist, undergoes an amazing transformation which allows him to experience and understand racism throughout the South in a whole different light and an entirely new degree - he becomes black himself. By changing his skin's color, Griffin experiences first-hand the stunningly different, and often hopeless, world on the other side of the racial barrier. A book that makes you both sad and angry, but ultimately opens your eyes - changing the way you see the world. Powerful!",
                    "I read this book 20 years ago and found it to be very impactful. I have recently rediscovered it and incorporated it into my sons' homeschool program. Synopsis: The author, who is caucasion, wants to discover first-hand the experience of African Americans in the south. He finds a way to actually physically appear to be an African American. It is an essential and very enlightening book. If you haven't given too much thought to civil rights issues; this book will leave you with a new appreciation for those who experienced racism. I would recommend this book for seventh graders and adults. In my opinion, this book is truly a classic and deserves to be rediscovered!",
                    "I have wanted to read this book for over ten years, but never made it a priority. I knew the basic premise of the book as being a white man making himself look like a black man to see how bad racism was at the time. I was fortunate enough to find an old copy at the local Goodwill, so I figured it must be time for me to give it a read. I had high expectations of this book, but they were far exceeded.This book is raw, almost terrifyingly so at times. The tales told on many of the southern whites made me ache inside and out, and really made me check myself for any hints of racism that may be lurking in the dark recesses of my own heart. I fear we are all guilty in small ways of this, though I wouldn't have believed it before reading this book.I will say it may be a good thing that I didn't read this book when I first heard on it. As a high-school student, I'm sure I was probably too immature to appreciate the depth of man's hate. Life experience has proven invaluable to my understanding of this book and Griffin's project.",
                    "having dealt with walking while black, department store while Black, driving while Black and just being a Black Man in America any place, anywhere here this book speaks the truth and always will because there is still a divide and if more people went on the journey that this man went on, then they wouldn't think that things don't still exsist and still happen because they still do very much so.there is still privledge and acceptance in the United States based on the color of your skin. the author felt a month was too long, imagine a year or longer? the naiveness and Priviledge is still mind boggling and is very real, because without proper acknowledgement and other factors you can't ever Enslave a race of People and then call them free without understanding the Pshycological and physical damage that has happen and how it still has impact and effect to this very day, but Props to one very daring Soul to expose the reality within the reality.a must read for all and when i see the Fox Network or the Tea Party or the Dixie Democratic party its a reminder of how powerful of the past still has pressence on the now.",
                    "This book had a profound effect on me as a teenager back in the 70's as part of a psychology class in high school. I've just listened to it - all 7 hours. I am moved once again.It is amazing to think about the courage that John Howard Griffin had in order to turn himself in to a black man so that he could truly experience the racism of the South in the late 1950's. His writing is powerful as he details in diary-form his journey and the people that he encounters - both good and bad.It is also amazing to think about how far we as a country have come in our race relations. Although there are still serious injustices and inequalities in the US today (2011) as it relates to blacks and whites, we as a nation have come a very long way. This book is a profound reminder of how far we have come.I strongly encourage anyone who wants to develop a keener understanding of the human psyche and to develop a stronger sense of empathy to not only read but to listen to this book as I have just done. (Note: I was not able to find the audio version on Amazon. I found it at my local library - a pleasant surprise.)",
                    "Black Like Me was a great book and taught me how the black person who lived in the South had such a hard life especially in the Deep South of Mississippi or in New Orleans, which is the setting of the book. In New Orleans the white person is nice to the black man but the white man does not respect the black man just tolerates him. In Mississippi the white person is very degrading to the black man. You cannot even look at a white woman in Mississippi without getting lynched. John Griffin who was on a bus ride in Mississippi was not allowed to get off at his stop because the bus driver was a white man and a horrible racist and he just wanted to mess with John Griffin. John Howard Griffin was a courageous journalist because he was a white man who wanted to turn himself black to see how the black man lived in the South. He wanted to see what the real hardships were for the everyday black man. For example how hard it is to find a job or a place to live; everyday things that we take for granted in today's society. The book showed me that racism is a real thing that blacks even in today's society have to deal with. The book was great and I would recommend the book to anyone who wants to learn about the South and how black people really have to live their everyday lives.",
                    "In the novel, Black Like Me, the author, John Howard Griffin, temperaroly changes his white skin color the the hated color, black, to research in the Deep South what it is really like to be hated for the color of your skin. The theme of this non-fiction novel is hate. Griffin recieves the &quot;hate stare&quot; from many whites in the bus stations and other businesses that he tries to enter. &quot;Then came again, the Hate Stare.&quot; (129) Griffin goes into businesses as a Black person and is refused service and bathroom facilites, but he returns to these businesses as a White person and is treated with dignity and respect. This is exact proof that people hate other people just because of their skin. It is also ironic when Griffin finally returns home after going public with his project. Whites in his hometown that once repected Griffin, wouldn't even talk to him and white supremisists hung a dummie of Griffin painted half black and half white to ridicule him. It is ironic because he is White, but they still hate him just because he was trying to help the Blacks. Americans are overflowing with hate and disgust for all the wrong reasons. Hate is a disease that infects the ignorant minds of young Americans and grows inside and is spread to their young. It is almost uncurable and in some cases is fatal. I recommend this novel for any person, Black or White, that has a heart and cares enough about America' citizens to try to unite the different races to make our country a better place to live.",
                    "John Howard Griffin's Black Like Me is the best book that I have read in years. I admire his nerve for being so gutsy. He now knows what we dark skinned people have been putting up with for 400 years. I learned something valuable: The white people were more afraid of their friends, peers and family members than they were the dark-skinned people. He took a risk of losing his health to feel what we have always felt.I admire him for his courage and compassion for the love he had for others.This book is a great book. It describes the way a white man feels when he switches from having a normal life in the late 1950's to being a black man in racist situations. It has an important lesson along with this book: it says that blacks in the 1950's should have been treated with the same respect that white men were. White men picked on the blacks, not letting them even share the same restroom, simply because they didn't think they're skin was the right color. This is a story about a man who discovers that color isn't an object to place racism on, and that people can get along when there's no prejudice.This book recounts one of the most exciting sociological experiments of the 20th century. The Caucasian author undergoes chemical and physical changes to appear as an African American, to document the bias and social injustices of the white American society from personal experience.",
                    "What better way to discover what it is like to be someone than to become them? This is exactly what John Griffin did in 1959. John was a writer for an African-American magazine, Sepia, who wanted to discover what it was like to be an African-American in the Deep South. By medication and ultraviolet rays he turned his skin a rich brown so he could pass for an African-American. He decided he would not change his name, the way he talked or the way he dressed and with two hundred dollars and a duffle of close he was off to New Orleans. John immediately was amazed at how only the change in his skin color made him hated by whites but in the same way it made him loved by African-Americans. He traveled through the south looking for a job. Normally a well-dressed, educated man would have no trouble finding a job but that's far from the truth if you're an African-American living in the Deep South. After three months he had more than enough and could not stand that quality of life any longer. He changed his skin tone back to the old milky white went back to his home in Texas. Here he would encounter the same hate that he did as an African-American. Now simply changing his skin color cannot free him from this hatred. Black Like Me is a definite must read. It is an eye-opening experience for the reader. It is important for every American no mater age what to read this masterpiece. It lets one see the horrific crimes we committed against an innocent race because they were different. It lets the reader fully understand the conditions if you were an African-American living in the South in the 1950's. When something is understood it can be prevented from every happening again.",
                    "Black like me is a journey into the depths of human emotion and prejudice. Griffin chooses under his own power to brave the hate of a world in its own and an existance that is not fit for human survival. He wishes to know how and why our society is destroying itself with inconsequential arguements. Griffin discovers that some would prefer the truth remain hidden, and that this danger and intolerance can hit quite close to home. Griffin endangered his life, and also that of his family, because he believed his experience was one that needed to be told, and his story upset a generation to enlighten the next.",
                    "I just finished a class at school on black/white relations, and this book drove to the heart of the issue in a dramatic and truthful fashion. The book is the true account of Griffin, a white man, changing only the color of his skin so as to experience first-hand the life of a black man in in the very openly racist Deep South of the late 1950s.The account becomes particularly revealing when Griffin describes how towards the end of his investigation he &quot;switched&quot; back and forth between black and white on a daily basis, noting the negative reactions he received from both black and white communities based on the color of his skin.Additionally, the epilogue by the author is incredible. He bemoans how people, particularly northerners, have tokenized him, seeing him as the only white person capable of communicating with blacks. Specifically, he describes one situation where a city task force brought him in as the &quot;liason&quot; to their black community, yet they had not even taken preliminary steps to communicate with its most outspoken representatives.I don't typically read books in their entirety at one sitting, but this book drew me in by its interesting topic, and I wasn't able to let it go until I had finished it. This book is a great book, and I recommend it to all. Specifically, I would imagine this book to be particularly helpful for a white seeking to better understand the nature of race in this country, but there is nothing about the book that would preclude enjoyment by another demographic.",
                    "Black Like Me is an \"eye opener\" to what it was like to be a black person in the deep south in the 1950's and the 1960's. I recommend this book to anyone for general information concerning the prejudice that was exhibited toward the black people of this nation. Great book and a great writer!",
                    "Five stars for the author's courageousness, four stars for content at the time of publication, three stars for content when read today.No white man - no matter how well-intentioned - can satisfactorily explain the social or emotional climate faced daily by blacks, a fact that was even more true a half-century ago. Coupled with the relatively brief period Mr. Griffin spent posing as a black man, it is understandable why I, or another reader, could be left asking, \"Is that all there is?\" But Griffin placed his family on the line during this project, put personal relationships to the test, and had to maintain his wits to maintain his facade. At a time in our history when the only exposure whites had to blacks took the form of media coverage of early civil rights demonstrations and a \"daring\" television program hosted by Nat King Cole, Griffin performed a true public service in helping to explain, albeit in surface terms, what it just might be like to be black. That would be contribution enough, circa 1960. Looking back now, \"Black Like Me\" can almost be viewed as a stunt, as something we might associate with Geraldo Rivera or someone from \"Dateline\", but it was a daring technique for its time, a selfless act by a man with newly-restored vision who could have played it safe.If you want raw, unvarnished narrative on the black condition, try \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\". If you desire a window into the \"white\" side of the civil rights movement and a first-person narrative on personal courage, this is the book for you.",
                    "I first read this book in 1965 as a junior in high school. As a white man, it seared my conscience then, as a naive 17 year old and again as a &quot;worldly&quot; 55 year old. Mr. Griffin's book will remain a timeless classic and a primer for we who are not of color as we try to gain some understanding on life for those who are people of color. I believe that reading this first in 1965 made me a better man and able to at least attempt to stamp out tired stereotypes in my own heart. I am certain it helped me look upon ALL humankind as worthy of my kindness on an equal level. May God help me continue this as I live out my life. I wish the lessons of this book might be learned by all and appreciated. The world would be a better place!",

Usually, I never see anything about it until about February 26...but this year, the newspaper, television, movies, and Amazon had new information each day. \"Black Like Me\" was on sale one day and I picked it up. I remember the turmoil of the era through a young child's perceptions: I lived through the days of desegregation, apart from it, in a white area near Washington, D.C. \"Black Like Me\" tells an incredible story of bravery and soul, written by a man who was one of our nation's greatest Unsung Heroes. 50 years later, it hurts to read and be reminded. Then I think of how far this country has come - We have a Black President - and how far we have to go for the true brotherhood of man. Well worth the read.",
                    "This book gave me a totally different view on what the Deep South was like in the 1950's, so I deeply enjoyed it. Anyone who might enjoy a historical non-fiction novel of America, or is integued by African-American history would absolutly LOVE this book.",
                    "I was very pleased with this book. Going into it, I did not believe that I would find it very interesting, but I soon found that I could not put it down.

                    "John Howard Griffin's Black Like Me, contrasts the lives of Blacks and Whites in the 1950's. I was mesmerized by the hateful encounters that the Black people went through just because of their skin color. I was also amazed about how my ancestors, the white man, never gave the Black people one iota of respect.Another angle of the story showed how far a journalist of the fifties would go for a story. Through the book, I saw Griffin go against all morals of his time for a story. I saw him become an outcast of his society. On top of that he put his life on the line, with the skin change and the crazy white men, for a story. This seemed to me to be a dumb mistake that eventually cost him his life.I enjoyed the book and will read it again. I think this book could give you a different perspective on a lot of issues not only of Griffin's time, but on ours as well.",
                    "I'd heard of this \"experiment\" before and was curious about how it turned out. I saw the moviesWatermelon ManandThe Spook Who Sat by the Doorafter taking a racism class in college, interested in the evolution of black power in America. Many years later I got Griffin's book.It's a quick read, only 200 pages (including epilogue & afterward), yet is enough to fill the reader with enough information to show them that there was still deep-rooted racism in the south. You must understand, though, that this takes place during '59-'60, so much has changed as far as laws & many incidents of blatant discrimination. The civil rights movement started, and in some aspects continues today. And recently the country's first black president sits in the white house, something no one could have thought of in the '60s. Despite all this we can still see forms of discrimination & racism today.Griffin's experiment proved a point that no matter what color we are, we can discriminate, hate, judge, and these things are what keep us back as a species. They prevent us from making any real progress because we always divide ourselves by color, class, caste, race, sex, culture, instead of realizing that we are humans first, and that's the perspective we should come from when handling issues that trouble us...at least that's how I see it. I understand that we all have different needs & they might not apply to everyone, but we also have the same basic needs that everyone cannot live without.We can understand, though Griffin's book, how black people might feel towards whites, or towards their own people. The frustration of being overlooked, chased away, ridiculed, or immediately classified as \"not good enough\" just by the pigment of your skin. We've made SOME progress over the years but I doubt that much has changed since the books' publication.Griffin's book is one of many (The Spook Who Sat By the Door,Malcolm X,Soul on Ice,Nigger) that have tried to understand the struggle of blacks from the times of slavery up to present-day. It is a struggle that, unfortunately, we'll have to fight for a long, long time.",

This book had me feeling like it was me going through these acts of racism. I was not thought of during the time he pulled this off so when he was telling the story from a mans point of view who had not been through this before he was telling it through me as well. I was reading the story thinking dang, why are these people treating me this way? This is some B.S., but anyhow this very true book is sad that thats how it was (even worse years before that, however) and an interesting concept and good story.",

I would have loved to have seen him in person in both black and white. The book was a page turner and I really respected his views. I always respect a person who doesn't write books off of statistics and will go out of his way for personal experience...and ma-an, did he go out of his way!",

                    "... ...09/07/02Core 8Book ReviewBlack Like MeBook ReviewFor my summer assignment, I read the novel Black Like Me by John Griffin. It is an autobiography about a white man who explores The Deep South as a black man by changing the pigment of his skin. This is a terrific book and I strongly recommend it.Mr. Griffin's purpose is to find out how African American's are treated compared to Caucasian American's. To achieve this, Mr. Griffin travels to The Deep South. He finds himself in the middle of two cultures who accept or reject him merely because the color of his skin. He finds the discrimination gets worse as he travels farther South.The book takes place in the late 50's and early 60's. It is set mainly in New Orleans and The Deep South. The mood of the book is depressing and poignant.I think Mr. Griffin proved his point by telling America and the rest of the world how badly black people in society were treated. His writing is fairly easy to read with a few difficult words. I would have liked the book more if Mr. Griffin was not so verbose. Overall, the novel is very moving and John Griffin vindicates himself. I would recommend this novel because it tells a lot of history and Mr. Griffin speaks very eloquently and from his heart.The novel taught me some history along with how African American's were restrained from having a normal life.",

I really enjoyed this book because it shows u how the black people were ridiculed because of their skin color which is like wrong, i think, um the thing that stood out to me was that, if a person was black and wanted to like eat in a resteraunt, they would have to eat in the back of the building and not at a table. Anyways i recommend this book to whomever wants to read this book.",
                    "Black Like Me is a great book to read. It described life in 1959,when blacks had no happiness and little freedom. Life was like prison, but a prison for life that blacks couldn't leave. This is shown by John Howard Griffin who went through a medical transformation that turned his skin color black. The outcome shocked him and me. I felt the pain of his mistreatment, and the shame he went through. The people that he knew gave him no respect as a black man. For example when Griffin went back to his hometown New Orleans, he went to a restaurant that he ate there all the time as a white man, but now that his black they won't even lit him use the restrooms.This book is one of the best books I ever read; it will show you that one man wanted to see what it is like to be a black man in the Deep South. Griffin had to live the life of a black man, and be what whites thought he should be. This book is GREAT, you should read it.",
                    "As an avid reader, I have long wished for a book that would in some way enable white Americans to feel the pain of hatred based on something that one has no control of. The history of African-Americans and their struggle for equality is seldom discussed in schools, homes and churces of the majority group. This is not simply a matter of not caring, but a matter of not knowing the courageous struggle of an entire race of people which has gone on for over 400 years and continues today. As a black southerner, I can empathize with the bigotry that Mr. Griffin encountered, I can also testify that it still (in less obvious ways) occurs today. I only wish that he could still be here to document the often unbelieved fact that the hands of racism still choke opportunites for minorities in this country. This book is a must read for any person who wishes to become more enlightend, more aware and more understanding of the plight of minorities in these(almost)United States.",
                    "This book really makes you think about the United states in the era of segregation. This book is extremly honest and I think everyone should read it, so people will know the horrors of extreme discrimination. I found the most important theme in this book was trust, there was none. There was no trust between blacks and blacks, whites and whites, or blacks and whites. I suggest that if you need something to read you really should consider this book",
                    "I read this significant book in one day. John Howard Griffin did something most whites would never even dream of, especially when segregation was thriving in the Deep South. By changing his white skin to black, he became nothing but an inferior servant to the white race, regardless of his educational upbringing. I highly recommend this book to those who are intolerant of racial injustice.",

I live in a \"rust belt\" city , & white , ignorant , un-educated people still think they're superior to the black population ! It just baffles me ?? The book itself was fast reading , you could taste the food , smell the odors , \"see\" New Orleans as if you were there ! A sad commentary on the times , but it was a start.............Mr. Griffin is a true American hero , anyone seeking out the truth as he did is..........even if you fail , at least you tried , that's how this book makes me feel , I WILL try , never say die , very profound effect on my life.....read the book , you won't be disappointed !

                    "The book I read was called Black Like Me, By John Howard Griffin. This book is about a white, middle aged man who darkened his skin. He wanted to see what it was really like to be a black man in the Deep South. So he is basically under cover going to experience the treatment and life of a black man in the Deep South.To me this book was pretty good. The only bad part about this book was in the begining it was kind of confusion, because they were talking about how the plan was going to work, and it was kind of hard to understand.My recommendation for this book would be to peole who like to learn about history and how things were back then. If you are a person who doesn't know much about how things were in those rasis days, then this is a book for you.",
                    "We simply cannot experience everything. There are too many options to choose between. Our only hope to understand all that is out there is through books. Vicariously we can at least partial understand the suffering in our world. Black Like Me is one of the better inside looks at a particular reality. Griffin sunned and dyed himself black and went into the deep south to experience life as a black man. The book is a revelation of human nature. Written as a diary it is hard not to symphathize with the situation described. Everything should read.",
                    "I can say that at 50+. I still remember this book from reading it at High School at 12years old and how significantly it touched me. it gave me an understanding the was reflected in all my life versus culture shocks. I have noted that in black and white towns that children who have no black in them but with meditteranean colouring is treated as a black derivative by white people. until they see that their mother is white and obviously so then the attitude changes to a better behaviour. So many years and people do not change.I think this book covers the attitudes of people of all races to other races. I have noted as a white person that some coloured women in my country in specific area of the country will not speak or will speak in a unfriendly way to others not of their culture.I hope I have written this respectfully as information not as to judge. I think this book was a courageous act by the author and respect him highly for it. without these people, undercurrents go by secretly instead of out in the open. Nothing can be denied from this action by one man concerned.",
                    "Black Like Me should be required reading for every American, young and old. It is especially fitting at a time when our country is still in the grips of racism.",
                    "When we learn about history we seem to only learn about the events themselves and never their context. One thing I didn't know about Black Like Me is that Griffin was only black for like six weeks and the book is mostly his journal notes. That, of course, changes the entire context and reading of the book.I've done some research for Robert Greene, and I wish I had read this when I was researching for The 50th Law Publisher: Harper because it is much, much better than Native Son and says most of the same things. (Two sidenotes, if Griffin was able to successfully fool people into thinking that he was black using the resources available in 1950, how incompetent were the makeup artists on Black White? Secondly, the best part of the book is the editor's note at the end where his biographer basically admits that after John died he married his widow and took over his estate, including the book he happens to be writing the epilogue to.)",
                    "The book Black Like Me by John Howard Griffin is about how the author, John Howard Griffin, goes from being a white, honorable journalist to a black journalist. He transforms through a series of aid medication and dye. He changes his color pigment from white to black. In the book, he transforms completely. He keeps a diary on his daily experiences, experiences hard to imagine. The diary documents his experiences as a black male trying to survive the crucial racist reality in the Deep South in the late decade of the 1950's and early 1960's. He transforms from a man who is able to get what he wants when he wants it, to someone who faces restrictions when going into places and doing what he wants.This book is an excellent way to show people of the United States the crucial reality of, not only the experiences of a black male, but of the whole entire ethnic group. I think this book is an excellent way to portray and show racism at a first glance. John knows the risk he is taking when he decides to go undercover as a black male in the Deep South, but he still goes ahead and does it. The truth is very harsh, but he still writes it. He opens a discussion among people of this crucial reality: that Blacks face discrimination in the simplest forms of life. He opens up the dormant eyes of every American in the country. This is an excellent book. -by OlgaThe book Black Like Me talks about a lot of discrimination. John Howard Griffin is the author and he writes about himself and the reasons why he changed from white to black. He wanted to be black and he decides to change how he looks and go to other places where nobody will know him. When he is black, he tests racism because he isn't like the other white people. The racism in the book Black Like Me is against black people for how they look.The book makes me question why people discriminate against other people. Everyone is human, everyone has feelings and everyone should have the same rights in this world. When he is white he is able to do what ever he wants and when he is black, he is restricted from doing a lot of things. People look at him differently for how he looks. People make racist comments and he feels bad for why people are like that. -by ArtemioThe book Black Like Me is very interesting. It is about a white man named John Howard Griffin that wants to change his skin color to black. He changes his white skin color to black because he wants to experience how black people were treated around 1959. It is something brave to do, because when he changes his color he goes through a lot of discrimination. He actually feels how other people from a different race are treated so badly.John Griffin is a businessman but he is no one when he changes his skin color. He has a wife and kids that he loves very much. He leaves that behind for some time just to feel how black people are treated. He is known as a black person and it goes really badly because he can't do what he would do if he was a white man. After being black, he finally realizes it is not easy being a black person. He feels bad for blacks; he can't believe they are treated so badly.In my opinion this book is very interesting. This book shows a good example of racism. It also shows that there are white people that care about black people because of what John Griffin did. John Griffin is a man that understands what black people were going through and it was something brave for him to do.These are three examples from the book that support my personal statement. One of them is that John Griffin tells his friend about what he is going to do with his color skin. His friend says he is crazy but John doesn't care. He still does it. Second, when John changes his color, people treat him badly but there are actually other people that help him out. The third example is that John has to get used to being black because he can't do what he used to do when he was a white person. These are my three examples that support my personal statement. -By MarielaThe book Black Like Me is about John Howard Griffin, the author, and his life. It all starts by him wanting to change his skin color through treatment/medication. He wants to change his color to a black person because he wants to see how people from his opposite color are treated. While he is living like a black person, he sees many differences between when he was white and then black. When Griffin was first white, he could go anywhere he wanted like fancy restaurants, sit on the buses with no trouble and stop where he wanted. He could also change checks into money. When Griffin changes his color to black, he can't sit in the park comfortably without being criticized by a white person. He is discriminated against, and he can't change a check into cash like he could when he was white. The main idea in this book Black Like Me is that black people are and were discriminated against currently and in the late 1950s while doing the same acts that white people do.I thought this book was interesting. I liked learning about John Howard Griffin's opinions/thoughts/experiences in his life. He goes through being black and seeing how blacks are treated. At the same time, I think he is the kind of guy that didn't judge people based on color. He cared about everybody, no matter what. For him, everybody is family. When Griffin was white he could go to fancy restaurants, stay in nice hotels, and have a great time outside without being discriminated against. After Griffin's medication darkens his color, he has to get comfortable with the reality that blacks get treated differently. John Howard Griffin was white and wanted to see from his own perspective how black people were treated. -by Marisol",
                    "I bought this book after reading Uncle Tom's Cabin, because I wanted to see a man's point of view on the treatment of Blacks.This was very informative, and gave a view of a white man's life as a Black. However, as an African American, I could not help but feel sad by reading this book. This man had the opportunity to go back and forth as a Black, but many that he came in contact with did not. I wish that there was more written about how this affected the author's home life, and also how the author felt about the experience once time had passed.This is a highly suggested book for one who would like to know about the race relations of the 1950's.",
                    "Black Like Me was not written in the interests so much as to move and startle the reader as it was to inform him; yet it has accomplished both. I know it has touched millions, and the common feeling of these readers, including me, is that this story needed to be told. I believe it didn't need to be shared just with the people of that time, to help them understand, to begin closing the gap between races. I feel it was meant to be shared with those who have come later, and those who have yet to arrive. It is often said that if one doesn't learn from history, it is doomed to repeat itself, and this book will be needed to remind generations far beyond of the tragedies of that time, and how never to let them happen again. John Griffin wrote Black Like Me in working for the dream of black and white equality, in the hopes of getting the truth to people everywhere. He needed to uncover the real story behind racism in the South for himself, but with his quest came persecution and hatred of another kind; anger directed towards him and his ideas and truths, not senseless anger like the racism he encountered in his travels. I admire and enormously commend Griffin for taking such a great task on himself, in spite of the fires he knew he would spark with his enlightenment.",
                    "I'd been meaning to read this book for a long period of time but somehow never got around to doing it. Because of the extended time since the book's publication, my philosophy, hopefully, matured quite a bit. For this reason I found the book mildly disappointing but still generally interesting.From the standpoint of a Black man I found the author's assessments of race condescending while attempting to place myself in his shoes in 1959's racially charged southern culture. No Black man or even woman could have had the author's dual perspective but I found his descent into self-hatred compelling. His evaluations seem elitist because of the ease in which he navigated the culture as a Caucasian - the differences stark and extreme. Blacks knew only one experience - so his experience can only be described as an anomaly.",
                    "The author was born and raised in Texas, went to France to study psychiatry, and became embroiled in World War II while working with the French insurgents against the Nazi-installed sham government there. His insurgent work became known to the Gestapo and he had to \"leave France in a hurry\". He joined the Army Air Force as an Intelligence Officer, was badly wounded twice, and suffered from temporary blindness. He underwent a spiritual conversion and became a Catholic.He returned to Texas and pondered doing covert participant observation on racism in the Deep South employing his skills developed through his experiences in the French Resistance: \"For years the idea had haunted me, . . . If a white man became a Negro in the Deep South, what adjustments would he have to make? What is it like to experience discrimination based on skin color, something over which one has no control? . . . How else except by becoming a Negro could a white man hope to learn the truth?\"Indeed, Griffin made a sound case for the benefits of covert participant observation as a method of sociological enquiry. \"The Southern Negro will not tell the white man the truth. He long ago learned tht if he speaks a truth unpleasing to the white, the white will make life miserable for him\", he explained. People behave differently when they know they are being studied. Through covert particpant observation, it was possible for Griffin to experience what goes on, to see who or what is involved, to note when and where things happen, how they occur, and why.With the help of a doctor, he darkened his skin in order to pass as a Negro in order to experience white hostility towards blacks: \"The transformation was total and shocking . . . who is this large, bald Negro\"?, he asked.\"In the bus station lobby . . . She answered rudely and glared at me with such loathing I knew I was receiving what the Negroes call 'the hate stare'. It was my first experience with it. . . I realized I had done nothing - my color offended her\".A pioneer of the growing sociological field of covert participant observation, Griffin's own experiences as a Negro in the Deep South are repeated in this volume \"in all its crudity and rawness\". Griffin provides a beacon in which other ethnographers might frame covert particpant observation research and illuminates some of the obstacles and dilemmas they might expect to encounter along the way. \"It traces the changes which occur to heart and body and intelligence when a so-called first-class citizen is cast on the junkheap of second-class citizenship\", he said.This book should be read along with Jack Douglas's \"Investigative Social Research\" and Erving Goffman's \"The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life\".",
                    "I read this book a while ago. But even now, I still remember how good of a read it was. Griffins way of showing how it is to be black in those days was a major leap in trust. Not many well-liked white men would dress up as a black man to show the injustice in america. I would have a hard time changing my skin color to become a black man. I think that showing the injustice was just as scary as almost anything you could imagine. Throwing yourself into a world that might kill you, and all the while gathering information to show the rest of the world was daring and gutsy. I admire Griffin for his ability to do that. The plot was a gripping one that kept me reading and wanting to know what was goint to happen next. I would recommend this book to anyone.",
                    "The story is well described in all of the other reviews so I will not rehash it yet again.A very interesting look from a unique perspective at the very start of the civil rights movement in the southern US. Forty + years later one has to wonder what it would be like for a new JH Griffin to repeat the experience. What would he find different? What would he find the same? In all honesty, a great deal has changed and great deal has remained unchanged. It would be even more interesting to have a white become black and a black become white. I'm sure that would be quite an eye opening report from the both of them.The book just goes to show that a person can never really know what something is like unless they themselves have experienced it. Watching &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; doesn't make a person know what combat is really like although it can give an idea of it; a white person can never really know what it is like to be black although they may some idea, it is never authentic.",
                    "I think that this is a great book for people to read, many people who were not aliv during these time periods do not understand the intensity of racism that occured. The stories that are told are so vicious and so cruel that sometimes we choose to not &quot;hear&quot; these stories. I think that this was a good book for people to read because I feel like this man did a great thing. It's hard to go from something to nothing but to want to understand what black people had to go through was something special. I know had it been me i would have given up as soon as I realized how bad it truly was for people, in this book white people wouldn't cash his checks, serve him, and white people tried to beat him up. He went through a lot and could have given up at any time but he chose not to. Then even after his experiment was over and he started doing all those different tv shows and interviews and he started being hated for what he did he still stuck with it and just moved away to another country. I look up to him for being strong enough to do this, but I also look up to him for taking the time to do it, even when he lightened up on his medicine so that he could go back and forth from black to white to compare how he was treated he knew that when he was black he was treated wrong, and also at the time when he went to Mississippi and the courts would put a lynch mob in jail just because they killed a black person and not a white person, it was things like this that showed him how bad black people really had it during these time periods....But overall this is a great book, people always say that you never really know a man until you have walked a mile in his shoes, I feel that John Griffin has walked states....",
                    "This book made a huge difference in my life and understanding of racial issues in thes country in the 1960's. It is equally relevant today and I cannot wait to read it again.",
                    "As an \"experiment\", this book has to be an all time classic. It's indicative of the mistrust society has for the black person, that a white person must darken his skin and witness the injustice firsthand, before it's believed to be true. The loneliness and degradation Griffin experienced left me with a deep sadness for the black people who struggle with this on a daily basis. A book that has hopefully changed the attitudes of many people forever.",

One that reminds us what we have done to our fellow citizens in this country. Some of the problems mentioned in this book have long since disappeared, but the underlying problem has not. Black people still do not have the same chances in this country that most of the rest of us do. This book is very useful in looking at the past, and at where we have been. It may help us correct the course to where we are going. I bought this book for my Kindle so I would have it with me to reread. It is one of the few books that I always want to have with me. \"Black Like Me\", \"I know why the caged bird sings\", and \"Shindler's List\" are all among them. Very inspiring books with the same basic theme.",

I did a little research and found out that many people had read this in high school. I am a bit older now, so I ordered it and I am glad that I did. I can't imagine how revolutionary this book must have been when it came out. What a horrifying history we have had in this country! If this book is no longer assigned in school, everyone should read it anyway. We don't want to repeat the past ever and this book goes a long way to promote stepping into the other guy's shoes.

                    "This book will make you very afraid of many things happening in this world that don't stop happening because we stop thinking about them. The force behind racism is blunt stupidity which can't be negotiated with, can't be dealt with, must be avoided as much as possible. It is dangerous as it knows no respect for the laws of either nature or civility.To launch ones self headlong into near-certain risk of personal harm, with no easy or sometimes no means at all of escape, all in the pursuit of knowledge for the betterment of one's fellow man, is the definition of a hero. Racism does not produce, it is a fire that consumes. John Howard Griffin is the firefighter who was willing to run into a burning building to search for a child who might not even be there, willing to risk his life and unwilling to face the prospect that he didn't give it all, didn't do what it would take.Or, maybe the man was just crazy. Probably a little bit of both. 5 stars of course. And like I seem to say a lot, this book isn't about a man and it isn't about a society, it is about YOU.",

                    "\"Have you ever heard of a white man impersonating a black man to the extent of changing his skin color? I've never, and after reading this book, I am truly amazed by the courage John Griffin had to do such a thing. In his book, Black Like Me, John uses medication and ultraviolet light to change his skin color for journalistic purposes. His goal was to see how blacks were treated now in the 1950s. What he sees is shocking: blacks are constantly insulted, beat by white men, and very obviously segregated. I would definitely recommend this book, because it shows the large difference between how whites and blacks were treated. Also, from this book, you see the contrast of how people treat John when he is white or black. Black Like Me digs deep into the segregation of the South, revealing the between-the-lines horrors the blacks had to face during this period of American history.\"",
                    "Wow! The text floored me! Probably one of the most gripping experiences ever to be written. I was crying, shocked, angered, and generally shaking my head at the discourse of how ridiculously and outrageously uncharitible, inhuman, and overall extremely un-Christ like the Whites in Griffin's case study behaved. I'm a white male and cannot image displaying such hatred when we are all called to love each other with the same regard we have for ourselves.",
                    "To really, honestly, see the world through another person's eyes is something that's incredibely rare and is difficult to do. Griffin darkened his skin and changed his life to be able to see what it was really like being a black man in the segregated South. The things he heard, felt, and saw are things that will forever be impressed upon my mind as a reader. The way he told his story was very simple and straightforward, which almost seems to bring the messages home even harder. You can easily see him struggling with concepts that were everyday for the people he encountered: segregated restrooms, segregated water fountains, sneering, baiting, hatred, and disdain. If this book doesn't make you want to cry, then you don't have a pulse.",

The fact that it's still in print and selling at #3000 on Amazon is a testament to the universal appeal and underlying message of JH Griffin's book.Here's the deal: in the 50s, the author was a journalist in the Deep South, and decided to experience the life of a black man by crossing the color line. He took medication that darkened his skin and exchanged his live as a privileged white man for the world of an unemployed black man. Black Like Me is his eyewitness history about race and humanity - and ultimately humility.Should be read by every thinking person in the country.

Of course all of us would change if it meant that we would have a better life, but how many of us would put ourselves in a new lifestyle that would station us at the bottom of the social and economic system? John Howard, the author of Black Like Me, did just this. He found a way to change his skin pigmentation so that it was dark. He went down to the deep south during the late 1950's. This was a time of great oppression, humiliation, and segregation of colored people. This book follows his life before, after and during his life changing activities. We see people who are sympathetic to blacks and we see people who are ready to kill every last colored person alive. This book was truly moving and yet it was saddening.

                    "This compelling novel by John Howard Griffin has truly all the elements of a great writer. Griffin whom has written many compelling books such as: `Encounters with the other', `Forgive My Grief' and many others has captured investigating writing. He not only gives writing its purpose but also defines it. Within the novel Black like Me he explores the life of a white man, but as a black man as well. Griffin uses his remarkable investigating skills and truly walks in the shoes of a black man. John H. Griffin walks in the shoes of a black man literally for he transforms himself by dying his skin. This novel is quite the read, for it deals with the struggles and hardships that African Americans faced in the 1950s.The novel gives one a taste of the never-ending discrimination African Americans face during this time. One can not help but be compelled to John H. Griffin and his profound determination upon the subject of racism. This is a well-written novel, which is filled with America's history of hate and degradation. But John H. Griffin uses his writing expertise to bring this to light.",
                    "Although it was written nearly forty years ago, this book points squarely and unflinchingly at unpleasant racial realities that are still too much with us. Taking to heart the axiom about &quot;walking a mile&quot; in the other guy's shoes, the caucasian Griffin altered his appearance in the late 1950's by the use of skin dye and hair treatment, so that he could spend a few weeks on the other side of the curtain of segregation that was an undisputed fact of life in the South. What he learned was not only profoundly eye-opening for him, but can be so as well for anyone who reads him sensitively today.As a light-skinned African-American who has spent much of my life among whites, I have often observed that perhaps only their becoming black could convince most whites of the reality, the pervasiveness and the persistence of racism in America. Short of that, I would heartily recommend this venerable classic by Griffin.Especially valuable is the Epilogue, in which the author recounts the experiences he had following the book's initial publication, when he was invited numerous places to expound his insights into America's &quot;race problem.&quot; Time and again, he is exasperated to find that those seeking solutions to racial unrest and animosity ignore the perspective of knowledgable blacks, preferring the views of a white man who has briefly experienced blackness over those derived from decades of such experience. In this section of the book, Griffin also offers a superb brief for the value of the perspectives presented in black newspapers and other black-controlled media. His own brief sojourn into blackness had shown him that such perspectives on events are no less valid or &quot;objective&quot; than those coming through the mainstream (white) media, and often provide a healthy and necessary corrective to the latter. It remains true that no American can consider him/herself fully informed on the issues of the day without exposure to a variety of viewpoints, and Griffin's admonitions on the dangers of ignoring black perspectives are as true in 1998 as they were in 1958.A sobering read, highly recommended to anyone seeking insight into the still-troubled world of American race relations. It would be a grave mistake to assume that the realities Griffin describes in this book ended with the Jim Crow laws. The only reason I would not rate it a &quot;10&quot; is that Griffin is no longer alive to give it a proper updating.",
                    "Black Like Me delineates the experience of John Howard Griffin, a white writer who specialized in race issues, who desperately wanted to know what it was like to be an African-American in the Deep South in order to experience discrimination based on skin color, something over which one has no control. In 1959, Griffin risked everything, including his career, his family, and his reputation. With the support of an African-American magazine and the help of dermatologists, he took medication that darkened his skin to a deep brown. He changed nothing but the color of his skin, and witnessed on a first-hand account what it was like to be a Negro. He began his journey in New Orleans and was shocked to discover how the whites treated him like scum, and all African-Americans treated him like their brother. He immediately found that he had to walk across town just to find a caf&eacute; that would serve him food and water, or that he would have to walk around a building in order to find a \"colored\" bathroom that he could use. Despite his education and qualifications, he had trouble finding a job. He traveled all throughout the Deep South, stopping in Alabama and Mississippi, which made New Orleans seem like the North. He began to feel like he had truly become an African-American, and felt bitter towards the Southern whites. His experience completely opened his eyes to what the real definition of racism is, and he hoped that his book would do the same for millions of people throughout the world. Black Like Me is John Howard Griffin's attempt to reveal the truth about discrimination and racism, and in my opinion that is exactly what it did. I recommend this book to those readers who usually can't stay interested in a book. You will not want to put this one down.",
                    "This was a compelling novel that showed the true struggle African Americans in the Deep South went through against racism. It was commendably written. At times, I felt as though I could smell, feel and taste the events that Griffin described. With each new experience every detail was given. Black Like Me is a true story of a man, John Howard Griffin, who used medication and dye to change the pigment of his skin from Caucasian to African American. He went to the southern United States to find out if African Americans were actually treated differently. He then wrote an article revealing how differently he was treated when his skin was dark. This novel depicts what it was like for a black person living in the south in the 1950's. It shows the hatred, and disgust that was directed towards them for no other reason than the colour of their skin. It discusses the obstacles that they had to overcome as a race and the problems that they had within their race. Black Like Me tears at your heart. It shows how far we've come since then but also how much farther we need to go. The book ends with a fairly long epilogue explaining what has gone on since he wrote his article. It talks of great men such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and what they did for the black movement. A book like this is a must read if we will ever as a human race fully judge people by who they truly are and not by the colour of their skin.",

And the book that made me appreciate the life long work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. I am a white woman who was raised in the coal regions of Pennsylvania. At the time there were no people of color (any color) in my small town. Most were of Irish/German/Polish ancestry. I never saw any form of racism UNTIL I picked up this book.This book opened my eyes and made me understand a LITTLE bit of what life was like during the 50's and still are like for some to this day. We need to take a lesson from this man. If I could I would give this book 1000 stars.",
                    "I grew up in the south (Atlanta and Athens, GA) in the 60's and 70's, went to public schools in which we had serious racial tension, and I've only now just read John Howard Griffin's outstanding book of investigative reporting, Black Like Me. I honestly don't understand why this book was not required reading in my junior high school; in fact, it would be a service to America even today to make it required reading for everyone. Living in the suburbs and going to newly integrated schools, black rage was inexplicable, unavoidable, and terrifying to my friends and I, but this book would have helped us by giving us a real context. There will always be minds closed to the truths presented here, but if a more vital call for compassion toward those who seem different to us but are united in humanity exists, I don't know what it might be. And herein lies the true worth of this book--not only that it documents the constant oppression of blacks in the South under segregation, but also that it documents the distances that build up between any oppressor and oppressed. Black Like Me makes completely clear that the oppressed of any class, race, ethnicity, religious orientation, sexual orientation, etc., cannot &quot;rise above the problem&quot; without a lessening of that oppression; and that even the best willed of the oppressors are scarcely able to even recognize the extent of the problem. The mythologizing of the &quot;other&quot; so overwhelms our commonalties that they are almost completely obscured. Although many whites in the deepest South spoke of blacks as &quot;subhuman&quot; (or at best did not speak out against such grotesque characterizations) Griffin documents the fact that many blacks in the segregated South were astonishingly and universally civil toward one another, sharing what little they had with complete strangers. This generosity of spirit was practically unknown to most whites who had no real point of contact with the black community, as black relationships with one another were decidedly different than black-white relationships.Although the story of Griffin's changing his skin color to live as a black man in the south is totally compelling, ultimately I regretted that it wasn't longer or more detailed. Griffin was an absolutely extraordinary man, yet entirely human himself, and occasionally when situations turned too extreme he felt it necessary to retreat. At one point Griffin decides that he must go to Mississippi and so he gets to Hattiesburg immediately after a Mississippi county court rules against indicting anyone for the kidnapping from jail and lynching of a black man accused of a crime in spite of evidence gathered by the FBI. Once there, Griffin immediately finds the tension intolerable, the constant threat of violence overwhelming, and the degradation absolute. Rather than sticking with the story he calls a white friend and stays with him for a few days, then leaves. I can't fault him personally for this decision, and it certainly speaks to the horrifying environment in which he found himself, but a chance for some important journalism was missed. Similarly, the book feels truncated--after visiting Atlanta (which came off rather well at least in comparison, I'm pleased to say) Griffin winds up the project rather abruptly. He continues to suffer the consequences of his project for some time, facing threats and ostracism from his white neighbors to the point that he and his parents move elsewhere.Griffin rather casually dropped in some shocking autobiographical statements without any follow-up: &quot;when I was blind&quot;--he was blinded in a bombardment and his impairment lasted for 10 years; and &quot;It reminded me of the nagging, focusless terror we felt in Europe when Hitler began his marches, the terror of talking with Jews (and our deep shame of it).&quot;--he's not writing in the abstract. as he worked in Resistance France helping rescue Jews. Perhaps Griffin's humility causes him to omit some of these details, but I would have liked to have understood Griffin himself a bit more, to have known how he came to the decision to live as a black man. Regardless of its minor faults, Black Like Me, a veritable cry for compassion toward one another, is a true &quot;must-read&quot;--it has my very highest recommendation.",
                    "I just read an incredible book. It is called, Black Like Me. The author, John Howard Griffin tells about his accounts of taking skin pigments to change his Caucasian body to African-American. This is one of the few books out there in today's literature that gives a true account of what life is for an African-American male living in the south in the late 50's early 60's. Griffin, a journalistic man, went out on this experiment to get a story but instead of getting a story he got a life long lesson. This is a story where it is more then putting yourself in their shoes. You are they, you live their life and you understand what they always talk about. The details in this book, come out and grab you. While reading this book you will not want to put it down because you as the reader are always waiting to see what happens next. This may shock you because it cannot be found in any history or biographic book. It is a story you can understand because it comes from a person who entered a life they never experienced before. It makes you believe that you were there and maybe now you have a little more understanding of what African-Americans deal with then and now. This is a must read book because you will not find this anywhere else and it is a fact that we need to learn. We cannot hide from this any longer, we need to come to reality and face it.",
                    "I read this book in the early 1980s when I was a teenager and recently picked it up again. While not having quite the impact and eloquence of Richard Wright's \"Black Boy\" or anything by Ralph Ellison, this is an interesting contribution to the essays and commentaries on race in the Deep South in the early 1960's.The premise is something of a gimmick in some ways, although very seriously intentioned, but one that works like this: a middle aged white man, who also happens to be a writer and commentator on race, \"blackens\" his skin with medical pigmentation procedures and stain. It all sounds quite rudimentary, but it appears that this combination allowed him to pass for a black man for a period of about six weeks in the deepest parts of the American South. He actually switches back and forth between white and black society over that period, and the differences in treatment are astounding, but also expected.While this is a useful part of writings of the 1960s race issues, I could not help feeling that the plight of the black race was deeper of course than Griffin was able to go: he could always opt out of his situation and reappear as a white man. While he experienced some of the feelings of hopelessness and violation that was part of the daily life of the black person in 1960, he also could escape it at any time. This book is arguably superficial in that respect since it deals with race on an emotional level - how Griffin felt, how people felt about him, what he experienced while temporarily black. While this is a valiant and noble effort, I doubt that anyone who has not completely walked for a lifetime in the shoes of a race victim can truly feel the impact of racism. I say this as someone who is white. In the end, I admire what Griffin set out to expose, and he probably has done much good by so doing, but the impact to me was considerably less than from reading Wright or Ellison.",
                    "John Howard Griffin, after convincing a doctor to make his skin darker using a combination of pills and tanning beds, lived for a month in various places in the South as an African American. When this book, which is essentially his journal of that time, was published in 1959, I imagine this was groundbreaking and also extremely controversial. Griffin's simple descriptions of the way he is treated as a white man and the way he is treated as a black man speak volumes about race relations in our country.By its nature, the book/journal meanders a little, but I found Griffin's musings after the story is publicly known particularly thoughtful and incisive: \"The mail poured in, hearteningly favorable and moving. Most people in other areas, including the Deep South, understood, though the situation remained uncomfortable at home. Our townspeople wanted to 'keep things peaceful' at all costs. They said I had 'stirred things up.' This is laudable and tragic. I, too, say let us be peaceful; but the only way to do this is first to assure justice. By keeping 'peaceful' in this instance, we end up consenting to the destruction of all peace - for so long as we condone injustice by a small but powerful group, we condone the destruction of all social stability, all real peace, all trust in man's good intentions toward his fellow man.\"Recommended for its unique and interesting perspective on the lives of Americans.",
                    "Being a Black man and reading this and not having lived during that time period, I now understand my parents generation and my grandparents as well. People tend to get caught up in the idea that this was only the South. The issue is that the South was the worst place you could be. People who often write reviews neglect the fact that Black people experienced these things all over the country to varying degrees. Of course there were no Jim Crowe laws or Whites only signs but subtle racism or hidden racism can sometimes be worse than the blatant. At least in the South my ancestors knew where they stood and if they fought the system, they knew who to fight.With that said, this has tremendous bearing on today's African American. You cannot excuse the crimes of 50 years ago as simply history. The affects on my granparents and parents generation has played a major impact on what is happening today both with Black people and White. Remember, some of the same people in office then are in office now or have children in office. It will take generations for things to change if ever they do.",

Ancheta demonstrates how United States civil rights laws have been framed by a black-white model of race that typically ignores the experiences of other groups, including Asian Americans. When racial discourse is limited to antagonisms between black and white, Asian Americans often find themselves in a racial limbo, marginalized or unrecognized as full participants. Ancheta examines legal and social theories of racial discrimination, ethnic differences in the Asian American population, nativism, citizenship, language, school desegregation, and affirmative action. In the second edition of this influential book, Ancheta also covers post-9/11 anti-Asian sentiment and racial profiling. He analyzes recent legal cases involving political empowerment, language rights, human trafficking, immigrant rights, and affirmative action in higher education--many of which move the country farther away from the ideals of racial justice. On a more positive note, he reports on the progress Asian Americans have made in the corporate sector, politics, the military, entertainment, and academia. A skillful mixture of legal theories, court cases, historical events, and personal insights, this second edition brings fresh insights to U.S. civil rights from an Asian American perspective.",

                    "Why America Should See More than Black &amp; White By Samuel R. CacasRace, Rights &amp; The Asian American Experience By Angelo N. Ancheta, Rutgers University Press: 1998, 224 pp, Hardcover.While taking a civil rights class in law school during the late 1970s, I felt cheated by what I felt was a significant gap in the course and text material which almost exclusively focused on the achievements for and by African Americans. As a very politically conscious Asian American in college, I knew that while immigrant groups like Asians were a very minuscule minority population-wise in this country, they had still made a significant contribution to the eradication of &quot;Jim Crow&quot; policies and other racial segregation laws.And I would often expound on such contributions during class. For instance, the Yick Wo v. Hopkins case - in which a Chinese American laundry owner in San Francisco successfully sued to overturn a racially discriminatory city ordinance - has been cited in countless legal briefs and court cases involving the Fourteenth Amendment1s Equal Protection clause. Or U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark which has long been the major legal precedent establishing birthright citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment. While my civil rights teacher and fellow classmates were warm and respectful to my tendencies, I still felt the contributions of non-Black minority groups deserved to be covered more thoroughly in print. So reading civil rights lawyer Angelo Ancheta's &quot;Race, Rights &amp; The Asian American Experience&quot; was a refreshing affirmation of my daily, righteous meanderings in that civil rights class. Ancheta pulls no punches in citing his motivation for writing this ground-breaking text on civil rights and race relations. In the books preface, he relates his racial experiences growing up in San Francisco during the 1960s: racist landlords that limited the sections of the city where his family could live, discriminatory employment practices which prevented ! his parents from the career they desired, and the endless anti-Asian racial taunts he endured throughout elementary and high school. And even when such experiences receded as he grew older, Ancheta was still exposed to significant, though subtle, forms of racism such as law school classmates who marveled that Ancheta - a second generation, American-born Filipino American - could not understand Chinese or Japanese. The book's bifurcated focus - how Asian Americans are affected by civil rights laws and how civil rights laws are affected by Asian Americans - forms the basis for why all Americans should read this book even if they are not of Asian descent. If anything, they will come away with a more encompassing mind-set on civil rights that accommodates the racial experiences of the fastest-growing minority group in this country. A major polemic addressed throughout the book is the problem that civil rights protections available to Asian Americans are most often contingent upon the rights granted to African Americans. In effect, says Ancheta, Asian Americans &quot;have been treated primarily as constructive blacks,&quot; forced to make &quot;unseemly, curious choices&quot; when they sue for their civil rights, such as asserting that they are white in order to attend the best public schools. But Ancheta emphasizes that periods where Asian Americans were treated by courts as &quot;honorary whites&quot; were &quot;short-lived and more unusual.&quot; And not always beneficial. The recent exclusion of Asian Americans from affirmative action programs due to their repeatedly being lumped with whites is an example of the latter, according to Ancheta, even where &quot;Asian American still face racial discrimination and remain underrepresented.&quot; Such exclusions are built into all civil rights protections and policies which are premised largely premised on the color discrimination premised on the treatment of African Americans. While such bias may apply to Asian Americans, Ancheta contends, the stigma! of being labeled foreign-born - even if one is American-born - has been one of the primary bases for Asians in this country being the target of hate violence, media-based stereotypes, as well as benefit-entitlement laws like California's Proposition 187 premised on citizenship, among others. Anchetas solutions for such racial inequities which feed on the anti-Asian tendencies in the law and among most Americans is very concrete: develop new laws or amend old ones that rely on theories that comprehend the complexity of race relations beyond the black-white racial paradigm. Essentially this means including immigration status in hate crime laws. As well as recognizing that discrimination can be based on ethnicity and being labeled and treated as foreign-born, not just race. In asserting such remedies where the interracial friction involves African Americans as victimizers, such as the current conflicts occurring between Asian Americans and African Americans in San Francisco's housing projects, Ancheta encourages transracial, innovative solutions such as the Asian Law Caucus suing the city housing authority instead of racially targeting individual tenants. After all, he posits, &quot;expanding the civil rights agenda to include Asian Americans cannot come at the expense of African Americans.&quot; While presented in tightly written, sometimes analytical prose, this book could probably be well understood to the average lay person not well-versed in the law. Many of the principles Ancheta expounds on are based on real-life stories that Ancheta and other Asian Americans have lived. Stories, along with perspectives, often missing in the media1s coverage of important issues such as immigration, affirmative action, and hate violence. Their absence in headlines as well as history books are complemented by the laws insensitivity to immigrant groups such as Asian Americans. And Ancheta addresses that insensitivity very eloquently."

                    "Picking up mid-stream, in what can only be called America's sublimated and unacknowledged dialectic racial wars, these authors use the struggles of the 1960s as a backdrop for exploring and then extrapolating racial issues into the future. With it, and an analysis based on a Gramsci model of hegemony, they have greatly enriched the vocabulary for trans-racial discourse.Importantly, and borrowing from the field of social criticism, they introduce the notion of a \"racial project,\" a more or less tribal mechanism for advancing group motivated racial interests. And in doing so, they greatly clarify many ideas about racial thinking that had previously been overlooked or remained dormant or inaccessible to the lay mind. With skillful use of this and related concepts, these authors are able to open up new spaces for a much expanded dialogue on race, one that slowly begins to pull away the barely hidden veil (in the subtext of our collective complicity) that maintains a blind eye to the role \"being white\" plays in defending the hierarchy and the prerogatives of the \"white racial project.\"Their main theoretical concern here is with social meanings and with attaining a true sense of social balance: the way we understand, explain, and behave with racial justice and empathy within U.S. society. Their innovation is to frame the dialectic of race as an exercise in negotiating between competing \"racial projects,\" each of which comes to us with their own sets of foundational assumptions and their own behavioral repertoire, and with their own implicit hierarchies. The whole contraption, when taken together, is coterminous with U.S. society.Thus, those who are either born into U.S. society, or who might have immigrated here, whether they want to be or not, find themselves inserted into a \"complex racialized stew\" that has an ongoing history of messy confrontations. Yet, this struggle is what constitutes the social structure of American society. The unwritten imperative is that one entering the U.S. must quickly learn to sink or swim in the swift moving racial currents, which is a \"life-or-social death\" struggle about racial meanings. Failure to learn quickly enough to negotiate the implicit rules of engagement in the U.S., even in 2012, is equivalent to consigning oneself to a likely early social death.In sum, these authors argue essentially that race is a social construct given expression through ongoing political, cultural and especially our ever-changing ideological struggles. The primary dialectic is between the white race (or tribe) and challenging races (or tribes). The \"white racial project\" tends to view the struggle as a zero-sum affair: anything gained by one race can only come at the expense of long-held illicit white racial prerogatives, therefore white resistance (which is also illicit) has been folded into the American norm. Non-white races, on the other hand, see the struggle as a negotiation about fairness, and ultimately about how the U.S. will eventually live up to the full tenets of its founding principles.Surprisingly, these authors are optimistic about America society finally although begrudgingly, opening itself and the dialectic up to morally-driven negotiations about racial fairness and incremental changes in the meaning of race vis-a-vis the U.S. Constitution and American culture more generally. And in this sense, the struggle best can be characterized as a multi-generational dialectic about the meaning and defense of white privilege as it gets played out over time. A resolution of this dialectic and these negotiations will define what the contract containing the ultimate meaning of America will be.This struggle for national meaning takes place daily, within private minds as well as publicly out in the open, and is one that totally absorbs and envelops U.S. social consciousness. It is the unwritten rules and assumptions about race and proper racial behavior,that constitute the contract that makes up America's \"common sense.\" Knowing how to properly and smoothly negotiate the rules of race still defines what it means \"to be American.\"In contemporary American politics, since the 1990s, the battle about race has become a more sublimated one expressed mostly through \"coded\" ideological language and discourse. Invariably this discourse is an emotionally heated and yet cryptic one, that today is framed as being about \"cultural,\" \"family\" or differences in values. But as this book suggests, the truth is that all these issues are \"coded language\" that eventually vectors back to one issue: the respective \"racial projects\" of the color coded tribes. The racial project that hold the keys to America's racial dictatorship and thus to America's future, is of course, the \"White racial project.\"I believe these authors essentially get it right when, following Gramsci, they suggest that America has, since the Civil War, been a white run cultural hegemony, in short, a \"white racial dictatorship.\" They exhibit the historical evidence that supports this view. For instance, they show that from America's founding fathers up through the civil war an attempt was made to enshrine as \"common sense,\" the understanding that what it means to be American is to focus exclusively on only one \"racial project:\" the one that put into place many of the evils of American society: things such as the racial meanings that limit the full participation in American society of dark-skinned races, blacks in particular. It is this racial project that suggests that blacks still remain barely human and thus their continued denigration is always justified. At the same time that it is denigrating blacks, the \"white racial project\" also is trying to justify and rationalize what became (in the aftermath of D.W. Griffith's movie \"Birth of a Nation), \"One White nation United under a racist God\" and a white \"racial and cultural dictatorship.\"This is a challenging book but well worth the effort.

The authors firs show us the way the conclusions reached in the press are not supported by the data used to support them. The paper begins by asking this question: Two fifty-year-old men arrive at an emergency room with acute chest pain. One is white and the other black. Will they receive the same quality of treatment and have the same chance of recovery?By the end of the book you will realize the false assumptions within this question and why it is inadequate to get at the real issues involved in the healthcare system and the way race is and is not a factor. Just as one example, if I told you that black patients had lower rates of cardiac catheterization that white patients and that if their attending physician was white the rate was 38.4 for black patients while 45.7 for white, would that lead you to believe this was strong evidence of racial bias? How does that change when you learn that if the attending physician is black the rates are 38.2 for black patients and 49.6 for white? To bend your mind even further, what if I told you that the OUTCOMES - the survivor rate is not different between the two groups of patients for three years after a heart attack. (This does not address quality of life whether treated or not, just whether you live or not.)As the authors show us various aspects of the problem we learn that there is a lot more correlation between where patients live, the socio-economic class, their wealth or poverty, their education, the quality of hospitals, and the quality of the network of physicians available to their primary care physician that any concept of physician racial bias. And, yes, blacks do have poorer care and, for example, poor glycemic control, but trying to address the real issues by crying racial bias a waste of resources as well as creating more problems that get in the way of rectifying the situation.This is an interesting paper and is not long. I recommend it to anyone who wants to think seriously about this issue and get evidence to help him or her see past the obscurantists who make a living drumming up racial conflict to the cost of us all.",

Delving into a deeply profound investigation of the realities for which patients really are treated, The Health Disparities Myth comprehensively guides readers through its exclusive perceptive analysis of health care, race, socioeconomic, geographic, and ethnic factors in the fair or otherwise treatment of hospital patients.

                    "I received the book in great condition with all of the specifications that were promised to me.Took a little bit longer than promised to be shipped, but still didn't take TOO long.",
                    "I find it rather interesting and puzzling that the authors suggest that a focus on relative rather than absolute measures of care is narrow-minded, while in my opinion it's exactly the opposite. So, both black and white patients receive better care now than 20 years ago but, for example, black infant mortality not only still lags behind white infant mortality, it fell even further behind (i.e., it's higher). We should be glad that progress is being made for both groups, but we should also worry about why one group continues to fall behind the other, and not just ignore that fact because \"absolute\" levels of care are better for everyone.Another example: the authors complain that when comparing diabetes testing between two clinics (one in the Bronx and one in DC), a \"narrow judgement\" would focus on the fact that blacks received worse care than whites in both clinics, while ignoring the fact that both blacks and whites received better testing in the DC clinic than blacks and whites in the Bronx clinic. I don't see how the first is narrow judgement, absolute levels of care may be better in the DC clinic than in the Bronx clinic but it still does not negate the fact that in BOTH clinics blacks received worse care than whites.BTW, this last example, given in the Introduction of the book, contradicts much of the book's premise that health disparities have been found because blacks and whites live in different areas and \"do not visit the same population of physicians\". Ahem... your example discusses black and white patients attending the SAME clinics!"

Perhaps he meant police dogs and oppression but I suspect he meant a different kind of oppression. It was something I'd been thinking about myself, anyway. The sort of 'shut up about your problems, only women/blacks/indians have real problems, so sit down and get back to work', coupled, perhaps, with an unconscious feeling of superiority engendered whenever the same newspapers print women's/blacks/indians sad tales of woe? Wilmot Robertson doesn't really explain what he means here. It seemed like an important passage in the book.Most of the book, however, is about race itself or examining whites as victims of racism. As far as I know, he was one of the first to say it's over for whites in North America (no doubt the idea goes against his deeply ingrained feelings of white supremacy) just a joke there. To me the Dispossessed Majority seemed racist itself. I was glad to hear Robertson broaching many of the topics examined in The Dispossessed Majority anyway. I was Ok with the racism in a way too - one time I thought a black guy might steal my lunch money and I was pretty scared. For me it was racist, and I think on an unconscious level, or at least it was racist, to me (and my mind could construe it no other way - perhaps in the way visual ticks can sometimes fool the mind) because Robertson spends so much times examining differences between groups of whites. Another reviewer notes that Robertson claims Greeks and Italians cannot assimilate with other whites? If Robertson thinks this about whites, what must he think of Blacks and Indians and Asians? Perhaps my take on this is wrong and Robertson is just doing 'the same thing Blacks, Indians and Asians do', promoting his own race and objecting to injustices (something that is far more needed)?In one passage of the book Robertson claims racial activist groups are natural or desirable and a good thing. Since only races of color have these groups active. . . (and this is still true 30 years later), to me, it seemed like all Robertson was trying to do is endorse these activist groups of color. It seemed like a kind of responsible-conservatism. We don't want the crazies mad at activists of color. . . It wouldn't have done you much good this past 30 years or so.One reviewer compared Robertson to Karl Marx. He seemed to be promoting Robertson in his review, or he had his own 'new-racist' view to promote. Perhaps 'babysitter' might be a more appropriate word to use than 'reviewer'? It was a very good review and flattering to Robertson and a sort of 'racist' world view. I suppose even us racists should feel good about ourselves if only for a time, at least, for the world to be a better place to live in. Ironically, the ideas in this one review may be all the proof needed to back up Robertson's thesis. . . Wilmot Roberston is genuinely being compared to Karl Marx, in an effort to legitimize Robertson. Robertson claims a liberal/minority coalition has taken control of America's institutions. Leftists, for whatever reason, at least right now, generally work against the interests of whites. Sure, people of color in the US need help (although many of these groups do much better than average) and leftists, more than most, work to do that. But no one identifies the needs of whites in the USA, quite the opposite. One could argue whites are being dehumanized. It seems important that only white evil be identified. Anything else might be racism (including any values or standards?). Robertson notes leftists in particular work against the interests of whites but he may not be conservative himself. There's a sort of objectivity in much of the work.Racism is a broad topic. A more libertarian view might be that simply discussing race, any kind of racial activism, is the very definition of racism. Others, perhaps a majority, would prefer that opposition to affirmative action policies be considered racism or even 'white supremacy'. I don't feel racism is unique to the Western world. Or rather superiority works in more than one direction. To me, its seems as though people of color, even those living hundreds of miles from the nearest white person, believe they are morally superior to whites. Perhaps it's the only thing that civilizes them. I suspect many of them feel superior to whites in other ways also. It's understandable those outside the West would blame the West for their problems or problems in the world but the seat of this ideology (everything people of color do is good, everything whites do is bad) seems to be in the West itself. Perhaps it's only neighborly we allow them to feel at home. We are inviting them to colonize what were formerly 'our' lands. There is still a white supremacy idea out there, I think. It's sold every time a telemarketer sends out one of those Nigerian e-mails scams. Perhaps whites are seen as privileged (evil) Gods who can't be harmed. Perhaps for the most part they don't think of us at all. Another reviewer claimed whites are sort of raceless in a society where race is given great importance. Perhaps we're all now compartmentalized along lines of race and sex where we each believe in completely separate realities?I have to admit, though I read the whole book, it was a chore, and there was a fair amount of day dreaming and skimming on my part too no doubt. Robertson managed to write a very boring book on a very interesting topic. Another reviewer called The Dispossessed Majority Tendentious. Though I haven't read it, I would recommend his follow up, The Ethnostate, ahead this one. The title page here on Amazon boasts 150,000 copies sold but I wonder about that. I got my copy from the university library. A book can be a best seller just from library sales, not to mention 'selling' books to a store (or yourself under a different name) that just sit there? They may still be trying to sell them! The Dispossessed Majority was just sitting there on the library shelf where I picked it out (had never heard of it before). There must be a racist section to the Dewey Decimal system. It's been over 20 years since I've read it but decided to try and do the review. In all honesty I felt The Dispossessed Majority struggled to earn 3 stars. Because of the author's efforts at tackling a difficult subject, even broaching the subject, and perhaps because he's providing quite a different viewpoint, I give it 4 stars. Actually, I'm going to ignore my personal prejudices. Wilmot Robertson may be exactly right on everything he says. What do I know? 5 stars. Then deduct a point for it being just another voice of the multicult.There are a number of very good quotes in the book. I think The Dispossessed Majority would be of most use to journalists. Those who always attempt to get both sides of every story in their reports. When these topics come up in the news it would be one way to present the opposing view, something that might not be easy to find. Do I think think Journalists have actually used The Dispossessed Majority. . . It would be of secondary importance to university students. It would be a chance to show your university professor your ability to explore different sources. It could be a way to show you understand the 'racists' and know how to cut them down a peg or two (in an objective manner, of course).I don't think The Dispossessed Majority would convert anyone. Perhaps at most leave a reader wondering if whites might have interests of their own, too. . . and isn't that the real danger? A little moment of sarcasm here near the end. . . If the Dispossessed Majority does convert you somehow I do have a word of caution. It would be best to take a vaguely left of center stance in your paper. The same stance that appears in the course material and is likely being copied by the other students in their papers? Isn't that what every student does?",
                    "The book arrived very speedily, in the condition it was described as being. Amazon is a very good method of making purchases of new and used books as there ever was. I couldn't be more satisfied with the service.",
                    "Thought this would be a good book based on the reviews but it was just white supremacy ideology polished up the best it could be.",
                    "I bought Wilmot Robertson's \"The Dispossessed Majority\" thinking I'd learn new things about anthropology and gain some political insights from a very learned man. In addition, I had read in an online review that Mr. Robertson felt some European groups (e.g., Spaniards, southern Italians, Greeks) were unassimilable in American society, so this piqued my interest in his writings.I found the book to be well-written by an obviously cultivated man, but the book is very biased and draws arbitrary conclusions under the guise of scientific methodology. For example, Mr. Robertson asserts that Italian Americans and Greek Americans are not assimilable because of their pigmentation. He concludes this by falling into the proverbial racialist trap of projecting his own color sensitivites onto those he considers a part of his ingroup (i.e., Northern and Central Europeans).This thinking goes against the common sense understanding of most people, including, presumably, demographers and sociologists, that Italian and Greek Americans, especially the former, have already been assimilated into the American mainstream. We see this in the popularity and the esteem men such as Rudy Giuliani, Joe DiMaggio, John Travolta, Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando, and other successful Italian Americans who have shaped the popular culture, are held. Right now 2 out of 9 Supreme Court justices are Italian American. It is said Italian Americans have a higher per capita income than the general population. In short, Mr. Robertson's claim that Italian Americans, and other Southern European groups, are unassimilable is not supported by evidence. Yet, astonishingly, despite the influence Italian Americans have had on the popular culture, especially with their numbers, he concludes that Alpines and Dinarics from Southeast Europe are assimilable, presumably because of their somewhat lighter pigmentation, even though their influence on American culture has been significantly less.Mr. Robertson also has a difficult time accepting that Jewish Americans score higher on IQ tests than Americans of Northern European descent, claiming that Jewish IQ comparisons with White Americans of non-Jewish background are unfair or inaccurate because of the way Southern Europeans and possibly non-Whites counted as Whites are lumped into the White category. His one study cited to the contrary, Jewish Americans have fairly consistently outscored White Americans generally, and their IQs have also consistently beaten the nations of Northern Europe with relatively homogeneous societies. Kevin MacDonald, author of \"The Culture of Critique,\" has no such difficulty accepting the IQ superiority of Jews, and in fact bases much of his theory on intergroup competition on IQ differentials such as those between Jews and non-Jews of European descent, in which Jews are seen to have a clear advantage.There are other problems with the book, such as his categorization of two-thirds of the White population as \"Nordic.\" He manipulates the facts gathered by physical anthropologists in a way which suits his political wishes. He writes about Nordic aesthetic superiority without seeming to realize that few White Americans, even of Northern European descent, are Nordic in the sense that Carleton Coon and other physical anthropologists used the term.These are just a few problems with the book. I decided to stop reading the book half way, because it was time-consuming and much too tendentious for my taste. Reading a book is like an investment in terms of time, and I felt I wasn't getting enough value for my time. From what I understand, Mr. Robertson changed some of his views as he realized over time that the revolution he anticipated would not come, due to American complacency. Like I have mentioned, he projected his racialism onto his arbitrary ingroup.Mr. Robertson's erudite manner of expression and his racial biases will ensure that among a certain hard-core minority his legacy as a thinker will live on. Among anthropologists, even those who do not resort to knee-jerk name-calling, many flaws in the book will be found and he will thus be relegated to the status of a political, though impassioned, crank.Given the nature of racial politics, I suspect those praising the book are predisposed to praise it merely because their own biases are supported in the book. Likewise, as Mr. Robertson writes, those from racial outgroups are bound to attack ideas such as his own. How do we transcend this seemingly deterministic conundrum? One way to do this is to resort to the impersonal Western scientific method, in which case I'm afraid Mr. Robertson comes up short.",
                    "Mr. Robertson is a very good writer and his individual assertions in this book are carefully made and supported.But his overall thesis has been proven wrong by time - and specifically by immigration to the U.S.His thesis essentially, is that white, Northern Europeans created what he calls American &quot;culture&quot;. And that these people are the barometer of the cultural and moral condition of America. White America is like a caged canary in a coal mine. If it is sick or dead - then it's time for the everybody to get out of the mine.But Mr. Robertson's book was written before the internet. It was written even before PC's became a household fixture. It was written before the world became wired.Now, the US has tens of thousands of hi-tech engineers and doctors from India, China and the Middle East.They are not Northern Europeans. So the question is: Are they contributing to the decline of the West? Or are they helping America and Western culture continue to prosper?I argue the latter. And if that is the case, Mr. Robertson's thesis has been proven wrong by time.Mr. Robertson's book may have been right for the time in which it was written, the 1960's, 1970's and early 1980's. These years saw the ascendency of many nutty liberal ideas like affirmative action and race quota, white guilt and the rest of that garbage.But the world has left those ideas behind. Chinese medical doctors or research scientists do not need race quotas. Indian software engineers do not need them either.It is a new world. And I thank God that America is drawing the best people the world has to offer. It's the best hope for our future.",
                    "The Dispossessed Majority is a book about the decline of American culture, and the related declines in all western nations. The author, Wilmot Robertson, posits the cause of this decline on the decline of the white majority in America, the values and culture of which built the miracle of American industry, law and society. In direct and refreshing contrast to most other writers, Robertson states that the &quot;majority culture&quot; drew its greatness not only from historical experience, but from biological pre tendencies among Europeans toward individualism and tolerance. He develops an argument that the Euro-American respect for human rights and dignity are being abused and subverted by other races in our midst for financial and political gain. Drawing from painstaking and detailed research into politics, science, art, anthropology, crime, law, and science, Robertson demonstrates this point conclusively. He suggests that European people must regain our sense of group consciousness, our &quot;racism&quot; as it were, in order to resurrect our cultures. His command of the English language and the powerful, and often inspiring writing of the book in almost without parallel in these times. Many, of course, have been quick to dismiss Robertson as a bigot and a racist, but in reading the book, I found that many of Robertson's assertions were carefully reasoned, with recurrent emphasis on the necessity of finding peaceful resolutions to interracial strife. In his defense of whites, Robertson is doing exactly the same things as black, Hispanic, or Asian defense groups are doing, and it will only be a matter of time before his currently suppressed views become widespread.",
                    "This is the most accurate and detailed explanation ever offered on why the political interests of Whites are sliding downhill fast, even though this book places very little emphasis on the solutions for turning the situation around. For that part of the picture, those who buy this book should also read Robertson's \"The Ethnostate.\" Despite that and other efforts from Robertson, his supporters did not succeed in constructing an Ethnostate.That's not because he or they were wrong, though, it's because ordinary and less intellectual Whites were never given down-to-earth explanations on where they fit into the building process. Had Robertson spoken about organizing political communities on a more modest level, similar to how hippies, gays, Chinese, and others built their political communities in San Francisco, his own people would probably have succeeded. To put it in Nathan Bedford Forrest's terms, they would have become those who got there \"the first-ist with the most-ist.\"The organization which actually has that honor may be the American Friends of the British National Party in Virginia, as they use Robertson-esque terminology for their process of building \"Pioneer Little Europe(s)\" on a neighborhood level. It's getting a much better response, even with much less effort, because everyone sees what they can personally do right away. Now even Robertson's idealistic and far-reaching vision has a chance to rise up on their cornerstone of hard logic.",
                    "The American scene when turned upside down and examined carefully is a desperate and ugly one. This book presents an intellectually honest composite of underlying truths and facts that will determine the fate of this country and then the World. This book should be read carefully and with the thought that it is not as readily available as the less reasearched but more widely accepted information that influenes most American's thoughts.",
                    "This is a remarkable book.Its thesis, documented in exhaustive and fascinating detail, is that white Americans, whom the author refers to as \"the Majority,\" or \"Majority members\" (terminology no doubt inspired by Richard Nixon's famous phrase, \"the Silent Majority\"), have had their nation and culture hijacked from them by \"the liberal-minority coalition.\" Admittedly, such euphemistic terminology, appropriate at the time of the book's initial publication in 1972, seems less persuasive today. In no sense can whites realistically be regarded as a \"Majority,\" demographically, economically, politically, or culturally, anymore.The copy on the dust flaps reads, \"In part an elegy, in part a galvanic recall to greatness, this mind-rousing book hammers home the theme that America has changed for the worse because its once dominant population group, the Americans of Northern European descent, the Majority, has been reduced to second-class status. It is racked by the moral debility of liberalism and the rampant virus of minority racism, which have diluted its group consciousness. Sick to the point of moral disintegration, the Majority has become the loser in a racial war. Since the liberal-minority coalition has emerged victorious on all fronts, it is not an overstatement to describe the losers as the Dispossessed Majority. Those who are assuming control of the United States have a long history of failure in the art of civilization. As always, what they cannot measure up to, they are driven to destroy. The regeneration of a dying people is an all-or-nothing mission that will strain Majority capabilities to the limit.\"The biological substrate of race is analyzed via old-style physical anthropology rather than the (then) emerging field of population genetics. \"Race was still the unspeakable historical determinant, although the loudest denouncers and deniers of race were, as always, the biggest racists.\" The thrust of the book, however, is overwhelmingly cultural--culture as refracted through the prism of race--in its approach, and it is this aspect which makes it one-of-a-kind, written not from an anti-white or non-white point of view like all other books on the market, but by and for the dispossessed majority itself. If you're white, it stimulates awareness--a consciousness of what it means to be white. Possibly the only other book that comes close to achieving the same effect is Madison Grant's classic The Conquest of a Continent (1933).Starting with the biology and metaphysics of race, the author analyzes the racial composition of the U.S. (there is even a now-outdated but still illuminating racial census, the only one in recent times to enumerate the major divisions of the white race in America), encompassing two categories of white ethnics, the \"assimilable\" (Irish, Slavs, Hungarians, French Canadians, Finns and Balts) and the \"unassimilable\" (Albanians, Romanians, Bulgarians, southern Italians, Cubans, Basques, Iberians, Greeks, Turks, Arabs, Iranians, Armenians and Jews)--as well as unassimilable non-whites such as Negroes, Indians, and Mexicans. \"While Assimilable Minorities generally have culture working against them but race working for them in the assimilation process, the Mediterranean minorities have culture and race working against them.\" A chapter fifty pages in length is devoted to the Jews due to their out-sized role in the dissolution of the Majority population.Art, religion, education, liberalism, conservatism, democracy, economics, crime, law, foreign policy, and nuclear war are examined in light of their underlying racial and ethnic components. The chapter entitled \"The Split in the Ranks\" categorizes anti-white whites as \"Gracchites\" (aristocrats like FDR and the Rockefellers), \"Trucklers\" (politicians and journalists like Hubert Humphrey and Benjamin Bradlee), \"Pussyfooters\" (don't-rock-the-boat businessmen, professionals, and academics), \"Old Believers\" (honest but misguided liberals like journalist Dorothy Thompson, historian Charles Beard, and the Quakers), and \"Proditors\" (traitors like John Brown, Alger Hiss, and Jane Fonda).Three separate editions of the book (1972, 1976, 1981) exist in hardcover and softcover formats, as does an abridged paperback edition lacking the invaluable footnotes. So it's desirable to know which one you're buying. (This review is based upon the 1981 Third Revised Edition.) Despite an extremely effective campaign of suppression waged against the book, including exclusion from trade distribution channels, newspapers and magazines refusing to review it and bookstores to stock it, and even denial of paid advertising space, it has sold approximately 200,000 copies to date.The pseudonymous author, who died in 2005, operated a small, privately-owned publishing firm, Howard Allen Enterprises, in Cape Canaveral, Florida. He also authored two other books--Ventilations (1974; rev. ed. 1982), a slender volume of stimulating essays, and The Ethnostate (1992). From 1975 to 2000 Robertson edited and published the monthly magazine Instauration. It and the unrelated William L. Pierce-era National Vanguard magazine (1970-1997) constituted the premier radical intellectual underground periodicals of the racialist movement in the United States in the last quarter of the twentieth century.The density and fineness of The Dispossessed Majority's text, enhanced by over 1,291 footnotes, appendixes, bibliography, and a comprehensive index, makes it an absorbing source of information, the sort of book you'll consult again and again.\"At all events,\" the author writes, \"the Majority will soon be out of limbo. There is nowhere for it to go but up--or all the way down.\" The book's admonitory epigraph is from T. S. Eliot's \"East Coker\" in Four Quartets:In order to possess what you do not possessYou must go by the way of dispossession.",
                    "I met the late Wilmot Robertson (real name: Humphrey Ireland) in 1990 in his home in the North Carolina mountains and found him a sterling gentleman. Let me say as a person proud of my Irish and Keltic genes that I think his critique of the Irish-American role in the Left (partly illustrated by the Kennedy family) was fair and accurate. The Irish have become such rooters for the \"underdog\" that they often have been at the forefront of supporting Blacks, Jews and others against the white majority, and aiding in its dispossession. It is urgent that Irish-Americans realize that it is WE WHITES who are now \"the underdog\" and our compassion must be for them, for our own people, whose backs are now to the wall.",
                    "For those born after the assassination of President Kennedy, and who therefore, can't connect the dots to the sweeping changes made in the wake of his death, this is a must read. Predictably, those who have benefitted by tax-supported \"scholarships,\" and \"immigration payoffs,\" including government appointments and other of the jobs that comprise the now 45% tax-supported government jobs, \"disagree\" with this book. Often, they only want to make a case for their own contributions post-1963. In a sense, while xenophobic and self-centered of such people who only care about themselves, their \"opportunities,\" and in telling others how valuable they are, they show their own colors in saying what they do.In the end, though, it's really a book written for the ethnic European and especially Northern cultures. They have been more than \"simply displaced,\" as massive policy changes made after the assassination were never really explained to the children. Some of the confusion known in those early years has dissipated--- when young children were simply thrust into Marxist-Freudian ways of being that felt alien to them, propagandized for \"Zero Population Growth,\" and so on. That 100 million new population was brought in--- against a backdrop of telling the generational Americans not to \"reproduce\" b/c the planet could not sustain them, and many other such conundrums begins to be clarified in new ways.Many who lived through massive confusions in the 60s/70s are slowly finding footing, since the players have become visible, the theories that so harmed many people and their families available for them to read as adults--- while many \"rights\" they thought they once had (such as to reproduce children), or to \"life,\" or \"liberty\" or \"happiness,\" has become felt by many to be a thing of the past.While the 100 million newcomers may be very pleased, and to come to such a place directly after taxes were instituted from 1% to 50% and now with the idea it will be 70% (with the new debt)--- is interesting to watch.It seems that others would wish to vote for slavery--- a wage-debt slavery that North Europeans forged a constitution to actually make impossible. They had thought the Welfare State was a thing of ANCIENT history, only to have other populations brought who would want it.",
                    "This book while excellent can sometimes be construed to have white suprecist material. But the author writes many things which are true. Many of the subjects he talks about have come full circle and are true today. Similar to what Pat Buchanan said years ago where people called him crazy, when in fact, everything Pat Buchanan said would come true has come to pass. Back to the book, it's a very long read, but in the end it's worth it for the detailed knowledge the writer has put forth. There's a reason it's out of publication, MANY people do not want you to know the truth! Buy it as you can get it very inexpensive used.",
                    "This book should be on the bookshelf of every European-American, and of every student of political science/social science/urban studies/etc.Don't buy this book if you're a narrow-minded \"liberal\" (you might not like it).",
                    "Every college student is bound to learn sooner or later that if you're going to be considered an educated person, you have to understand that Marx held the magic idea that explains society--social class. History is the struggle of the poor against the wealthy.Every educated person is familiar with Marx, but only the rarest individual has ever heard of Wilmot Robertson, one man (among others) who was much closer to the mark when he wrote in The Dispossessed Majority that history is the struggle of ethnic groups. The most cursory look at our past shows a clear pattern of conflict among groups, each seeing themselves as a \"people.\"Robertson carefully documents how social and political trends in 20th century America were the victories of a coalition of minority groups over the majority. His evidence is strong, and his insights are often stunning.Unfortunately he makes a wrong turn when he answers the question of how to empower the majority and return society to a healthy course. Since he sees ethnic conflict as so fundamental and so costly, he recommends that America separate along ethnic lines into several nation-states.At this point, the otherwise tough-minded Robertson becomes the pie-in-the-sky utopian. And what's more, he abandons the sense of fairness he often showed in the earlier part of his analysis. Tens of millions of minority citizens love America and would never leave it unless they were expelled, and as citizens they have a right not to be pushed out of their own country.Ethnic competition is real and an important part of multiethnic societies, but the wiser recommendation to America's white majority is that they need to understand how they have interests as a group and that they have every right to protect those interests just like every other group does, but that such an awareness is all they need. Once whites come to understand that racelessness is powerlessness, they will not allow other groups to exploit them as they are now doing; they will reform the social and political system without the need for something as drastic as separation.",
                    "This book contains 538 pages, 39 chapters, is evenly divided into 10 Parts. The first four Parts deal with race, the majority race or what used to be the majority race, and the other races. The next five Parts deal with the various clashes between the races: cultural, political, economic, legal, and foreign policy. The last Part, Part X, contains two chapters dealing with the so-called nuclear conflict and the possibility of a Pax Americana.The climax of this incredible work is found in Chapter 35 of Part IX entitled \"The United States and the Middle East\" which should have been titled instead \"Israel versus the Arab World\" because such a title states the theme and content plainly, unlike the original one.The dispossessed majority are those people who were or are members of the race known as Northern Europeans and can include as well all White people who are descendents of the majority that once founded and built this great country known as America or people who belong to the same race as these people.I learned plenty reading this book, mostly in the realms of history, sociology, and race awareness.I learned an incredible amount of American history, particularly in terms of just how and when modern liberalism and the minority coalition (the Jew and the non-Whites), working together, have been destroying the core of America's Anglo-Saxon law system since 1915, beginning clearly with the spineless President Wilson and his responsibility for establishing the Federal Reserve but as well by legal decisions instigated by dastardly Supreme Court Judges like Earl Warren, Hugo Black, Louis Brandeis, and William Douglas, all of whom created legislation to protect (minority) criminals, not the (white) victims of crime.I learned a lot about the morally and financially devastating and debilitating effects of the global or internationalist crime against the state, better known as Zionism, and what totalitarian tyranny it has brought and continues to bring not only to the United States but to the Middle East and Europe as well.I learned how important race is - both to civilization as well as to history, and how America's survival depends mainly upon the Northern European race, albeit the White race.All of what is asserted in the above summary is well supported by historical fact and documentation and all of it is presented in clear, plain prose. Reading the book involves a great deal of patience and attention because there is no fat, no padding, no clever patter, no fascinating divagations from the main topic. Every word counts, and every sentence is fruitful and insightful.I also found this book to be imminently quotable. I must have copied out more than 12 notebook pages of the most stunning insights. Here are a few:\"But no matter what the circumstances, those who leave the racial fold weaken the racial fold. It is not so much that there is strength in numbers. There is weakness in defection.\" (\"The Split in Ranks,\" Chapter 11, p. 96)\"Neither Jewish, Oriental nor Negro law ever developed any substantial protection for the individual whose interests were always put below those of the nation or tribe. This collective approach is clearly evident in contemporary legal patterns where the question is no longer that of the rights of individual Negroes or Jews but of the rights of the Jews and Negroes as a group.\" (\"The Adulteration of the Law,\" Chapter 28, p. 381.)\"[Louis] Brandeis . . . used the prestige of his high office to urge young American Jews to be trained in Zionism . . . .\" (p. 389)\"The very desperation of the denials lends substance to the claim that history clusters about race . . . that when there was no race consciousness there was no historical consciousness . . . there was chronology but no history . . . the essence of history is the rise and fall of races.\" (\"Toward Pax Americana,\" Chapter 39, p. 535)\"In fact, there will soon be no America. History is insistent in pointing out that when the dominant population group goes, the country goes.\" (p. 538)While this book was published in 1970 when the author was 57 years of age, there is very little historical material that is truly out of date, though there is some, admittedly. It is astonishing how prescient this work is today for every American worth his or her salt. Here are just a couple of pointers:\"Although anti-Semitic acts are not tolerated in the U.S., anti-Arabic acts are.\" (pg. 487)\"If there were any reason for the American Majority to regain control of American foreign policy it would be to undo the catastrophic damage that Zionism has inflicted upon the American posture in the Middle East.\" (pg. 490)There was one error Wilmot Robertson made in this book, an error that I am terribly sorry to have to note though the error is not one of fact but of foresight since the author clearly did not have a crystal ball for the future and perhaps did not heed his own cautionary tale about the evils of Zionism.The author asserts: \"Australia in the twenty-first century may be the center of the most advanced and authentic expression of Western life, and a final port of call for those North Americans and Northern Europeans who allowed their own countries to become minority-ridden bedlams.\"In Australia today, pathetically and sadly, Australians can't say jack about the huge influx of immigrants coming into their country nor can they say anything at all about the immigration laws being set and controlled by the Jews in their country. Australia has fallen under the weight of Zionist-run multiculturalism.I do not recommend purchasing a used, paperbound version of this book. Within a month, the spine of my paperback broke in half. Make an investment in a used, hardbound copy. This book is astonishingly well researched and deserves a second and third reading, so having a hardbound copy of this book will last through time, unlike the paperback.For interested readers who wish to understand the issues Wilmot Robertson presents in this book from the 1970s to the present, I happily recommend he or she surf the web and locate the websites known as Prothink, Incog Man and, best of all, ZionCrimeFactory."

                "description": "In this controversial and path-breaking book, William E. Cross, Jr., presents the diversity and texture that have always been the hallmark of Black psychology. Shades of Black explodes the myth that self-hatred is the dominant theme in Black identity. With a thorough review of social scientific literature on Negro identity conducted between 1936 and 1967, Cross demonstrates that important themes of mental health and adaptive strength have been frequently overlooked by scholars, both Black and White, obsessed with proving Black pathology. He examines the Black Power Movement and critics who credit this era with a comprehensive change in Black self-esteem. Allowing for a considerable gain in group identity among Black people during this period, Cross shows how, before this, working and middle class, and even many poor Black families were able to offer their progeny a legacy of mental health and personal strength that sustained them in their struggles for political and cultural consensus.

This reader has been very favorably struck by the careful and non-sarcastic exposure of some of our most common chestnuts regarding racial diversity, and in particular some of the sillier pronouncements regarding within- and between-group differences in genetic frequencies that have abounded in all of the media, academic and non.As more genetic research, particularly at the molecular level comes to our attention, it seems clear to this writer that this book will represent an important milestone in reducing the millstone of the myths that have accumulated denigrating and/or ignoring our genetic diversity.

                    "Most people who consider themselves intellectuals pride themselves on how far removed their theorizing is from contact with mundane reality. After all, if daily life could provide answers to lofty questions, we might not need so many professional intellectuals. And that subversive thought must be suppressed at all costs!Consider the topic of race. The trendiest idea among intellectuals is that Race Does Not Exist. Last year, a three-night PBS documentary summed up the new orthodoxy: Race: The Power of an Illusion. That this strikes the vast majority of Americans as a self-evidently stupid notion only heightens its appeal to those who view themselves as superior because of their ability to mentally juggle esoterica.Geneticist Vincent Sarich, Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Berkeley, and journalist Frank Miele, senior editor of Skeptic magazine, have stepped in to this debate with a new book Race: The Reality of Human Differences. It documents overwhelmingly that the weight of scientific knowledge is on the side of the man-in-the-street's commonsense view of race. Sarich and Miele demonstrate that all ten of the PBS documentary's summary statements on the nonexistence of race are wrong. Indeed, they bring so much firepower to bear against the series' assertions that it's a little like breaking a butterfly on a wheel. (Or, considering the mendacity of the PBS offering, a more accurate phrase might be \"like crushing a cockroach with a cannonball.\")Rejecting the straw man argument that the existence of race would require a race for everyone and everyone in his race, Sarich and Miele call races \"fuzzy sets.\" They write, \"Human races are not, and never were, distinct, mutually exclusive, Platonic entities into which every living person, unearthed skull, or set of bones could be pigeonholed.\"Miele is perhaps the best interviewer of scientists in the business. He's also a dog enthusiast, and his deep knowledge of breeds (which are artificially selected races) adds perspective to \"Race.\"Sarich won't make himself popular with the politically correct at Berkeley, but he is a hard man to intimidate. A hawk nose and piercing eyes make him look like the world's tallest ayatollah. Approaching 70, he still has the dimensions of an NBA quick forward at 6'6\" and a muscular 215 pounds. (In fact, he holds the world record for his age group in the small sport of indoor rowing.) Being the rare scientist who is also an enthusiastic fan of spectator sports makes Sarich far more aware of racial differences than his colleagues, who tend to only pay attention to unthreatening subjects for which they can win grants from the government or big foundations.In a 1989 book review in the New York Times, Richard Dawkins, author of The Selfish Gene, praised \"the enormously important work of the American biochemist Vincent Sarich.\" As Sarich recounts in an autobiographical section of Race, as a graduate student back in 1967, he famously teamed with Allan C. Wilson to launch the use of the \"molecular clock,\" which led to a revolution in evolution studies. At a time when experts on fossils believed that proto-humans had diverged from our closest ape relatives around 25 million years ago, Sarich and Wilson estimated, by counting the number of mutations that distinguished humans from chimpanzees and gorillas in a single serum protein, that our ancestors had broken away only about five million years ago. Although greeted with howls of protest from famous paleontologists, their figure has stood up well, and their molecular clock technique has become fundamental to both physical anthropology and population genetics.Stephen Jay Gould insisted we chant along with him, like Dorothy trying to get home from Oz, \"Say it five times before breakfast tomorrow: ... Human equality is a contingent fact of history.\" As a staunch Darwinist, however, Sarich understands that natural selection requires hereditary inequalities. Sarich and Miele write, \"Simply stated, the case for race hinges on recognition of the fact that genetic variation in traits that affect performance and ultimately survival is the fuel on which the evolutionary process runs.\"Sarich became the rare physical anthropologist expert on both genes and bones. So, when he saw PBS proclaim, \"Despite surface differences, we are among the most similar of all species,\" he dusted off the measurements of 2,500 human skulls from 29 different racial groups and compared them to 347 chimpanzee skulls from the two separate species of chimp (the common chimp and the bonobo). Sarich discovered that the dissimilarity in head and face measurements between these species was less than half that found between the two most morphologically dissimilar human racial groups in the sample (the narrow-faced Taita of Kenya and the wide-faced Buriat of Siberia). Sarich concludes, \"I am not aware of any other mammalian species where the constituent races are as strongly marked as they are in ours... except those few races heavily modified by recent human selection; in particular, dogs.\"The book is packed with fascinating information. For instance, in response to PBS's claim that, \"Race is a modern idea. Ancient societies did not divide people according to physical differences...\" Miele writes a definitive chapter showing, \"The art of the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, Rome, India, and China, and the Islamic civilization from AD 700 to 1400 shows that these societies classified the various peoples they encountered into broad racial groups. They sorted them based upon the same set of characteristics -- skin color, hair form, and head shape -- allegedly constructed by Europeans when they invented 'race' to justify colonialism and white supremacy.\"Will Race: The Reality of Human Differences change the minds of the prominent advocates of the Race Does Not Exist theory? No, because I can't imagine they'll even read it. One striking difference between the two schools is that the realists pore over the writings of the social constructionists, while the No Race theorists prefer to keep themselves ignorant of all troubling facts.",
                    "This is the first serious book i have read about race and I learnt alot about the early evolution of ape and man and how the development of DNA testing proceeded to reach its current accurate stage of been able to differentiate not only individuals but races.This book covers 3 basic topics in order-1) a historical account of how ancient civilizations like Aztecs, Egytians and Romans etc recognised and treated the racial groups in their empires.2)Early anthropolgy and its disputes between its famous scientists, leading to DNA methods that prove the birthdates of man-ape and modern man.3)Showing how real race differences exist today, in sport, medicine and measured IQ. Also examples of how race can be integrated into modern societies by either Meritocracy, Affirmative Action or EthnoStates.The author Sarich? is occasionally a bit glib in some of his remarks but there is nothing controversial or heretical in this book. Both authors do get a bit personal with their ideological opponents but anyone with any interest in DNA/race is aware of the ideologies that some vehemently proscribe to in the name of denying race.I really enjoyed this book and although i would have liked it to contain more data on the modern race groupings it really brought my understanding of race and evolution into the new millennium.",
                    "The subject of race is one of the most controversial and polemical ones in today's American intellectual circles. Almost any statement that can be made about race is bound to provoke a strong reaction from at least some quarters. Keeping in mind a long and difficult history of race relations in the US, this sort of attitude is to be expected. Unfortunately, because of the strong reactions that the topic of race elicits, many social scientists, anthropologists, and other experts treat it like the third rail and avoid engaging in any form of discussion about it. This has even lead some intellectuals to declare that human races don't really exist, and that race as such is nothing more than a \"myth\" or an \"illusion.\" Such attitudes fly in the face of common sense, and are actually completely at odds with the legal, social and political system in the US. For better or for worse, humans are one of the most genetically diverse species and the racial differences are far from being just \"skin deep.\"In this book the two authors, Vincent Sarich and Frank Miele, attempt to give a rational, evidence-based account of the reality of racial groupings. Much of the book reads as one long refutation of the acclaimed 2003 PBS documentary Race: The Power of the Illusion. The book is very well written, with detailed background research and plenty of sources and references. It guides the reader through a variety of topics relating to race: the history of racial attitudes, the various social connotations of race, the modern research on racial differences that started in the nineteenth century, the genetic research of the past few decades, and the main trends in the social science throughout the twentieth century. The book is very convincing in providing the evidence for the perceptual consistency of the race differences that have been used for several millennia, and it provides an interesting insight into the recent research in human biological makeup on the molecular level.My biggest problem with this book is that it's rather uneven, especially when it comes to the chapters which were written by Miele vs. those that had been written by Sarich. Miele is a much more competent writer, particularly when it comes to presenting difficult material for the general audience. Sarich, on the other hand, tends to get lost in the scientific jargon and topics that are very difficult for non-specialist to appreciate. He also has a tendency, which I've seen in many scientist, to overestimate the importance of the obscure research and topics at which he himself is an expert. This would have been a much more readable book if some of the nitty-gritty details of the scientific research had been left out. The authors also gratuitously pepper the narrative with some of their own pet peeves (like the high prevalence of the lack of communication skills among the faculty job candidates). These detours are rather distracting, but thankfully there aren't too many of them in this book.All things considered, though, this is a well presented and adroitly argued case for the reality of racial differences. The book is a valuable and thought-provoking contribution to the public discussion of a very controversial topic. People of all intellectual and political persuasions would greatly benefit from reading it.",
                    "After years of non-stop media and academia misrepresentations, suppressions, and outright lies about race, it is wonderful to have another famous scientist break free of Politically Correct (PC) conformity and tell the public the truth.This book was written to refute the highly PC Public Broadcast System (PBS) television program, &quot;Race: The Power of an Illusion.&quot; That program laid out 10 points about race, of which the authors say 8 are &quot;facts&quot; that they refute and the remaining two they reject &quot;for economic and ethical reasons.&quot; The book carefully and convincingly shows that evolution requires variation and that variation carries across racial groups, even, or especially, in the highly-charged area of IQ. There is even a frank discussion of the most politically incorrect fact anywhere - that the average IQ of sub-Saharan Africans is only 70.I have only two quibbles about this excellent book. First, they make this fascinating statement, &quot;As we have shown, the morphological differences between human races can exceed those found between subspecies [i.e., races] or even species of our nearest relatives, the chimps and gorillas, and other nondomesticated animals.&quot; In particular, the racial distance between the common chimpanzee and the bonobo chimpanzee is 14.6%, which exceeds the racial distance between some human races. An explanation of why the two chimpanzees groups are different species but the human groups are only different races seems to be needed here, but is not supplied.My second quibble is that the authors accept the Out-of-Africa theory of human origins based on DNA, mtDNA, and Y chromosome data. While they do show how that data supports Out-of-Africa, I don't think the debate is quite over yet. As an example of another view see: www.rafonda.com.",
                    "Prevailing social dogma, from which dissent is effectively prohibited, asserts that \"race does not exist.\" \"Racism,\" however, does (a neat trick), thereby justifying institutional accumulation of data on race and the systematic implementation across the legal and cultural spectrum of laws and policies discriminating against a single group.It is manifestly obvious to everyone, including race deniers, that race does in fact exist. Race denial is driven by ethnic and ideological animus, not scientific empiricism. The leading academic architects of the dogma--Franz Boas, \"Ashley Montagu\" (Israel Ehrenberg), Stephen Jay Gould, Richard Lewontin, and Jared Diamond--as well as the creator of PBS television's race denial documentary, Race: The Power of an Illusion (all are discussed in the book), belong to an ethnic group exempt from official discrimination, and share a Left-wing ideological tilt that is sometimes extreme (Marxist).In an ideologically Orwellian atmosphere there is always a need for the statement of simple truths. This the authors set out to do.Both are associated with Skeptic magazine, journalist Frank Miele, the author of Intelligence, Race, and Genetics: Conversations with Arthur R. Jensen, as senior editor, and Vincent Sarich, emeritus professor of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley, as a member of the magazine's editorial board. Sarich's most notable career achievement is the co-development of the \"molecular clock,\" a genetic technique for constructing phylogenetic trees and determining dates when species (or human races) diverged.Do the authors succeed in their aim? This question must be answered on two levels: the societal, and the inner court of the mind.On the first level they necessarily fail, as everyone must. \"Race does not exist\" is dogma maintained by laws and social sanctions. Societies that scorn freedom of thought do not permit proscribed positions to be rationally discussed in the public arena. Therefore, the authors' failure in the social realm is a foregone conclusion completely unrelated to evidence or arguments; it is purely a function of force. For this book to have an impact, a culture of intellectual freedom and honesty would have to exist.What of the independent, rational (if there be such) mind, which power and group conformity don't yet control? There, the argument succeeds--though not without difficulty. The problem is that key elements of the authors' case rely heavily upon technical expertise in genetics, and are difficult for educated non-technical readers to evaluate. Nevertheless, there is sufficient common sense scattered throughout the book to insure that the authors ultimately succeed in making their case.Miele and Sarich define races as fuzzy sets of \"populations, or groups of populations, within a species, that are separated geographically from other such populations or groups of populations and distinguishable from them on the basis of heritable features.\"Humans and chimpanzees are genetically 98.9% the same, and different human races 99.9% the same, race deniers assert. (Anthropologist Peter Frost calls this ploy the \"small percentage fallacy.\") And yet, say the authors, imagine \"a random assortment of fifty humans and fifty chimpanzees. No one . . . would have any difficulty in reconstituting the original fifty-member sets by simple inspection . . .\" Likewise, applied to 150 humans selected 1/3 each from Japan, Malawi, and Norway, \"[a]gain, by simple inspection, we would achieve the same 100 percent sorting accuracy.\" Moreover, if the 100% rule is relaxed so the criterion is \"nearer the 75 percent that has often sufficed for the recognition of races in other species, then obviously the number [of identifiable human races] would be very large.\" The great population geneticist Sewall Wright (died 1988), who asserted the reality of race throughout his life, likewise employed this technique.A uniquely useful feature of the book is a table entitled \"Three possible scenarios for race in the new millennium.\" For each scenario the authors objectively identify a list of accompanying advantages and disadvantages.The first scenario they call \"Meritocracy in the Global Marketplace\"--globalization characterized by non-discrimination, including non-discrimination against whites. It embraces the physical extinction of European-derived populations worldwide, while de facto preserving non-whites. In other words, it represents current thinking, but with explicitly anti-white laws and policies removed. An international, racially intermarrying cosmopolitan elite will dominate. This is the authors' preferred option.The reason why a globalist order, even with present anti-white laws removed, will lead to the extinction of whites (which, again, does not perturb the authors) is simple: the racial makeup of vast regions of the world, \"including China, India, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East, which have not changed in recorded history,\" are also not going to change anytime soon. \"This is not the case in the developed world, however, where birthrates have been plunging for the past two centuries to the point that they are currently below replacement level . . .\" Barring some radical change in ideology and social policy, \"the United States and Western Europe each year will see an increasing percentage of the population composed of . . . immigrants . . . from the underdeveloped countries of the Third World.\" The \"ultimate evolutionary irony\" is that Europeans, \"having conquered and colonized the world,\" \"brought about their own extinction.\"The remaining scenarios, both disfavored by the authors, are intensified \"Affirmative Action and Race Norming\" (anti-white discrimination) or \"Resegregation and the Emergence of Ethno-States.\"A thought-provoking section near the end of the book discusses bioweapons designed to kill only members of specific races--which genetics has rendered feasible. South Africa and Israel have researched the development of such weapons. (White South Africa, of course, no longer exists.) This says much about the race deniers' position: for if Jews are not a race, then bioweapons targeting Arabs or Europeans would also kill Jews. But such evidently is not the case.In sum, a worthwhile book containing useful information and insights.",
                    "Vincent Sarich and Frank Miele construct here a great case for the reality of race were it not for their selective use of evidence and their inability to answer one crucial question: how does one create meaningful and accurate racial groupings if more than eight-five percent of the genetic variation amongst individuals is the result of other genetic factors? Thus, Sarich and Miele are forced to rely on meaningless studies on such scientifically irrelevant phenomena as skull size variation (which interestingly Franz Boas destroyed a century ago as a persuasive argument) to bolster their case and to present alternative subjective classification schemes based on &quot;fuzzy sets&quot; rather than the commonly accepted and objective metric of genetic variation. Indeed, the authors do their best to ignore facts like the black males of the Lemba tribe of Central Africa thanks to migration are more significantly related from a genetic disease standpoint to male white Israelis than to the contiguous tribes of Cameroon--only illustrating the problems that a genuine, science-based racial classification scheme would run into. Yet, preconceived notions die hard and Sarich and Miele come from a physical anthropology school uncomfortable with the reams of new evidence from the Human Genome Project, etc. that have overturned cherished theories. To anyone genuinely interested in the topic, Mapping Human History by Steve Olson, a former science writer for the Economist, provides a more realistic account of what conclusions modern science has reached. For more advanced readers, anything by Luca Cavalli-Sforza should give one a more technical grasp of how studies into race, genetics and human evolution are progressing.",
                    "This book has the advantage that it is by a serious human geneticist and anthropologist(Sarich--Miele seems to be purely a journalist, helping Sarich write the prose and adding some minor points). Sarich knows about human evolution and explains it well, though professionals will have various quibbles. Previous racist books have been rendered worthless by ignorance of the simplest human genetic truths. Sarich is aware that &quot;race&quot; is only 15% of the variance between any two distant-origin individuals, and, more important, that one can recognize any number of &quot;races&quot; by making finer and finer distinctions--there could be thousands of &quot;races&quot; in Europe alone. (Anthropologists abandoned &quot;race&quot; not because they don't believe in human differences, but because the number of different populations they could recognize got unmanageably large--we work with thousands now.) Sarich reasonably critiques the claims that &quot;race does not exist,&quot; but seems not to realize that this claim, when seriously made, refers to the ridiculous &quot;races&quot; of American folk speech--Mexican, Latino, Asian-Pacific, Irish, Arab, and other non-biological categories. (Even &quot;African-American&quot; refers not to a biological population, but to a gradient from basically African to almost pure white--remember, &quot;one drop of African blood&quot; makes you African-American in the US.)The book points out that human races differ enough biochemically to necessitate some differences in medical treatment. True enough (though the differences are very minor and merely statistical). But Sarich and Miele don't emphasize enough the point that this is true only of actual biological populations (Europeans vs Sub-Saharan Africans, for instance), not of folk or social races. American doctors treating African-Americans who are 98% White as if they were &quot;Africans&quot; are doing no one a favor.The serious problem with this book concerns IQ differences. Here, Sarich does not control the relevant psychological and behavioral-genetic literature so well. Intelligence is now known to be affected by countless genes and environmental factors, and they do not work together in some neat, harmonious system. If local populations differ in innate intellectual gifts, this could well involve a bunch of verbally superior people next to some not-so-verbal math geniuses, or a bunch of spatial-perception hotshots next to some who are weak in that area. Sarich buys the claims of a &quot;g factor&quot; that underlies intelligence; this &quot;g&quot; shakes out of factor analyses of IQ test performance, but remains impossible to ground in genetics or brain physiology, both of which indicate a much more complex reality. It is not demonstrated in psychological performance other than standard IQ tests, either; again the evidence is for more complexity. For instance, a unique gene found among certain Amish makes them more prone to bipolar disorder, which would surely screw up their performance on at least some tests. In any case, IQ testing has avoided like poison any attempts to control for malnutrition, illness, lead poisoning, lack of knowledge of tester's language (monolingual Spanish speakers are still tested in English in my area), etc.The worst thing in the book is that Sarich accepts the guesstimate of 70 as the IQ of Sub-Saharan Africans, which is ridiculous in view of the high levels of education and performance seen in those African cities and regions that have anything like a functioning educational system (to say nothing of adequate nutrition). An adult with a 70 IQ can barely walk or talk; African nations now produce physicists and biologists and poets. To their credit, Sarich and Miele present a lot of evidence that Africans are perfectly sharp people, but don't really know what to do with it and wind up unconvincingly trying to explain it away. (And, just to prove that African-American IQ testing problems aren't genetic, those 98% White &quot;African-Americans&quot; test the same as the 100% African ones.)The other really silly thing in the book is comparing human races with breeds of dogs. Dog breeds have been artificially selected for differences in behavior and ability. Human groups have not. They are more comparable to wild subspecies of animals. If there are any demonstrated differences in intelligence and behavior between naturally evolved subspecies of any species of animal, I don't know about it.I think this book will be valuable in that it will teach racists something about actual human evolution and variability. Above all, it will teach them that real races are, as Sarich says, &quot;fuzzy sets&quot;--loosely defined regional populations--not ironclad and utterly different creatures, and not the ridiculous &quot;races&quot; of American folk speech. It will teach them something about actual human evolution and genetics. However, psychologists and psychological anthropologists will cut it to pieces when it trespasses on their turf. (See e.g. U. Neisser, ed., THE RISING CURVE; Jencks and Phillips, ed., THE BLACK-WHITE TEST SCORE GAP.)",
                    "I picked up this book as a critical companion to o Joseph Graves book The Race Myth. I was interested to hear the authors critique of the PBS series also. The first chapter quickly made it clear that this was a book born of more anger than analysis. The authors set up a straw man--the \"no race\" perspective--and proceed to offer a long and disconnected string of arguments ranging from sociology to highly selective genetic research to prove races do exist. Most often they are content to simply say they are challenging the status quo and therefore must be listened to. But what are they saying? In part, they are agreeing with a great deal of the science in the PBS series regarding genetic variation. The PBS series does not say that there are no genetic differences among humans. What it does say is that skin color and other physical features are not a useful marker for categorizing those differences. Miele and Sarich never, in my judgment, explain how human races can be coherently differentiated or how we would identify them. They discuss the dominance of \"Africans\" in track and field but their evidence is all drawn from a small group of Kenyans and African-Americans who, as Dr. Graves points out, could well be as European genetically as African. So, what does \"African\" mean? Why is it a coherent genetic category? The authors never tell us. THe book frustrates the reader continually in this regard--unless the reader already assumes that the authors' arguments are correct. In their introduction, they say that Chapter 6 will show there are sub species among human beings. But chapter 6 is mostly about the development of language. The following chapters don't answer the question either. Given the harsh history of racism in the United States, those who would rehabilitate race as a concept have both the scientific and moral responsibility to make clear how we are to determine who are members of a given race. They also have a moral responsibility to say what we are to do with our received racial categories which are are based largely on visual cues which have been given powerful sociological meanings. Otherwise, these authors are telling the lay person, with evidence presented in a manner that seem intended to impress and obfuscate, that the racial categories that society has taught them to view as \"common sense\" are indeed valid. Blacks are athletic, Asians are smart, whites are pretty good at everything--its all true. But at the end of the book, none of those things have been proven. This is simply another book which uses its claim to being \"anti-PC\" as a way to challenge the integrity of critics and shield their work own work from close examination. It simply extends the justifications for racism.",
                    "Can I give zero stars? I would if I could. This is a dreadful book, destroying science to pander to racist goals. Sarich is a known and respected scientist but in this book he mostly leans on that respect to promote his most unscientific racist agenda. He ignores a great deal of evidence of the range of human variation, the lack of correlation of most genes with color. He says that those of us who attack the race concept won't provide a workable definition to refute. But there is, in fact, a perfectly workable definition of race that has been stated many times, but that they ignore. Races, if they existed would be tightly bound groups of people, very homogeneous within and markedly distinct from others. This is a preposterous idea to defend given what is known of human variation across and WITHIN groups and the authors for the most part don't even try. Variations like color and nose shape are each on a continuum and cannot be partitioned clearly except in an absolutely arbitrary way; and supposed \"Racial\" traits like color, shapes of nose, eyes, lips,hair and hair color, the sickle cell trait and many others don't correlate with one another. (Sickle cell disease, despite popular stereotypes, is relatively rare among dark skinned populations, found in only a few groups; and it also occurs in many light skinned populations. Black skin has appeared many times separately in human evolution. The authors simply ignore the enormous number (in fact great majority) of highly varied populations around the world that don't match their stereotypes in order to stick to their recognition and manipulation of three great \"races.\"But when the book moves from the genetics of human variation to IQ and cultural performance, the author's ignorance is even more appalling. They know nothing at all about variations in human behavior or the science of IQ testing and the problems with tests described repeatedly in the literature. Their claim, offered twice out of the blue, that the average intelligence of Sub-Saharan Africa is 70, would imply individuals and whole societies that were simply dysfunctional. Even my IQ-believing friends find that number absolutely preposterous. Anyone with any knowledge of African cultures and accomplishments would find the number silly. The sense of IQ and the culture and life histories of blacks comes from JP Rushton, a noted racist who the authors make no attempt to challenge in any way. Rushton uses a bizarre choice of questions and highly manipulated data that are easily dismissed by anyone with anthropological knowledge Sarich and Miele know nothing about the content of the tests, the conditions under which they were given, the tested population, the language in which tested--literally hundreds of languages if the results refer to all of SubSaharan Africa.They and the people who's work they use ignore all of these problems and ignore the power of human culture including our own to limit peoples perception of the culture of others. They completely ignore the enormous problems of testing IQ across cultural boundaries, which are sometimes very subtle. I could go on at great length but I will conclude by saying that the only reason to read this book is to recognize parody of science.",
                    "To begin with humans, as a species, are not very variable genetically. Of this small genetic variation, only a small proportion is correlated with the geographical distribution of human social groups. This geographically conditioned genetic variation, small though it is, can nevertheless help in the reconstruction of human history as long as it is used to supplement large amounts of reliable information from the social sciences: social and cultural anthropology, history, archeology, and linguistics.One thing that geographically conditioned genetic variation cannot help with is in explaining the evolution of cultural and social institutions within human groups. Social scientists discovered this a century ago when they observed that genetically very similar groups can show enormous cultural and social differences while groups that are relatively different genetically can be socially and culturally alike. Unfortunately, the authors of this book are not aware of this. As geneticists who know little social science they look for genetic explanations where these do not exist.The author's ignorance of social science also leads them to miss an important story. Although, the genetic differences between human groups are relatively insignificant in themselves, humans have, at times, attached a great deal of importance to them. One product of this socially and culturally conditioned exaggeration of the importance of genetic differences has been racism. Unfortunately, the author's ignorance of social science seems to have rendered them unconscious of their own racial prejudices.Readers interested in human diversity can find a number of good books on this subject. This is not one of them.",
                    "I jotted down more than 200 words of notes on just the first 10 pages of this book, so egregious are its wrongs.That includes lies told from within his own scientific field of expertise by anthropologist Vincent Sarich.An example?On page 9, Sarich claims that the Out-of-Africa hypothesis of modern Homo sapiens dates that to about 50,000 BCE.This is not incontrovertible. To the point, anthropology shows modern Homo sapiens outside Africa long before that date. And, even if 50,0000 BCE is taken as the point for some final \"breakout\" beyond Africa and the neighboring edge of the Middle East, Sarich's idea deliberately glosses over \"backwash\" -- migration back into Africa, primarily from neighboring parts of the Middle East, but also from elsewhere. (Witness the colonization of Madagascar by people from south India in the last few thousand years.)Besides, how can Sarich fit those \"smart as a whip\" Jews, living oh so close to \"Darkest Africa,\" into this hypothesis?More seriously, the Jebel Qafzeh skull from Israel is the most commonly known candidate for the oldest modern Homo sapiens skull ever found. It dates to between 92,000-115,000 years of age.On page 1, the authors misinterpret a Lincoln quote about the difference between races, and infer that, rather than talking about the sociologocial fallouts from a clearly perceived difference in skin colors, Lincoln was talking about deeper differences in physical attributes.The last paragraph of page 3 has a logically fallacious appeal to authority, which the authors continue throughout the first chapter of the book.At the bottom of page 4, the authors appear to make a logically and empirically unwarranted jump, from all humans distinguishing other humans and classifying/chunking them into certain groups, to an almost Platonic-ideal concept called \"race.\"Page 9 - Going with their unproven -- and logically fallacious idea-generating -- 50,000 year date for the evolution of modern Homo sapiens, Miele and Sarich then use this to bootstrap their own arguments about the degree of difference between races, claiming this shows how rapidly human evolution can progress. It's clear circular reasoning based on an already assumed point of view.Pages 9-10 have a laughably racist \"genetic\" rather than sociological assumption of evidence for various types of athletic prowess. (I await every new world-class African swimmer or hockey player to refute \"athletics of the gaps\" thoughts like this.)More seriously, here's a sociological counterexample. Chinese children, and adults, are known from research to have an above-average percentage of musical perfect pitch. Genes?And, the piece de resistance on page 10 -- the \"mean sub-Saharan African IQ of 70.\" All together, now, can we say Bell Curve?How ironic that coauthor Miele is a senior editor of Skeptic magazine, because this book warrants incredible amounts of skepticism.",
                    "Recently, leading intellectuals in the fields of genetics, human biology, and physical anthropology have been engaged in an ongoing debate as to the validity (or lack thereof) of \"race\" as an accurate way of measuring human biological variation. While this is one of the pre-eminent matters of current debate in each of these fields, most scientists today are rejecting racial categories as biologically meaningless.After reading this book in its entirety, it was painfully obvious that the authors created a strawman argument and based their entire book off of it. Their strawman is the ridiculous act of asserting that those who question the scientific validity of racial categories are denying that there are any biological differences whatsoever across human populations. This illogical stunt may fool the layreader, but will fool no one with a background in human biology. Certainly there are physical and genetic differences across the human species (as a quick glance around the streets of Chicago or New York indicate). The real question is not weather diversity exists, but weather such biological diversity can consistently and precisely be classified into racial categories.Evolutionary biologists and physical anthropologists cite four key points that discredit the idea of biologically discrete human races: no agreement or even measurement as to the number of human races that exist, the nature of continuous variation of most human phenotypic traits, nonconcordance of what most people assume to be \"racial\" genetic traits (a la sickle cell anemia and skin color), and variation between \"racial\" groups.Sarich and Miele have attempted to pull the wool over people's eyes by presenting a strawman argument loaded with political rhetoric (post-modernist this and that, liberal agenda, political correctness, etc), all the while preaching to the choir and failing to prove that racial categories are biologically valid.",
                    "There's \"scientific\" hype attached to this argument, but it's the same stuff we've been treated to since the earliest attempts by Europeans to rationalize colonialism and slavery. When you've got some moron blathering about \"communist propaganda\" in a short review lauding this book, you know this is just red meat for the dogs. And Steve Sailer is a notorious far-right apologist for racialist theories who regularly hangs his hat at the neo-racist VDARE website. If you want a taste of what's behind this line of argument and where it all leads, check them out. The fact that the author invokes breeds of dogs to rationalize his discredited theories is proof enough of how far out on a limb these guys are. I, incidentally, live in a town and a neighborhood that's as mixed ethnically as any in America and have a \"racially mixed\" family, so I know up close and personal how this crap is just feeding some very ugly strains in our body politic and that it has all of the scientific gravitas of one of Charles Murray's synthetic tracts or the \"Hutu\" vs. \"Tutsi\" faux-tribal inheritance of European colonial masters that was used to justify genocide in Rwanda. Europeans aren't the only guilty parties, but any notion of European genetic superiority is a grotesque legacy of one of history's ugliest epochs. Read \"Guns, Germs and Steel\" if you want to dig into the basis of human \"difference\" in a historical as opposed to a recycled racist context."
