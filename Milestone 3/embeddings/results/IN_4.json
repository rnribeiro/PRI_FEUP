It, and its origins have been studied more intensively than any other period in American history, yet it remains profoundly controversial. Brian Holden Reid's formidable volume is a major contribution to this ongoing historical debate. Based on a wealth of primary research, it examines every aspect of the origins of the conflict and addresses key questions such as was it an avoidable tragedy, or a necessary catharsis for a divided nation? How far was slavery the central issue? Why should the conflict have errupted into violence and why did it not escalate into world war?",

It was a war defined by savage brutality, untold human costs, and monumental political crises that left the literal and social landscape of the nation forever changed. One hundred fifty years later, it continues to hold a powerful grip on the American psyche. In A Short History of the Civil War, noted historian James L. Stokesbury dramatically and concisely chronicles the important events leading up to the war and, using maps, recounts its decisive battles while describing the strategies and tactics of the North\u2019s and South\u2019s prominent commanders. Drawing on fascinating details and little-known facts, Stokesbury also brings to life the generals\u2014Grant, Lee, Hooker, McClellan, Jackson\u2014and the unsung heroes of this great struggle between the Union and the Confederacy.",

                    "This is a nice introduction to Civil War history. The author does not take sides which is refreshing since a bias is often evident in Civil war books. Between narratives of movements and battles are several short essays about the cause of the war, the economies of the respective nations, and analysis of military doctrine of the period.The author does a bit of analysis of the key characters and its interesting to see a foreigner's take on the war (Stokesbury is Canadian). One criticism is that the battle descriptions are so short that it is easy to get confused about what took place in the action, and whole complex campaigns can be glossed over. To be fair, this is difficult to avoid in a &quot;short&quot; history of such a protracted war.The writing is good and some of it stands out (the last paragraph of the book gave me goosebumps). This is a good primer on the Civil war and is recommended.",
                    "I bought this book for a nice summary, but not too detailed summary of the Civil War....and thats exactly what I got. Professor Stokesbury writes this wonderful, well researched book on one the most key points in our history. After reading this book I have a new outlook on how close we were to becoming two nations. Each key battle is cleary and methodically discussed, along with some of the stuff outside the battlelines. He is very objective, not favoring either side, and explains the causes of the start and the final collapse of the Confederacy. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a quick, easy-read summary of the Civil War, or to a history buff.",
                    "James L. Stokesbury was a professor of history at Acadia University in Nova Scotia, Canada. He has written numerous short histories of some of the most important wars of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.In this book on the Civil War, Stokesbury takes a vast amount of information (over 50,000 books have been published on the subject) and condenses it into a slim book of just over 300 pages. He covers the broad horizon of this period in a meaningful and entertaining way. Of course, sacrifices must be made. Some of the battle narratives are confusing in their shortened form, but the ebb and flow of the campaigns are accurately portrayed.Stokesbury's account is remarkably objective generally; however, every Civil War buff has his own opinions about the best and worst of the generals. Stokesbury makes no attempt to hide his feelings about his candidates for the worst.Many of the trivial details a typical soldier's life are incorporated in the narrative. Also covered are some of the economic, social, and political events which shaped the course of the war.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about this pivotal point in our history but doesn't have the time to commit to some of the larger tomes.",
                    "There are a number of one volume histories dealing with the American Civil War, but this is one of the best I've read. It consists of about 330 pages of narrative published in a very readable text design. Within this limited amount of space the author does an admirable job of covering such a sprawling topic. Descriptions of the major military campaigns are balanced with sections explaining changes that occurred in the political, economic, and social landscape. The often neglected war in the western portion of the Confederacy is well-covered. Although the historical personages who cross this bloody stage must be rendered in brief strokes, they are handled deftly enough so one gets some feeling for their characters and their roles. Author James L. Stokesbury dispenses personal observations that are at some points droll and at others fully reflective of the tragedy of the war. Certainly there are aspects of mid-19th Century American life not given full scrutiny, including slavery itself. But this is, after all, a self-described short history. I would strongly recommend \"A Short History of the Civil War\" as an introductory text for casual readers and students. I'd further suggest that even more serious minded researchers can benefit from reading what I find to be a model of concise, balanced, yet compelling historical narrative.",
                    "I blundered on this book in the stacks at the local library. After an introduction to the civil war via the Shaara novels, my wife and I have been reading some histories of specific battles and some biographies of individual leaders. We felt the need for a general survey of the war to tie it all together, but we did not want to devote the time to a comprehensive history. This book filled the bill perfectly.Stokesbury has an extremely fluid and readable prose style that is simply a joy to read. I assume that his facts are reasonably accurate. To me, he seems to devote just the right amount of attention to the various battles, individuals, issues, etc., though he leaves enough unsaid to stimulate further reading. He certainly does have his opinions, which he expresses sometimes with a delightful sarcasm. And he imparts some of the flavor of what it must have felt like to fight or have a loved one fighting in this war, which literally tore America apart in more ways than one. Tears came to my eyes as I read the details of the surrender at Appomattox, a testament both to the extreme emotions of the war, even after more than a century, and to Stokesbury's narrative powers.The only real weak point of the book for me was the maps, which are not cited in the text and do little to assist the reader in visualizing troop deployments, battle maneuvers, etc.",

Texans fought Indians, built the area into an agricultural success, and developed trade with America. Then the Mexican government wanted to transplant it's own people to take it over. Texas entered the Union as an understood Slave State, then the U. S. Government declared war on Texas for being such.

A fellow buff of mine and I have already had many lively debates about Flagel's ranking of the best and worst generals--George McClellan the second worst general in the war?

If you're already knowledgeable about the Civil War, except for the occasional list, most of the stuff you've covered already, or already read, or was already familiar with. I enjoyed the lists of best books, best movies, and best and worst generals, but I learned nothing new from this book.",
                    "The writing in this book is eloquent, evocative, and brings the Civil War to life. I've given copies of this book to my daughters who are in middle school and high school as well as to my older daughter to share with my Granddaughter (they live in the south and this book contains truth rather than historical fiction). I would recommend this book for every student who thinks history is boring - so they can find out it's not.",
                    "There have been more books written about the Civil War -- or the War Between the States, or the Rebellion, or the War for Southern Independence, whichever you prefer -- than about any event in U.S. history. It's both a key subject for academic historians and a point of fascination for amateur readers of history. That being the case, it's difficult to come up with an entirely new approach, but Flagel comes close. He's one of the academics but also obviously a \"buff,\" and he takes the approach here of collecting more than thirty \"Ten Best\" and \"Ten Worst\" lists about all aspects of the War and its preliminaries and aftermath. The result is a large number of short, often anecdotal, well-written articles and sketches which the reader will have difficulty putting down. The \"Top Ten Surgical Tools and Medicines,\" for instance, will take you into discussions of mercury poisoning, the fact that the Confederate Army ran its own distilleries, and the procedure of amputation. The \"Ten Most Significant Battles\" are selected in terms of their consequences, and while any list like this one will start arguments, Flagel does a good job of defending his choices. Nor does he restrict himself to the military side of the War; the \"Top Ten Acts of Government\" allows him to show the relevance of the Homestead Act, Lincoln's suspension of habeus corpus, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the Thirteenth Amendment. Small factoids are scattered throughout and nearly every statement or assertion is sourced -- though mostly to other secondary sources. This is exactly the sort of book that is likely to have you jotting down subjects and books for further perusal.",
                    "American Civil War expert and history teacher Thomas R. Flagel wrote The History Buff's Guide To The Civil War as a guide to the most critical people, places, and events of the Civil War. Meticulously organized under over thirty headings to spotlight key facts and topics in an easy-to-lookup manner, The History Buff's Guide To The Civil War is accessibly divided into the main subjects of Antebellum, Politics, Military Life, The Home Front, In Retrospect, and Pursuing the War, with each section deftly and succinctly exploring issues with heavily researched, matter-of-fact directness. An excellent introductory guide and consultation reference for readers of all backgrounds, The History Buff's Guide To The Civil War is a welcome addition to personal, school, and community library Civil War Studies reference collections.",
                    "I enjoyed reading this book of lists on the Civil War. I used the Kindle version and all the links etc work fine. There is an active TOC which is great. This is an easy read and a good quick reference. I did not learn anything new nor did I encounter any new analyses or theories about the war. My favorite lists were the 'top ten best and worst generals'. I was surprised to see Hood listed as one of the top ten worst generals. My guess is this book will be very popular for those who just want a quick review of the civil war.If you want an excellent and a meatier introduction to the Civil War I would go with McPherson's \"Battle Cry Freedom\".",

There are of course thousands of books out there on the Civil War, some good, some not so good. For a good quick overview though, I do not think you could go wrong with this one and I highly recommend it.

The author is very neutral in his historical summary, trying to not offend any Southerner. The writing is concise and neatly summarizes the war. I actually learned something even though I have read dozens of books about this war. The book is divided by years, and includes a prelude.The war's battles are detailed with battlefield maps. This was a nicely done book.As I said, the one thing that is lacking is the author's neutrality. This is disconcerting, especially when the author describes the institution of slavery. Slavery was wrong, and the author should have stated it so. I guess he didn't want to offend the Southern population. Everything else about the book was great."

For example, the author gives statistics on Northern information, but then claims that Southern statistics are unavailable, or missing, or, I suppose, lost to history, which is utter nonsense. The battles are mostly referred to by their Northern names (ex. Bull Run for Manassas), which as a Southerner (I was born in Va, moved back here in 2004, and was raised in Alabama) I find mildly offensive. Yes, I know that the North \"won\" the War, but I would have liked a more balanced description and explanation of things. Two thumbs WAY down. Yankee propaganda.",

                    "A surprisingly robust summary of the main elements of the Civil War, the book begins with the causes of the war: They were multiple (not a single cause), involving, among others, industrial competition between the North and South, slavery, Western expansion and states rights. In various ways these issues had been simmering for the better part of a decade and all came together in a perfect storm with the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln.And then the book discusses the key economic and political issues: With \"king cotton\" ruling the global economy as oil does today, the South (doing so, completely on the backs of its black slaves), had begun to flex its economic muscles well beyond its region -- as it provided about 75% of the $1 billion dollar annual world cotton market. Yet, its very success, through its rural-ness and dependence on slavery, became its Achilles heel as both were the main reasons the South lacked the industrial might of the North and was unprepared to fight a war. Plus, of the 9.5 million southerners, half were black and could not be relied upon during times of war. The North on the other hand saw a rapid expansion in immigration around 1850, and thus had large reserves of both manpower and war critical raw materials, 90% of the nation's rail lines, and about two and a half times the war aged population of the South.The narrative then moves from issues to people giving more than just a thumbnail sketch of the key players; their bios, covers the Lincoln-Douglas debates, both of Lincoln terms as President and his assassination. It discusses the pivotal role of the Border States, the process of secession, and European reactions to the establishment of the CSA.Finally, it covers the major battles of the war, the weapons used, its horrors both on the front and back home, and the chronicling the history of the war. Altogether this is a veritable Civil War feast. Four Stars",

A \"hard core\" historian probably won't find much here -- pretty basic. I think either the \"for dummies\" or \"complete idiot\" book is probably a better intro."

(Simply for the price of a stay overnight in a downtown Marriot.)Seriously though this distllation of years of work by a lot of heavy weight scholars will save you many hours of tedious digging.If you cannot persuade your local university or public library to buy it then by all means do so for yourself.In addition the book includes a listing of the book trade members, both publishers and dealers, who specialize in the Civil War.Carter Rila",
                    "The American Civil War must be the most written-about episode in U.S. history, with as many as 70,000 titles thus far and more appearing every day.The sheer scope of the literature can be overwhelming. Where to start? The present work is an excellent jumping-off point, as it organizes the literature and research into eleven broad areas, then subdivides each into 47more specialized topics such as ordnance, social conditions, and economic factors, each of these then treated in a bibliographic essay by an expert on the subject.The result is a feast for beginner and old hand alike, opening the entire literature for browsing or focused research.

                    "It seems that much more attention is paid to debating the causes of the Civil War, but as this slim volume of essays reveals there are any number of varying and subtle arguments for explaining the outcome of the Civil War.It is probably the common view that the North winning the Civil War was inevitable, that the overwhelming preponderance of the North in terms of supplies, industrial infrastructure, and manpower ensured victory. Only one of these authors somewhat accepts the thesis of Northern material superiority. These authors are far more mindful of the fact that mismanagement or deep-seated flaws within the losing side of a conflict can be larger factors in the ultimate outcome than positive actions by the winning side.The authors all note some inherent advantages of the South: a need to only defend territory, the vastness of the South, a transportation network, the ability to produce large quantities of foodstuffs, a commodity, cotton, of great value in the international market, a huge labor force of three million slaves, and a certain psychological advantage in the defense of a way of life.But these authors discuss any number of factors that led, not necessarily inevitably, to the defeat of the South. The authors point mostly to both military and political malfeasance, as well as personalities and inherent characteristics of Southern society, as leading to defeat. The manner of financing of the War produced tremendous inflation; the supplies of cotton were mismanaged both as a source of revenue to fund the war effort and as a tool to force European nations to recognize the Confederacy; food supplies were confiscated at below market prices; and manpower was poorly utilized both in recruitment to the Southern army and in the deployment of labor on Southern farms.The states rights and independent political stance of Southerners seemed to prevent a coherent national posture being formulated in winning the Civil War. One of the authors points to the anti-statist views of all Southerners as interfering with producing a disciplined army. Southern units elected their superior officers and were disinclined to follow orders with which they disagreed. In contrast to this aggressive independence, some of the authors point to a general weakening of the Southern psychological state and even a &quot;loss of nerve.&quot; The Confederate President, Jefferson Davis, is viewed by one author as a huge factor in the defeat of the South. Davis incompetently micromanaged the war effort, pursued flawed economic strategies, was personally difficult to engage, and exhibited an ineffectual indecisiveness and conservatism in times needing forceful and visionary actions. But the one-party system in the South prevented the rise of an effective opposition that could have addressed the original poor choice of President.Beyond any material advantage, the authors generally contend that Lincoln and Grant were trump cards for the North. Both were better suited to their jobs both in temperament and competency than anyone in the South. Some would almost suggest that Lincoln and Grant being on the Southern side could have reversed the result.This book was reissued in 1996 after first appearing in 1960, but it is as readable and relevant as anything being written today. There is some overlap in the material covered in the essays, but the ideas are interesting and challenging. You won't see all of these ideas in a general book on the Civil War.",
                    "This is a slim book (approximately 124 pages) that contains essays by different writers who each examine a major factor that contributed to the South losing the Civil War. Although in hindsight it appears that the South was doomed to lose, in reality, it was a close contest that literally could have been won by either side. Although the North had significant material advantages, the authors point out internal factors and decisions made (or not made) by the South that contributed greatly to it's eventual defeat. This book, although originally published nearly 50 years ago, remains surprisingly relevant and thought-provoking today.As an interesting aside, the forward to the book was written by retired Major General U. S. Grant III, the grandson of Union General (and later President) U. S. Grant.",
                    "Half a century ago some of the nation's leading Civil War era historians put together this collection of essays seeking to explain, from a variety of perspectives (economic, military, political, diplomatic), why the North prevailed in the epic contest of wills between the states. We have arrived at the sesquicentennial of the great conflict and yet the insights and arguments found in \"Why the North Won the Civil War\" have lost little of their cogency.Many could (and have) argue that the southern cause was doomed from the start. Richard Current makes this conventional case in his contribution \"God and the Strongest Battalions.\" In short, he maintains that northern victory was practically guaranteed owing to the Union's insuperable advantages in manpower (2.5 times the south), capital (4 times larger), and industrial output (an order of magnitude greater), among other areas of comparative strength. Sure the Confederacy made mistakes, Jefferson Davis and Treasury Secretary Christopher Memminger could have crafted better policies, but the ability to overcome the South's economic handicaps went far beyond the power of any man or group of men, Current (and many others) argue.But is that a fair and complete view of the comparative strengths and weaknesses of the competing sides? Did not the American colonists and Vietnamese communists face longer odds in their improbable quests for independence? Did not the Confederacy hold the advantage of interior lines, a long and difficult to blockade coastline, some of the best military officers of the war, a three-million strong involuntary labor pool (i.e. slaves), great natural defenses, and the strategic advantage of being able to win simply by not losing? If neither northern victory nor southern defeat were foreordained, then how to explain the defeat?The essays by T. Harry Williams and David M. Potter reviewing military strategy and the political leadership of Jefferson Davis, respectively, are learned and forcefully argued, but hardly make a convincing monocausal explanation for the South's defeat. Nevertheless, Williams' essay in particular is a gem and recommended to any student of nineteenth century military history. He stresses that Jominian thinking was dominant among the West Point trained officers on both sides of the conflict and it is no accident that two of the three great generals in the war (Lee, Grant and Sherman by his calculation) were northerners who eschewed the Napoleonic concept, Grant even claimed that he had never read Jomini. Rather, the North's two leading commanders embraced a more Clausewitzean approach of total war, seeking the destruction of the main enemy army wherever it may be found through withering preponderance of force, not a victory of maneuver through superior planning and the capture of critical physical locations as dictated by Jomini.The most convincing essay, I found, was the largely contrarian contribution by David Herbert Donald, \"Died of Democracy,\" which argues ironically that the true weakness of the Confederacy was an unwavering commitment to democracy and individualism. He compares and contrasts the democratic/libertarian South to the often dictatorial North. For example, the South continued to elect non-commissioned officers and junior officers throughout the war and many men and entire units refused orders they disagreed with or simply didn't find personally satisfying. The North, on the other hand, had mostly cooperative, professional troops, especially the large percentage that were recent European immigrants and freed slaves. The South retained freedom of the press throughout the war and only briefly and locally suspended habeas corpus three times. In contrast, over 300 northern newspapers were shut down during the war and Lincoln suspended habeas corpus throughout the Union. The South claimed to be fighting for \"states rights\" and individual states that made up the Confederacy were just as jealous of their local prerogatives under the new southern form of government as they were under the Union, Donald maintains. It was this dynamic - the North, acting like a pack of dogs in their fight against the South, acting like a group of feral cats - that was the ultimate cause of Union victory and Confederate defeat, and its a theme that Potter further develops in his essay, showing how a collection of fiercely independent states with no two-party system could effectively develop a national policy on how to best leverage the power of \"King Cotton\" or raise revenue for the war effort through some form of national taxation or allocate the use of the captive slave population to fight the war. All of these potential war power policies were neglected in the face of state and individual property rights that made up the intellectual foundation of secession in the eyes of the South's political leadership.All told, this is a nice complement to any Civil War library.",
                    "I was required to read this for a military history class, and as usual the professor chose a great read. Some people said it was hard to read & identify the theses of the essays due to the length, but I didn't find it a hard read & the arguments are fairly easy to identify since they cover different topics: the 1st essay being an overview & the remaining 5 covering the social, economic, political, military, and diplomatic aspects of the conflict.Despite somewhat hard read, most found it enjoyable. The writing is simple enough for non-historians to understand while providing historical analyses. Great read if you want various perspectives on why the war had the outcome it did.",
                    "Many books have been written on why the South lost the Civil War or why the North won. Donald's book offers a fresh approach and the most concise expression of the author's views which are bou to make for argument and thoughtful reflection.",
                    "This is an excellent book which contains six essays on the various economic, miliary, diplomatic, social, and politiical reasons why the Confederacy lost and the Union won the Civil War. This book saved my butt",
                    "Includes a Foreward by U. S. Grant III, retired Major General! That, and the 8-page \"For Further Reading\" chapter, alone, are worth the price of this book!I give this book five-stars for being thought-provoking on the general subject of reasons for a military victory ending in 1865, but it is only part of the story.For the rest of the story, be sure also to read such books as __The South Was Right__ by the Kennedy brothers, and of course __General Lee's Papers__ and Jefferson Davis' own __The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government__. These latter two men were both active participants in the great drama -- there in person as eyewitness accounts -- and also give their reasons in answer to the same question of why the North won.",
                    "This is a short book consisting of five lectures. The civil war does not represent a subject of great interest to me. Americans, killing Americans is basically depressing. This book, though, I find fascinating. It is a concise examination of how organizations, the military, people, governments work. If you are a student of human nature, you will enjoy it. I continue to pick the book up, and will open to any page and reread passages that stimulate thought. For a civil war \"buff\", it will place you in deep waters illuminating why things turned out the way they did.",
                    "I have used this space over the past couple of years to commemorate many events important in working class history, leftist history and just plain democratic history (hey, that is our heritage too). My idea, as explained in my profile, is to try to transmit to the younger generation of leftist militants a sense of the rich, if many times negative, history of our movement. With that in mind, I have noticed recently that while I have spilled a certain amount of justifiable ink on honoring John Brown and his band at Harper's Ferry and on the personage of Abraham Lincoln, also justifiable, I have not spent nearly enough time on some of the other great issues of the Civil War period itself. I begin to rectify that error here. And it is an error. A lot of what the United States have become in the world, for good or evil, stems from the events of that period.Some of the books that I review in this space as I introduce subjects that I think will be of interest are those that first got me interested in the subject. Thus, the books tend to have older copyright dates and, in many cases, have been superseded by more recent (and generally, better) work on the subject. But I still see value in them as a starting point. That is the case here. I distinctly remember, after having gone through the basics of the American Civil War in my high school history class, going out to buy this book in order to better understand the question posed by the title of this book- why did the North win the Civil War? Although this book does not directly address some of the reasons that I would give now for why the North succeeded it nevertheless gave some, to me, provocative thoughts about the issues then.This short book is a result of a conference held in the late 1950's at Gettysburg, in preparation for celebrating the Civil War Centennial, which discussed various historical points of view as to the basis for the Northern victory. Now there have been innumerable books on every conceivable aspect of the Civil War, from songs to sewing, so by this year 2008 so it is hard to say that this book sticks out. However this book represented the best thinking of the last generation of Civil War scholars on the general trends of the times. The subjects delved into-Northern and Southern economics, generalmanship, diplomacy, effects of war- weariness, Southern character defects have all been expanded on since. But here is a place to start an outline of the subject. This book also helps to understand one of the positive consequences of the Northern victory-the consolidation of a unitary trans-continental state. Of course, readers, let us keep our eyes on the prize- the real import of studying about the Civil War is to see how the great social issue of that day-the abolition of slavery got fought out to the finish. For that we need to look elsewhere.",
                    "The book is good for anyone who wants a quick understanding of certain possibilities of why the North won. However, some of the essays(this is no reflection of the actual book) are not that well justified in my opinion."

                    "James Ford Rhodes (May 1st, 1848 - January 22nd, 1927) was both an industrialist and an historian. Prior to this work, he produced seven volumes of a \"History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850\" (an eighth volume was published after this work), and he also produced a three volume \"History of the Civil War 1861-1865\". In the preface to this one-volume \"History of the Civil War 1861-1865\" he states that this is not an \"abridgement\" of his prior work, but rather was a \"fresh\" study.Originally published by \"The MacMillan Company\" in 1917, this new History was awarded the 2nd Pulitzer Prize for History in 1918. Rhodes became known for his detailed research and lack of bias which is consistent throughout all his history works. His balanced treatment of both sides is a rather stark contrast to the first winner of the Pulitzer Prize in History (Jean Jules Jusserand's \"With Americans of Past and Present Days\") which was more of a celebration of Franco-American relations.It is interesting while reading this book to think about the way the perceptions of the United States Civil War have changed over the years. As an example, Rhodes has no difficulty in emphasizing slavery and anti-slavery as the primary causes of the war, and since that time it has become more common to see more general references to state rights used, perhaps to cover the ugliness of issue. Another example would be the way History and Historians treat Robert E. Lee. Rhodes has high praise for Lee, though that is not to say that he doesn't point out his mistakes. Lee does not seem to fare so well with modern historians.The discussion of other nation's attitudes towards the war is one of the more interesting sections, at least for me. Though ultimately there was no foreign interference, it is interesting to learn how a different outcome in a battle here and there, could easily have changed things considerably. One also gets a slightly different view on the French position towards the Union than one did from the essay from Jusserand's work, though to be fair the prior work was more focused on their attitude towards slavery and Abraham Lincoln, and not as much on the war and its negative effects on France.Other interesting chapters and threads throughout the book include looking at how the North responded to the draft, especially after it became clear that the war would be won. There is a discussion of the politics and the Democratic Party turning into the Copperheads, while some legitimate opposition positions were lost as a result of the party pushing their opposition to Lincoln and the war. Rhodes also discusses the technology, and the failure to quickly move to breech loading rifles.His discussion of the economics during the war is also very thorough. Obviously there is a discussion on the blockades and blockade running. In addition he discusses the currency problems faced both in North and South, as well as the debt resulting from the war and the consequences to the populations of the Union and the Confederacy. He also looks at the illegal trade between North and South during the war.Not surprisingly, Rhodes gives an excellent and thorough evaluation of the Generals and other figures on each side of the war. In particular, his comparison of the Generals as they come into opposition with each other is particularly well done. While the perception of some of them as changed through time, one can count on an even appraisal in all cases. The same is true for his evaluation of the battles, tactics, and strategies from the perspective of both sides. Of course, there are many good books on the United States Civil War which cover these areas, but just as obviously this book would not be complete without them.One weakness of this history, is that despite Rhodes' claim that this was a fresh study, he does in the very early discussion inform the reader that his discussion of the supporters for disunion was so complete in his three volume history that it is unnecessary to repeat it at length. The result is that one has to wonder how much he is leaving out in this one volume history that was included in his earlier three volume work. Having not read his earlier history, or his larger history of the entire era, it is impossible to judge how much he is leaving out.Along the same lines, his discussion ends fairly abruptly after describing in some detail Lee's surrender, he then briefly mentions the assassination of Lincoln and the surrender of Johnston to Sherman. There is no discussion of the aftermath of the war to balance the discussion of the events leading to the start of the war. These weaknesses are small though when one looks at the overall strength of the book. This one is highly recommended, even after 90+ years.",
                    "Purchasers of this classic civil war history need to be aware that the original Macmillan hardcover editions contain 8 full-color, fold-out maps, that you will not likely find in such marvelous form in the print-on-demand paperback reproductions.

As for the accuracy of information presented, I cannot tell but trust the various reviews that I've found on different sources that this is a good book. It sure packs a lot of information into it, and gives a very good over-view of the civil war. The only peeve I have is that the book is rather centered around the east-south-eastern USA. There isn't much mention of what was going on in the north (especially wisconsin where I live where the civil war was very alive) nor the west (there's a few mentions here and there about the west.) Yet I don't know if one can find a better introductory book than this on the civil war.",

                    "James Ford Rhodes (May 1st, 1848 - January 22nd, 1927) was both an industrialist and an historian. Prior to this work, he produced seven volumes of a \"History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850\" (an eighth volume was published after this work), and he also produced a three volume \"History of the Civil War 1861-1865\". In the preface to this one-volume \"History of the Civil War 1861-1865\" he states that this is not an \"abridgement\" of his prior work, but rather was a \"fresh\" study.Originally published by \"The MacMillan Company\" in 1917, this new History was awarded the 2nd Pulitzer Prize for History in 1918. Rhodes became known for his detailed research and lack of bias which is consistent throughout all his history works. His balanced treatment of both sides is a rather stark contrast to the first winner of the Pulitzer Prize in History (Jean Jules Jusserand's \"With Americans of Past and Present Days\") which was more of a celebration of Franco-American relations.It is interesting while reading this book to think about the way the perceptions of the United States Civil War have changed over the years. As an example, Rhodes has no difficulty in emphasizing slavery and anti-slavery as the primary causes of the war, and since that time it has become more common to see more general references to state rights used, perhaps to cover the ugliness of issue. Another example would be the way History and Historians treat Robert E. Lee. Rhodes has high praise for Lee, though that is not to say that he doesn't point out his mistakes. Lee does not seem to fare so well with modern historians.The discussion of other nation's attitudes towards the war is one of the more interesting sections, at least for me. Though ultimately there was no foreign interference, it is interesting to learn how a different outcome in a battle here and there, could easily have changed things considerably. One also gets a slightly different view on the French position towards the Union than one did from the essay from Jusserand's work, though to be fair the prior work was more focused on their attitude towards slavery and Abraham Lincoln, and not as much on the war and its negative effects on France.Other interesting chapters and threads throughout the book include looking at how the North responded to the draft, especially after it became clear that the war would be won. There is a discussion of the politics and the Democratic Party turning into the Copperheads, while some legitimate opposition positions were lost as a result of the party pushing their opposition to Lincoln and the war. Rhodes also discusses the technology, and the failure to quickly move to breech loading rifles.His discussion of the economics during the war is also very thorough. Obviously there is a discussion on the blockades and blockade running. In addition he discusses the currency problems faced both in North and South, as well as the debt resulting from the war and the consequences to the populations of the Union and the Confederacy. He also looks at the illegal trade between North and South during the war.Not surprisingly, Rhodes gives an excellent and thorough evaluation of the Generals and other figures on each side of the war. In particular, his comparison of the Generals as they come into opposition with each other is particularly well done. While the perception of some of them as changed through time, one can count on an even appraisal in all cases. The same is true for his evaluation of the battles, tactics, and strategies from the perspective of both sides. Of course, there are many good books on the United States Civil War which cover these areas, but just as obviously this book would not be complete without them.One weakness of this history, is that despite Rhodes' claim that this was a fresh study, he does in the very early discussion inform the reader that his discussion of the supporters for disunion was so complete in his three volume history that it is unnecessary to repeat it at length. The result is that one has to wonder how much he is leaving out in this one volume history that was included in his earlier three volume work. Having not read his earlier history, or his larger history of the entire era, it is impossible to judge how much he is leaving out.Along the same lines, his discussion ends fairly abruptly after describing in some detail Lee's surrender, he then briefly mentions the assassination of Lincoln and the surrender of Johnston to Sherman. There is no discussion of the aftermath of the war to balance the discussion of the events leading to the start of the war. These weaknesses are small though when one looks at the overall strength of the book. This one is highly recommended, even after 90+ years.",
                    "Purchasers of this classic civil war history need to be aware that the original Macmillan hardcover editions contain 8 full-color, fold-out maps, that you will not likely find in such marvelous form in the print-on-demand paperback reproductions. The original maps are one of the real treasures of this title and so any editions without them would, I'm sorry to say, be considered woefully inferior.",
                    "I was afraid I'd be bored by attempting to read up on the Civil war, even though as a foreigner here, I wanted to learn about american history. Turns out, this book is extremely engrossing; I could not put it down once I took it up, and I don't remember any part being boring such that I wanted to skip over them. As for the accuracy of information presented, I cannot tell but trust the various reviews that I've found on different sources that this is a good book. It sure packs a lot of information into it, and gives a very good over-view of the civil war. The only peeve I have is that the book is rather centered around the east-south-eastern USA. There isn't much mention of what was going on in the north (especially wisconsin where I live where the civil war was very alive) nor the west (there's a few mentions here and there about the west.) Yet I don't know if one can find a better introductory book than this on the civil war.",

                    "The book is well written and has been very worth while to read. Unfortunately I seem to be missing the illustrations which I presume is a part of the book, I am therefore not able to evaluate the entirely.RegardsKim Mller Petersen",
                    "I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I am a history buff and have tried to read as much as I can.",
                    "Rhodes covers the war in a very succinct, no nonsense manner. Writing style is somewhat dated, but completely understandable. It's advertised as being illustrated, but there are fewer pictures than I would have liked. Still, it's a good bargain for the amateur historian that wants a refresher on the Civil War.",

                    "To me, the dullest part of the Civil War began at Fort Sumter. The greatest deficiency of Ken Burns' celebrated documentary (enough to make it almost useless)is that he spent almost no time on the causes. I have always found the political maneuvering between North and South, between the two great parties(and within them as well), the occasions when secession and war almost happened, and the dramatic compromises that held off disaster to be essential for understanding the war and why it was fought the way it was. The political battles over the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the Lecompton Constitution are more interesting to me than the dramas of Antietam, Chancellorsville or Gettysburg.Avery Craven was one of the so-called &quot;revisionist&quot; school of American historians, those academics who asserted that there was blame for the war on both sides, that condemned radical abolitionists and Southern fire-eaters equally. Although he may not have intended it, Professor Craven makes an even more interesting assertion. There were not two sides in this affair but three. The West(what would now be the Middle West)was a region with its own economic interests. And this region, for the most part, wouldn't have gotten all that worked up about slavery if its farmers could have gotten their goods to market. But Southern political ineptitude and indifference to Western interests alienated that region from the South and probably cost the South the war.All in all, an excellent history of the antebellum United States. Whether you agree with Professor Craven's ideas or not, this book is well worth your time.",
                    "I believe it was Avary O. Craven who once said that in depth exploration of the social, political and economic factors which led to the war do not have \"the entertainment value of harrowing tales of runaway slaves.\" He was right of course. Readers will not find any moralizing in this book. That alone will make for a refreshing read. It's not easy reading - but then, understanding the various undercurrents that propelled America to this war isn't an easy thing. But if the reader perseveres, he will emerge with a better understanding of the event, and a realization that the drivel that contemporary historians (for the most part) peddle, is a simplified and dumbed down version of the facts, written, most likely, for a population that has itself been dumbed down.",

I FULLY AGREE. THIS BOOK GIVES A FRESH LIGHT ON THE MOST INTERESTING PERIOD OF AMERICAN HISTORY--THE ANTEBELLUM PERIOD. A GREAT BOOK WELL WORTH READING. sIMPLY LOOK AT THE TABLE OF CONTENTS.",
                    "This book is interesting in that it not only examines the key political issues of the antebellum period but also delves into the culture of the time, especially that of South. But the author's views are tilted toward those of the antebellum South. He goes to great length in describing the Southern plantation system with its incorporation of slave labor and compares it somewhat favorably with the industrialization and the \"so-called\" free labor of the North. In addition, the exaggerated Southern claims of social superiority seem to strike a chord with the author.A great deal of the book is consumed with describing the reactions and views of leading spokesmen and of various publications in the North and the South concerning major antebellum political developments. The question of the Mexican Cession and the Wilmot Proviso in 1846 moved the question of slavery squarely into the political system resulting in the formation of the Free Soil Party and talk of secession in the South. The Compromise of 1850 quieted some voices, but only until the next expansion of slavery.Interestingly, of all of the political crises of the mid-1850s where slavery was front and center, that is, the Kansas-Nebraska bill, the bleeding Kansas crisis, and the Dred Scott decision, the author claims that the Southern response was relatively moderate compared to the extremists of the North. Yet that moderation seemed to have evaporated with the John Brown raid at Harpers Ferry. And the Southern reaction to Lincoln's election the next year was beyond shrill and ultimately self-destructive.I think it is fairly obvious that this author regards the Civil War as occurring as a result of emotionalism and opportunism run amok. And despite the fact that the South was unwilling to honor the untainted election of a President and failed to comprehend that all of the conservative candidates together far outpolled the Republican, I believe that the author holds that Northern forces largely provoked the Southern secession and then were unwilling to accept that fact by offering some kind of compromise.This author fails to grasp, or at least state, that slavery and its ramifications were the great moral issues of the day. Of course, tremendous emotionalism was evoked by the issues. And those issues could not be simply managed or downplayed in the Second American Party system. Slavery was conceptually wrong for America and produced an unsustainable divide between two sections of the country. Emotionalism may have obscured that fact then and now, but it is superficial as an explanation for the Civil War."

This book captures the heart of the tale, and you come away with both the history and the powerful national and human drama. I read this book with a sense that I was there, watching the battles unfold, listening in as the decisions were made that sent men to their triumphs or to their deaths. It is highly readable, but I did not want to rush through it; I periodically put it aside to let my spirit settle.If your knowledge of the Civil War is limited and you think maybe you ought to know more or you'd like to know more, but you don't want to crack open a dry textbook -- then this is the book for you!",
                    "The Civil War remains the pivotal and most discussed event in our Nation's history. Every generation of writers and readers feels the need to tell the story of the War anew and to reflect upon its meaning. In the mid-20th Century, the leading interpreter of the Civil War was Bruce Catton (1899-1978). Catton wrote narratives for the nonspecialist reader. He had the ability to make the Civil War era, the battles, and the issues come alive to a broad public. There is still much to be learned from his writing style and from his discussion of the War.Catton's &quot;This Hallowed Ground: the Story of the Union Side of the Civil War&quot; (1956) remains an essential one-volume study of the conflict. Only James McPherson's work, &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; comes close to matching its scope. While McPherson's work may show a greater degree of scholarship, Catton's work more than compensates in its eloquence and passion.The book begins with the famous caning that Congressman Preston Brooks of South Carolina gave to Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts in 1856 following a Sumner speech against slavery before the Senate. It examines the causes of the War, the battles and politics of the conflict, and concludes with the end of the long conflict in April 1865. (It gives only a brief glance to Reconstruction.)Catton tells the stories of the War's military engagements simply and understandably. I have read detailed accounts of many Civil War battles and tend to become confused. Catton's accounts of the battled are short and, of course, simplified; but they cut to the heart of the matter. I would recommend that anyone interested in studying a battle in depth read Catton's account first, both for an overview of the War and for a basic account of the battle and its place in the scheme of the War.Catton unequivocally states that slavery was the prime cause of the War. I think most contemporary historians agree with him. But many recent writers try to persuade their readers that they are discovering the importance of slavery to the conflict for themselves -- almost for the first time since 1865. It is helpful for an understanding of the history of history to see Catton's recognition (in a popular work written more than a generation ago) of slavery as the driving factor of the War. Catton also writes eloquently about industrialization in North America and about the factors which worked ultimately to make the United States a unified nation. I learned a great deal about the issues leading to the War and about the changes it effected in American life from Catton's account. (In his short discussion of Reconstruction, Catton suggests that the victorious Union took an unduly punitive approach to the South. This is one area in which many contemporary historians, I think, would tend to disagree with him.)Catton's work also places great emphasis on the Western theatre of the War beginning with the capture of Fort Donelson in 1862. He sees Antietam rather than Gettysburg as the Confederate &quot;High Tide&quot; in the conflict. In these matters too, Catton's discussion is in accord with much recent writing on the War.Although Catton's book focuses on, and is deeply sympathetic to, the Northern war effort, he portrays the Confederacy as a valiant and determined foe making its own effort to preserve what it viewed as a traditional, agrarian way of life. Again, he never allows the reader to forget that this way of life was predicated upon slavery. He recognizes the South's persistence in the War, the determination of its people, the courage of its soldiers, and the brilliance of Robert E. Lee without falling into &quot;Lost Cause&quot; mythology.I am pleased that Catton's &quot;This Hallowed Ground&quot; remains in print and available for new readers who wish to understand our country and its greatest conflict. This book is an excellent choice for readers who only wish to read a single work on the War. I enjoyed the comments of the other Amazon readers who have reviewed this book.",
                    "Bruce Catton is first and foremost a storyteller. Beyond the actual retelling of the events, which are truly awe-inspiring in their own right, Mr. Catton offers the reader true insight into the stakes of each major battle and the entire as only historical hindsight can offer. The reader will likely gain an appreciation for Lincoln's burden, who seemingly was singly aware amongst the Northern decision makers of the broader consequences of the actions taken to preserve the fledgling union. Mr. Catton does not overly dwell on tactics and casualty numbers, focusing rather on the Civil War amid the context of American culture and history.A note on the tone of the book. This is not a balanced account of the great story, in that there is focus on the Northern side. However, Mr. Catton is delivering no more or less than promised, as the title of the book identifies this intent. That said, this does not mean that he in any way exaggerated the cause or characters in any apparent way. I am not an historian, but am a budding Civil War enthusiast, and have read a couple of the heavyweights: McPherson's &quot;Battlecry of Freedom&quot; and Foote's &quot;The Civil War: a Narrative,&quot; and consider Catton's work superior to both. McPherson's work is a bit more factual, but not as poetic. Foote's 3000+ page work is difficult to read due to his unabashed favoritism to the Confederacy's cause, its heroes, and its battle prowess; even though he is every bit the storyteller and researcher that Catton is. All in all, I would recommend reading both Catton and Foote to achieve a well balanced tutorial of our greatest American story.",
                    "This is one of the two or three very best histories of the Civil War ever written. It is on a par with &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom.&quot; It brings events to life. It has the ring of absolute truth. Its characterizations of events and individuals are poetic and deeply moving. It teaches us tremendously important lessons of character and history.In addition, it's a real page-turner - not a hard read at all. I've quoted more sections of it to my wife, my children (ages 11 and 13) and my co-workers than any other book I can think of.I recommend this book to my brothers and sisters who are descendants of Confederate veterans, as well as those of us who are descended from the Union side. It is of a character and stature commensurate with General Lee.Tim Oksman, City AttorneyPortsmouth, Virginia",
                    "I read this book twice; once before and again after reading the Grant Trilogy--Capt. Sam Grant, Grant Moves South, and Grant Takes Command followed by The Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant. The author drew liberally from primary sources, and what he writes you can believe. He writes very well. My first reading was an introduction without knowledge; the second pulled all the other readings together. I recommend them all, of course, but this seems to me a must because it so accurate, complete, and insightful. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",
                    "The works of Bruce Catton were among the first that stimulated my interest in the American Civil War. It's a massive subject matter with what must be millions of words written in it's account. Thus reading about the war could be confusing at the least and over powering at the most. This is not the case with Bruce Catton who writes with a clarity that enables the reader to clearly understand the events he is relating.'This Hallowed Ground' is no exception. It is concise, clear and informative, thus the reader whether this is their 1st Civil War read or their 100th will put the book down and want to know more!For a factual book it often had the feel of a good Civil War novel, it is exciting and breath taking with a real power that I feel is hard to match elsewhere. Here is an author that not only both knows and respects his subject matter but is able to transfer this to the written page.One word of warning, read it slowly. If you rush through this book (and there is a temptation to do so due to its strengths) you will regret it when the last page is completed.",
                    "I have been a reader of Bruce Catton's Civil War histories for years (I own 10 of them). I agree with the reviewers about Catton's vast talent as a storyteller and as a narrator of events. It was through reading his works that I first became aware of some of the lesser known colorful characters of the time, such as Gen. Phillip Kearney, Gen. D.H. Hill, and Robert Toombs. In fact, it was the writing of Bruce Catton that first turned me into a Civil War buff.I have a rather strong objection to the subtitle of this work, which the late historian would never have approved were he alive today. This book is not \"the Union side\" of the Civil War; it gives BOTH sides. In fact, the author is more sympathetic to men like Gen. Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis than I would have been. For many years, some influential historians have sought to label any history that seems to hint that the right side won the Civil War as biased. (Over four score and seven years, actually.) This work is a balanced account, and one of the best one-volume histories of the war ever written, both on the battle front and at the home fronts. It deserves to be thought of as such.",
                    "Of all the heartbreaking, sacrificial, and exhausting wars that the United States has encountered, the Civil War is the most upsetting of all. Bruce Catton, part of the last wave of a generation of romantic historians, paints a vivid portrait of the Union side of the conflict. Like all war historians, he is impressed by the elements that are found in the crucible of a long fight: the pageantry, brilliant tactical moves, feats of individual courage, and the inexhaustible source of stories. But on the other, he has enough judgment to temper his own writing with accounts of casualty lists and useless battles.Catton's main thesis is that although the war did not begin over slavery, it became so through the force of the war's tide, and that the tide only became inexorable after a series of poor decisions on the Union side. He is especially adept at tracing the threads of the various campaigns - the Army of the Potomac's stalemated situation in Virginia, for instance, is contrasted with Grant's quick thinking out west with the Army of the Tennessee. As the title would imply, the book focuses on the to and fro movements of the Union side. Lincoln, Lee, and the particularities of the situation prior to the war are not dealt with in any depth.Nor is this is a book with a list of laundry items for the typical soldier and a slew of footnotes, although it is well-researched and thorough. Catton is more interested in quickly sketching an army as they march through the heat of the Mississippi and the lush countryside of Georgia. He unabashedly plays favorites with his \"cast of characters\" - Grant and Lincoln are praised, McClellan is not - but in most cases his biases are justified.One could argue Catton's taste for drama and humorous anecdote overrides his ability to assess rationally the Civil War, but perhaps his romantic/realistic view of history is more in keeping with the age it is describing. The Civil War was fought by stubborn men who refused to cede a tenet long past its due date - and that in itself is the true tragedy.",
                    "There are more books about the American Civil War than on any other subject in US history. New books are written everyday. Some are very good, some are not. However, despite all the new enteries to the field of study in my opinion the best is some of the oldest. In my opinion no one writes better about the Civil War than Bruce Catton. In this work he looks at the Civil War from the Union point of view. But regardless, it is one of the best single volume histories of the war. And despite its age, Catton's works has stood the test of time. His history is good and accurate. And he can write. Catton discusses good history and tells it in beautiful writing. This could be a novel. There are a lot of books on the Civil War, however there are not a lot of writers as good as Catton.",
                    "Of the thousand of books written on the American Civil War, &quot;This Hallowed Ground&quot; ranks among the very best, standing side by side with James McPherson's &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom.&quot; Both books not only give a comprehensive history of the war but also place the war in historical context and thoroughly discuss its causes and consequences. In so doing, both books provide an insightful analysis of racism in the mid-nineteenth century and how it is a foundation for racism today. Both those who continue to worship the Confederacy and those who believe the lie that slavery was not the cause of the war will hate these books. Those with open and inquiring minds will love them.",
                    "I first read this book almost 40 years ago. With some nervousness, I picked up a copy to read, wondering how well it has held up with the years. Bruce Catton wrote a number of works during his time--from his examination of the Army of the Potomac to his final two volumes of a 3-work biography of U. S. Grant. A number of things stand out about Catton's work. For one, he is an excellent writer. His books move along smoothly and even eloquently. One is captivated by his style. Two, he can, in a few paragraphs, tell us a great deal about the people of the Civil War. Want to get a sense of the crusty veteran general, Charles F. Smith? In a few broad strokes, you get a sense of the man. Three, he provides broader context on the war and its battles, for example, illustrating at one point the difference between the industrial might of the North and the much less advanced industry of the South. A telling commentary on the raw differences between the two sides.This book, then, has something in common with McPherson's splendid \"Battle Cry of Freedom.\" As McPherson, Catton provides a context in which to examine the Civil War. However, even though his description of battles and campaigns tends to be terse, one nonetheless gets a sense of what was at stake and how the battles unfolded. Even with only a few paragraphs on the battle at Wilson's Creek, for instance, one gets a sense of the strange saga of the pugnacious General Lyon's outnumbered army trying to envelope the superior southern forces (the text does not mention that making the odds even longer, Lyon depended on Franz Sigel to carry out the envelopment--a most unfortunate choice).Just so, the discussion of both Gettysburg and Vicksburg is brief but in enough detail to get a sense of the challenges facing both armies at these struggles.Catton unequivocally identifies slavery as a key issue as a part of the cause of the war; he also points out, here and there, how the Union army came slowly to see the evil of slavery, even as they harbored prejudice against slaves.If the reader wants detailed analyses of battles, this book would not serve well. If the reader is interested in a well written historical work that looks at the Civil War and its context, then this book should do nicely. Over a half century since its original publication, this book holds up pretty well--and it is written superbly.",
                    "If you're interested in the Civil War enough to browse this book, go ahead and snag it. To get a grasp on this period of our history, you must read Catton. He tells the overall story in the style almost of a novel. He is accurate and factual. Never fear. But this isn't reading history as you might remember. Catton will get your attention, draw you in and help you to feel some of the myriad of emotions that coursed through our ancestors on both sides of this conflict. He made me understand that wherever they trod was indeed hallowed ground after their passing.",
                    "This is a book about war, rebellion and freedom. And Bruce Catton weaves these three ideas with great precision in telling this story about our American Civil War. War is about battle and Catton leaves no stone unturned, describing the battles fought and the participants involved with clarity and precision. No significant action in the Eastern or Western theaters of operation is omitted and the reader is left with an understanding of the shifting, near thing with which many of the engagements are fought. From Bull Run in 1861 to the final contest at Five Forks in 1865, Catton works his audience through the campaigns in singular detail.With regard to rebellion, Catton is not one to mince words and defines it in one word: Treason. He points out that the South's most significant error was their complete failure to understand early on, the North's total dedication to Union. \"The South could only win its independence by destroying the government of the United States. As such Southerners were not merely enemies; they were traitors, to be treated as such.\" It would be a long and vicious war whose terms and methods of waging it would be defined by Abraham Lincoln.But it is with regard to freedom that Catton is at the top of his form. He regards the Emancipation Proclamation as the most significant weapon fired during those four long years of war. Declaring slavery extinct in exactly all the areas in which the Federal Government could not enforce the decree, the Emancipation was truly an unusual document. But Lincoln knew its ultimate impact. Emancipation isolated the South. In Catton's words, \"It closed a great door in the face of the southern Confederacy. It locked the Confederacy with the anachronism that was the Confederacy's dreadful, fatal burden.\" Europe could not support slavery. The South was alone with limited manpower, no manufacturing capacity to produce the instruments and material with which to wage war and no friends. The millstone of slavery, that for which it had been fighting, would drag it under.Catton delivers a thoughtful, stirring analysis of the American Civil War. Written in 1956, This Hallowed Ground is totally devoid of rancor, finger pointing, or the revisionism so prevalent in many of the works of its era. Bruce Catton is probably the most prolific writer on this subject; given his superb writing he is also probably the best.",
                    "\"This Hallowed Ground\" is famed Civil War historian Bruce Catton's one volume history of that conflict. It captures the great themes of his three volume centennial history in a concise yet complete reading experience.Bruce Catton wrote \"This Hallowed Ground\" in the mid-1950's, prior to the centennial of the Civil War. His scholarship is therefore dated with respect to details revealed by later research, and certainly more recent historians have contributed new and fascinating interpretations of events and participants. However, none save Shelby Foote have approached Catton's literary gifts as a narrative historian of the first order. \"This Hallowed Ground\" reads as tragic human drama on an almost mythic scale. Catton's gift is to provide a coherent narrative of the conflict while locating the stories of very human actors within the larger tragedy. The result brings a long and complicated war into focus for the average reader.Catton came to the study of the Civil War from a career as a journalist, and as one who had known Civil War veterans during his youth in Michigan. Catton had the good journalist's ability to capture a sense of the person, the place, and the event. \"This Hallowed Ground\" is told as a series of rather vivid vignettes, each capturing a key moment in the war. The reader comes to understand how the force of events quickly overran the intentions of both sides at the start of the conflict. Key persons, themselves often driven by political considerations of the moment, changed the direction of events, sometimes inadvertantly. The major personalities, Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, Grant, and Lee march across the stage, but a host of lesser characters have their moments as the war winds down to its awful and perhaps unavoidable conclusion.This book is highly recommended to the reader looking for a highly readable one volume history of the Civil War, and to students of the conflict looking for an account that transcends dry scholarship.",
                    "Bruce Catton is one of the best history writers of the Civil War. He writes in a fashion that is easy to read yet leaves no doubt what he is saying. Very good way to enjoy history. It is almost like reading a novel.",
                    "(For a complete, formatted review, please visit [...]There are not enough superlatives to do justice to this book. I read it as a teenager and bought it in a Washington bookstore for my son but ended up reading it again myself. As many reviewers have noted, if you read only one book about the Civil War, read this. Bruce Catton has a lyrical poetic style that weaves colorful anecdotes with sweeping prose that makes about as much sense as anyone can of the horror of America's bloodiest war by far.First published in 1955, before the civil rights movement entered into the consciousness of most educated Americans, This Hallowed Ground was remarkably prescient, referring repeatedly to the painful issue not just of slavery but of race and of the inevitable reckoning that would have to come if the \"peculiar institution\" were abolished once and for all. Eight years before Martin Luther King was to deliver his \"I Have a Dream Speech,\" Catton could see that almost a century after the Civil War, the United States remained a work in progress.Catton avoids the pitfalls that trap many historians, such as a compulsion for detail that misses the forest for the trees, or a contemporary interpretation whose bias makes later readers wince. When Catton drills down to a battlefield, he gives just enough detail to create a vivid word picture but is adept at zooming out and showing us how the battlefield fits in the campaign, and the campaign in the war, and the war in the history of America. Long before Ken Burns' PBS Civil War series had been conceived (Burns was only 2 when the book was published), Catton peppered his narrative with extracts from letters and diaries of the ordinary men who had a front row seat to this extraordinary history.Perhaps because of all the shouting going on in American politics today about what it means to be an American and the proper scope and power of the federal government, there was something eerily contemporary about the book's opening. Following arrests made in Baltimore, \"when Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney issued a writ of habeas corpus to set one of these free, President Lincoln blandly ignored it... The Supreme Court had indeed been flouted, the Constitution had been stretched, perhaps even broken (depending on one's point of view), scores of people were being held in prison without due process of law... No matter. Maryland was not going to go out of the Union.\" And I could not help think of today's political attack ads when reading that \"men who were whipping themselves up to the point where they would refuse to try to get along with one another were, at the same point in time, doing precisely the things that would bind them together forever whether they liked it or not. \" But for all the harsh words, today's acrimony has not spilled over into violence, as it did on the senate floor in the opening scene of the book with the 1856 caning of Senator Charles Sumner. But the compulsion of demonizing one's adversaries remains: \"All of the things that were slipping beyond hope of easy solution - ... varying interpretations of the American dream - all of these somehow might hinge on what was done about Kansas, so that the wrong phrase in an enacting clause could mean earth's best hope lost forever.\"If Catton's work had been fiction, it would have been rejected for lack of plausibility. Given the carnage of the war that was to come, why would volunteers be so eager to fight that \"soldiers sent home in Indiana threatened to shoot their colonel\"?How could it possibly be that the house chosen to host the surrender that would end this terrible war would be that of Wilmer McLean, a Virginian who found his Bull Run home too caught up in the war's opening battle, so moved to Appomattox? Who knew that Grant not only owned a slave at one point but didn't care all that much about slavery one way or the other until about 1861? Or that the two generals most instrumental to ending the war were both from Ohio and overlapped at West Point (Grant was a senior when Sherman was a plebe)? Or that on the very morning that Sherman was to accept the surrender of General Johnston he received a telegram telling him of Lincoln's murder? And the contrast between General Lee - \"tall, gray, one of the handsomest and most imposing man who ever lived, dressed today in his best uniform, his sword belted at his waist\" and the man who received his surrender \"US Grant, rather scrubby and undersized, wearing his work in close, with mud spattered boots and trousers and a private's rumpled coat with his lieutenant general stars tacked to the shoulders\" at a surrender ceremony where Grant had to borrow ink from the Lee and Lee had to borrow paper reflected staging too perfect for a good fiction editor.His writing pulls you in and keeps you riveted such as with this description of Antietam:There never was another day like Antietam. It was sheer concentrated violence... it had all of the insane fury of Shiloh with this difference: at Shiloh the troops were green ... at Antietam the men were veterans and they knew what they were about... so that the dawn to dusk fight above Antietam creek went into the records as the most murderous single day of the entire war.Sherman's march to the sea is described in a way that rivals the far more biased and regional fiction of Margaret Mitchell: \"Smoke filled the sky like a gigantic ominous signal as Sherman's army pulled clear of the city [of Atlanta] and started for the sea... And so began the strangest, most fateful campaign of the entire war, like nothing that happened before or afterward. These federals were not moving out to find and destroy an armed enemy; the only foe that could give them a fight, Hood's army, was hundreds of miles off to the rear, and everybody knew it. They were not being asked to hurry; 15 miles a day was much less than these long legged marchers could easily make, and everybody knew that too. Their mission was to wreck an economy and to destroy a faith - the economy that supported the thin fading fabric of the Confederacy, the faith that believed the Confederacy to be an enduring creation and trusted in its power to protect and avenge.\" The men were \"conscious agents of this destruction; men who trampled out the terrible vintage of the grapes of wrath, led by an implacable general who was more and more coming to see a monstrous but logical destiny in his mission... For Sherman was not fighting and opposing army now; he was fighting an idea, knocking down the last shredded notion that the Southern Confederacy could exist as an independent nation, moving steadily and relentlessly not toward a climactic engagement but simply toward the end of the war.\"The final days and aftermath of the Civil War are such well-trodden ground that it is surprising that no author before or since has really topped Catton's riveting description of the end:Until this Palm Sunday of 1865 the word Appomattox had no meaning. It was a harsh name left over from Indian days, it belonged to a river and to a country town, and it had no overtones. But after this day, it would be one of the haunted possessions of the American people, a great and unique word that would echo in the national memory with infinite tragedy and infinite promise, recalling a moment in which sunset and sunrise came together in a street glow that was half twilight and half dawn.Like a brilliant movie director, Catton pans his camera over the horrific cost and inevitable consequences of the Civil War in ways that make historical abstractions come alive:Here and there all over the country where the mounded graves of half a million young men who had been alive and unsuspecting when all of this began. There would be more graves to dig, and when there was time there would be thin bugle calls to lie in the still air on a handful of dust drifted down on a blanketed form, but most of this was over. A little more killing, a little more marching and burning and breaking and smashing, and then it would be ended.Ended; yet, in a haunting way, forever unended. It had laid an infinity of loss and grief on the land; it had created a shadowed purple twilight streaked with undying fire which would live on deep in the mind and heart of the nation, as long as any memory of the past retained meaning. Whatever the American people might hereafter do when one way or another take form in color from this experience.If Catton can be faulted, it is for a certain tendency to repeat but his prose is so lyrical, almost hypnotic, that he can be forgiven. He also shares the compulsion of all historians to assign meaning to events, even if some things, perhaps most things, just happen. Historians probably would not be historians if they did not discount the role of randomness, meaningless, and blind chance. But I find myself so mesmerized by Catton's authoritative writing - at times he seems to have known the protagonists personally - that I find myself wanting to believe his sweeping, all-explanatory narrative.",
                    "When I was a freshman in college, way back in 1986 I happened upon a Bruce Catton (1899-1978) book in the bookstore while buying all of my textbooks for my first semester. I picked it up just because I was in a mood to be educated with something that looked more interesting and less daunting than my economics and math textbooks. My fascination with all things Civil War began with that book (I sold it in a fit of stupidity a couple of years later). I read his trilogy, re-printed articles in American Heritage and then I moved on to other talented authors, such as James McPherson.Rather stupidly, I forgot how truly gifted Catton was as a writer and I just assumed that because Catton was the historian of my childhood, he was an inferior writer. Why? I don't know. I picked up this This Hallowed Ground: The Story of the Union Side of the Civil War to read on a family vacation and I was reminded, once again, that this man could truly write and he belongs right there in the pantheon of truly gifted storytellers who can tell the story of America in an entertaining, factual and compelling way (for those that scoff at narrative history in favor of \"serious history\" I say that the purpose of a historian is to tell his society their own story and make it seem that it matters. Bruce Catton did just that.)Catton begins with a single week in May of 1856. We have the beating of abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner by a pro-slavery Congressman in the Senate Chamber, the sacking of Lawrence, Kansas by pro-slavery forces and John Brown's brutal attack at Pottawatomie Creek. All within a few days of each other - all portents of things to come. One thing seemed to unhinge everyone in America - slavery and the disagreement over a state's right to declare a man to be another man's property.Catton does tell the story almost completely from the Union perspective and it is clear that he is sympathetic to the Union cause in this book. He is not the only author of Civil War histories to have favorites, but he is clearly not disrespectful of the Confederate soldiers or of their efforts. He is also leery of some of the liberties Lincoln took in his effort to maintain the Union, as is clear in the section on Clement Vallandigham.Mostly, though, Catton's strength is just his storytelling. It moves along crisply with a penchant for telling the odd, humorous and tragic little stories that make up the overall big story. Along the way, Catton produces some profound little gems, like this paragraph about 1864 the slow, bloody demise of slavery and what that meant for the country that concluded a chapter:\"It would be that sort of year: year of Jubilo, year of overturn and disaster and ruin, year infinite bloodshed and suffering, with the foundations of the great deep broken up; hard tramp of marching military feet, endless shuffle of splay-footed refugees running from something they understood little better than they could understand what they were running toward; the significance of their march being that it led toward the unknown and that all America, like it or not, was going to follow.\"To sum up, this is a lovely little history - beautifully written, skillfully told by a master storyteller. It is not the only history that someone should read of the Civil War, but it is a great place to start. Also, I am thrilled that I went back and re-discovered Bruce Catton and found that he is not only as good as I remembered - he is better.Highly recommended.",
                    "I have an extensive Civil War library, and this is simply the best of the best book therein. It is a one volume offering from the Union point of view, although it clearly defines both sides. Catton's style is simply amazing. Although history at its best, this reads like classic literature. The concluding scenes described by Catton practically bring tears to your eyes.Be aware that this book is out of print. This is why I bought several more copies at Amazon.",
                    "Catton has masterfully crafted a well researched very readable book. It explores much more than troop placements by putting a very human face on the greatest of American tragedies.",
                    "I was half way through the first volume of Foote's epic 3 volume \"The Civil War: a narrative\" when I paused for a breather and read Catton's Hallowed Ground.So, compared to Foote's 3 volume The Civil War, Catton's Hallowed Ground provides a good overview of all the major battles in the Civil War. He had also included quotes from letters soldiers had written to family which I thought was a nice touch as it provided a different view of the civil war and illustrated how tough things were for them. What I also liked about Catton is that he had referenced the quotes and pointed to other books if you were interested in that particular regiment or battle.For someone new to the civil war, I would definitely recommend reading Catton's Hallowed Ground first then refer to Foote for more detailed description of the more interesting battles. However, as another reviewer here points out, there is a hint of bias in favour of the confederacy in Foote.",
                    "The premiere work from the War Between the States' best author. I've read nearly all of Bruce Catton's Civil War work and this one is the best--buy it and read it again and again.",
                    "If you are one who has never read a book about the Civil War, or studied it since you were in high school, you could do much worse than to start with Bruce Catton's \"This Hallowed Ground.\" Mr. Catton, who passed away in 1978, has long been hailed as one of the best, if not the very best, Civil War writer ever to create a manuscript. Recently, when I mentioned to a friend during a conversation about the kind of books we prefer, that I read a lot about the American Civil War, she sort of made a sour face and began praising the virtues of Romance novels. Now, there are history books, even books about the Civil War that warrant a sour face, but the books written by Bruce Catton are not among them. His narrative, his prose, his whole writing style is sometimes enough to bring tears to the eyes or take the breath away. Here, I quote a paragraph from a chapter titled \"Where They Were Bound to Go,\" in the book that is the subject of this review.\"The wind was being sown, and the hurricane would come later; and yet, all in all, these things were not so much causes as warnings - the lightning flashes that set evil scarlet flares against the black clouds that were banked up along the horizon. Somewhere beyond the lightning there was thunder, and the making of a great wind that would change the face of a nation, destroying much that men did not want destroyed. A doom was taking shape, and it seemed to be coming on relentlessly, as if there was nothing that anyone could do to prevent it. The republic that had been born in an air so full of promise that it might have been the morning of the seventh day was getting ready to tear itself apart.\"In this manner Mr. Catton sets the scene for the war that took the lives of 620,000 Americans, tore families apart, and put some teeth in the statement that \"All men are created equal.\" As has been noted in other reviews here, Catton was top-heavy on the side of the North, and why not? He was a Michigan boy, and no one would expect a Michigan boy to lionize the South any more than they would expect a fellow from Georgia to shun Stonewall Jackson and glorify Tecumseh Sherman! Yet there is, wrapped up in all of the words in this book that seem to revere the Union cause, in the dramatic and often dynamic prose of a great writer, a recognizable thread of fairness, and deep admiration for the courage and valor of the Southern soldier.This Hallowed Ground is an excellent place to start any study of the Civil War, or even to engage in some casual reading. Bruce Catton begins before the beginning, and carries it through to the end, leaving out much of the battle strategy and tactics, and appealing to the heart of every American who, as he says on page 25 of the paperback edition: \"......what they saw, briefly but clearly, after so many years in which nothing was clear - was the fact that they did have a country and that their common possession of it was the most precious thing in the world.\" It may be that what Americans saw so clearly all those years ago, is the only way to understand the \"why\" of the war that changed the soul of this great nation. At least, I think that may be so.",

                    "James Ford Rhodes (May 1st, 1848 - January 22nd, 1927) was both an industrialist and an historian. Prior to this work, he produced seven volumes of a \"History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850\" (an eighth volume was published after this work), and he also produced a three volume \"History of the Civil War 1861-1865\". In the preface to this one-volume \"History of the Civil War 1861-1865\" he states that this is not an \"abridgement\" of his prior work, but rather was a \"fresh\" study.Originally published by \"The MacMillan Company\" in 1917, this new History was awarded the 2nd Pulitzer Prize for History in 1918. Rhodes became known for his detailed research and lack of bias which is consistent throughout all his history works. His balanced treatment of both sides is a rather stark contrast to the first winner of the Pulitzer Prize in History (Jean Jules Jusserand's \"With Americans of Past and Present Days\") which was more of a celebration of Franco-American relations.It is interesting while reading this book to think about the way the perceptions of the United States Civil War have changed over the years. As an example, Rhodes has no difficulty in emphasizing slavery and anti-slavery as the primary causes of the war, and since that time it has become more common to see more general references to state rights used, perhaps to cover the ugliness of issue. Another example would be the way History and Historians treat Robert E. Lee. Rhodes has high praise for Lee, though that is not to say that he doesn't point out his mistakes. Lee does not seem to fare so well with modern historians.The discussion of other nation's attitudes towards the war is one of the more interesting sections, at least for me. Though ultimately there was no foreign interference, it is interesting to learn how a different outcome in a battle here and there, could easily have changed things considerably. One also gets a slightly different view on the French position towards the Union than one did from the essay from Jusserand's work, though to be fair the prior work was more focused on their attitude towards slavery and Abraham Lincoln, and not as much on the war and its negative effects on France.Other interesting chapters and threads throughout the book include looking at how the North responded to the draft, especially after it became clear that the war would be won. There is a discussion of the politics and the Democratic Party turning into the Copperheads, while some legitimate opposition positions were lost as a result of the party pushing their opposition to Lincoln and the war. Rhodes also discusses the technology, and the failure to quickly move to breech loading rifles.His discussion of the economics during the war is also very thorough. Obviously there is a discussion on the blockades and blockade running. In addition he discusses the currency problems faced both in North and South, as well as the debt resulting from the war and the consequences to the populations of the Union and the Confederacy. He also looks at the illegal trade between North and South during the war.Not surprisingly, Rhodes gives an excellent and thorough evaluation of the Generals and other figures on each side of the war. In particular, his comparison of the Generals as they come into opposition with each other is particularly well done. While the perception of some of them as changed through time, one can count on an even appraisal in all cases. The same is true for his evaluation of the battles, tactics, and strategies from the perspective of both sides. Of course, there are many good books on the United States Civil War which cover these areas, but just as obviously this book would not be complete without them.One weakness of this history, is that despite Rhodes' claim that this was a fresh study, he does in the very early discussion inform the reader that his discussion of the supporters for disunion was so complete in his three volume history that it is unnecessary to repeat it at length. The result is that one has to wonder how much he is leaving out in this one volume history that was included in his earlier three volume work. Having not read his earlier history, or his larger history of the entire era, it is impossible to judge how much he is leaving out.Along the same lines, his discussion ends fairly abruptly after describing in some detail Lee's surrender, he then briefly mentions the assassination of Lincoln and the surrender of Johnston to Sherman. There is no discussion of the aftermath of the war to balance the discussion of the events leading to the start of the war. These weaknesses are small though when one looks at the overall strength of the book. This one is highly recommended, even after 90+ years.",
                    "Purchasers of this classic civil war history need to be aware that the original Macmillan hardcover editions contain 8 full-color, fold-out maps, that you will not likely find in such marvelous form in the print-on-demand paperback reproductions. The original maps are one of the real treasures of this title and so any editions without them would, I'm sorry to say, be considered woefully inferior.",
                    "I was afraid I'd be bored by attempting to read up on the Civil war, even though as a foreigner here, I wanted to learn about american history. Turns out, this book is extremely engrossing; I could not put it down once I took it up, and I don't remember any part being boring such that I wanted to skip over them. As for the accuracy of information presented, I cannot tell but trust the various reviews that I've found on different sources that this is a good book. It sure packs a lot of information into it, and gives a very good over-view of the civil war. The only peeve I have is that the book is rather centered around the east-south-eastern USA. There isn't much mention of what was going on in the north (especially wisconsin where I live where the civil war was very alive) nor the west (there's a few mentions here and there about the west.) Yet I don't know if one can find a better introductory book than this on the civil war.",

                    "The book is well written and has been very worth while to read. Unfortunately I seem to be missing the illustrations which I presume is a part of the book, I am therefore not able to evaluate the entirely.RegardsKim Mller Petersen",

Based on previously unpublished letters and diaries, CIVIL WAR SOLDIERS follows the troops of both North and South. It describes not only their feelings about what they were doing and the reasons they did it, it shows the offense that men of both armies took from the behaviour of their fellow citizens. and claims that medical help was either lacking or incompetent. Mitchell claims that blacks suffered brutality from both armies and offers proof.This is a book that reaches across the centuries to bring a distant war close to the reader. It should be required reading in every American history classroom.",
                    "In researching the family genealogy, I discovered many soldiers in the Civil, 1812,WWI and WWII wars. This book is a great way to share what they personally felt and believed in what they were doing. Invaluable!",
                    "Mitchell brings together a collection of primary sources to bring together a thesis that I've always bandied about in conversation, but lacked the background to make clear: that the occupational aspect of the union side heavily colored their view of the purpose of the war. The union soldier saw a backward, inferior society in the South-a \"way of life\" unworthy of a great country, and was more than happy to defeat it and its people. THe central chapter \"The Union Soldier Views the South\", certainly explains why Mitchell in his intro. says that he has been described as a \"post-Vietnam\" historian: the chapter is filled with citations from letters by soldiers describing not only a people that they do not understand, but a half-wild, feudal landscape at stark odds with the well-ordered towns of the Midwest.",
                    "Civil War Soldiers provides an excellent overview into the beliefs and mindsets of both Northern and Confederate soldiers. This book includes excerpts and snippets from soldier's primary sources, mostly letters and journals. Mitchell follows events from the motivations for men to enlist and the initial excitement and conviction of going to war through the Emancipation Proclamation, then through to the surrender of Lee and Lincoln's assassination. The reader really gets a feel for the soldier's conflicting justifications and complex emotional reactions to battle, looting, and experiences with civilians and African Americans. The hardships and deprivations that soldiers experienced are told from their own voices; the thrill of battle and the rage felt at fighting guerrilla forces. Glimpses are seen of prisons, pillaging, and civil interactions between enemies. Being a soldier in the Civil War was an emotional and mentally trying experience; Mitchell shows the complexity through the voices of those who fought in the war."

                    "\"War, Terrible War: 1855-1865,\" the sixth volume in Joy Hakim's A History of US series, tells the story of the Civil War, although the author points out that there was nothing civil about it. Instead, Hakim favors Lincoln's notion that the purpose of the war was to give the nation a \"new birth of freedom.\" Within these pages young readers will learn about the bloody conflict, beginning with Fort Sumter and the battle of Manassas to Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House and the assassination of President Lincoln.However, I have to admit I was a bit distracted because while I understood 1865 was the year the Civil War ended I was not sure what 1855 was supposed to signify as a starting point. The previous volume in the series, \"Liberty for All?\" set up the slavery issue and created some overlap in covering the years 1820-1860. But why the year 1855? The Compromise of 1850 was in 1850, Harriet Beecher Stowe published \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" in 1852, the Kansas-Nebraska Act was in 1854, the Dred Scott decision in 1857, the Lincoln-Douglas debates in 1858, and John Brown's attack on Harpers Ferry in 1859. Off the top of my head I would say that the Republican Party might have been founded in 1855, since they put up their first candidate in 1856, but that is not mentioned in this volume.In fact, after a preface that sets the stage for the Civil War by recalling the infamous dinner in 1830 when President Andrew Jackson and his Vice President John C. Calhoun quarreled over the issue of Union, the first chapter of this book is devoted Southern states leaving the Union after Lincoln's election in 1860. The war begins in the second chapter with the Confederates firing on Fort Sumter and the battle of First Manassas (note Hakim lets the winning side name the battle). Then Hakim goes back in time to Harriet Beecher Stowe's \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" the story of Harriet Tubman, and the mythological political career of Abraham Lincoln. Chronology continues to become a secondary consideration as Hakim devotes a chapter to Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy, before looking at the slavery issue and the story of John Brown. Only after establishing Lincoln's problem in trying to hold the Union together does Hakim return to a chronological account of the major campaigns and battles. But never a mention of why 1855 is the starting point for the volume.That is a minor concern, because I prefer a solid argumentative structure to mere chronology. Consequently \"War, Terrible War\" can be seen as having four distinct sections. The first (Chapters 1-2), establishes the spark that started the Civil War. The second (Chapters 3-10) goes back and provides key background elements that will help young readers to understand the issues and personalities that are played out in this particular drama. The third (Chapters 11-25) covers the Civil War through the Battle of Gettysburg and includes both the Emancipation Proclamation that made this a war to free the slaves and the Gettysburg Address that reestablished the idea that \"all men are created equal\" as the supreme American principle. The final unit (Chapters 26-31) covers the end of the war and the brutal irony of Lincoln's assassination once the threat to the Union was ended.Throughout the book Hakim not only relates events, she captures the passion and commitment of abolitionists and slave owners through a series of profiles of politicians and soldiers on both sides, slave owners, abolitionists, average citizens, and others. These books are richly illustrated with historic photographs, etchings, political cartoons, maps, and the like. The margins are crammed with definitions and mini-biographies, as well as quotations from both historic figures and contemporary historians. As always, the major strength of this series is that Hakim keeps her young audience first and foremost in mind. Constantly asking her readers to think about these events from the perspective of the participants, she also does a marvelous job of anticipating questions from them as well. For example, if anyone has seen the Ken Burns documentary on \"The Civil War\" or the film \"Gettysburg\" and is wondering why Hakim does not talk about Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, there is a note in the margins to check out the book \"The Killer Angels.\"If there is a better juvenile American history series out there for young students who are being home schooled, then I have yet to see it. This is a superb series that does an admirable job of adapting a wealth of information and historical details to its audience. Hakim knows that her readers have grown up on computers and the Internet, but she does not sacrifice her subject matter on the altar of stylish presentation."

                    "This very readable volume is an introduction and guide to the battles and issues of the Civil War. It was the greatest emotional experience and has an unceasing attraction for Americans (`Preface'). The Civil War brought important changes to society, its economics (growth of corporations), and the role of government. It was the first conflict of the technological age (p.7). A peaceful solution was impossible (p.8). The war was decided in the West while there was a stalemate in Northern Virginia. Naval operations are often overlooked. The story of the Civil War often overlooks the economic and political facts. [The `Index' does not list the Income Tax Act of 1861 or the Legal Tender Act of 1862.] The real power of the North was in its agriculture and manufacturing, miles of railroads, and industrial power. The `List of Maps' is on pages 13 and 14.The `Contents' list the thirty chapters. They are written for the general reader. [R. Ernest Dupuy was a reporter, ship news editor, and feature editor before 1917.] Chapter 1 tells of the attack on Fort Sumter. General Winfield Scott recommended an immediate blockade of Southern ports and raising a tremendous army to invade down the Mississippi (p.35). Politicians wanted a quick and cheap victory. General George McClellan reorganized the new and enlarged army (Chapter 4). Could the South have won after the first Bull Run (p.49)? Chapter 5 tells of the maneuvering to gain control of Missouri and Kentucky, border states with divided loyalties. Chapter 6 tells of the little-known invasion of New Mexico by Confederate General Henry Sibley. His defeat kept New Mexico in the Union. New Orleans was captured in April 1862. The Confederates invaded the North but were stopped at Antietam (Chapter 12). McClellan failed to win (p.165). Chapter 17 describes the battle of Gettysburg, Lee withdrew. Grant captured Vicksburg (Chapter 18). The naval blockade reduced supplies to the South (Chapter 20). Battles continued in northern Virginia (Chapter 22). The Confederate Navy destroyed or captured hundreds of US ships (Chapter 24). The `Kearsarge' sank the `Alabama' near Cherbourg France (p.323). Sherman invaded Georgia and captured Atlanta (Chapter 25). Jubal Early invaded Maryland and came close to Washington (Chapter 26). This led to the Shenandoah Valley campaign. Sherman captured Savannah (Chapter 27). Wilmington NC was captured (Chapter 28). Columbia and Charleston SC were occupied (Chapter 29). Petersburg VA was attacked, Richmond was evacuated. Lee was trapped and surrendered (Chapter 30).The `Appendix' tells of the Arms and Uniforms. The Union recognized 79 different models of rifles and muskets, 23 types of carbines and musketoons, and 19 models of pistols and revolvers. The Confederate inventory was similar. Northern artillery was mostly smooth-bore bronze Napoleons and cast-iron rifled Parrott guns. The Confederates used older and captured cannon. The Northern Navy used older smooth-bore cannon and the newer Dahlgren rifled guns. [The authors both served in the Field Artillery.] While the Union uniform was blue and the Confederates wore grey, the beginning saw a variety of uniforms (p.424). Each militia group could select their uniform at the beginning. [The `fog of war' may have showed the need for consistency and differences.] There is a `Selected Bibliography'. The `Envoi' says those familiar with civil strife in European history expected continued resistance by guerilla bands (p.418). The magnanimous and liberal surrender terms may have prevented this, as well as a lack of popular support. It was time for peace (p.419).",

                    "The book contains valuable sources, is well documented, and presents some good information, but it has some unpleasantly conspicuous problems. This book presents a mono-causal reason at the tactical level of war for why the Confederacy lost which is overly simplistic. Analysis of conflicts and their resolutions can rarely by tied to one cause - causes are normally woven together and to analyze one thread without the others creates an artificiality which negates any sincere analysis. This book conducts a sterile study of war at the tactical level without the influence of strategy, operational plans, politics, or economics which gives questionable results.In the beginning of the book, the authors clearly state their thesis which is the only time that it is clear. They begin to present data in several different tables that are skewed. In presenting a case that the Confederacy suffered more casualties because they attacked more often, the authors include the 29,396 southern soldiers who surrendered at Vickburg (these soldiers were entrenched and never attacked). There is sufficient evidence to support their case without skewing figures - this only lessens their credibility.After the first section, the thesis of the book seems to wander. Facts are presented but analysis is missing. Various issues of the war are well presented while others are biased and fail to present all of the evidence - some of the evidence does not support the thesis and some negates it. The combination of the rifle and fieldworks are proclaimed to be practically invincible. This becomes the primary thesis for most of the second section and the authors are more interested in proving this new thesis than supporting their original one. The South is accused of failing to learn from its attacks on entrenched positions while Gen Grant proceeded to charge them through the end of the war. Their logic is questionable, and they fail to ask if there were other reasons for these attacks. Did political pressure drive these attacks? What was the strategic objectives of both sides? None of these questions were addressed which all influenced the generals' decisions.Some of the topics presented in the book are never woven back into the theme of the book. In discussing artillery, the authors were more interested in proving that the rifle was the sole cause of the Confederate losses rather than showing how the devastation caused by smoothbore artillery against attacking infantry supported their original thesis. Cavalry was discussed but only in terms of its ineffectiveness as shock troops against the rifle. The book did not discuss the effective uses of the cavalry (reconnaissance or raids) and it did not develop how the change in roles for the cavalry supported their original thesis.The most glaring problem with this book is in the last chapter. This is where the true (hidden) thesis is presented - the Celtic heritage being the reason the South lost the war. The evidence presented is circumstantial and weak. The second to last chapter presented an excellent argument for why the Civil War generals' preferred to attack - they were young officers during the Mexican War where offensive action was decisive.The original thesis does present a factor in why the south lost - they lost in attrition warfare. With a smaller population, the South had less men available and the cost of attrition warfare was greater. They did sacrifice too many men in charges but was there a valid alternative? The authors did not explore other options but locked themselves into hidden agendas which diverted them from fully exploring, supporting, and developing their original thesis.",
                    "I would like to give this 2.5 stars, but 3 is too much.As a tactical discussion this is probably preferable to Paddy Griffith's work favoring vigorous frontal assault and discounting the new firepower. However, Attack and Die has some glaring omissions that hurt it, and it also makes some assertions that don't help. There are too many technological phases and differing terrain, strategic, and logistical situations in the American Civil War to support the simple tactical absolutes that authors too often apply.The authors' thesis is two fold: Southern armies were too aggressive; and that this was the result of Celtic heritage. On the first point it is true that the improvements in the rifle and percussion firing systems greatly improved the odds for the force on the tactical defensive. As the war progressed, earthworks further increased lethality of rifles while shielding the defender and concealing his numbers. However, this completely misses the strategic fact that it's rather hard for two opposing armies to simultaneously and indefinitely remain on the defensive since it results in stalemate. Unfortunately, as Joe Johnston proved both at Vicksburg (by failing to support Pemberton) and before Atlanta, if one cannot find an opportunity to repel the invader, the enemy can pin one's force and subdue it through siege operations. So remaining on the defensive can result in an even more demoralizing defeat without ever yielding an opportunity for victory. Preserving one's force is irrelevant if it cannot be fed or equipped because of destruction of one's territory, industry and logistical hubs. Lee, Davis, and even Bragg understood that. \"Use it or lose it\" applies.As for blaming the tactical offensive of Southern armies on Celtic roots, it fails on several levels. First, one wonders what that means for Grant's armies who lost far more men in offensives...and in the end captured three separate CSA field armies for their trouble, and broke the siege of Chattanooga. Second the ethnic theory illustrates a huge flaw in the authors' (and many others') approach to comparing North and South, a simplistic New England vs. Old South view. Both North and South were heterogeneous, the North far more so. New England was far different than the Old Northwest, or the western states of the time. The differences can be seen clearly in census data for churches.The discussion of ancient Celts, the *strategic* reasons for their defeats, the quality of their weapons and battles is very flawed and Telamon in particularly was erroneously interpreted.Ignoring the speculative ethnic theory, what is missing in the discussion is the recognition of initiative and that when defending one's territory one must either compel the invading army to attack so that it can be defeated, or find a way to gain sufficient advantage to attack and defeat it. This was the impetus behind Lee's actions to repeatedly repel Union armies in Virginia. While the cost was high, it was probably necessary to prevent the immobilization and eventual defeat of his army. When Lee could no longer do this in 1864 he was forced to settle into a prolonged but eventually fatal siege defense.Another important factor the authors neglected is that armies on the strategic offensive in hostile territory are at a considerable disadvantage in terms of intelligence, communications, and supply. Most of the decisive defeats North and South occurred as much for these strategic considerations as for tactical ones. Often forcing one major battle was sufficient to deplete the enemy's supplies or manpower sufficiently to end the offensive campaign even if victorious tactically.The authors are careful to point out the general adoption of major entrenchments as a standard practice by 1864, and how this greatly changed Civil War fighting. They also illustrate how these (along with further entrenchments in the rear) became nearly impregnable to assault. Upton and other commanders had partial successes of using heavy assault columns to overwhelm sections, but the inherent resulting disorganization prevented capture of parallels to the rear. Local successes had become too difficult to exploit with large armies.The best aspect of the book is the continual referencing of Mexican War actions and how these shaped the tactical thinking of the ACW commanders. Also useful is the lengthy discussions of period tactical manuals for the various arms.The artillery discussion is generally correct, but the authors conspicuously fail to note the *wartime* transition from inaccurate and short ranged 6 pounder smoothbores and 12 pounder howitzers to the more accurate and longer ranged Napoleons and rifled pieces.I was shocked at the lack of attention paid to Nathan Bedford Forrest's superb tactical skills. In fact the authors go so far as to suggest he added nothing! Perhaps they should have studied Brice's Cross Roads---a very relevant action that they entirely neglected to mention. Forrest understood initiative, momentum and concentration. Initiative and momentum are not things the authors seem to appreciate. With regard to weaponry, Forrest, like Mosby preferred two pistols for his men. This was an acknowledgement of the melee style of combat that frequently occurred in the thicketed country he operated in. He also at times effectively advanced his cannon in a more Napoleonic support because rifle range was not a factor in the dense growth. But perhaps Forrest's effective closer fighting style is in fact why they ignored his contributions.Another irritating oversight was ignoring the decisive battle of the Vicksburg campaign, Champion Hill, and instead focusing on assaults vs. the entrenchments around the city. Champion Hill was an example of fixing an army in position and then hammering at a wing until it broke. The whole Vicksburg campaign up until the siege is one of continuous motion (initiative and momentum) never allowing the defenders to face the attacker with parity. Furthermore, after Champion Hill, at the Big Black River Grant's forces easily overran the entrenchments and forced Pemberton's army back into the city's works. Other lesser-known examples are Piedmont, Droop Mountain, Cloyd's Mountain.Where Johnston failed is in giving up all the ground before Atlanta without once finding a point to effectively turn the Federal position or destroy a section of the army when it was most vulnerable. This is something the authors overlooked: the vulnerability of armies on the move to momentum based attacks. The defensive tactical advantage existed when positions were fixed and the defenders forces could support one another. When an army was moving it could be struck without such advantages as interior lines and defensive entrenchments. It also had less sense of where the enemy was and how strong while moving. Some famous examples of striking armies on the move include Brice's Crossroads, Mansfield, New Market, and Olustee. Each of these were Confederate victories seizing the tactical offensive from the enemy and effectively halting a Federal campaign.Grant and Lee understood the initiative at both strategic and tactical levels. The authors (as well as McClellan and Joe Johnston) apparently do/did not. The tactical offensive could be extremely costly and against entrenched defenders it was nearly suicidal unless there were special considerations. However, it could also achieve the strategic objective and produce outsized results in various other situations. I can't recommend this work to most readers as I think it will lead them to an erroneous view of offensive operations because its conclusions are too broad and absolute.",
                    "Attack and Die : Civil War Military Tactics and the Southern Heritage by Grady McWhiney and Perry D. Jamieson is a good compliment to other more complete histories of the Civil War. In and of itself the book is too focused on its central thesis - that the South lost due to the compulsion of its generals to be on the offensive and the resulting high casualty rate. While these tactics certainly had a dramatic effect on the outcome, the authors fail to put them in to the proper context of other causes.The strength of the book is in its description of the reasons for the Confederate strategy, and the failure of almost all Civil War generals to come to grips with the effect that the introduction of the rifle had on the upcoming battles. The authors trace the introduction of the rifle and the displacement of the musket as well as how the tactics that were used being generally premised on the musket. What was missing was any refrence to General Longstreet's plan for the strategic offense combined with tactical defense. This is exactly what Longstreet suggested to Lee before the second day of Gettysburg.The most interesting part of the book is the last two chapters. The second to last discusses how the Mexican War experiences of the generals predisposed the participants to take the offensive, since that is how the Mexican War was won. The increased accuracy and killing power of the rifle made those tactics obsolete.The last chapter is the most interesting, although the authors may have taken their conclusions too far. Their conclusion is that given the Celtic roots of the Confederate Generals that they were culturally programmed to take the offensive. While the cultural antecedents of the generals cannot be dismissed as a factor, the Celtic battles that the authors discuss took place generations before the Civil War.This is a worthwhile read for someone who already has a good Civil War background.",
                    "McWhiney and Jamieson use Attack and Die: Civil War Military Tactics and the Southern Heritage to effectively stage a war between the American Englishman of the North and the American Celts of the South. The authors engulf themselves in the heritage and culture of the South and its ties to its Celtic ancestry. Their viewpoints on how and why the Confederacy lost so many men are saturated throughout the book. Their exposition on Civil War tactics and how they were altered or rendered ineffective by technology allows the reader to examine the challenges faced by the Confederate commanders and soldiers in a war being fought solely with spirit and ambition.McWhiney's thesis is much more of a stretch. He examines the disastrous Southern military tactics which cost the Confederacy its independence and argues that the reason the South stuck to these tactics for so long had to do with the Celtic ancestry and folkways of Southerners and of Southern culture. He contends that &quot;the Confederates bled themselves nearly to death in the first three years of the war making costly attacks more often than did the Federals. Offensive tactics, which had been used so successfully by Americans in the Mexican War, were much less effective in the 1860's because an improved weapon, the rifle, had vastly increased the strength of defenders. The Confederates could have offset their numerical disadvantage by remaining on the defensive and forcing the Federals to attack; one man in a trench armed with a rifle was equal to several outside it. But Southerners, imprisoned in a culture that rejected careful calculation and patience, often refused to learn from their mistakes. They continued to fight, despite mounting casualties, with the same courageous dash and reckless abandon that had characterized their Celtic ancestors for two thousand years. The Confederates favored offensive warfare because the Celtic charge was and integral part of their heritage....There was no glory to be gained from fighting out of a hole in the ground.&quot;",
                    "The focus of this book is boldly stated on page xv: \"How and why the Confederates lost so many men is the burden of this book. We contend that the Confederates bled themselves nearly to death in the first three years of the war by making costly attacks more often than did the Federals.\"One theme of the book is that warfare had been changed by the outset of the Civil War, with the development of rifled guns. Masses of troops firing at one another at close range made some sense with the inaccurate muskets of the Revolutionary War or the Napoleonic Wars. However, such formations made much less sense as rifles increased accuracy and range.Among specific arguments that the book makes is that the romance of the bayonet was pretty much done; evidence suggests that rather few casualties came from bayonet thrusts? Why not? It was difficult for attacking soldiers to get close enough to defenders because of the rifle fire and the use of defensive positioning. Fieldworks thwarted many massed charges; soldiers on the defensive were ordinarily better placed for victory than those who attacked. Just so, the value of cavalry with sabers bared, charging. The bulk of cavalry combat came with troopers fighting as infantry did, not fighting from atop their horses.Doctrine lagged behind facts-on-the-ground. Only a few officers began to redefine how to carry out an offensive against entrenchments (e.g., Emory Upton). And, according to the authors, Confederates appeared less willing to give up the tactical offensive. Why? Here comes the rather bizarre part of the book. The authors content that southerners were more Celtic and Northern troops more English. And, the contention goes, Celtic warriors fought on the offensive (there is even an effort to tie the Rebel yell to Celtic warriors). At this point, the argument, to me, falls to pieces.Nonetheless, up to that point, the analysis makes some sense. Other books have explored this thesis, too, but--until the end--this book compares well.",
                    "McWhiney and Jamieson argue that the South lost the Civil War because it lost too many men through frontal assaults, and that the frontal assaults were actuated by the South's aggression-prone Celtic culture.I thought the book established effectively that the defender had the advantage in the Civil War and discussed cogently the role of current tactical thought and Mexican War experience in encouraging offensive tactics despite the changes wrought by the rifled musket.The authors claim that when Confederate soldiers attacked they suffered more casualties than Federals did when they attacked, but do not seem to give an explanation. If this is true, and the problematic nature of exact numbers and losses in the Civil War should be acknowledged, I suspect it has to do with artillery fuses.A major claim, that Confederate troops attacked more often than Federals did, is never, in my view, substantiated. The evidence offered, which includes accounts of Grant's attacks in 1864, actually supports the idea that neither side really learned the dangers of the tactical offensive.I am, in particular, not convinced by any aspect of the \"Celtic\" theory. The evidence of a Southern preference for the offensive seems shaky, and the evidence for Southern cultural aggressiveness comes mostly from anecdotal and/or unfriendly sources. A newspaper editor ranting about war to the knife, or similar sources, shouldn't be taken as representing a culture as a whole.Nor am I convinced that the South was \"Celtic\", and the argument put forward by the authors is circular -- the South fought aggressively and that proves they were Celtic because Celts are aggressive. Actually, a quick look at the surnames of Northern and Southern generals and politicians doesn't give me any sense that the North, with its Sheridan and Grant, was any less Celtic in ancestry than the South with its Davis and Stuart. Irish immigrants were more common in Northern than Southern armies, though both sides had their Irish Brigades.The idea that the Celts were aggressive convinces me least of all. To support this claim, the authors mix primary sources and literary references, often from unfriendly and not necessarily expert authors (Caesar) and skip wildly from one cultural and historical setting to the next, giving a deep analysis of none and appearing to choose evidence tendentiously. Bannockburn, for example, appears, but Scots defensive schiltron formations do not.The authors use overgeneralized and stereotypical \"racial\" arguments -- Romans, Englishmen and Yankees were \"practical, materialistic, tenacious, machine-like\", and Celts and Confederates were \"emotional, foolhardy, romantic, undisciplined\". Substitute \"white\" and \"black\" for those ethnicities and it becomes clear that this argument is oversimplified at best. The idea that the American Civil War represented \"a continuation of the centuries-old conflict between Celts and Englishmen...\" not only strikes me as specious, but underemphasizes slavery as a cause to a degree with which I am uncomfortable.The idea that there's some meaningful tactical or cultural link between Pickett's Charge, say, and Vercingetorix, or for that matter Bonnie Prince Charlie, beggars my belief -- the popularity of Scott's novels notwithstanding. The book descends to its silliest level when it attempts to draw a serious parallel between a Union soldier's quite possibly wild claim of having found Union skulls in a Confederate camp and the beheading activities of the medieval Irish literary/mythological hero Cu Chulainn.I can't recommend this as serious scholarship.",
                    "Probably better suited for more serious students of the Civil War, \"Attack and Die\" by Grady McWhiney and Perry D. Jamieson, provides an excellent expose' about how the Confederates \"bled themselves nearly to death...\" by attacking with greater frequency than their Northern counterparts. The book also presents a very compelling argument about how the use of outdated offensive tactics, learned during the Mexican War, and antiquated in the face of major technological improvements to muskets and cannon, had a devastating effect on the South.Another interesting, and controversial, aspect of the book is the authors' conclusion that the tendency for offensive warfare was deeply rooted in Southern culture, and Celtic heritage. While the authors lacked sufficient evidence to be convincing on this point, they were far more convincing about how the advent of the rifle made bayonet attacks obsolete, the offensive use of cavalry ineffective, and entrenchments and fieldworks highly prized by Northern commanders.Although, as the authors point out that there were good reasons for the South to adopt a defensive strategy, they elected to pursue the offensive to the detriment of their cause. Certainly, it is difficult to argue with the fact that the South lost 175,000 men during the first 27 months of the war due to their propensity for offensive action, or how they lost 97,000 men vs. 77,000 men for the North during the first twelve major battles of the war, or how Pickett's famous charge resulted in the loss of 62% of his command at Gettysburg.It's no wonder that these tactics prompted D.H. Hill to respond with, \"it was not war, it was murder,\" in reference to the losses the Confederates took after repeated attacks against heavily entrenched Union troops on Malvern Hill on July 1, 1862.This book is an insightful and worthy addition to the study of Civil War strategy and tactics.",
                    "As many other reviewers have pointed out, the &quot;Celtic&quot; premise is ridiculously overblown. The Army of Northern Virginia can not be compared to the Scots at Culloden in 1745.Also, as other reviewers have pointed out, the book ignores many &quot;big picture&quot; issues that played into the outcome of the war. Better alternative reading would be &quot;Two Great Rebel Armies&quot; by McMurry or &quot;Why the South Lost&quot; by Hattaway and company.",
                    "The authors make an excellent argument that Confederate tactical aggression in the face of changing technology caused an attrition rate higher than their adversaries (exactly what one does not want when fighting a defensive war), an argument that is backed up with statistics and logic. Unfortunately they then make bizarre and totally unsupported conclusions from that...conclusion.The body of the book is a bit dry and heavy on numbers and charts, which actually makes it good as a tabletop reference. They have an obvious pro-Confederate bias, shown most clearly in the use of Manassas and Sharpsburg instead of Bull Run and Antietam (although they also use the Union name Fair Oaks instead of the more common Seven Pines). They also say \"yankee\" and if I recall correctly use one or more of the pro-South euphemisms (Southern Independence, Northern Aggression, etc.); slavery is not mentioned, but I don't think it should be, as this is an examination of battlefield tactics used IN the war, not a study of the political causes OF the war. It frequently refers to the experiences of the men on both sides during the Mexican-American War, and how this last struggle fought with smoothbore muskets taught them the exact WRONG lessons for a war fought with rifled muskets. So overall the data is good, and I can recommend it to students and anyone with a solid background in the conflict. Novices would find it obtuse and boring, and experts probably won't discover anything new, but those of us in the middle could put it to good use.The ending makes absolutely no sense whatsoever as it veers into ethnic theories, the so-called \"Celtic thesis\". This is completely unsupported by facts in evidence (or facts generally); there is literally ONE mention of this element before the conclusion, a single line in the Acknowledgements. Now, I once did this, trying to force a conclusion at the end without leading up to it; of course, I was in 8th grade at the time and it was the first serious research paper I ever wrote, at a monstrous 5 pages. To see this done by a pair of PhDs in a major scholarly work is shocking. Also, the stats tables so useful in the main body are absent from the conclusion; perhaps because a demographic study would implode the whole theory. Pennsylvania had a larger concentration of Welsh and Scots-Irish than most of the South, yet McWhiney and Jamieson don't make jaw-dropping statements about their inherited aggression and barbarity. In the eyes of themselves and their would-be allies across the sea, the Virginia planters were Englishmen in all but geography; the North took in the majority of the Irish, and Southerner and Englishman alike sneered at the Celtic mob.To sum up: there is a wealth of useful information here, but take the concluding chapter with an entire bowl of salt.",
                    "I'd write much more if I had the space (and I might eventually write the authors in any event), but I see three errors in the authors' assertion that the South was uselessly aggressive early in the war and could have won through a more defensive strategy:1. It is based on the enemy being obliging enough to attack frontally. In the First Manassas campaign, however, the Union commander elected to turn the flank rather than attack the Confederate entrenchments, and nearly won the battle as a result.If the Union commanders had all followed this example, all the Southern armies' defensive positions wouldn't have done them any good; they would have been outflanked all the way to surrender.2. It assumes that a Revolutionary War-type strategy, wherein the defender almost always has space and time to manuever, and isn't concerned with defending big cities filled with military industry or large areas of cropland necessary to feed the army, would have worked with a South that was dependent on these industries and crops for survival and, because of Napoleonic innovations in the art of pursuing and overtaking an enemy army, would not have had as much space and time to manuever. It is worth noting that not one war has been one solely by means of attrition since the Revolution (not counting Vietnam, where attrition won only because the American armies were handicapped by political considerations).3. It makes the mistake of emphasizing war solely as mathematical equation rather than human endeavor. If success in war depended solely on bringing the numbers of the enemy's armies down to zero, no war would be won, since there has not been such a war of total destruction since ancient times. Victory, rather, is dependent on the psychological element---that is, what a nation thinks of it's chances for winning versus the situation. Regardless of Lee's \"unacceptable\" rate of casualties, he came very close to winning through the psychology of victory---that is, by driving the Northern peoples' morale down to the breaking point through battles lost. Nor would Southern armies standing permanently on the defense have satisfied their own people, particularly as large areas of land were lost to the enemy through manuvering (assuming #1 above).This is how wars are fought and won: with hearts and minds, not calculators; and through attack, not defense.",
                    "McWhiney and Jamieson offer their perspective on the South's stratagems during the Civil War with emphasis on two main points: the efficacy of the rifled musket and the lessons (oft times the &quot;wrong&quot; ones) learned during the Mexican War. The role of infantry, artillery and cavalry are outlined, with, as a nice touch, a summarizing/concluding paragraph at the end of each chapter. The final chapter, which logics the South's &quot;Celtic&quot; war-like traditions, I found a bit of a stretch.",
                    "The authors in this book point out that if the South had focused on defending itself instead of attacking Union troops during battles (not even counting the two failed invasions of the North by Lee) they might have had a chance. Yet the authors also show that the South had no choice - their generals took from West Point (and the Mexican War) all the wrong lessons - that tactical offensive would always win the day. Before rifled weapons, when the musket was the main weapon of the ground forces, men COULD get close enough to use the bayonet and use it well. I have seen studies that showed many battles during the Pre-Rifle period (American Revolution, War of 1812) was decided by the bayonet - those killed were mostly killed by the bayonet. Muskets were too ineffective.Rifles changed all that. It changed everything but American generals, mostly those of the South, refused to change their ways. But then why didn't the people say something to make them change their ways? The authors suggest that this also had to do with the culture of the South - that they were Celtic in their ways and thoughts. So the people approved of the tactics, even when it meant defeat!While that part of the book seems weak, most of it I can agree with. This book DOES list a ton of facts and I suggest it only for those who already know a lot about the American Civil War.",
                    "Attempts to explain why the South lost the Civil War have been a crowded cottage industry since the war ended. Northern industrial might, excessive Southern democracy, poor political leadership, faulty economic support, have all had their advocates and periods of popularity. Attack and Die is a fresh appraoch to the question. The analysis of McWhiney and Jamieson combines a shrewd analysis of southern culture, changes in military technology between 1846 and 1861, with an impressive array of statistics to explain the Southern defeat as springing from their dependence on outmoded tactics that worked in the Mexican War but did not work fifteen years later. The reason: the change in that fifteen years from the musket to the rifle as the basic infantry weapon. Studies like this demonstrate that there is still a vast amount of material to be collected, analysed, and theorized upon about our Civil War.",
                    "In Attack and Die the authors attempt to explain the reason for the southern preference for the attack over defense and inject into the discussion the relevance of Celtic heritage as part of the penchant for aggression. It appears the problem many reviewers have is describing the heritage as \"Celtic.\" It proves too much of a stretch in the attempt to find a cultural continuum all the way back to the era of Julius Caesar and his Gallic foes described in his commentaries.Instead of Celtic it may have been better to label the cultural influence as Scots-Irish. This is the culture described in detail by David Hackett Fischer in part four of his outstanding history Albion's Seed. Also, Jim Webb's Born Fighting is an excellent popular history on the Scots-Irish. These are the people who came to America from Ulster and low country Scotland and moved into the colonial frontier. The rank-and-file of the Confederate army was largely a product of this culture.Southern aggression may have had some cultural origins but it resulted from political expedience as well. The back-pedaling Joe Johnston would have been a favorite with Czar Alexander I, but with Jeff Davis as his boss he ranks low in the pantheon of southern generals. Oddly, for all their attempt to demonstrate southern aggressiveness, the authors conclude that \"no other Civil War general--not even Lee--was more aggressive than Grant.\"There is much in Attack and Die to entertain and inform, if you don't get too caught up in the whole Celtic debate.",
                    "The thrust of this book can be found in its portrayal of the brave men who clashed over hill and dale, river and stream, and hallowed ground with bayonets, rifles, and artillary pieces of all descriptions, all deadly to humans, especially those enfused with a Celtic Culture whose dictum was 'attack and die.' This war of 10,000 battles killed north of 600,000 soldiers and men, And in 'Attack and Die' you see just exactly who, where, how, and why.They'd line up, shoulder to shoulder and attack at the same pace while screaming remarkably like the Celts who attacked the Romans, oh those many years ago. Courage was at a premium and devil may care, the mood. The book cites attack after attack, under all different circumstances, with an over hang of an over riding sense of error, that is that the newer rifiles were accurate at much greater range than they had been in the Mexica war just 15 years before. Even at this the north's advantage in men and material could have been somewhat nullified had the southern leaders changed their tactics. But old habits die hard, and Lee, even without Jane Fonda on network television, could have fought a guerilla war resulting in two countries with fewer casualties.The confederates were brave men, with great spirit, a culture of honor, and what did they get? Lynard Skynnard tribute bands?After reading this you'll see this war in a different light.",
                    "This book was a requirement..I enjoyed it a lot in my Civil War Class..you will as well. Give it away whenyou are done because paperbacks are worthless used.",
                    "After concluding this work, the only description that comes to mind is the title of this review, otherwise known as, a complete waste of time. The authors totally ignore the military/political realities facing a numerically inferior side, choosing instead to concentrate on a flawed mathematical &quot;analysis&quot; that is not only laughable, but also totally at odds with the immutable principles of war.",
                    "I am a novice Civil War buff and this book is packed with high quality information. The book impressed me at several levels - a good introduction into historical research, a compendium of ordered facts on the tactics of the Civil War, a credible journal of how the Confederacy was defeated, robust due to its surprise ending.",
                    "This book examines the disastrous Southern military tactics which cost the Confederacy its independence. McWhiney argues that the reason the South stuck to these tactics for so long had to do with the Celtic ancestry and folkways of Southerners and of Southern culture. His thesis is a bit of a stretch, unless one has read his other book, Cracker Culture, which argues the Southern-Celtic connection more convincingly. Nevertheless, this is a fascinating and vital book",
                    "and it should be read in tandem with McWhiney's CRACKER CULTURE: Celtic Ways in the Old South, which expands upon this monograph's radical (to some) premises. But McWhiney and Jamieson elucidate what I've always suspected in a cogent and salient manner, and this book is a MUST for any Civil War buff of historian of American social history.Kevin McGowin"

                    "_Why the South Lost the Civil War_ was hailed as a classic at its first appearance in 1986, and it continues to remain a useful survey of the Civil War and an exploration of the reasons for the Confederacy's defeat. I have regularly assigned it to my undergraduate and graduate students at both the University of Central Arkansas (where I taught until 1999) and Temple University, and most have never failed to get a lot out of it (including those who are professional military officers).In many ways, the book is a reflection of America's experience in the Vietnam War, where the side with the larger armies, greater wealth, and technological advantages failed to win. To say that the Confederacy lost the Civil War simply because it was outnumbered and outgunned is only half the story. Why did Confederates choose to quit when their forebears in the American Revolution persevered against even more formidable odds? While some may question this book's insufficient nationalism thesis, it is delineated with such grace and authority that the effort demands respect.The book begins by providing a comprehensive overview of previously offered theories explaining the fall of the Confederacy. That historiographical survey alone makes this book worth the price of admission and makes it an invaluable tool for the serious Civil War student.As some of the other reviews here attest, this is not a book for those who prefer their Civil War history as vapid entertainment. If you are just interested in killing, there are plenty of good battle and campaign histories to read. But if you are the kind who wonders why nations rise and fall and how wars are won and lost, you will find this a rewarding and thought-provoking experience."

                    "This is an absolutely essential book for anyone with an interest in Civil War scholarship. The scope and breadth of this work is utterly astounding. Over 250 Civil War scholars have joined to create over 2700 pages on 1600+ entries in this massive book. As advertised, this book is a political, social and military history, as pretty much nothing is missed. Makes a phenomenal starting point for information and research on about any subject or person relating to the war that you can think of. Each entry also includes a list of recommended books and articles for further reading for each entry in the encyclopedia. Several appendicies to the book are made up by important documents realted to all aspects of the conflict, a civil war chronology of events and a state by state battlefield location map. This is a book you will constantly refer back to for information. And, at the seldom instance you are not using this book for study, you can use it in your workout program, as it is darn heavy for a book.",
                    "This sure is a complete reference for the American Civil War. My only complaint would be that I thought at least something would be in color, but it is all black and white, which gives it the feel of a book from my grandmother's attic. It's still a great book, I just was expecting it to look more current.",
                    "This humongous encyclopedia is easily the best reference I have ever seen on the Civil War. The thing is 2600 pages long, has 1600 entries, and weighs about 7 pounds, and is quite well written and edited. It covers military, political, and social events, and biographies equally. The articles are generally well written but short and introductory rather than exhaustive. Has lots of photos, illustrations and maps (the maps are OK but not spectacular), and a wonderful bibliogaphy section. I can't recommend this book enough. I learn something new every time I open it.",
                    "First of all, this thing is MASSIVE! When you're done reading it you can use it for weight in an exercise routine. However, it has over 2200 pages so it will be a long read. That having been said, I believe this will henceforth be THE standard reference guide to the Civil War. It is packed with great photos and maps, some I have never seen before. The capsule summaries are well written and informative. I have glanced through this book and now I am ready to dive in and read it cover to cover. Get this one if you are a Civil War or History buff!",
                    "This is a massive book. It will soon be &quot;THE REFERENCE&quot; to most all Civil War debates.If I were to pick just one book to go to, for a search of Civil War information, this one would have to be it.From Battle, Politics, Leaders, speechs, debates, economics, literature, etc., IT IS ALL IN HERE.This is one book that everyone would be proud to own. ( As well, as the kind that almost caves your chest in, laying in bed reading--It IS A BIG BOOK.)There is such a wealth of information, and every thing is solidily backed up with excellent references. It's a fantastic book.",
                    "Whenever I want to do very much research on the Civil War my principle resources begin with the books of Bruce Catton. Following extremely close on their heels is this one.I used to refer to \"Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History\" as an arm killer even before I got it. This came from finding it in a local bookstore several years back and sitting down with it. It's a big book, over 2,730 pages long. Get the picture? This isn't the type of book you get if you have only a passing interest in the war. If you have a passing interst in the war, this is the type of book you hope your local library has in it's reference room while if you're serious about studying the war it's the type you want in your personal library.And believe me, you'll be happy it's in your personal library because it literally is an encyclopedia on the war. As you might expect there is info in here on the major battles of the war as well as key military and political figures. Battles and individuals you've probably had to learn about since grade school. But this also goes into detail on lesser or unknown battles and individuals. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Subjects covered by this book includes music, newspapers, Union and Confederate railroads, Union and Confederate navies, Union and Confederate rations, female soldiers, the Trent Affair, the suspension of Hapeus Corpus, states themselves, the formation of the Congressional Medal of Honor, prisons, etc.Articles are divided by alphabetically, as should be expected in an encyclopedia. On top of this, the book is also divided into the encyclopedia section, a section on documents from the war and just before, five different appendices, a chronology of the war, and a glossary. All of which, naturally, adds to why theis will become one of your principle resourcesThe documents cover several hundred pages of the book. The section is divided in two, a listing of the documents featured which serves as a kind of table of contents that is divided by subject matter and then the documents themselves. Subjects are each divided into the principle subject and a sub-sets of subjects. For example, the very first principle subject is \"The Political Crisis\" and sub-sets of this subgect include \"The Harper's Ferry Raid,\" \"The Election of 1860,\" and \"Secession- The First Wave.\" Each sub-set within a subject includes at least one document. Some sub-sets may themselves be broken even further into sus-sub-sets. The \"Secession- The First Wave\" is such an sub-set, being broken into A-G sub-sub-sets which cover the secession documents of the first seven Confederate states to seceed before the shelling of Fort Sumter.The appendices are pretty straight forward. The first two are for the Confederacy, one on it's officers and one it's government. The next two are the same as the first but for the Union. And the fifth is a listing of Civil War battlefields and state maps helping to locate them. On the officers appendicies, these are basically just lists of generals with the highest rank they achieved during the war. The government appedicies include the presidents (Buchanan, Lincoln and Davis), Senators, Representatives, presidential cabinet members, and Cogresses and their sessions.Like the appendicies, the chronology and the glossary are also straightforward. The chronology offering dates and events that occured on those dates while the glossary offers definitions of terms one might not understand. An example from the chronology, maybe you want to see what might have occured on February 7, 1862. You look it up and find the book lists this as the start of the Battle of Roanoke Island, NC which you can then look up the main article on the battle in the encyclopedia. An example from the glossary, maybe you've heard the term panada in reference to the war but don't know what it is. The book's glossary specifically explains panada is a \"mush consisting of corn meal, crackers, and boiling water, often flavored with seasoning and wine.\"Is this book worth the price? Well, it may seem a bit steep. But in the end the book ends up paying for itself as it becomes, as has already been noted, a principle resource for studying the war.",
                    "As a writer and public relations practitioner where the Civil War is concerned, I've found Heider's Encyclopedia of the American Civil War to be a top-notch source of information about the War Between the States. Thorough, yet concise, there is information on all aspects of the conflict ranging from pre-war issues to its ultimate consequences. Although it's impossible to cover all skirmishes and engagements, it's amazing how many are included. The Documents section is impressive and all entries contain excellent cross-referencing. I recommend this encyclopedia to anyone interested in the conflict between the North and South.",
                    "My library of American Civil War books is still on the small side but constantly growing. One reason I do not feel compelled to add to it at an even faster pace is the fact that I am fortunate enough to own this comprehensive work. The Encyclopedia of the American Civil War is the finest book of its kind that I have ever seen on any subject at a price that most people can afford.I cannot imagine anyone with a substantial interest in the Civil War who would not thoroughly enjoy this book. It is amazingly broad in its coverage, and I often find it surprisingly deep as well. It never fails to fascinate regardless of whether I am looking for specific information or simply flipping through it randomly when I have a few idle minutes. For example, while looking for information on Charleston, SC, I stumbled upon a multi-page article on Charleston, IL, a small town 20 miles away from where I grew up. It turns out that this small community in rural America was not only home at one time to the Lincoln family, which I knew, but it was also the site of one of the bloodiest riots in the Civil War. I had no idea of the latter until I came across the article in this book.My only regret is that I have never found affordable encyclopedias covering World Wars I and II that are this comprehensive. The Oxford Companion to World War II is very good, and its size is more managebale, but it is not in the same league as the Encyclopedia of the American Civil War. I cannot recommend this highly enough for Civil War \"fans\".",
                    "There is so much information in this book it is ridiculous. I have found new sources just by flipping through this book. Every entry is detailed. Many different facets of the war are covered such as political, military, and socioeconomic issues. This is a true all encompassing source to the American Civil War! It is well worth the money.",
                    "Over the last 20 years, I have spent thousands of dollars on Civil War reference materials covering anything from individual biographies, to in-depth analysis of battles, to the roles of Chaplains and Civil War medicine. There are a lot of good references out there, many of which are in my personal collection. Yet the one I keep using the most often is this one. It is far superior to anything else that is out there. If you are a serious scholar of the American Civil War, this is right up your alley. It's thick. It's heavy (make sure you have a reinforced bookshelf to put this on) and not a page is wasted.Whether you buy it used, or pay for a collectible version of it, you will find it money well spend. I don't know how I got by this long without it.",
                    "As you have probably guessed, this book is HUGE. But don't let the size and price scare you. This is a MUST have for anyone who has an interest in the American Civil War. The sheer number of references and the breadth of the topics which cover every single angle of the Civil War, make this book THE reference manual to own.",
                    "Superb in all respects.The definitive reference book on the American Civil War.An absolute must for any serious Civil War buff.Absolutely outstanding."

                    "This very readable volume is an introduction and guide to the battles and issues of the Civil War. It was the greatest emotional experience and has an unceasing attraction for Americans (`Preface'). The Civil War brought important changes to society, its economics (growth of corporations), and the role of government. It was the first conflict of the technological age (p.7). A peaceful solution was impossible (p.8). The war was decided in the West while there was a stalemate in Northern Virginia. Naval operations are often overlooked. The story of the Civil War often overlooks the economic and political facts. [The `Index' does not list the Income Tax Act of 1861 or the Legal Tender Act of 1862.] The real power of the North was in its agriculture and manufacturing, miles of railroads, and industrial power. The `List of Maps' is on pages 13 and 14.The `Contents' list the thirty chapters. They are written for the general reader. [R. Ernest Dupuy was a reporter, ship news editor, and feature editor before 1917.] Chapter 1 tells of the attack on Fort Sumter. General Winfield Scott recommended an immediate blockade of Southern ports and raising a tremendous army to invade down the Mississippi (p.35). Politicians wanted a quick and cheap victory. General George McClellan reorganized the new and enlarged army (Chapter 4). Could the South have won after the first Bull Run (p.49)? Chapter 5 tells of the maneuvering to gain control of Missouri and Kentucky, border states with divided loyalties. Chapter 6 tells of the little-known invasion of New Mexico by Confederate General Henry Sibley. His defeat kept New Mexico in the Union. New Orleans was captured in April 1862. The Confederates invaded the North but were stopped at Antietam (Chapter 12). McClellan failed to win (p.165). Chapter 17 describes the battle of Gettysburg, Lee withdrew. Grant captured Vicksburg (Chapter 18). The naval blockade reduced supplies to the South (Chapter 20). Battles continued in northern Virginia (Chapter 22). The Confederate Navy destroyed or captured hundreds of US ships (Chapter 24). The `Kearsarge' sank the `Alabama' near Cherbourg France (p.323). Sherman invaded Georgia and captured Atlanta (Chapter 25). Jubal Early invaded Maryland and came close to Washington (Chapter 26). This led to the Shenandoah Valley campaign. Sherman captured Savannah (Chapter 27). Wilmington NC was captured (Chapter 28). Columbia and Charleston SC were occupied (Chapter 29). Petersburg VA was attacked, Richmond was evacuated. Lee was trapped and surrendered (Chapter 30).The `Appendix' tells of the Arms and Uniforms. The Union recognized 79 different models of rifles and muskets, 23 types of carbines and musketoons, and 19 models of pistols and revolvers. The Confederate inventory was similar. Northern artillery was mostly smooth-bore bronze Napoleons and cast-iron rifled Parrott guns. The Confederates used older and captured cannon. The Northern Navy used older smooth-bore cannon and the newer Dahlgren rifled guns. [The authors both served in the Field Artillery.] While the Union uniform was blue and the Confederates wore grey, the beginning saw a variety of uniforms (p.424). Each militia group could select their uniform at the beginning. [The `fog of war' may have showed the need for consistency and differences.] There is a `Selected Bibliography'. The `Envoi' says those familiar with civil strife in European history expected continued resistance by guerilla bands (p.418). The magnanimous and liberal surrender terms may have prevented this, as well as a lack of popular support. It was time for peace (p.419).",

                    "This two-volume set is one of the two major works (the other is by Jefferson Davis) that asserts that &quot;slavery had nothing whatever to do with the Civil War.&quot; This thesis was developed only AFTER the end of the Civil War; it is also anti-historical.Before and at the beginning of the war, Davis and Stephens were of the opinion that slavery, indeed, was the underlying cause of the conflict.Slavery, clearly, was an embarassment after the Civil War -- after all, before the Civil War, the US was the only Western country that had slavery. It is in this context that this fictional work was written.The idea that the civil war was a &quot;constitutional crisis&quot; that had &quot;nothing whatever to do with slavery&quot; is nonsense. The legal question of whether states could secede from the Union was settled by the US Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison, early in the century; the answer was NO: the Union, once created, was perpetual. Give that decision a thorough read; the constitutional question was settled.Strange -- both Davis and Stephens AT THE OPENING OF THE CIVIL WAR found slavery to be the root cause of the conflict (read their speeches). Specifically, the pro-slavery South was fearful of what the newly-elected Lincoln and Republicans in Congress were planning to do, even though the 1860 Republican platform stated that the Party had no intention of abolishing slavery. Even so, the pro-slavery South was motivated by fear; and the timing of the beginning of secession (led in December, 1860, by South Carolina, shortly after the coming formal election of Lincoln by the Electoral College was considered assured) illustrates this.So . . . read the speeches of Davis and Stephens (who was an out-and-out racist, and a vigorous one!) as the War began, not the fiction they wrote later. Also: (1) read the statements of secession made by the seceding states: their blaming slavery as the root cause of secession is clear, and (2) read the 1861 Confederate Constitution (e.g., Art. I, Sec. 9, Subsec. 4 -- the Confederate Congress was barred from impairing the right to own slaves) to see that the seceding south was VERY serious about preserving slavery. (The Confederate Constitution is on the internet, much to the consternation of present-day &quot;Confederate impersonators&quot;; read it!)For an excellent, objective book on the entire subject of the shifting historiography of Civil War history, read &quot;Americans Interpret Their Civil War&quot;."

All was preserved in letters (May 7, 1861 to June 18, 1864) from Pvt. John R. McClure, 14th Regiment of the Indiana Volunteers. It was amazing that, although wounded, John survived three years of the war's fighting.Nancy Niblack Baxter, who edited the letters and did the introduction, also includes a paragraph of information preceding many letters placing Pvt. McClure's exact location, plus preceding military and political events. Many of McClure's misspelling and language is retained, adding to the delight of the reader. Baxter is a well-known Hoosier author, having written several other books, many relating to Indiana, including the four book series of \"The Heartland Chronicles.\"Although the letters document the activity of one Indiana regiment, primarily, this book is a delightful inside look at the reality of pride, feelings, grief, and hardship of any Civil War Union soldier. It was \"privately printed for the family\" so it's one to grab when available. Happy reading to historians."

                    "Students of history would do well to begin their studies of the U.S. Civil War by reading this seminal historical text by renowned historian James Garfield Randall (1881-1953), University of Illinois professor and Lincoln biographer. Released in 1937, \"The Civil War and Reconstruction\" was revised by Randall's student David Herbert Donald in 1961. This is the book we are dealing with, not the further revised volume outlined in the product description.What distinguishes this work is Randall's keen sense of historical accuracy: Although he had his own predilictions (Abraham Lincoln was his childhood hero and lifelong subject of his scholarship), he separated his early personal views from his assessment of the historical record. Anyone who has ever read books on the Civil War written before Randall's will find enough jingoism, hyperbole and finger pointing to suffice them a lifetime. What Randall aspired to, however, was a more objective and scientific analysis of history. In that, I believe, he has succeeded.Written in an era before political correctness, this book deals with the issue of slavery honestly and forthrightly. Randall looks into the economics of slavery from Colonial times up to the Civil War, and gives a dispassionate sketch of its origins and practices. For example, consider these simple facts: That unlike the pale white indentured servants from the British Isles, who were generally physically ill equiped for working the soil in the hot and humid Southern states, African slaves were much better acclimated to the South's punishing climate, and, in fact, received better treatment than their European counterparts. The reason for this was purely economic, not altruistic: Slaves were owned, and represented a financial investment, whereas indentured servants more or less were leased and were driven hard so that plantation owners could extract every penny of value from them while they could. Yet, when I voiced these facts in a graduate school lecture hall in New York City in the early 1990s, many students glowered at me, and the professor looked like a scared rabbit, and changed the subject immediately.What makes Randall's study of the Civil War most appealing is that although he began his career seeing the Union through rose-colored glasses (given his admiration for Lincoln) one sees that after studying the matter thoroughly, his sympathies often lie with the South, and that he regards Lincoln as a sort of tragic figure, who was torn between holding the Union together and keeping more radical elements of the Republican Congress at bay. This is significant, because it is seldom that scholars admit they are wrong.His thesis, that the Civil War was indeed not inevitable, ought to be carefully studied by purveyors of the two prevailing -- and ignorant -- explanations of the Civil War and Lincoln's place in it. To those Southerners who declare that the Civil War was not about slavery, Randall provides copious evidence to debunk that myth. Yes, while it is true the war was not *exclusively* about slavery, Randall shows that slavery was indeed the crucible through which radicals of both sides eventually wound up taking arms against each other. He holds radical abolitionists such as John Brown and cynical Yankees as Stephen Douglas (more concerned with building a transcontinental railroad through the industrial north, partly at the expense of Southern taxation) in equal disdain. A simple study of the breakoff of the West Virginians from Virginia illustrates the concept of two economically separated nations.Another naive, yet dangerous, view that Randall dispells is the gripe often voiced by leftists that Lincoln was no hero for ending slavery, because his primary objective was holding the Union together, even if it meant keeping slavery intact. That view drops context just as readily as does the aforementioned Southern view. According to Randall, Lincoln was a voice of moderation in the Republican party, not a rabid abolitionist. Lincoln knew that slavery could never be ended immediately without war, and indeed tried to prevent it. Randall's telling of the election of 1860 showed that while Lincoln's more moderate platform of compromise and consensus made it possible to have a mandate in the North, deep divisions within the Democrat party further exacerbated Southern suspicions that the Northerners had it in for them. The nomination of Illini Douglas caused the South to field their own candidate, John Breckenridge. John C. Bell, a pro-South candidate who wished to see the Union preserved, tried -- like Lincoln -- to appeal to calmer emotions, but made little impact. The election ended with a nation deeply divided, and though Lincoln was considered a moderate in his native North, Southerners -- who wound up with the short end of the stick from the Missouri Compromise and the Kansas-Nebraska Act -- viewed Lincoln as the veritable embodiment of abolition.Thus, according to the politically correct, Lincoln was no puritan on this issue, and therefore of suspect motivation. In fact, though, he did represent the best practical hope of ending slavery, through attrition, rather than the hotheaded clash of swords.Likewise does Randall paint a rational picture of Reconstruction, more informed by economics and sociology than partisan fury. I commend this volume to anyone who wants to read a well-researched and reasoned account of the Civil War. I find, on balance, Randall's attempts at objectivity to be quite fruitful. For those who 139 years later are still re-fighting the war with vitriolic fervor, they will find little in this tome to stir up spiteful emotions, pro or con. Such types will nevertheless regard Randall either as a Yankee apologist for Abe Lincoln or a pro-Southern closeted racist.Although thoughtfully appended with excellent photographs, maps and illustrations, I additionally recommend Bruce Catton's \"American Heritage Picture History of the Civil War\" as a fun and informative companion general history of the American Civil War and Reconstruction.",
                    "I essentially agree with the two previous reviews. The book is largely devoid of the kind of nonsense and PC that one finds in so many other books on the Civil War. The chapter on the illegal, fraud-ridden creation of the state of West Virginia is excellent.I would make one comment about a statement made in one of the reviews, namely, that Randall showed that the Civil War was fought over slavery. Randall proved no such thing because it's utterly false to say the war was fought over slavery. If the war was fought over slavery, then why didn't Lincoln or other Republicans ever offer to stop the war if the South ended slavery? Why was Lincoln's one and only condition for ending the war the repudiation of Southern independence?If you want to know what a war is being fought over, look at the conditions that each side names for ending the war. Not once did any Northhern leader say the North would halt its invasion of the South if the South would end slavery. And the South's only demand to end the war was for the North to halt its invasion and withdraw its armies. The South's position was simple: \"Leave us alone and stop trying to force us to rejoin the Union, and naturally the war will be over.\" The war was fought over Southern independence, not slavery.By late 1864 the South was moving toward ending slavery, yet there was no offer from the North to suspend or end the Northern invasion if the South followed through with an emancipation plan. The few abolitionists who suggested making such an offer were shouted down by their fellow abolitionists. Neither Lincoln nor any other prominent Republican gave the slightest indication that the North would let the South leave in peace if the South abolished slavery. Slavery wasn't the sticking point--Southern independence was.",
                    "The authors exhibited a point of view that, for me, made the entire book suspect. For example, the authors condemned former historians, who had claimed that black administration in the southern states was largely corrupt and often incompetent, were wrong, and the authors made this charge without providing proper evidence. The style of the narrative seems a bit cynical because primarily self-serving motives are attributed to the Democrat and Republican parties when planning strategy. For example, Republican motivation to further black suffrage is portrayed primarily as a need to gain northern voter approval and to increase the pool of potential Republican voters in the south.As for style, I found the book a little hard to read. Some sentences had to be read 2 or 3 times to get the meaning. I prefer books where the author took pains to make it easy for the reader. Here is an example that is characteristic of the style:\"The next day, polling the Cabinet again, the president found a striking change in Cabinet opinion: only Smith and Seward were in favor of giving up the South Carolina fort, and the secretary of state forfeited much of Lincoln's confidence by making a bizarre proposal on April 1 to \"Change the question before the Public from one upon Slavery, or about Slavery, for a question upon Union or Disunion\" through making impossible demands upon Spain, France, Great Britain, and Russia.\"I did learn a lot from the book.",

                    "Students of history would do well to begin their studies of the U.S. Civil War by reading this seminal historical text by renowned historian James Garfield Randall (1881-1953), University of Illinois professor and Lincoln biographer. Released in 1937, \"The Civil War and Reconstruction\" was revised by Randall's student David Herbert Donald in 1961. This is the book we are dealing with, not the further revised volume outlined in the product description.What distinguishes this work is Randall's keen sense of historical accuracy: Although he had his own predilictions (Abraham Lincoln was his childhood hero and lifelong subject of his scholarship), he separated his early personal views from his assessment of the historical record.

                    "The premiere work from the War Between the States' best author. I've read nearly all of Bruce Catton's Civil War work and this one is the best--buy it and read it again and again.",
                    "If you are one who has never read a book about the Civil War, or studied it since you were in high school, you could do much worse than to start with Bruce Catton's \"This Hallowed Ground.\" Mr. Catton, who passed away in 1978, has long been hailed as one of the best, if not the very best, Civil War writer ever to create a manuscript. Recently, when I mentioned to a friend during a conversation about the kind of books we prefer, that I read a lot about the American Civil War, she sort of made a sour face and began praising the virtues of Romance novels. Now, there are history books, even books about the Civil War that warrant a sour face, but the books written by Bruce Catton are not among them. His narrative, his prose, his whole writing style is sometimes enough to bring tears to the eyes or take the breath away. Here, I quote a paragraph from a chapter titled \"Where They Were Bound to Go,\" in the book that is the subject of this review.\"The wind was being sown, and the hurricane would come later; and yet, all in all, these things were not so much causes as warnings - the lightning flashes that set evil scarlet flares against the black clouds that were banked up along the horizon. Somewhere beyond the lightning there was thunder, and the making of a great wind that would change the face of a nation, destroying much that men did not want destroyed. A doom was taking shape, and it seemed to be coming on relentlessly, as if there was nothing that anyone could do to prevent it. The republic that had been born in an air so full of promise that it might have been the morning of the seventh day was getting ready to tear itself apart.\"In this manner Mr. Catton sets the scene for the war that took the lives of 620,000 Americans, tore families apart, and put some teeth in the statement that \"All men are created equal.\" As has been noted in other reviews here, Catton was top-heavy on the side of the North, and why not? He was a Michigan boy, and no one would expect a Michigan boy to lionize the South any more than they would expect a fellow from Georgia to shun Stonewall Jackson and glorify Tecumseh Sherman! Yet there is, wrapped up in all of the words in this book that seem to revere the Union cause, in the dramatic and often dynamic prose of a great writer, a recognizable thread of fairness, and deep admiration for the courage and valor of the Southern soldier.This Hallowed Ground is an excellent place to start any study of the Civil War, or even to engage in some casual reading. Bruce Catton begins before the beginning, and carries it through to the end, leaving out much of the battle strategy and tactics, and appealing to the heart of every American who, as he says on page 25 of the paperback edition: \"......what they saw, briefly but clearly, after so many years in which nothing was clear - was the fact that they did have a country and that their common possession of it was the most precious thing in the world.\" It may be that what Americans saw so clearly all those years ago, is the only way to understand the \"why\" of the war that changed the soul of this great nation. At least, I think that may be so.",
                    "I only wish that I could write 1/4 as well.",
                    "I first read this book almost 40 years ago. With some nervousness, I picked up a copy to read, wondering how well it has held up with the years. Bruce Catton wrote a number of works during his time--from his examination of the Army of the Potomac to his final two volumes of a 3-work biography of U. S. Grant. A number of things stand out about Catton's work. For one, he is an excellent writer. His books move along smoothly and even eloquently. One is captivated by his style. Two, he can, in a few paragraphs, tell us a great deal about the people of the Civil War. Want to get a sense of the crusty veteran general, Charles F. Smith? In a few broad strokes, you get a sense of the man. Three, he provides broader context on the war and its battles, for example, illustrating at one point the difference between the industrial might of the North and the much less advanced industry of the South. A telling commentary on the raw differences between the two sides.This book, then, has something in common with McPherson's splendid \"Battle Cry of Freedom.\" As McPherson, Catton provides a context in which to examine the Civil War. However, even though his description of battles and campaigns tends to be terse, one nonetheless gets a sense of what was at stake and how the battles unfolded. Even with only a few paragraphs on the battle at Wilson's Creek, for instance, one gets a sense of the strange saga of the pugnacious General Lyon's outnumbered army trying to envelope the superior southern forces (the text does not mention that making the odds even longer, Lyon depended on Franz Sigel to carry out the envelopment--a most unfortunate choice).Just so, the discussion of both Gettysburg and Vicksburg is brief but in enough detail to get a sense of the challenges facing both armies at these struggles.Catton unequivocally identifies slavery as a key issue as a part of the cause of the war; he also points out, here and there, how the Union army came slowly to see the evil of slavery, even as they harbored prejudice against slaves.If the reader wants detailed analyses of battles, this book would not serve well. If the reader is interested in a well written historical work that looks at the Civil War and its context, then this book should do nicely. Over a half century since its original publication, this book holds up pretty well--and it is written superbly.",
                    "If you're interested in the Civil War enough to browse this book, go ahead and snag it. To get a grasp on this period of our history, you must read Catton. He tells the overall story in the style almost of a novel. He is accurate and factual. Never fear. But this isn't reading history as you might remember. Catton will get your attention, draw you in and help you to feel some of the myriad of emotions that coursed through our ancestors on both sides of this conflict. He made me understand that wherever they trod was indeed hallowed ground after their passing.",
                    "This is a book about war, rebellion and freedom. And Bruce Catton weaves these three ideas with great precision in telling this story about our American Civil War. War is about battle and Catton leaves no stone unturned, describing the battles fought and the participants involved with clarity and precision. No significant action in the Eastern or Western theaters of operation is omitted and the reader is left with an understanding of the shifting, near thing with which many of the engagements are fought. From Bull Run in 1861 to the final contest at Five Forks in 1865, Catton works his audience through the campaigns in singular detail.With regard to rebellion, Catton is not one to mince words and defines it in one word: Treason. He points out that the South's most significant error was their complete failure to understand early on, the North's total dedication to Union. \"The South could only win its independence by destroying the government of the United States. As such Southerners were not merely enemies; they were traitors, to be treated as such.\" It would be a long and vicious war whose terms and methods of waging it would be defined by Abraham Lincoln.But it is with regard to freedom that Catton is at the top of his form. He regards the Emancipation Proclamation as the most significant weapon fired during those four long years of war. Declaring slavery extinct in exactly all the areas in which the Federal Government could not enforce the decree, the Emancipation was truly an unusual document. But Lincoln knew its ultimate impact. Emancipation isolated the South. In Catton's words, \"It closed a great door in the face of the southern Confederacy. It locked the Confederacy with the anachronism that was the Confederacy's dreadful, fatal burden.\" Europe could not support slavery. The South was alone with limited manpower, no manufacturing capacity to produce the instruments and material with which to wage war and no friends. The millstone of slavery, that for which it had been fighting, would drag it under.Catton delivers a thoughtful, stirring analysis of the American Civil War. Written in 1956, This Hallowed Ground is totally devoid of rancor, finger pointing, or the revisionism so prevalent in many of the works of its era. Bruce Catton is probably the most prolific writer on this subject; given his superb writing he is also probably the best.",
                    "\"This Hallowed Ground\" is famed Civil War historian Bruce Catton's one volume history of that conflict. It captures the great themes of his three volume centennial history in a concise yet complete reading experience.Bruce Catton wrote \"This Hallowed Ground\" in the mid-1950's, prior to the centennial of the Civil War. His scholarship is therefore dated with respect to details revealed by later research, and certainly more recent historians have contributed new and fascinating interpretations of events and participants. However, none save Shelby Foote have approached Catton's literary gifts as a narrative historian of the first order. \"This Hallowed Ground\" reads as tragic human drama on an almost mythic scale. Catton's gift is to provide a coherent narrative of the conflict while locating the stories of very human actors within the larger tragedy. The result brings a long and complicated war into focus for the average reader.Catton came to the study of the Civil War from a career as a journalist, and as one who had known Civil War veterans during his youth in Michigan. Catton had the good journalist's ability to capture a sense of the person, the place, and the event. \"This Hallowed Ground\" is told as a series of rather vivid vignettes, each capturing a key moment in the war. The reader comes to understand how the force of events quickly overran the intentions of both sides at the start of the conflict. Key persons, themselves often driven by political considerations of the moment, changed the direction of events, sometimes inadvertantly. The major personalities, Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, Grant, and Lee march across the stage, but a host of lesser characters have their moments as the war winds down to its awful and perhaps unavoidable conclusion.This book is highly recommended to the reader looking for a highly readable one volume history of the Civil War, and to students of the conflict looking for an account that transcends dry scholarship.",
                    "Bruce Catton is one of the best history writers of the Civil War. He writes in a fashion that is easy to read yet leaves no doubt what he is saying. Very good way to enjoy history. It is almost like reading a novel.",
                    "(For a complete, formatted review, please visit [...]There are not enough superlatives to do justice to this book. I read it as a teenager and bought it in a Washington bookstore for my son but ended up reading it again myself. As many reviewers have noted, if you read only one book about the Civil War, read this. Bruce Catton has a lyrical poetic style that weaves colorful anecdotes with sweeping prose that makes about as much sense as anyone can of the horror of America's bloodiest war by far.First published in 1955, before the civil rights movement entered into the consciousness of most educated Americans, This Hallowed Ground was remarkably prescient, referring repeatedly to the painful issue not just of slavery but of race and of the inevitable reckoning that would have to come if the \"peculiar institution\" were abolished once and for all. Eight years before Martin Luther King was to deliver his \"I Have a Dream Speech,\" Catton could see that almost a century after the Civil War, the United States remained a work in progress.Catton avoids the pitfalls that trap many historians, such as a compulsion for detail that misses the forest for the trees, or a contemporary interpretation whose bias makes later readers wince. When Catton drills down to a battlefield, he gives just enough detail to create a vivid word picture but is adept at zooming out and showing us how the battlefield fits in the campaign, and the campaign in the war, and the war in the history of America. Long before Ken Burns' PBS Civil War series had been conceived (Burns was only 2 when the book was published), Catton peppered his narrative with extracts from letters and diaries of the ordinary men who had a front row seat to this extraordinary history.Perhaps because of all the shouting going on in American politics today about what it means to be an American and the proper scope and power of the federal government, there was something eerily contemporary about the book's opening. Following arrests made in Baltimore, \"when Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney issued a writ of habeas corpus to set one of these free, President Lincoln blandly ignored it... The Supreme Court had indeed been flouted, the Constitution had been stretched, perhaps even broken (depending on one's point of view), scores of people were being held in prison without due process of law... No matter. Maryland was not going to go out of the Union.\" And I could not help think of today's political attack ads when reading that \"men who were whipping themselves up to the point where they would refuse to try to get along with one another were, at the same point in time, doing precisely the things that would bind them together forever whether they liked it or not. \" But for all the harsh words, today's acrimony has not spilled over into violence, as it did on the senate floor in the opening scene of the book with the 1856 caning of Senator Charles Sumner. But the compulsion of demonizing one's adversaries remains: \"All of the things that were slipping beyond hope of easy solution - ... varying interpretations of the American dream - all of these somehow might hinge on what was done about Kansas, so that the wrong phrase in an enacting clause could mean earth's best hope lost forever.\"If Catton's work had been fiction, it would have been rejected for lack of plausibility. Given the carnage of the war that was to come, why would volunteers be so eager to fight that \"soldiers sent home in Indiana threatened to shoot their colonel\"?How could it possibly be that the house chosen to host the surrender that would end this terrible war would be that of Wilmer McLean, a Virginian who found his Bull Run home too caught up in the war's opening battle, so moved to Appomattox? Who knew that Grant not only owned a slave at one point but didn't care all that much about slavery one way or the other until about 1861? Or that the two generals most instrumental to ending the war were both from Ohio and overlapped at West Point (Grant was a senior when Sherman was a plebe)? Or that on the very morning that Sherman was to accept the surrender of General Johnston he received a telegram telling him of Lincoln's murder? And the contrast between General Lee - \"tall, gray, one of the handsomest and most imposing man who ever lived, dressed today in his best uniform, his sword belted at his waist\" and the man who received his surrender \"US Grant, rather scrubby and undersized, wearing his work in close, with mud spattered boots and trousers and a private's rumpled coat with his lieutenant general stars tacked to the shoulders\" at a surrender ceremony where Grant had to borrow ink from the Lee and Lee had to borrow paper reflected staging too perfect for a good fiction editor.His writing pulls you in and keeps you riveted such as with this description of Antietam:There never was another day like Antietam. It was sheer concentrated violence... it had all of the insane fury of Shiloh with this difference: at Shiloh the troops were green ... at Antietam the men were veterans and they knew what they were about... so that the dawn to dusk fight above Antietam creek went into the records as the most murderous single day of the entire war.Sherman's march to the sea is described in a way that rivals the far more biased and regional fiction of Margaret Mitchell: \"Smoke filled the sky like a gigantic ominous signal as Sherman's army pulled clear of the city [of Atlanta] and started for the sea... And so began the strangest, most fateful campaign of the entire war, like nothing that happened before or afterward. These federals were not moving out to find and destroy an armed enemy; the only foe that could give them a fight, Hood's army, was hundreds of miles off to the rear, and everybody knew it. They were not being asked to hurry; 15 miles a day was much less than these long legged marchers could easily make, and everybody knew that too. Their mission was to wreck an economy and to destroy a faith - the economy that supported the thin fading fabric of the Confederacy, the faith that believed the Confederacy to be an enduring creation and trusted in its power to protect and avenge.\" The men were \"conscious agents of this destruction; men who trampled out the terrible vintage of the grapes of wrath, led by an implacable general who was more and more coming to see a monstrous but logical destiny in his mission... For Sherman was not fighting and opposing army now; he was fighting an idea, knocking down the last shredded notion that the Southern Confederacy could exist as an independent nation, moving steadily and relentlessly not toward a climactic engagement but simply toward the end of the war.\"The final days and aftermath of the Civil War are such well-trodden ground that it is surprising that no author before or since has really topped Catton's riveting description of the end:Until this Palm Sunday of 1865 the word Appomattox had no meaning. It was a harsh name left over from Indian days, it belonged to a river and to a country town, and it had no overtones. But after this day, it would be one of the haunted possessions of the American people, a great and unique word that would echo in the national memory with infinite tragedy and infinite promise, recalling a moment in which sunset and sunrise came together in a street glow that was half twilight and half dawn.Like a brilliant movie director, Catton pans his camera over the horrific cost and inevitable consequences of the Civil War in ways that make historical abstractions come alive:Here and there all over the country where the mounded graves of half a million young men who had been alive and unsuspecting when all of this began. There would be more graves to dig, and when there was time there would be thin bugle calls to lie in the still air on a handful of dust drifted down on a blanketed form, but most of this was over. A little more killing, a little more marching and burning and breaking and smashing, and then it would be ended.Ended; yet, in a haunting way, forever unended. It had laid an infinity of loss and grief on the land; it had created a shadowed purple twilight streaked with undying fire which would live on deep in the mind and heart of the nation, as long as any memory of the past retained meaning. Whatever the American people might hereafter do when one way or another take form in color from this experience.If Catton can be faulted, it is for a certain tendency to repeat but his prose is so lyrical, almost hypnotic, that he can be forgiven. He also shares the compulsion of all historians to assign meaning to events, even if some things, perhaps most things, just happen. Historians probably would not be historians if they did not discount the role of randomness, meaningless, and blind chance. But I find myself so mesmerized by Catton's authoritative writing - at times he seems to have known the protagonists personally - that I find myself wanting to believe his sweeping, all-explanatory narrative.",
                    "When I was a freshman in college, way back in 1986 I happened upon a Bruce Catton (1899-1978) book in the bookstore while buying all of my textbooks for my first semester. I picked it up just because I was in a mood to be educated with something that looked more interesting and less daunting than my economics and math textbooks. My fascination with all things Civil War began with that book (I sold it in a fit of stupidity a couple of years later). I read his trilogy, re-printed articles in American Heritage and then I moved on to other talented authors, such as James McPherson.Rather stupidly, I forgot how truly gifted Catton was as a writer and I just assumed that because Catton was the historian of my childhood, he was an inferior writer. Why? I don't know. I picked up this This Hallowed Ground: The Story of the Union Side of the Civil War to read on a family vacation and I was reminded, once again, that this man could truly write and he belongs right there in the pantheon of truly gifted storytellers who can tell the story of America in an entertaining, factual and compelling way (for those that scoff at narrative history in favor of \"serious history\" I say that the purpose of a historian is to tell his society their own story and make it seem that it matters. Bruce Catton did just that.)Catton begins with a single week in May of 1856. We have the beating of abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner by a pro-slavery Congressman in the Senate Chamber, the sacking of Lawrence, Kansas by pro-slavery forces and John Brown's brutal attack at Pottawatomie Creek. All within a few days of each other - all portents of things to come. One thing seemed to unhinge everyone in America - slavery and the disagreement over a state's right to declare a man to be another man's property.Catton does tell the story almost completely from the Union perspective and it is clear that he is sympathetic to the Union cause in this book. He is not the only author of Civil War histories to have favorites, but he is clearly not disrespectful of the Confederate soldiers or of their efforts. He is also leery of some of the liberties Lincoln took in his effort to maintain the Union, as is clear in the section on Clement Vallandigham.Mostly, though, Catton's strength is just his storytelling. It moves along crisply with a penchant for telling the odd, humorous and tragic little stories that make up the overall big story. Along the way, Catton produces some profound little gems, like this paragraph about 1864 the slow, bloody demise of slavery and what that meant for the country that concluded a chapter:\"It would be that sort of year: year of Jubilo, year of overturn and disaster and ruin, year infinite bloodshed and suffering, with the foundations of the great deep broken up; hard tramp of marching military feet, endless shuffle of splay-footed refugees running from something they understood little better than they could understand what they were running toward; the significance of their march being that it led toward the unknown and that all America, like it or not, was going to follow.\"To sum up, this is a lovely little history - beautifully written, skillfully told by a master storyteller. It is not the only history that someone should read of the Civil War, but it is a great place to start. Also, I am thrilled that I went back and re-discovered Bruce Catton and found that he is not only as good as I remembered - he is better.Highly recommended.",
                    "I have an extensive Civil War library, and this is simply the best of the best book therein. It is a one volume offering from the Union point of view, although it clearly defines both sides. Catton's style is simply amazing. Although history at its best, this reads like classic literature. The concluding scenes described by Catton practically bring tears to your eyes.Be aware that this book is out of print. This is why I bought several more copies at Amazon.",
                    "Catton has masterfully crafted a well researched very readable book. It explores much more than troop placements by putting a very human face on the greatest of American tragedies.",
                    "I was half way through the first volume of Foote's epic 3 volume \"The Civil War: a narrative\" when I paused for a breather and read Catton's Hallowed Ground.So, compared to Foote's 3 volume The Civil War, Catton's Hallowed Ground provides a good overview of all the major battles in the Civil War. He had also included quotes from letters soldiers had written to family which I thought was a nice touch as it provided a different view of the civil war and illustrated how tough things were for them. What I also liked about Catton is that he had referenced the quotes and pointed to other books if you were interested in that particular regiment or battle.For someone new to the civil war, I would definitely recommend reading Catton's Hallowed Ground first then refer to Foote for more detailed description of the more interesting battles. However, as another reviewer here points out, there is a hint of bias in favour of the confederacy in Foote.",
                    "The Civil War was a vastly complex conflict, and there are thousands of specialized texts to be had. This book captures the heart of the tale, and you come away with both the history and the powerful national and human drama. I read this book with a sense that I was there, watching the battles unfold, listening in as the decisions were made that sent men to their triumphs or to their deaths. It is highly readable, but I did not want to rush through it; I periodically put it aside to let my spirit settle.If your knowledge of the Civil War is limited and you think maybe you ought to know more or you'd like to know more, but you don't want to crack open a dry textbook -- then this is the book for you!",
                    "The Civil War remains the pivotal and most discussed event in our Nation's history. Every generation of writers and readers feels the need to tell the story of the War anew and to reflect upon its meaning. In the mid-20th Century, the leading interpreter of the Civil War was Bruce Catton (1899-1978). Catton wrote narratives for the nonspecialist reader. He had the ability to make the Civil War era, the battles, and the issues come alive to a broad public. There is still much to be learned from his writing style and from his discussion of the War.Catton's &quot;This Hallowed Ground: the Story of the Union Side of the Civil War&quot; (1956) remains an essential one-volume study of the conflict. Only James McPherson's work, &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; comes close to matching its scope. While McPherson's work may show a greater degree of scholarship, Catton's work more than compensates in its eloquence and passion.The book begins with the famous caning that Congressman Preston Brooks of South Carolina gave to Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts in 1856 following a Sumner speech against slavery before the Senate. It examines the causes of the War, the battles and politics of the conflict, and concludes with the end of the long conflict in April 1865. (It gives only a brief glance to Reconstruction.)Catton tells the stories of the War's military engagements simply and understandably. I have read detailed accounts of many Civil War battles and tend to become confused. Catton's accounts of the battled are short and, of course, simplified; but they cut to the heart of the matter. I would recommend that anyone interested in studying a battle in depth read Catton's account first, both for an overview of the War and for a basic account of the battle and its place in the scheme of the War.Catton unequivocally states that slavery was the prime cause of the War. I think most contemporary historians agree with him. But many recent writers try to persuade their readers that they are discovering the importance of slavery to the conflict for themselves -- almost for the first time since 1865. It is helpful for an understanding of the history of history to see Catton's recognition (in a popular work written more than a generation ago) of slavery as the driving factor of the War. Catton also writes eloquently about industrialization in North America and about the factors which worked ultimately to make the United States a unified nation. I learned a great deal about the issues leading to the War and about the changes it effected in American life from Catton's account. (In his short discussion of Reconstruction, Catton suggests that the victorious Union took an unduly punitive approach to the South. This is one area in which many contemporary historians, I think, would tend to disagree with him.)Catton's work also places great emphasis on the Western theatre of the War beginning with the capture of Fort Donelson in 1862. He sees Antietam rather than Gettysburg as the Confederate &quot;High Tide&quot; in the conflict. In these matters too, Catton's discussion is in accord with much recent writing on the War.Although Catton's book focuses on, and is deeply sympathetic to, the Northern war effort, he portrays the Confederacy as a valiant and determined foe making its own effort to preserve what it viewed as a traditional, agrarian way of life. Again, he never allows the reader to forget that this way of life was predicated upon slavery. He recognizes the South's persistence in the War, the determination of its people, the courage of its soldiers, and the brilliance of Robert E. Lee without falling into &quot;Lost Cause&quot; mythology.I am pleased that Catton's &quot;This Hallowed Ground&quot; remains in print and available for new readers who wish to understand our country and its greatest conflict. This book is an excellent choice for readers who only wish to read a single work on the War. I enjoyed the comments of the other Amazon readers who have reviewed this book.",
                    "Bruce Catton is first and foremost a storyteller. Beyond the actual retelling of the events, which are truly awe-inspiring in their own right, Mr. Catton offers the reader true insight into the stakes of each major battle and the entire as only historical hindsight can offer. The reader will likely gain an appreciation for Lincoln's burden, who seemingly was singly aware amongst the Northern decision makers of the broader consequences of the actions taken to preserve the fledgling union. Mr. Catton does not overly dwell on tactics and casualty numbers, focusing rather on the Civil War amid the context of American culture and history.A note on the tone of the book. This is not a balanced account of the great story, in that there is focus on the Northern side. However, Mr. Catton is delivering no more or less than promised, as the title of the book identifies this intent. That said, this does not mean that he in any way exaggerated the cause or characters in any apparent way. I am not an historian, but am a budding Civil War enthusiast, and have read a couple of the heavyweights: McPherson's &quot;Battlecry of Freedom&quot; and Foote's &quot;The Civil War: a Narrative,&quot; and consider Catton's work superior to both. McPherson's work is a bit more factual, but not as poetic. Foote's 3000+ page work is difficult to read due to his unabashed favoritism to the Confederacy's cause, its heroes, and its battle prowess; even though he is every bit the storyteller and researcher that Catton is. All in all, I would recommend reading both Catton and Foote to achieve a well balanced tutorial of our greatest American story.",
                    "This is one of the two or three very best histories of the Civil War ever written. It is on a par with &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom.&quot; It brings events to life. It has the ring of absolute truth. Its characterizations of events and individuals are poetic and deeply moving. It teaches us tremendously important lessons of character and history.In addition, it's a real page-turner - not a hard read at all. I've quoted more sections of it to my wife, my children (ages 11 and 13) and my co-workers than any other book I can think of.I recommend this book to my brothers and sisters who are descendants of Confederate veterans, as well as those of us who are descended from the Union side. It is of a character and stature commensurate with General Lee.Tim Oksman, City AttorneyPortsmouth, Virginia",
                    "I read this book twice; once before and again after reading the Grant Trilogy--Capt. Sam Grant, Grant Moves South, and Grant Takes Command followed by The Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant. The author drew liberally from primary sources, and what he writes you can believe. He writes very well. My first reading was an introduction without knowledge; the second pulled all the other readings together. I recommend them all, of course, but this seems to me a must because it so accurate, complete, and insightful. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",
                    "The works of Bruce Catton were among the first that stimulated my interest in the American Civil War. It's a massive subject matter with what must be millions of words written in it's account. Thus reading about the war could be confusing at the least and over powering at the most. This is not the case with Bruce Catton who writes with a clarity that enables the reader to clearly understand the events he is relating.'This Hallowed Ground' is no exception. It is concise, clear and informative, thus the reader whether this is their 1st Civil War read or their 100th will put the book down and want to know more!For a factual book it often had the feel of a good Civil War novel, it is exciting and breath taking with a real power that I feel is hard to match elsewhere. Here is an author that not only both knows and respects his subject matter but is able to transfer this to the written page.One word of warning, read it slowly. If you rush through this book (and there is a temptation to do so due to its strengths) you will regret it when the last page is completed.",
                    "I have been a reader of Bruce Catton's Civil War histories for years (I own 10 of them). I agree with the reviewers about Catton's vast talent as a storyteller and as a narrator of events. It was through reading his works that I first became aware of some of the lesser known colorful characters of the time, such as Gen. Phillip Kearney, Gen. D.H. Hill, and Robert Toombs. In fact, it was the writing of Bruce Catton that first turned me into a Civil War buff.I have a rather strong objection to the subtitle of this work, which the late historian would never have approved were he alive today. This book is not \"the Union side\" of the Civil War; it gives BOTH sides. In fact, the author is more sympathetic to men like Gen. Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis than I would have been. For many years, some influential historians have sought to label any history that seems to hint that the right side won the Civil War as biased. (Over four score and seven years, actually.) This work is a balanced account, and one of the best one-volume histories of the war ever written, both on the battle front and at the home fronts. It deserves to be thought of as such.",
                    "Of all the heartbreaking, sacrificial, and exhausting wars that the United States has encountered, the Civil War is the most upsetting of all. Bruce Catton, part of the last wave of a generation of romantic historians, paints a vivid portrait of the Union side of the conflict. Like all war historians, he is impressed by the elements that are found in the crucible of a long fight: the pageantry, brilliant tactical moves, feats of individual courage, and the inexhaustible source of stories. But on the other, he has enough judgment to temper his own writing with accounts of casualty lists and useless battles.Catton's main thesis is that although the war did not begin over slavery, it became so through the force of the war's tide, and that the tide only became inexorable after a series of poor decisions on the Union side. He is especially adept at tracing the threads of the various campaigns - the Army of the Potomac's stalemated situation in Virginia, for instance, is contrasted with Grant's quick thinking out west with the Army of the Tennessee. As the title would imply, the book focuses on the to and fro movements of the Union side. Lincoln, Lee, and the particularities of the situation prior to the war are not dealt with in any depth.Nor is this is a book with a list of laundry items for the typical soldier and a slew of footnotes, although it is well-researched and thorough. Catton is more interested in quickly sketching an army as they march through the heat of the Mississippi and the lush countryside of Georgia. He unabashedly plays favorites with his \"cast of characters\" - Grant and Lincoln are praised, McClellan is not - but in most cases his biases are justified.One could argue Catton's taste for drama and humorous anecdote overrides his ability to assess rationally the Civil War, but perhaps his romantic/realistic view of history is more in keeping with the age it is describing. The Civil War was fought by stubborn men who refused to cede a tenet long past its due date - and that in itself is the true tragedy.",
                    "There are more books about the American Civil War than on any other subject in US history. New books are written everyday. Some are very good, some are not. However, despite all the new enteries to the field of study in my opinion the best is some of the oldest. In my opinion no one writes better about the Civil War than Bruce Catton. In this work he looks at the Civil War from the Union point of view. But regardless, it is one of the best single volume histories of the war. And despite its age, Catton's works has stood the test of time. His history is good and accurate. And he can write. Catton discusses good history and tells it in beautiful writing. This could be a novel. There are a lot of books on the Civil War, however there are not a lot of writers as good as Catton.",
                    "Of the thousand of books written on the American Civil War, &quot;This Hallowed Ground&quot; ranks among the very best, standing side by side with James McPherson's &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom.&quot; Both books not only give a comprehensive history of the war but also place the war in historical context and thoroughly discuss its causes and consequences. In so doing, both books provide an insightful analysis of racism in the mid-nineteenth century and how it is a foundation for racism today. Both those who continue to worship the Confederacy and those who believe the lie that slavery was not the cause of the war will hate these books. Those with open and inquiring minds will love them."

                    "The Civil War Reader by Richard B. Harwell is a combination of both the Confederate and Union Readers making this an indispensible companion to anyone interested in the Civil War. By combining both readers in one volume you can cross reference accounts across both sides of the conflict giving you a better picture as to what really happened.Here the participants describe in their own words the bitterness of the conflict making reading this book realistic as the animosity, battlefield scenes of heroism and horror reach up and grab for your attention.Like all history, time dimmes the recollection till there is no one left to tell what happens, only the written word is left to tell the succeding generations what had transpired. But so much we forget. The war was more than Lincoln and his generals and his Cabinet, more than battles and heros. The South and the Confederates in this reader is a rough chronological selection from the writings of the times, the writings that were, theoretically at least, available to the Confederate reading public. And here, more than about any other period, the South has felt it necessary to explain itself. Hardly was the ink dry on General Lee's farewell at Appomattox before the South began its attempts to vindicate in print its course during the war. the War of Separation, the War of Yankee Aggression.This record left by these printed evidences of Confederate life is the truest record of the war. Prejudiced and incomplete as it is, it is nevertheless an accurate picture of the Confederacy, left for posterity. I found this to be one of the best books on both sides of the war as the people who were there, wrote what they felt to be true, giving the reader a glimpse into the psyche of the war.America in 1861 was still a new country. Just as the war was a test of democratic principle it was a test of democratic education. Never before had there been so literate an army. Such a soldiery was ready, and proud, to relate its experiences. That is why we as the posterity can read eyewittness accounts that recall events in detail just as if we were there ourselves.This is an excellent, cogent, and fast read, but filled with copoius detail, making this an excellent choice for your library."

Too often the war waged west of the Mississippi River has been given short shrift by historians and scholars, who have tended to focus their attention on the great battles east of the river. This book looks in detail at the military operations that occurred in Louisiana\u2014most of them minor skirmishes, but some of them battles and campaigns of major importance. The Civil War in Louisiana begins with the first talk of secession in the state and ends with the last tragic days of the war. John D. Winters describes with great fervor and detail such events as the fall of Confederate New Orleans and the burning of Alexandria. In addition to military action, Winters discusses the political, economic, and social aspects of the war in Louisiana. His accounts of battles and the men who waged them provide a fuller story of Louisiana in the Civil War than has ever before been told.",

Juxtaposing articles and speeches by men who lived through the struggle with the interpretations of post-Civil War historians, Kenneth M. Stampp brings face to face spokesmen for the major schools of thought. Was slavery the determinig cause? Can the blame be laid either to 'Black Republican' agitation or to the ruthless machinations of a 'Slave Power' conspiracy? Was the war an 'irrepressible conflict' between an agrarian South and an industrialized North? This volume provides no answers. Rather, the readings--including several new selections--reveal the uncertainty about the war's causes that has repeatedly driven historians back to the sources. They help us to enlarge our knowledge and deepen our understanding of the differences that set brother against brother.\"--Page 4 of cover.",

If you believe that people died for this, then you need to be reading bedtime stories. The war was fought over MONEY, POWER, and caused by disagreement between Constitutional Federalists and Jeffersonians.

The most vivid memory I have is of the wonderful battle maps which showed individual soldiers in blue and gray lined up for battle or wounded or killed rather than just colored lines and arrows.

While it is adapted for young readers any adult can see the weath of information one can gather.The book discusses the war from 1861 to the end in 1865. It included the assasination of abraham lincoln.The text is written in plain English which makes it easy to understand and read through. It captivate the reader as it discribes the battles and engagement of the war.The Illustrations are beautiful and informative. You can see troop positions though there aren't any actual regemental information. You have an unobstructed view of the battle which place troops in general areas. I am uncertain if each battlefield is accurate because I have not research them all yet, but you can get a general idea of how the battlefield was laid out. These add to the value of this book.The pictures seem to give an insight on the the key players and events and does not hold back on what the war was really like.I think this book should be in every library, dedicated to the civil war or not.Enjoy",

Anyone interested in the Civil War should enjoy this book.",

I found it interesting, and it would be especially good for younger readers who are interested in learning more about the Civil War. One of the strengths of the book was the photos as well as many paintings and drawings that came from the period of the Civil War. These give the reader a picture of the scenes of war. Other helpful things found in the book are maps of battlefields with explanations of what took place and in what areas. The book might be a little old and outdated, but it is still very helpful in explaining more of that awful period of American history."
