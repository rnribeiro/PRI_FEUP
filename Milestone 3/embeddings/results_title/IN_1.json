What of the more brain-like, connectionist computers: could they really understand, even if digital computers cannot? This collection of classic and contemporary readings (which includes an editor's introduction and an up-to-date reading list) provides a clearly signposted pathway into hotly disputed philosophical issues at the heart of artificial intelligence.",

The history of science contains dramatic episodes of revolutionary change in which whole systems of concepts have been replaced by new systems. Thagard provides a new and comprehensive perspective on the transformation of scientific conceptual systems. Thagard examines the Copernican and the Darwinian revolutions and the emergence of Newton's mechanics, Lavoisier's oxygen theory, Einstein's theory of relativity, quantum theory, and the geological theory of plate tectonics. He discusses the psychological mechanisms by which new concepts and links between them are formed, and advances a computational theory of explanatory coherence to show how new theories can be judged to be superior to previous ones.",

        "description": "From the #1 bestselling author of The Bomber Mafia, the landmark book that has revolutionized the way we understand leadership and decision making. In his breakthrough bestseller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work--in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of \"blink\": the election of Warren Harding; \"New Coke\"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of \"thin-slicing\"--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.",

The Second Edition includes: - more coverage on the role of emotions, happiness, and general well-being in decisions - a summary of the new research on the neuroscience of decision processes - more discussion of the adaptive value of (non-rational heuristics) - expansion of the graphics for decision trees, probability trees, and Venn diagrams.",

        "description": "Purpose of the Book This book presents an approach to improve the standard object-oriented pro gramming model. The proposal is aimed at supporting a larger range of incre mental behavior variations and thus promises to be more effective in mastering the complexity of today's software. The ability of dealing with the evolutionary nature of software is one of main merits of object-oriented data abstraction and inheritance. Object-orientation allows to organize software in a structured way by separating the description of different kinds of an abstract data type into different classes and loosely connecting them by the inheritance hierarchy. Due to this separation, the soft ware becomes free of conditional logics previously needed for distinguishing between different kinds of abstractions and can thus more easily be incremen tally extended to support new kinds of abstractions. In other words, classes and inheritance are means to properly model variations of behavior related to the existence of different kinds of an abstract data type. The support for extensi bility and reuse with respect to such kind-specific behavior variations is among the main reasons for the increasing popularity of object-oriented programming in the last two decades. However, this popularity does not prevent us from questioning the real effec tiveness of current object-oriented techniques in supporting incremental vari ations. In fact, this popularity makes a critical investigation of the variations that can actually be performed incrementally even more important.",
