The history of science contains dramatic episodes of revolutionary change in which whole systems of concepts have been replaced by new systems. Thagard provides a new and comprehensive perspective on the transformation of scientific conceptual systems. Thagard examines the Copernican and the Darwinian revolutions and the emergence of Newton's mechanics, Lavoisier's oxygen theory, Einstein's theory of relativity, quantum theory, and the geological theory of plate tectonics. He discusses the psychological mechanisms by which new concepts and links between them are formed, and advances a computational theory of explanatory coherence to show how new theories can be judged to be superior to previous ones.",

Explains complex networks and hierarchies of concepts, mental structures, and conceptual systems, and how conceptual systems develop so that a new conceptual system eventually provides greater explanatory coherence than the previous conceptual system. Covers conceptual hierarchy transformation and how concepts are recombined, added into, and deleted from large-scale conceptual systems. Brings Kuhn's theory to completion, resulting in a fully powerful way of thinking about conceptual revolution in any domain, thus intellectual conversion in general.",

But it goes a bit further. And because it's specifically oriented towards implementing a learning process in Artificial Intelligence, that 'learning' orientation can easily be translated to 'organizational' or even 'individual learning'.A highly valuable asset!"

All the major contributors to computing are discussed, with a good synopsis for each, explaining his or her bailiwick. The treatment is about 50-50 between hardware and software. The articles tend to discuss the main ideas, and the encyclopedia and its supplements should not be seen as even an attempt at a summary of vendors' offerings.If you are new to computing and want a general introduction, try consulting articles here. Professionals in computing will already have specialised texts in their subfields, and may not really need this book."

        "description": "From the #1 bestselling author of The Bomber Mafia, the landmark book that has revolutionized the way we understand leadership and decision making. In his breakthrough bestseller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work--in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of \"blink\": the election of Warren Harding; \"New Coke\"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of \"thin-slicing\"--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.",

            "Skip BLINK.BLINK sure did not read in a blink--slow, slow read!To honor the crux of his book, I figured I should write the review so you would know within the first few seconds that you could skip reading this book.Liked the concept. Delivery was tediously slow. Lessons learned were minimal.However, I will give TIPPING POINTThe Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Differencea shot based on strong recommendations from friends and colleagues.",
            "The case studies are what make this book. Who wouldn't want the inside scoop on art dealings, marital discord, cop stories and what happens when someone with autism watches Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?I like the way the author dissects these stories -- some of which we're familiar with, like Amadou Diallo's death or the assassination attempt on President Reagan's life -- and then ties them together in the neat little concept of \"thin-slicing,\" or making decisions based on very minute pieces of visual or tactile information.But Gladwell's overarching idea, that the unconscious decisions we arrive at in the first few milliseconds of a situation can be better than thoughtfully considered ones, seems woefully optimistic to me. After all, many of the instances Gladwell analyzes are ones in which the snap decision was wrong.Take the death of Amadou Diallo. Gladwell's treatment of it is part of a section on how reading facial cues can help you \"mind-read,\" or intuit someone's true intentions. Even if the cops in this situation had years of practice in the arcane study of facial movements and could more accurately read Mr. Diallo's face, what could they have seen in this particular situation? It was the middle of the night on a dark street!The only real lesson I took away from this book is that, yes, \"thin-slicing\" can provide a good answer, but only after a lifetime of experience in some particular field. Gladwell's examples attest to that fact -- art forgery, police actions, music appreciation, food tasting. Unless you've honed your instincts with years of instruction and experience, I'd say you're better off taking your time making decisions.",
            "I decided to read this book because Outliers was not yet in at my library. With its low rating on Amazon, I should have known it wouldn't be worth my while. There are some neat stories in there and interesting ideas. My main problem is that the book claims to change the way we will think yet gives no instructions to do so. It just gives a few examples on when intuition worked out really well and when it lead to unfortunate consequences. Probably won't read Outliers now.",
            "\"Blink\" almost instantly made it to my shelf of favorite books of all time. I won't go into a detailed description of Gladwell's theory of thin-slicing, as other reviewers have already done this in all the detail you need to know before you decide to purchase this book (which I highly recommend you do) Instead, I'll tell you what I took away from \"Blink\", and why I think it's such an important read.\"Blink\" is more than just a series of entertaining anecdotes that support his theory. It is a book of lessons that provide insight into our minds, and the minds of those around us. Armed with this knowledge, we are better prepared to not only understand our own decision-making process, but to see, for a blink of an eye, what others are seeing when they make decisions about us. Many of the experiments and studies he describes contain information that can be directly applied to one's life.A good example of this is the study done in Germany that turns our idea of `feeling happy' on its head. While everyone knows that when you're happy, you smile, a team of German scientists found that it works in reverse as well. The simple act of smiling improves your mood. One could just take this interesting factoid and store it in the lumber room of your mind along with all the other trivia. I chose to make it relevant. I can't tell you how many times it's happened since reading this book that I felt angry, frustrated, impatient, or irritated in some way, and then turned my mood around just by forcing myself to smile for a little bit.Another sub-chapter of the book (\"Arguing with a Dog\") describes what Gladwell calls \"temporary autism\", a kind of mind-blindness that occurs when one is excited or stressed to the point that the heart rate rises above 145. I found this chapter very helpful in understanding the physiological process, as my work often requires me to deal with very stressed out people. (It helped with some easily excitable friends too!)The sub-chapter titled \"The Storytelling Problem\", which detailed the vast difference between what people say they want in a mate and what they are in fact attracted to, made me feel a lot better after reading it. After years of hearing women describe their \"perfect man\" to me, and then seeing them fall for a perfect jerk instead, I've gotten more than a little frustrated. But now I know there is a psychological reason for this insanity. I wish I could make every single woman in the country read this chapter (or at least the single women in my city!) On a similar note, I wish I could make everyone read the chapter called \"The Warren G. Harding Error\", which details the power of looks and our subconscious predilection for \"tall, dark, and handsome\" men. This chapter is especially relevant in an election year, when we are looking at our two candidates and judging them. Do we really know upon what basis we are judging? Are TRULY picking the best man for the job, or are we voting on who has made the more \"presidential\" first impression? As much as most people won't admit that race plays any part in their vote, mightn't it anyway, even among those people who truly DO deplore racism? Do we like a candidate because of what he or she truly stands for, or are we voting for them because they smile more often, or joke more often, or were wearing our favorite color the first time we saw them? One section of the book even describes how people can be \"primed\", subtly influenced to think and behave differently, at least in the short term. Are we, as voters, being \"primed\" by the various media? I think these are all very valid and relevant questions we need to ask ourselves.This is what I took away from \"Blink\"- a deeper understanding of the decision-making process, and what factors assist or subvert it. \"Paul Van Riper's Big Victory\" is a portrait of a decision-making model that works. \"Pepsi's Challenge\" describes a situation where thin-slicing doesn't work out. \"The Chair of Death\" describes an interesting hiccup in the thin-slicing process, where peoples' initial reaction can be negative, not because something is genuinely bad, but simply because it is unfamiliar. And \"Blink in Black and White\", which not only relates the problem of automatic subconscious racial stereotyping (even of ones OWN race) but supplies a test you can do yourself, was nothing less than chilling.OK, Gladwell is a writer, not a scientist. If you're looking for an airtight theory complete with control group testing and a detailed analysis of every possible permutation of the concept, go read a scientific journal. And, as another reviewer pointed out, he does tend to end his books with a thud rather than a conclusion. Nonetheless, I think this should be required reading in every American high school. The idea is that compelling, and the issues involved are that important.",
            "While it sounds by the title like it's a self-help book for the decisionally challenged, the book is actually a compendium of information about attitudes, prejudices, information and decision making, and what constitutes an expert decision maker.The book is interesting but somewhat rambling in character. The information seems a little disconnected, and I was at times hard put to it to decide if I were being encouraged or discouraged from using the unconscious part of my decision making apparatus for making judgments. By the end I could hear the distinct echoes of the Delphic Oracle's famous \"Know thyself\" reverberating through my mind.Like so much offered advice, in the end the distillation of all the information the author provides us is that sometimes it's a good idea and sometimes it's not. In the sometimes it's a good idea I can definitely find a resonance. As a college student I found that if I didn't do what I thought I \"should\" be doing I didn't do anything at all. By the time I had gotten to graduate school however, I had discovered that my subconscious mind was able to dictate when I needed to get busy with classroom projects, and it was always right too. I finally decided that it knew what I had to do, how much time I had, what my resources were, what the likely expectations of the professor were, and what my abilities were. Once I grew to rely on this subconsious sense of \"do it now,\" I no longer felt guilty about doing other things and got a whole lot more done in the bargain.Certainly the author's information on the research into default setting prejudices like black equals bad and white equals good was an eye opener. I have no doubt that despite my pleasant interactions with black individuals as friends and coworkers I also harbor an embarrassing default setting. When I realize how much a part the media play in this programing, I am amazed that race relations aren't worse than they are. It would appear that most of us are able to deal rationally with our irrational prejudices, thank God. Definitely the sketch of the disastrous death of an innocent black man in New York City at the hands of the police was a horror story about rational thinking short circuited. The tragedy was so appalling, it's difficult to realize how complex and physiological it all must have been and how totally out of control. Likewise the description of violence that occurred in Florida was also frightening and makes one understand how group behavior can so thoroughly take over. That the frenzied speeches of Adolph Hitler and the charged mass behavior could lead to a world war is not quite so surprising when one realizes that crazy things can happen with as few as four or five people under unusual conditions. What's truely sad is that much of the data on predjudice and group think and authority figures has been known for decades with very little done to change it.More surprising still was the study of military fact finding and its effect on decision making. The Red-Blue war game was especially informative. That the complexity of war should make it unpredictable should hardly be surprising. Murphey's Law should see to that, goodness knows. I was surprised that the author didn't discuss emergent properties or some of the findings on chaos theory. Surely Stuart Kaufman's or Per Bak's names should have arisen at least once, but--as I recall, anyway--they didn't.All in all, while the book seemed like a string of observations rather than a coherent whole, I found the information of great interest.Intriguing.",
            "Sometimes snap judgments are correct (rigged card games; analysis of statues); sometimes they're not (Amadou Diallo; Diet Coke). At the end of the day, what has really been learned? Should we trust our snap judgments or not? And what distinguishes a proper snap judgment situation from one where a longer analysis is required? The book never provides the answers, just a lot of admittedly-interesting vignettes and study synopses.So -- interesting book to read but not particularly helpful as an analytic aid.",
            "Gladwell is a superb, captivating storyteller. He opens the book with some compelling examples to support his principal objective of the book: the \"task of making sense of ourselves and our behavior requires that we can acknowledge there can be as much value in the blink of an eye as months of rational analysis.\" He amply succeeds in accomplishing his objective yet you can't help being left wanting for how we can opportunistically leverage our instincts versus when we should sit back and take a deep breath and analyze. That being said, I enjoyed the book and found the topic to be important. And the book passes my ultimate screen of a subject well explored that I will remember for years to come.",
            "The premise of this book is how we make split second decisions subconciously without really knowing it. This is explored in both a positive and negative light. Sometimes our intuitions are dead on, other times they lead to disaster.That being said, this topic is fascinating and the examples used are, for the most part, an intriguing look into the synapses of the mind. The book is highly entertaining and presents a bewildering dilemma. How do we know when these intuitive thoughts are a good thing as opposed to something detrimental to our being?The problem with this book is that there is no real connection between the two. Beyond the examples of when split second decisions work, and when they don't there is no real explanation as to why they go one way or another. Understandably, this is a difficult question to answer, and is probably not answerable altogether. Still, there is no real wrap up to the book, it rather presents itself as a series of examples.Even so, this is a fascinating book about the inner workings of the mind, and it makes you want to dig deeper into the mysteries within it.",
            "I came across this book after reading an article about intuition in Scientific American, and then conducting an online search of the subject.This book is not exactly what it states it is, but interesting enough and well-written.I think a point that Gladwell discusses, but not profoundly enough, is the essense of the book, \"experience\". Gary Klein's \"Sources of Power...\" hits more on the subject matter in a straightforward manner, where Gladwell is more articulate and sensationalistic.Ultimately, I want to learn or benefit from reading a book. Like a cookbook, I find it valuable if ONLY one recipe is successful - two is a bonus. Hence, the question for me is, \"Did I enjoy a benefit from the purchase of this book.\" Personally, I did. It gave me many ideas. Also, much of the referenced material is very useful - I've already followed-up (one thing leads to another). In layman's terms, this book helps me to understand why I do certain things, or react in certain manners. Gladwell is not an authority - he simply compiles experiences from his resources and their studies, and writes them nicer than the professionals he interviewed...",
            "Gladwell's focus in Blink is on snap decisions. Rather than a reliance on the slow rational process, snap decisions come from gut feelings, intuition, or as Gladwell puts it, behind the \"locked door\" of your unconsciousness. Why are some are absolutely right on and others so wrong? Gladwell states three aims for his book. First is to make the case for the accuracy of snap decisions. Second is to be able to understand why some snap decisions are good and others poor. Third, that we all can improve the quality of our snap decisions.What differentiates the good versus bad decisions, i.e. intuition versus prejudicial judgments? Accurate information, understanding which among all that information are the few crucial keys, and practice. Sounds almost contradictory, but the ability to make good snap judgments involves a lot of work!Blink is well-written. I've heard others complain it is superficial, but I feel he does an excellent job making science accessible without oversimplification (and he footnotes extensively, in case you want to read the original research).If you're expecting \"improve your SNAP in 30 days,\" you'll be disappointed. At his best depicting the good, the bad and the ugly, Gladwell is not explicit in prescribing a course to improve the quality of our decisions. He depicts it anecdotally.I read Blink with an eye towards incorporating it's lessons in the self-defense classes I teach. Every self-defense situation mandates decisions made in the blink of an eye. Rational thought is slow, so other brain pathways take over when we sense danger, increasing our adrenaline and preparing the body for action. You feel these effects: quickened breathing and pulse rates, tightening of the throat, chest, or abdomen, nausea, and many others. Every self-defense instructor exhorts students to pay close attention to these gut feelings, also called intuition. Yet how in the midst of an adrenaline rush can we distinguish intuition from a panic response? Is there a logic behind the difference, and a way to improve one's intuitive skills? The next-to-last chapter, focusing on the shooting death of Amadou Diallo in 1999 by New York police officers, describes how we read other people we feel may be a threat, how our bodies react under stress, and practices that police and security people can practice to help---or worsen---already bad situations. We are left to infer applications into our lives.",
            "Although I was able to power through this enjoyable book in a few short sittings, it left me a little disappointed. Blink's subject matter of our brain's powerful capability to make split-second decisions is thought provoking, but I found some of the treatments a little shallow. The book feels like Gladwell found an introductory college cognitive psychology text and decided to write a 250-page magazine article about its most interesting bits. Despite its shallowness, this is engaging and enjoyable soft non-fiction. A perfect beach or vacation read!",
            "Blink by Malcolm Gladwell is a riveting look at rapid cognition, or our natural ability to form snap judgments. Gladwell compiles an assortment of compelling examples of how we use our rapid cognition-sometimes for better, sometimes for worse-to make split decisions.Meet a psychologist who can predict with 95% accuracy whether a couple will still be married 15 years later by observing them for only one hour. Find out how researchers can tell which doctors will get sued and which won't after only observing 40 seconds of a conversation between doctor and patient. Meet the art historians and scholars who were able to spot an art forgery in seconds after science had \"proven\" it was authentic.This ability to discern a great deal from a limited amount of information is known as thin-slicing.As fascinating as the examples in the book are, what I found most interesting is what it teaches us about our snap judgments. Sometimes they go right (a firefighter who gets his men out of a building seconds before the floor collapses), and sometimes they go wrong (as in the case of the police officers who shot Amadou Diallo, an unarmed man). Why?More experience, not more information, seems to be the key. Experience educates our snap judgments, and experience helps eliminate the snap judgments that are behind unconscious prejudice, what Gladwell calls \"the dark side of rapid cognition.\" Through experience we identify signatures that allow us to make accurate evaluations in a short time. Information, especially as we compile more and more of it, tends to obscure these signatures and leads to less accurate evaluations. In many cases, this seems to contradict common sense, but the evidence in Blink is undeniable.Ultimately, the book's message is to respect our powers of rapid cognition, to recognize the times thin-slicing serves us and the times it leads us astray. But more than that. Rapid cognition doesn't need to be a mystery and we victims of it's whim. We can educate our snap judgments, and thereby learn to control them.2005 Curtis G. Schmitt / TurnOnToLife.com",
            "This is the first book I've read by Gladwell. I heard about the book on NPR and it sounded fascinating. If you've ever found yourself making a remarkable snap judgement in a stressful (or otherwise) situation, and wondered to yourself \"How did I know to do that?\", then this is the book to read. At 254 pages, it's a moderately short read that will keep you coming back for more. I didn't miss a single day of reading and managed to finisht he book in less than a week, which--for me--is fast.The book basically consists of 6 chapters in which Malcolm explores different facets of our unconscious mind. From art experts to orchestra auditions to police mishaps to military strategy to taste-testing, he certainly explores many different facets of instinctual reactions. Each chapter is divided into manageable, numbered, sub-sections that I really appreciated.I gave it 4 stars rather than five because it didn't make me say \"wow\" when I was finished. Not to say that I didn't enjoy, it just wasn't anything superbly profound that I hadn't thought about before. I would definitely recommend that if you've already got a mind to try this book out, you should. I wouldn't, however, recommend it to everyone I meet. All in all an interesting learning experience with a touch of entertainment value.",
            "The author treats us to a rehash of things already written several times (one original,the others ' followers').Why then the bestseller status? Well,who knows,maybe some have short memories,or don't read anything until it is on some list.not worth the money and time.",
            "I really enjoyed the book, both from a business (I own a Web site development business) and a personal perspective. The book gives the reader some keen insights as to the important nuances and peculiarities of our minds that are evident all the time. I was very impressed with how extensive the research was and how well orchestrated the content was. Gladwell's obvious writing talent allows him to smoothly weave an argument/narrative together the same way Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld used to write episodes of Seinfeld.I think that those who have been critical of this book have mistaken Gladwell's intention. He hasn't set out to establish definitive scientific theory. Instead, he's tried to give us several important glimpses of how our minds function and left the application to us. In this respect, I feel, the book is extremely worthwhile.",
            "What made The Tipping Point a wonderful book is back on display in Blink. At the same time, what made it unsatisfying is too. Gladwell is a gifted writer whose sentences have the straightforward brilliance of E. B. White's or Calvin Trillin's. He has a generous, curious spirit. He loves understanding why people do what they do. It's as if he goes through life with his notebook open, genuinely eager to learn about the people he meets. The stories that he tells in Blink are fascinating. The way, for instance, that little clues can tip off the careful observer that two newlyweds have a very high likelihood of divorce. And did I mention that he writes like an angel? But Blink is frustrating in much the same way that The Tipping Point is. Gladwell doesn't tie up all his stories into a clean thesis. Are snap judgments good or bad? Can anybody learn to do them, or just trained experts? Well? Most of the people who bought The Tipping Point were looking for a how-to book that would show them how to create tipping points for their own businesses. Unfortunately for them, that's not what Gladwell was trying to do. He's a great writer, whose m&eacute;tier is reporting.",
            "I would agree with several other reviewers of this book. After a while, the book becomes very repetitive and states the obvious. Yes, we clearly all make snap decisions and no, most of us don't analyze why we like jam for 15 minutes. In the beginning, its alluring to read about John Gottman's experiments and how he can predict whether a couple will divorce or stay together.He goes on from there to indicate the process of reading emotive expressions, but never ties back to how we should interpret/digest his examples. There seems to be lacking a definitive message in the book, suggestion, and practicality of whether we should go with intuition vs logic. He points out that male/female attraction is often inexplicable, contains the X factor and is not grounded in logic of what we \"say\" we want in a person. He never goes on to address how much weight we should give the X factor....have our minds become so highly tuned that it has integrated our deepest linear/logical thoughts as well as our non-linear feeling based wants/desires/needs and hence provides us with the X factor, or do we really need to discount the X factor to phermones and go back to what we logically want?How do we cognitively change unconscious emotions that in a blink of an eye, are expressed on our faces that as he points out, lead to either desirable or undesirable outcomes, and how much do we really need to change/hone this? Where's the point of the book?",
            "This is a very entertaining and enlightning book. The author introduces the concept of \"thin slicing\". Which is basically how people extract information about others and about situations from a minimum amount of information. It is the analysis of our first impressions and their value in our lives.The book analyses how people use this skill, when they are more likely to be successful in interpretation, when the ability is overshadowed by other circumstances, or when the skill shuts down completely.The reason why I give the book 4 stars is that the author did not make a very clear argument as to when can we trust our impressions and when not. For instance, there are long discussions about how experts are more likely to see the \"picture\" instanteneously for what it is. But then, the beginning of the book tells stories about lay people making good quick assessment on people's personalities based on their rooms alone. So do we have to become experts first, or can we trust our instinct now and then? That could be made a bit more clear.As to the writing style, in addition to being versed in various aspects of psychology, the author is an excellent story teller. The book is full of lively anecdotes and examples from life, news, history etc... The book also has a cohesive structure, with stories told in earlier chapters brought back again as the book progresses so we can gain a deeper insight into the workings of the mind.The bottom line is the book is great entertainment. It's a page-turner where you care about the people in the anecdotes and about the message of the book in general. Plus, after reading it you will feel that you learned something new about yourself and those around you.",
            "In his latest bestseller, Malcolm Gladwell examines how human beings often make critical choices in a fraction of a second. Sometimes judgments made on very little evidence are far more accurate than those based on volumes of data. What are the consequences of our snap decisions? Anyone interested in marketing and human behavior will be fascinated by this book.In his first book, The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference, Malcolm Gladwell examined why change so often happens as quickly and as unexpectedly as it does. His insights help make sense out of sudden social change.Our intuitions, as humans, aren't always very good, he says. Changes that happen really suddenly, on the strength of the most minor input, can be deeply confusing.Now, in Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, Gladwell furthers his exploration of fast moving ideas, this time focusing on how individuals can make almost instantaneous decisions based on very sketchy evidence. Or what seems like little evidence.Actually, relying on a gut feeling, and making a decision in the blink of an eye, is actually drawing on your lifetime of experience and jumping to a conclusion after synthesizing very little of the current evidence. If you do this well, Gladwell says you are \"thin slicing,\" or making a judgment based on a very small amount of data.When this works well, your snap decisions are accurate and insightful. Such decisions save time and money and can even eliminate the agony of human heartbreak. However, in most cases, the decision maker can't explain why or how she makes an instantaneous decision.In Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, Gladwell helps us understand the why and how.&lt;ul>&lt;li> Why one doctor is more likely than another to be sued for malpractice than another doctors of equal technical competence.&lt;li> How an expert psychologist can watch a newly married couple interact for only 15 minutes and predict, with surprising accuracy, whether they will still be married in 15 years.&lt;li> How political operatives can influence our vote by running candidates that we are predisposed to elect, despite their incompetence.&lt;li> Why and how a rogue military commander can easily outwit an army of experienced generals who are armed with volumes of intelligence and computer analysis.&lt;/ul>Blink's lessons for marketersAn understanding of how consumers make buying decisions is critical to marketing any product.Gladwell is a master storyteller and he weaves innumerable fascinating tales from the world of marketing to provide the anecdotal evidence that support his premises.In his less life-threatening tales, Gladwell covers a broad landscape of psychological testing and product branding experiences that will entertain and delight any serious marketer.&lt;ul>&lt;li> The Pepsi Challenge: Was it really fair or conclusive?&lt;li> How do the product and the package become a single entity in the mind of the consumer?&lt;li> How was margarine transformed into a desirable product after being rejected by a generation raised on butter?&lt;/ul>Gladwell makes a strong case for \"mind reading,\" or learning to trust your instincts when you read the subtlest of minimal cues on another human's face.Alternatively, he cites examples of how we are conditioned by a lifetime of unconscious prejudice to draw conclusions that are false and, in some cases, dangerous.Beware: the consequences of incorrectly interpreting the minimal cues on a human face can be fatal. Witness New York City police killing an unarmed citizen, Amadou Diallo, when, under extreme stress, they interpret fast unfolding events incorrectly and are certain they see him brandish a handgun when none exists.\"Our unconscious reactions come out of a locked room and we can't look inside that room,\" writes Gladwell. \"But with experience we become expert at using our behavior and our training to interpret -- and decode -- what lies behind our snap judgments and first impressions.\"--Peter A. Schaible",
            "I was recommended to buy this book at a user experience session at a web conference.After reading it all the way through, I felt that the core of the information would have made a good 3000-5000 word piece in a journal, with a few much shorter examples.In fact as I was reading it, I found myself thinking the annecdotes were too long and can we get back to some real content please.The annecdotes do illustrate the point well though, especially some of the ealier ones like the study on married couples. This was interesting, but I felt the book did drag on after that without adding much more.",

            "In the past, pageturners have been those books (usually mystery or spy novels) that you simply couldn't put down because they sucked you in for a few hours of enjoyment. With his second book, Gladwell has crafted a book every bit as addicting as \"The Tipping Point.\" Having used \"The Tipping Point\" as a book for students in high school business programs, I wish I taught psychology, as \"Blink\" would give me plenty to chew on. Students would thrill to the part about observing the couples for a few minutes to figure out if they will stay together! More importantly, the account of the failed war games can make one pause at the way our military is preparing for war around the world. Just like his previous book, Gladwell gives us plenty to chew on here, which means its effects will linger long after you've read it in a four hour session.

            "Gladwell probably doesn't know it, but his book could be a hit on Oprah's bookclub - at least the chapter on the Warren Harding Problem. This problem consists of the bad, misguided blink - to be distinguished from the insightful, intuitively on-point blink. Warren, you see, looked like a president, sounded like a president, and undoubtedly had a presidential swagger (though it hardly could have compared to WBush's peacocking under the Mission Accomplished banner or under the lights in New Orleans). But Warren was a superficial \"skirt-chaser,\" an idiot and a truly horrible president.But back to Oprah. The Warren Harding Problem, you see, extends not just to picking really bad presidents and CEO's, but to Boyfriends. Yep, that's what makes this Oprah-hot. We pick `em `cause they look like boyfriends, sound like boyfriends and even walk like boyfriends. But we fail to avoid the Warren Harding Problem and blink badly and our Warren-boyfriend turns out to be the worst boyfriend possible - actually, not a boyfriend at all.Note to Gladwell's agent: Forward this to Oprah.",

            "Malcolm Gladwell is one of my favorite authors, but Blink is not one of my favorite books. While it poses an interesting premise, Gladwell admits in the book that he got the idea for it because of how people reacted to his wiry shock of hair when he let it grow out - that seems like a thin editorial driver. But thin is really the focus of the book, in fact Gladwell coins the term \"thin-slicing\" as a key method that expert decision makers use to filter only the most important facts from an array of variables. While this is not a new idea - for decades the military has taught officers to make quick decisions with incomplete information - Gladwell takes it to an iffy extreme of making decisions in microseconds. That may hold true in some instances but seems unsustainable as a preferred methodology of selecting among options. Regardless, it is thought provoking and worth a read. Soundview recommends the book, but leaves it up to the reader to decide its validity - hopefully you'll give it more thought than a nanosecond or a blink.",
            "I did the audio book version of this. It had useful content and made me think a little about how people make decisions. Most of the book explains why it's important to give yourself an extra second of time to 'react' instead of making a quick decision or using your gut. I really didn't enjoy this book like many others have. Personally, I think great decisions are made on 'gut' and 'instinct.' The author does reference studies on incidents in american history where scientists compared the results of the actual incident versus a proposed alternative giving them more time to think before acting. Users who took an extra second to break up their unconscious reaction to make it a conscious decision showed greater success in desired results. I think the jury is still out on these studies, and I prefer to think that intuition and natural tendency/gut reactions are a better angle of approach, provided you have confidence in your decision-making and rarely second-guess yourself.",
            "In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell explains many things about what humans do when they have to make a decision. Is it a long and drawn out process? Or is it, simply, a \"snap\" decision? It is, Gladwell argues, the second choice. Whether the consequences of this action are good or bad doesn't influence our way of making it. Through style, tone, and impact, Gladwell presents us with a thoroughly entertaining nonfiction study of human behavior.There are, arguably, three fundamental ways to present a topic through a book. Style is incredibly important: it can express an unimpressively boring subject with a gleeful zeal that can make it interesting. The author of Blink has a bare idea but uses different types of structures to express it. Within the bulk of the eight main sections, there are mini-sections. That is, to elaborate further on examples, which brings the second part of the structure: examples. Gladwell has all of the hypotheses he can muster, but he also backs him up with legit historical and factual events that back up his point. The second part of writing is tone, which can very from cynical to joyful. The writer seems to find a nice balance between sarcasm and exuberance. Passion is another word that comes to mind, as the subject seems to be of great interest to the writer. The impact of a book is the climax and the conclusion. With Blink, he makes it fulfilling. It has an all-around view from every side in every situation, and the analysis seems well researched and well informed.The theory of thin slicing is the dominant theory available in the book. It proves in just a few words that everyone makes split decisions on a consistent basis. Gladwell expresses this well, through style, tone, and impact. Why did Warren Harding become president? Why do most couples use \"Irreconcilable Differences\" as a reason for divorce? Why do most people never notice the little mistakes in the marble of a statue? All of the answers to these questions lie in the magical world of Blink.",
            "I've avoided reading Mr Gladwell before due to various silly reasons - which mostly boil down to me avoid pop science books that talk about the values in gut reaction. However, I've been reading a lot on general marketing, management and brain development of late and I was looking for something related and light. \"Blink\" perfectly fit the bill.At heart, this is a book of stories. Within this framework, Mr Gladwell makes some compelling arguments about trusting the unconscious brain's initial read. Further, that when many factors are in play, sometimes it really does make sense to listen to the initial reaction instead of digging deeper into the problem. What makes this compelling is simple - he puts limits on when this works and describes situations where it fails. In fact he goes even farther and talks about how training is needed to fully know that you can trust your instincts. And to know when you can trust them. Indeed when we don't have training he shows how easy it is to \"seed\" someone so that they are more or less likely to reach certain conclusions (see Kahneman). A similar line of thought is used by Mr Taleb in \"Fooled by Randomness\" so its very good to see books come together on topics.For all this, there isn't much depth here so don't come looking for that. Instead focus on enjoying the ride as Mr Gladwell is a first class story teller.",
            "The main idea of this book is to explore how we use our subconscious (or instinct, or gut feeling) to make day to day decision. This instinctive decision helps us to manage our day to day life and response in emergency. This instinctive decision which made very quickly can be as good as decision made cautiously and deliberately. However, the very subconscious can also be dangerous, betray us and could cause us in making wrong decision. The second part of this book explore when should we trust our instinct and we should not. The final part of this book shows us how we could and educate control our snap judgment and first impression.We can know a lot about the person during first impression, as our subconscious mind is unconsciously finding patterns in situation and behavior while sizing up a person. This can also be done deliberately by observing small details. We could not explain how we derive certain decision which usually influence or based on our subconscious decision.Our subconscious is sometimes influence by our unconscious bias. This unconscious bias may have negative impact on our decision. However, this unconscious bias can be controlled using positive association.Good decision making relies on deliberate and instinctive thinking. In good decision making, less information is better than more information. More information will overload decision maker with noise because the additional information does not provide additional value.Using the example of tasting Pepsi and Coke, this chapter illustrates the result of focus group, which uses ordinary people for marketing research, may not be reliable. This is especially true when the members are made to think about their instinctive decision. The expert in a field have better judgment as compare to the focus group because their expertise allows them to have a better understanding on their unconscious decision on the subject they specialized. This chapter concludes by empathizing that our subconscious decisions are not necessarily wrong, however, they are shallow, hard to explain and easily disrupted.As we are emotionally arouse in an emergency situation our ability to collect and analyze information narrows. Our split second decision can lead us into trouble especially when we are under stress or in an emergency. This however can be control by slowing down our heart beat. By slowing down our heart beat, we can react better as our ability to analyze the situation increase. On a separate note, this chapter also mentioned that we could read peoples emotion by studying their facial expression.The final chapter concludes that we can avoid making wrong decision from our subconscious by isolating any factor that could mislead our judgment.",

It seems as if he was trying to say that \"Thin-Slicing\" and snap judgments can be more accurate than in detailed analysis.But then through the book, he provides data, studies, and stories to both support this idea and debunk it. So at the end of the book, you are left with the feeling that the author more or less just went out and gathered data and interview people without clarifying the issue or taking a clear stance.Its more like he just took the work of others and compiled it into a book form, without forming a solid opinion...",
            "Blink is about quick decisions that we all make without deep analysis. Often the decision makers cannot explain the rationale and logic behind these decisions. There are three themes that I picked up from the book. First, \"blink\" decisions may be better than decisions that are made after analysis and thought therefore we should not dismiss them. Second, there are other times that \"blink\" decisions can be terrible. Third, how do we improve our \"blink\" decisions? How can we distinguish situations that \"blinks\" are help or hurt us? The book is not organized quite this way . I found the author's writing and stories very enjoyable, but I did not follow what his point was in numerous parts. The stories were loosely related to \"blinking\". Some were too forced. Gladwell certainly gives you a lot to think about but does not really build a model that applies to the real world.Blink is delightful and very entertaining. Like the other two Gladwell books, the writing is excellent. The author creates the appropriate level of suspense in his numerous stories. He is a master at luring readers into his world. I think that he has improved with each subsequent book. Outliers was the best then Blink then Tipping Point.",
            "This is my favorite of Gladwell's conceptual ideas. I try to remind myself of it every day, that the information we gather in a blink of time is what we use to ascertain a situation. Why I bother gathering more is beyond me. How often I come back to that original burst of thought and wished I had listened to it. Of course, some impulsive thoughts are worth resisting and I suppose the secret is learnig to tell which is which, that is, which is worth a blink and which is worth a look.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell has a way that makes you believe you are being let in on newly-unveiled secrets. He did it with human social behavior in \"The Tipping Point\" and does it again here in \"Blink\" with the hidden world of the subconscious human mind.In \"Blink\", Gladwell tackles the way that the human mind can sometimes make near-instantaneous judgments that are often inexplicable, even to those who make them. Examples range from art experts who can tell a fake at a glance, to a tennis coach who can tell when a player is about the double-fault, to (less admirably) police officers who \"know\" a suspect is a criminal. There's a bit of benign bait and switch behind \"Blink\" in that it initially seems to suggest that we are about to be shown how to harness a great source of untapped, infallible interior wisdom. But while telling how some people do manage to make critical decision in the blink of an eye, Gladwell spends far more of the book discussing how our minds are fooled by our upbringing and experience, leading to horrific judgments that can have catastrophic effects.Gladwell's main focus in the book is on \"thin slicing\" -- the way our judgments are often based on seemingly insignificant portions of behavior. A surgeon's likelihood to be sued for negligence, for instance, can be predicted quite well on the basis of the tone of voice used when speaking with patients; a couple's likelihood of divorce on the number of insignificant facial flashes of contempt they show in a short conversation. Human minds, in another example, are incredibly well-tuned to pick up subtle fleeting signals from the faces of others. Maxwell makes the controversial, but I think on-target, point that our faces are not as much *controlled* by our minds, but are extensions of our minds. This is suggested by experiments that show how mood is changed by affecting an angry or happy face. But the connection goes the other way, and the mind is expressed by unconscious facial expressions that appear in milliseconds, betraying inner conflicts and fears. A film of British spy Kim Philby, when slowed downed considerably and viewed by and expert in facial expressions, betrays flashes of a man both fearful and proud of his duplicity.Gladwell also explores the subconscious -- the \"mind behind the locked door\" as he calls it, whose judgments strongly influence our behavior. He cites studies in which subjects, exposed to a set of words relating to old age, walk away from the test more slowly than do controls. That's one thing. More controversially, he contends that minority students score lower on a test -- if, that is they are asked at the outset to identify their race. Presumably, raising the race issue also raises unbidden associations with lower intellectual expectations. Aside from being potentially inflammatory, this last example seems a bit too pat in its suggestion that minorities devalue education and that more conscious biases are not also at play. But while \"Blink\" shows how our subconscious can be fooled, it also provides ways to defeat its worst tendencies. Gladwell's story of the successful car salesman who treats all customers alike, thereby deliberately blocking irrelevant signals (dress, age, gender, race) that fool others to dismiss potential customers, show that our mistaken snap judgments can be overcome.Gladwell's writing is fascinating, but not entirely trustworthy. He has a maddening tendency to fudge the story to make his point. He cites precise percentages when they agree with his thesis, but replaces them with vague language when they don't. And anyone who reads psychological literature will find Gladwell's sense of certainty a bit suspect. Gladwell's treatment of the Amadou Dialou shooting by 4 white cops in was a case in point. Avoiding the standard rationales for the killing (self defense by police backers and race by Dialou supporters) Gladwell spins a tale in which cops lost their ability to \"mind-read\" Dialou by rushing him, then getting lost in an adrenaline-fueled autism-like state. It's own thing to suggest this as a possibility. It's another to state it as a certainty.\"Blink\" is an interesting read when taken with a grain of skepticism. The picture it paints of the ways -- good and bad -- that we make quick decisions might help us overcome our reliance on gut impressions that are built only on cultural assumptions. The heroes of \"Blink\" are those whose \"snap\" impressions are built a database built from years of personal experience. In a society in which the most ignorant get to broadcast their opinions, thus affecting the \"experience\" of their audiences, this is refreshing.",
            "One of key ideas of this book is that on many occasions the unconscious can inform the rest of `the person' of a decision that is not realised consciously for some time to come. We need to recognise that, and know how and when to trust these potential critical moments - is it a good judgement or not?Gladwell has hit upon a winning formula in his writing. His earlier block-busting book has been a key influence in modern thought, and the title (\"Tipping Point\") has entered common vocabulary in its own right. The title of this book is not snappy enough to do that, but the book is a fascinating meander through both mental and physiological factors that can result in us making snap decisions. In its own way, this is no less of a classic as his earlier effort.The book does not only concentrate on key moments where the snap decision has been a `good' one, but also where the decision has been poor or very questionable - indicating when to trust snap decisions, and when not to. The election of Warren Harding as 29th President of the USA is an example of a collective snap decision that proved to be poor. Gladwell uses examples of many experiments, yet these do not detract from the overall narrative.There are a number of research techniques that are described, yet these are introduced in sufficient detail as to keep the overall interest of the reader. The variety of the knowledge touched upon is breathtaking, so it is a mixture of research, interspersed with little anecdotes, which work very well. The reader is sometimes left wondering how the rest of the story finishes, but that is a comment rather than a criticism.One of the series of anecdotes relates to the previously unknown prejudice in selecting personnel for orchestras. This only became apparent when auditions when the performers were unseen by the adjudicators became the norm. Gladwell uses this to illustrate that snap decisions sometimes use clues that are unknown and unhelpful.Thinking about thinking reminds me of the centipede, which when asked how he manages to walk, no longer can. So it is with people thinking. Take the story of how some people think, and use it to avoid possible pitfalls. Read the book, but keep on thinking. Take from it the notion of `Thin Slicing', so that you can realise when snap decisions can be an advantage. Look at the expressions on faces (learn to `mind read'), and if your heart rate is significantly raised, be very careful what you do.Peter Morgan (morganp@supanet.com)",
            "The information in the book was quite interesting, but I expected the concept to be expanded to include ways in which we could use this concept in our own experience. A bit of a dissapointment and way too long to get the point across.",
            "This book just makes you see things entirely different. It is absolutely amazing. Malcom Gladwell is a great writer and thinker. I definitely recommend this book.",
            "The basic idea is interesting and held my attention for a while, but eventually lost my interest.",
            "Started out really liking it, but it suddenly started feeling suspiciously like a self-help book. I'm not crazy into that.",
            "The book is interesting but not too awakening. It makes you think about your subconscious and instincts when making decisions. If a book is really good, I find it hard to put down. That was not the case with this book.",
            "Really liked this book...it opened my eyes as to how we as a society can make assumptions about things very quickly and not really know why. This explains the WHY. Malcolm Gladwell is an excellent writer and I also read his book \"The Tipping Point\" which is equally an excellent read. Great discussion book for a book club (nice change from chick lit!)",
            "Wow! Finally I get to read a book that shows the other side of this coin. M. Gladwell makes a superb work at giving a different idea of how we make judgements and therefore, how we can manage under certain circumstances those belly messages (according to his book, perhaps, only perhaps, we should give more credit to them than we do...). Each reader can make his / her own interpretation of the cases presented and then, understand and apply to every particular experience. Every case presented in this book is (to say the least) fascinating... one of those books you can't stop reading once you opened it!",
            "This book explores the power of our thoughts and how our 'automatic' thinking affects our lives-often in ways that are not clear-I recommend this and a book by a guy I heard on Sirius-FREE YOUR MIND by Anthony Stultz- together they help us to bring real clarity to our often cloudy minds.Free Your Mind: The Four Directions of an Awakened Life",
            "Amazing and insightful information written in a very engaging style. This book can help you be more objective, evaluate opinions of others, avoid prejudice, even help relationships including marriage. Very astute insights to help decision making. I highly recommend it.",
            "Highly recommended. This book is amazing- great research, and great life changing thought potential. I can't stop thinking about how this makes me think! Our brains are amazing, and this book shows us why.Easy to read, wonderful insight.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell expanded his argument through various examples. Insight into events in history as well as inclusion of his own anecdotes provided the momentum that kept the book a page-turner. Blink can easily become a quick read because of its gripping nature. I initially thought his argument was simplistic, but throughout the course of the book, he introduced many layers that made his reasoning much more complex in a pleasant way.This book is highly recommended for anyone who wants to understand decision making on an often subconcious level.",
            "I had read it before and enjoyed it so sent it on for a gift.",
            "I found the book very enjoyable, although chapters four and five had a little too much detail for me.This book is a must read as it clearly presents the role that your unconscious mind plays in decision making. A role that is often discounted and replaced by detailed analytical analysis. In the blink of an eye, your unconscious mind is able to give you insights about a specific situation or object. You may not be able to articulate these insights or justify them to others. However, they are often correct. The author describes a psychologist who can predict whether a marriage will last based on a few minutes observing the couple. This analysis is based on what is called \"thin slicing\" - focusing on the few factors that are critical, without over analyzing. Indeed, great decision makers are often those who have perfected the art of \"thin slicing\".However, the author also points out situations where your unconscious mind can lead you astray. For example when you have been culturally conditioned to believe in a certain way or where you have been conditioned to make certain associations. The author illustrates how people who are not racist, including blacks, can be unconsciously biased (slightly, but enough to make a difference) against blacks.If you are a police officer, thinking of becoming one or know someone who is, you will find Chapter Six: The Delicate Art of Mind Reading very interesting.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell has written a thought provoking series of essays about cognition. He uses interesting real life stories to illuminate the workings of the human mind. I found them thought provoking and informative.As a physician, I was particularly interested by his description of Goldman's algorithm, which is a simple tool for doctors to determine if someone is having a heart attack. Many writers stumble when they write about medicine, but Gladwell is spot on.Some reviewers have criticized this book as a series of articles rather than a coherent whole. That may be true, but the writing is so good that it doesn't matter. Gladwell is a first rate intellect and a fine writer. You won't go wrong with this read.",
            "A quick easy read with big ideas and great concepts. This and Gladwell's Tipping Point should be on all the high school reading lists. Together, these books would make great graduation gifts.Provides alot of useful insight and forethought.",
            "This book was an easy and fun read. But, more importantly, it gave me new insight on split-second decision making, the pros and the cons, when it works and when it doesn't. I think Mr. Gladwell's next book should be a \"how to\" manual on how to train oneself to make better decisions!",
            "I would love to sit and have a conversation over lunch with Malcolm Gladwell - what an absolutely fascinating fellow. Gladwell's book is full of pointed epigrams that exemplify his theories on decision-making, as he's laid them all out in his book. I quite enjoy his method of telling these stories rather then simply outlining the theories themselves. Blink is a fascinating study in how one makes decisions using intuition and it's certainly quite thought provoking. Though the author does offer several conclusions at the end of his book, I do hope a sequel is in the works, as more of a \"how-to.\" I enjoyed Blink immensely; though I was left at the end wanting a bit more on how one might actually sharpen these skills, being now more aware of them. Absolutely worthwhile reading.",
            "BLINK delves into what many may call intuition and has encouraged me to trust my gut--but not in a blind, I'm-always-right-kind of way. In areas where I have previous experience and know myself well, then my initial reaction may prove to be the most valid one. BLINK's concept of \"thin slicing\" stays with you. If at the end of a good read you can walk away remembering something, just one thing that will influence your future decisions, then I'd say the book and the author did its/his job.",
            "So I read this book on everybody in the world's recommendation and I have to say I was far from impressed. I think most people like this book because it's like sitting back in a bar and shooting the breeze with some buddies. Gladwell, in basically every case he brings up, writes about some case of a successful person and talks about how \"everyone loved him from the first second\" or some other anecdote like that. They're all interesting stories, but the conclusions you can take from this book are little if any. Every single one of these cases involve post-hoc hypotheses, something that is a deal breaker in any scientific community.But he's a good writer. So a fun read. Just take it with a grain of salt.",
            "Next time Malcolm Gladwell writes a book, I will buy it without blinking. I have read his Tipping point and this is his second book I read. I truly respect this author for the way he presents his ideas. Coginitive science is presented in the form of a story book. He debates throughout the book if we should follow our gut-feeling or not. There are times when this have proven right and sometimes it has proven wrong. There are some good examples of how instincts may not be always right : as in sipping Pepsi and deciding if it is better than Coke, listening to one song by an artist and deciding if he is good or bad. There are no conclusions drawn whatsoever. If you are looking at core Cognitive science as in \"science\", then this is not the book for you. This book has more examples than explanation of human behavior.All in all, it is a very light read. I agree with a reviewer who says it leaves you hungry, looking for more than what you read and an explanation of why we do what we do.",
            "The eyes may be the windows into our soul, but facial expressions are apparently good indicators of everything from how likely a marriage is to survive to how likely a suspect is to pull the trigger on his gun. It seems almost intuitive that over-analyzing is counter-productive, but Malcolm Gladwell gives us lots of examples to prove it, including a war game that made me cringe to think that our military really operates this way. Almost as scary is the process of determining how to handle ER patients with chest pain, in which case too much information may actually be misleading information. The author takes several detours, including one at the end that indicates that first impressions are not always valuable, particularly where a gender or racial bias may come into play. The conventional wisdom that women are inferior to men in the brass section of an orchestra is blown to smithereens by blind auditions. Warren Harding was elected President, apparently because he looked the part. Gladwell also points out that often our choices, in everything from speed-dating to music, do not always bear out what we say we like. In fact, we may claim to dislike something just because it's different, but without innovation, where would we be? Thanks heavens market research is sometimes ignored. In the case of New Coke, the taste tests were taken seriously, and they proved to be totally deceptive, since taking a sip of something is a lot different from drinking an entire 12-ounce can.",
            "I believe that the book is very interesting to read, and I enjoyed reading it. The Author, Malcolm Gladwell, brought some interesting studies that discuss human being's inborn ability to determine things beyond common judgment. Gladwell presents diverse studies to show us people's ability of making critical decisions depending on that inborn ability (blink). Although Gladwell elaborates on how snap judgments can be good or bad in our lives, he failed to elaborate on how to differentiate between the good and the bad intuition before making any judgments.The decisions that were made using people's inborn instincts can have negative outcome. For example, Gladwell discusses a case study about Cook County Hospital, which was about curing heart problem patients in a really poor medical environment. He mentioned that 250,000 patients with no medical insurance come through the hospital every year and the hospital does not have enough man power and resources to cure all those patients properly. The interesting part is that the doctors in hospital were treating patients using their gut feeling with minimal laboratory help, which gives totally inaccurate results and could lead to someone's death. These experts are able to make such decisions because they have been doing the same kind of treatment with different people for years, and their judgment is probably more than just intuitive. Their little mistake can cost a persons life. At the same time, Gladwell discusses on how snap judgments can be bad. In cases of racial prejudice for example, the cops who shot Amadou Diallo were shooting an unarmed man who at first glance looked liked a criminal to them. Since there is no way of knowing what out instinct tells us is wrong or right, it is better to not make snap decision and react towards it.On the other hand, blink of an eye decision can make you do the right decision. For example, on the Getty Statue case, Hoving knew that the statue was not genuine as soon as he saw it while the scientists wasted 15 months to figure it out. At the same time, General Paul Van Riper defeat his opposing team in the war using his instinct while his enemies were using satellites to fight against him. Even though intuition can lead you to a good decision, after all it is just a gut feeling and there in no way to answer why we felt that way and there is no way of knowing if it is correct. If you can not explain why you felt that way then there is no reason why someone should believe on what you have to say.Finally, after reading the book, it is clear that blink judgment can be useful and/or wasteful. Gladwell failed to point out on how to differentiate between the good and bad snap judgments. The book left me hanging with questions like; how could somebody know if the judgment about to make is good or bad? How can you make a distinction between good and bad snap judgments?",
            "In the book, Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, written by Malcolm Gladwell, he focuses on the subconscious mind and the decisions we make. Throughout the book, he utilizes several examples and statistics that support his theories on why people make decisions the way they do. His main focus points are about thin slicing and snap decisions, all in which addict the way we think about a person, object or an event.Gladwell discusses thin slicing, which is that our unconscious minds have the ability to recognize and asses people and situations very quickly and accurately, all within a matter of seconds. This is created by an individual's body language, gestures and facial expressions. Gladwell states that people can formulate ideas even before talking to someone and make an accurate assumption of who they are or what they are really feeling.Following thin slicing, he discusses snap decisions, which is the ability to thin slice situations to make correct judgments. How this is done is by taking control of our snap judgments. We must analyze the situation before letting our unconscious mind trigger. Sure, this may be difficult, but it is necessary to practice so that snap judgments are not made. We must ensure that our presumptions and biases do not control the way we think, for they can lead us to incorrect information and judgments. Finally, if a person has too much information it can cloud their mind and impair their judgment. They must focus on the current situation and make the best decision possible.I found Blink a very easy to read and would recommend this book to other readers. Gladwell provided some great examples that supported his theories. This book really made me sit back and think about my previous judgments I have made in my past about people and situations I have been. Such as when I was working for Enterprise Rent-A-Car, we had to underwrite every customer to ensure they were qualified to rent a car. When some individuals walked through the door, I found myself immediately judging them about whether or not they were going to qualify. Sometimes my judgments were correct and other times I was proven wrong. There were times where very professional looking men and women have came in and I thought for sure they were going to qualify, but they were renting with a debit card or trying to rent on cash and did not have any bills or pay stubs to verify employment and residency, so unfortunately they did not qualify. Also, there were times when people came in their pajamas looking like they had not showered in days and they were the ones who qualified. It just goes to show that one person should never make snap judgments. They must analyze the person or situation first and then make a judgment. Overall, I do agree with Gladwell, but I do feel that your first instinctive judgment may not always be the best and most accurate.",
            "This book could have been 200 pages, but instead, as modern authors seem to do, Gladwell felt compelled to make it much longer than it needed to be. This really is a good book, but Gladwell was on the verge of a great book. He provides an interesting topic with great commentary and thought. He ruins it with 2 things: 1) the unnecessary length 2) he doesn't go into \"why\" thin slicing is from a neuro-psychological standpoint. Effectivel, he tells us \"this\" is the case and gives some evidence ot support his claim. If you are going to this kind of commentary, write an article, no a book.If it sounds as though my opinion is mixed, it is. This book could have been truely phenomenal, but the books failings have me thinking of giving it 3 stars. More detail was necessary for some of the great examples he gave, and all of the uselessm uninformative chatter between points needs cutting out.",
            "It seems like a lot of reviews have spent a lot of time bemoaning what \"Blink\" isn't. It isn't a self-help guide that will teach you \"how to harness the power of thin slicing to win at business, cards, love, and the stock market\" which it seems is what a lot of Americans are looking for. To me - it seems more like an examination of the fact that we've become so data driven in the workforce that we've lost some of the balance between informed decisions based on data and 'gut feel.' I would also say that Gladwell didn't lay out a map of \"this is how you, too, can thin slice\" because it would be different for each of us depending on background, experience, the purpose we wish to achieve, etc. etc. etc. Instead - it's a personal responsibility to think about the ways that you make decisions and ways that you may be overwhelming yourself with data rather than doing something that comes naturally.Overall - I enjoyed the book for what it was and it made me spend time thinking about the different ways that I make decisions. I found the examples interesting - but maybe that's because I'm an Army officer that works in the medical field that has a car salesman for a father (all of these play a role in the book). It seems to wander a little at times and not all of the examples seem relevant to me, though.",
            "Again Malcolm Gladwell uses his considerable talent for insights to look at the way in which we make decisions. His questions are when we should trust our intuition and when not, why we should sometimes trust our intuition and how we can make our intuition more trustworthy. The book is called 'blink' because intuitive decisions happen in the 'blink' of an eye.The book is well argued, though from time to time connecting the dots becomes confusing, as Malcolm Gladwell tends to jump from topic to topic and only in the end brings some rhythm and rhyme to it.His fundamental message is that snap decisions can be correct but only if based on experience or training. E.g. experts can make correct snap decisions but if you are not an expert, you should not trust snap decisions.What Malcolm Gladwell does in this book is to spell out clearly what fundamentally was known but was rarely spelled out. E.g. a good chess player is also at 1 minute chess better than an average chessplayer, because his snap decisons are based on experience. And a professional race car driver is certainly better than me at carting.Yet though the result of his analysis is correct, the question remains whether his reasoning is correct. Is it simply that the expert can draw on such a wealth of data intuitively that he can make a better decision? Or is it that the expert can see more clearly what is relevant and what is not relevant? In chess (an example which Gladwell does not use) the expert clearly can more easily dismiss branches of the decisiontree which the average player does not so rapidly dismiss. This matters, as some of the situations Gladwell describes require the decisionmaker to focus on the relevant details, while other situations like the described police situation, requires the decider to consider a very broad range of input.And some of the examples he gives are not very relevant or too anecdotal to really matter. Is the Pepsi test really news? And the people who judged correctly from a very short video (or was it a photo) of a dorm room the character of the student - against which measure was their impression judeged? Was there a panel of jurors who declared that this student would be deemed unrelaibale on a scale from 1 to six and the snap judgement was tested against this?In any case, a readable and recommendable book with significant weaknesses.",
            "This book really grabbed my attention in the first few pages with its description of an art forgery, but things really slowed down about a third of the way into the book. The only other part that was really interesting to me was Gladwell's description of John Gottman's research with couples. That's about it. Most of the other examples were down right boring. I found myself looking at how many pages I had left. Worst of all, after finishing the book, I had no idea what the point of it was. Gladwell spends the first half of the book explaining why we should trust our gut instinct, but spends the last half demonstrating how our gut instinct can be wrong. I had to read almost 300 pages for that?",
            "Blink by Malcolm Gladwell: just seems to be a collection of ideas or small conversations, meaningless in themselves. The book starts out well but loses continuity, the conclusion of choice \"skip this book\". I haven't read \"the Tipping Point\" but if \"Blink\" is any indication of of the reading I would skip it too.",
            "What an easy and enjoyable read. Learning to trust your gut, everyone does it but now you know why. The conversational tone of the book makes you feel like you are having a chit chat with Malcolm. Great book.",
            "Several of the serious criticisms of this book are well-founded, but it also has several extraordinary virtues, not the least of which is superb writing. Others have reasonably criticized the book for its lack of coherence, but Gladwell is a journalist and not a thinker. What did you expect? Personally, I found the thesis, or theses, of this book, for there are several, much more compelling than the single thesis of The Tipping Point, which is really just a mathematical construct applied arbitrarily to a number of disparate real-world situations with have entirely different dynamics. Nonetheless I enjoyed that book for one of the main reasons I enjoyed this one: for its engaging writing about human behaviour.Blink, though, offers us a number of important, insightful, but disjunctive perspectives on human decision making. The title is catchy, no doubt, and probably sold more books than \"The Vagaries of Human Decision Making\" would have, but the many critical reviews found here (which themselves are likely to significantly affect, not only the book's sales, but its enduring reputation) show that the title is both inappropriate and misleading, and if it was the publisher's choice, crammed down the author's throat, Gladwell might want to think seriously about getting a different publisher, or better, publishing the book himself - who needs publishers these days, anyway?This book would have been worth publishing just for the sake of bringing John Gottman's research to the attention of the general public, or Paul Ekman's (the expert on human facial expressions). In fact this book contains the seeds of many potentially important books, and it also cries out for a true intellectual synthesis of all of this provocative, and often contradictory evidence of how we make up our minds at many different levels. Gladwell is not the man to deliver on such projects, but so what? I am very glad that he has given us what he has.My principal criticism of the book, echoing another reviewer (and the reason I give it only 4 stars), is that many of the summaries of the scientific studies are too superficial, and leave unaswered too many critical questions which would occur to the intelligent, or scientifically literate reader. It's nearly always a mistake to write down to your audience. Isaac Asimov, in his 100+ scientific books, proved that even the driest and most complex material can be made absorbing to anyone who is likely ever to read a serious non-fiction book sometime in his adult life. And Gladwell is twice the writer Asimov was. But, for whatever reason, Gladwell has given us in many places content-light, and again, I suspect the hand of his mass-market publisher, shaping this talented and impressionable writer and journalist into a mere entertainer, and not steering him instead towards greater rigor, and significance.",
            "The author is smart enough to pen down ( and cash in ) what we already know...to trust our instincts. The first and the second last chapters are definitely an interesting read. In between these two chapters all he does is to narrate examples of supposedly( i havent heard of any of these people) famous people on how they trusted their 2-second snap decisions / judgements. The author has made very little attempt to give any sort of insight on how our instincts really work. I must agree with one reader that its like going through psychology 101. The only part I truly enjoyed reading was the piece of information on autism.All said , I must admit the author did a good job in collecting data and he sure knows how to write. I have no doubt we will see more of his books in future .......lets just hope he writes something better.Buy this book when the price drops to 5 bucks.",
            "I felt that the author skipped around quite a bit in the story. Part of the book was like Marketing 101. I was disappointed.",
            "Although the Author does not use these exact words, the book is all about how your Intuition, Sixth sense or \"thin slicing\" (as the author puts it) plays important role in our day to day snap decisions and also about how to guard against mis-reading your Intution.The author enumerates this power with numerous examples ... for example ... how some experts can tell whether the marriage will survive based on just few minutes of interactions between the pairs ... how some folks can tell whether double fault is going to occur by just observing the beginning of the serve ... how some folks were able to tell that a statue was fake by just one brief glance.Additionally, the author enumerates different examples where \"thin slicing\" fails. He analyses and presents information which can help one from getting into the trap.At times the chapter gets long and obvious, in such situations once you get the essence of the subject, you may want to just skim over some of the chapters .Overall my take away was ... in times of quick action, do try to listen to what your gut tells. Don't totally rely on noise or so called facts that are being bombarded at you.Definitely worth reading ... at least once :-)-Sachin",
            "What I love most about all these reviews available in Amazon is that many diverge from the book appraised and those diversion have led me to some wonderful books: \"The Bamboo Chest\"! Thank you to \"Tome\" for your other recommendation. It's a great accompaniament to \"Blink\"! While \"The Bamboo Chest\" is more backed up by declassified documents from the Defense Intelligence Agency and the State Department and excellent writing style(catch some of those gems!), \"Blink\" is carried along by the strength of the vignettes and the author's clear understanding of a very innate (and important!) ability: interesting how even on this review list how much those belief patterns we all have, whether in favour or against, have defined the direction of the review. Such is the controversy of books like \"Blink\" and \"The Bamboo Chest\": I say get the book, read it and if you don't like it, as I've experienced with other books purchased from Amazon, resell it. But for this book, for what it delivers I say get it and keep it, refer to it as your life experience changes!",
            "Gladwell begins with a story about a supposed Greek statue that some experts, using scientific testing, could not detect as a fruad, while others were immediately suspicious. (So, some people look at the forest for immediate clues, before examining the trees in detail.)Another example involved a single tennis expert with an uncanny knack of foretelling when someone was about to double-fault. (The bad news is that he could not relate how this was done. Thus, what this proves is beyound me.)Still another revolved around an officer playing a \"rogue MidEast commander\" vs. the regular Army. Anyone who has been in government knows that it moves at glacial speed, and can easily be outdone by much smaller groups with a modicum of intelligence and speed (eg. Lockheed's \"Skunk Works,\" and Burt Rutan's \"space ship.\"). So the rogue officer's success is hardly suprising.To say that quick decisions - based on a few KEY VARIABLES - is better than studied analyses that include a multitude of minor issues is hardly surprising either. (And then there's the chapter on \"Action Without Thought\" - the Reality of Executive Behavior\" within \"Executive Intelligence\" by Justin Menkes providing examples that demoan the lack of thinking by business leaders.)Finally, readers need to keep in mind that there will always be statistical abberations - eg. someone who correctly predicts the flip of a coin 50 times in a row. However, that does not prove that they have any special talent, and they are just as likely to be wrong as right on the next toss.Similarly, finding snap judgements superior to supposedly sophisticated statistical models does not necessarily support a conclusion supporting snap judgements - many statistical models are poorly specified and have embarrasingly large errors.Not worth reading.",
            "I really wanted to like this book. I was excited when I bought it. But the book doesn't deliver.The stories are interesting in the sense you could use them as material for small talk. Yet, I finished the book with no idea of what was the point. And that's not good. The book goes on and on with examples and explanations but not once gives you an idea on how to improve your snap judgments. If you are looking for that kind of info don't buy this book. Maybe the author is planning to teach that in his next book? I'd never buy it *blink*",
            "Since reading the Tipping Point couple of months ago I became a big fan of Malcom Gladwell and have sent the book as a birthday gift to at least 5 people. I mention this just to worn you that I am a little biased.Gladwell is extremely good at simplifying common phenomena, which is usually known by many but is usually too complex to describe. He is also a master in gluing you to his books. He does this through the number of case studies each of which is a mini course in its field.The part that liked most was the case study about the pentagon's war game. It is a crash course in leadership and team management which is very very informative and entertaining at the same time.",
            "Blink is a great book. This book talks about how we make snap judgments about people and the things that surrounds us. He proposes an idea and supports it with many peer-reviewed research. He does raise questions and provoke the reader to ponder on the issues raised and come up with his or her own conclusion. What amazes me the most about him is that all the ideas in this book is about finding ways to improve our society as a whole. I strongly believe that he is a another version of President Obama that wants to help and improve society as a whole. There is more to this book that will make you step back and think about some of the issues affecting our society today. You must read this book!",

            "According to the theory of this book, people make internal judgements by \"thin-slicing\" in a mere 2 seconds. Sound doubtful? In theory, it makes sense. In practice, I personally think it depends on the situation, and cannot be simplified in the \"Blink\" of an eye. Time will tell, as more research is done, using a larger sampling group.Arlene Millmanauthor of \"Boomerang - A Miracle Trilogy\" and\"Forever Love and More, Encore\"",
            "I really love a good story, and the stories in this book were fascinating, especially since you weren't sure where each one was going. So much food for thought-- you may just read it in a few days, but spend weeks thinking about it (or telling your husband about it over and over...). Great!",
            "There's not much substance to this book. Rather than being a resource of information, it is merely a book of examples. There is no broad takeaway you can gather from it after reading except to say perhaps that many of our decisions are based on split-second thoughts. But did you really need to read this book to find that out?",
            "This book could probably be anywhere from a 1/3rd to a 1/4th as big as it is; if not a pamphlet. Maybe the 2d star I gave it is too altruistic. But I will credit it with a few good points.For what it purports to write about, it's WAY WAY too heavily larded down with minutiae and details to the point of the reader starting to doze off, break concentration from Gladwell's aggregate point, or both. Gladwell really needs to take a course on/in brevity.As much as I tried to give it a chance in spite of what the coverflap said of who the author's written for, I can understand why he writes for them and why they hired him.Definitely near the bottom of my list of recommends.",
            "I've loved reading Malcolm Gladwell's writing in the New Yorker for years. Standouts include \"Clicks and Mortar\" about internet shopping and \"Big and Bad\" about SUVs. In his usual fashion, BLINK draws from a broad range of sources and studies to help us understand the world we live in and our own role within it. I suggest you buy this book and keep it on your nightstand. Read it little by little and allow the chapters to sink in slowly. If you're like me, you'll be amazed at what you begin to observe in your daily life. Gladwell's gift is not so much inventing new ideas, but rather in putting ideas together and allowing us to see what was there all along.",
            "I bought this book because the introductory story about the Statue That Didn't Look Right fasinated me.The author's propositions are that:1. Decisions made very quickly can be as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.2. Our unconscious is a powerful force.3. Our snap judgements and first impressions can be educated and control.This book was organized in such a way that the rest of the chapters after the introduction were devoted to proving that the three propositions really work. Psychological tests and theories, including the \"thin slicing\", were brought in to support them.But can I rely on my instinct every time I make a decision? NO!! According to the author, snap decision can turn out to be wrong as well.So what I gained from reading this book was almost nothing. The book stops short of telling me how to harness my snap decisions so that they are right most of the time. And that is no surpise. I don't expect anyone can tell me that.Is it entertaining to read? Only the Introduction is. The rest, that is devoted on psychological stuff, is boring.",
            "Fantastic - a clear, concise view of how part of our mind and perception works. One of the top twenty non-fiction, insight/personal development books I have ever read.",
            "Gladwell's Blink offers some interesting ancedotes about rapid decision making. He offers a few cautions as well, but the tone of the book implies that rapid decisions are more trustworthy than considered reflection.While there is some discussion of marketing manipulations and stereotyping, I was hoping for more discussion of the tricks the mind plays on one -- heuristics that lead to reasoning errors, confirmation bias, and the large numbers of eyewitness ID errors among the DNA exoneration cases.While the book is thought provoking, it may be better read in combination with material on the perils of reflexive decision making.",
            "Hey Malcolm, way to go! great book! couldn't put it down.. and it's not too often i say that about a non fiction book!.. you've got some interesting phrases - ways of putting together words unique to you that put smiles on my face... okay this is one i can recommend to all those stodgy left brainer-do it by the book people i work with, though i have no idea if they will \"get it\" after reading it or no..... I'm one of those intuitive people that 'gets stuff' but cannot explain why i 'just know' to others.. such a delight to read your book.. thank you!! :)",
            "Fascinating read. The concept is presented through easy-to-read, engaging stories on a wide range of topics from marriage to war strategy to art. The author presents both the benefits and pitfalls of our unconscious reactions in relation to decision making.",
            "I gave it four stars because I did like the book - but it can be a little tedious to read. As previous reviews have stated, each chapter does have a theme - but the theme is usually a mere framework for a set of results from an experiment, incident or story, some of which are a little boring.When you review everything you have read at the end of the book, you realize that the point each chapter makes does feed into a bigger overall understanding of how split second decisions are made and how much our subconscious is in control when we just get a \"feeling\" about something immediately. Then it examines how other elements can affect the accuracy of the split second decision.Overall, I think this was a good read.",
            "A very interesting and clever book. We know more than we might think when it comes to making judgments. Malcolm Gladwell provides excellent examples of how we can improve our decision making by paying more attention to our intuitive side. He's not suggesting that information gathering and research be ignored, only that we also consider the benefits to be derived from learning and making decsions in a different way. His examples are fascinating and the book's long term high ranking is well deserved. It's a hard book to put down.",
            "This is a very good book. (Sorry to repeat myself...) I really appreciate the other side of the coin. Thinking has been drilled into my head and I tend to totally ignore anything else. If it isn't a fact that I can define, it can't be not real or true. But there is some value in intuition. Some things are under the radar of our thought, (and should be, or we'd be overwhelmed), but they can be important. Intuition is our way of communicating that to ourselves.This book has gotten some criticism - of course people should think. But there has not been much written on the power of intuition. When a person is knowledgeable about a subject, and they feel like something is wrong, they should trust, or at least acknowledge and respect that feeling. You can't just trust your intuition (make a guess) and go with it if you don't know anything about the thing you are \"guessing\" about. But if you do know about something, say you are an expert on US Currency (or someone who handles money alot), and you see a $20 bill that something seems wrong, should you act on that instinct, or do you say - \"I can't see anything specifically wrong with it, so it must be ok.\"? If you were a foreigner, and came to the US, and looked at a $20 bill and said - something seems wrong about this, of course you can't go with that feeling, because you don't know anything about a $20 bill.Anyways, read the book. It's worth it.",
            "This book is a great buy and the seller is very good. Lightning fast shipping.",
            "Gladwell offers an intriguing look at how the subconscious or intuition of a person works in different situations, as well as how it can be trained and the importance of sometimes taking a step back before acting on a situation. This is a relatively quick read with some intriguing ideas offered in it. If you like this book, you may find it useful to track down some of the writings by people he references as they go into more depth than Gladwell does.",
            "Blink by Malcolm Gladwell is subtitled The Power of Thinking Without Thinking. Because that pretty much summarizes my life, I decided to read it even though it's an \"intellectual\" book and I usually steer away from too much heavy reading. I'm glad I made an exception.Blink had my attention from the beginning. Gladwell has assembled interesting vignettes from normal worldly life and used them to illustrate his point about the value and dangers of making snap judgments. He doesn't advise us to discard all cognitive reasoning or experience as background for coming to a decision, but he points to many past decisions that could have been better if reams of information, scientific facts, and expert opinions had been ignored. Thin slices of experience, as opposed to lengthy studies or long periods of familiarization, often produce more satisfying and productive decisions.Gladwell presents many examples of better decisions through snap judgments. A quick analysis of couples by observers produced a higher accuracy rating in the chances of their marriages making it as opposed to lengthy studies of their compatibility, small talk patterns, and body language. A singer's music CD inadvertently fell into the hands of the co-president of a large record company who loved it and passed it around. The singer's success was almost immediate because he was thin-sliced by top executives who knew and liked good music and knew how to promote it. But then market research firms published opinions by mainstream listeners from around the country who found him lacking and unlikely to find a core audience or to gain significant radio air-play. People who had never seen him, and only listened to a couple of his songs, completely stalled his career.Large symphony orchestras, traditionally mostly male, have improved their performance by hiring females who audition from behind screens, masking their sex. Innovative military commanders who rely on experience and seat-of-the-pants decisions have regularly trounced better prepared forces with superior equipment and manpower.Gladwell points out that all is not good with this technique if some fundamental safeguards are not applied. Four police officers in the dark entrance of a Bronx tenement pumped 41 shots into a scared and unarmed Guinea immigrant. When heart rates go up, cognitive reasoning goes down, according to Gladwell. Only seven seconds passed from the time the officers first saw the victim, called out to him, thought they saw a gun, pulled their guns and fired 41 shots into him. Quick decisions were made with fatal results. Mind-reading abilities were probably impaired by elevated heart rates causing a series of misjudgments to be made.I highly recommend this book for a look into the world of decisions. We have to make them every day and we have to live with those made by others. Gladwell presents a well-researched study that is fascinating.",
            "This book is excellent on the discovery of how the subconcious works, and can work for you. It is an interesting exploration. It also compares \"intuition\" with more obvious forms of over-analyzation, which our culture is taken over by. A real heads-up to what is going on around you.",
            "A fascinating book, but as others have pointed out too many of the ideas here rely on anecdotal information. I got the feeling after a while that the author cherry-picked the stories he wanted to tell in order to bolster his thesis, and that another researcher could just as easily have formed a different thesis about decision making by selecting different stories.Another thing about this book that struck me, as odd, was the author's obsession with a person's appearance, particularly whether the person was short or tall. Some of the descriptions are as follows.P22, 'he is short and very charming'P49, `he is a small and irrepressible man'P61, `a tall, striking woman'P73, `his bigness of frame'P87, `who is both on the short side - five foot nine - and black'P99, `is tall and lean with a gleaming bald dome'P132, `is a tall man with a runner's slender build'P148, `is very tall and strikingly handsome'P190, `He was short and unassuming'P197, `He was short and thick'P202, `although he is of medium build, he seems much larger'P251, `is tiny'Seldom does the person's size matter to the thesis about decision making that the author presents. Even in the last example where a woman musician is described as `tiny', Gladwell admits that her size ought not to determine whether she is hired to play the French horn. Yet throughout the book he includes a person size as though it has some importance to his argument. This just struck me as perverse, and I wondered at his 'decision' for including this mostly useless information.",
            "Like someone allready said, it's a bunch of stories with no conclusion to it (and yes there even is a conclusion chapter.. but guess what.. it's another story)",
            "This review will be brief, but decisive. Like the \"blink\" - the book's namesake.blink - refers to the first few seconds (really two seconds) or less - moments really - in which split-second decisions are made. Often life and death decisions. Often decisions which are - by their nature - most often based on preconceptions, prejudice, prejudgment, or ingrained - evolved - subconscious beliefs, stereotypes, and conditioning.The book, through several cases or examples, explores split-second decision making. Decision making when you are pressed. Decision making under great uncertainty - where all the facts are not known and you don't have time to get to know them. Decision making when you don't have time to reason - or to consciously really thinks out.It is about how time constraints impact decisions. How they impact the quality of the decisions.Where all you really have is your \"intuition\". Which is often right, but is also often wrong.Through a case study-type analysis, Malcolm Gladwell, a brilliant thinker and writer - an original and ground breaking thinker - explores the issues related to these split-second or less than split-second decisions.If are interested in learning about the brain, decisions, and human psychology and sociology, then I highly recommend this book. If you are not interested in any of the foregoing, but want to see a brilliant thinker and writer in action (Malcolm Gladwell), then I urge you to buy and read \"blink\".",
            "Here the author of the groundbreaking, \"The Tipping Point,\" has again \"tapped into\" an underlying human ability of the mind to do amazing things, that upon first impressions appears all but impossible -- or at the very least, highly improbable. This book is filled with anecdotes (from the arts, psychology, statistics, business, and everyday life) of \"analyses at a glimpse\" (that the author refers to as \"thin slicing\"), which turn out to be almost as good as detailed, longer-term, more in depth analyses.This human ability to perform instantaneous \"background mental processing\" is presented here as if it is not just special, but also uncanny and even mysterious, and indeed it is. More appropriately, it is human pattern recognition analysis, an acutely human ability which has evolved in man over eons and in parallel with his ability to reason and to become conscious of his own actions, and thus to be able \"to preview\" things in his conscious environment before they happen. As a result of \"being conscious\", the human brain has had to learn to process prodigious amounts of information at the subconscious level in the background.One of the most obvious of these abilities (of these formidable background calculations) is the ability of humans to recognize each other by facial characteristics, which although we humans take it for granted, as a formal scientific process, is exceedingly difficult. Scientists have discovered, for instance, that babies as young as only a few days old can distinguish between their parents and others. So, clearly, this ability must have tremendous survival value.But also, if one remembers some of Picasso's \"minimalist sketches,\" of Shakespeare, (and there are equally famous computer-generated ones of Einstein and Abe Lincoln, and Marilyn Monroe, in addition to the famous bard) traced out of no more than five or six disconnected lines, the image of these famous icons emerge with unexpected but unmistakable clarity. Picasso, obviously is using the brain of a highly sensitive master artist; in the latter case, the computers are using \"computer generated algorithms,\" which by all calculations, is a crude approximation to what Picasso does. Those who have studied pattern recognition analysis and are already familiar with these minimalist iconic images know that they are the result of sophisticated data compression techniques (mostly complexly manipulated Fourier Transforms coupled with other information reduction algorithms). They also know how difficult it is to create algorithms to reproduce these precise images as a formal scientific process.In my own work many years ago at the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), among other problems, I used similar data compression techniques to distinguish between the seismic signatures of earthquakes and nuclear explosions. The objective of course was to develop an algorithm (or a set of algorithms) that preserved the maximum amount of discriminatory information that could be used to separate the signatures of the two phenomena with a high degree of reliability, and of course using the minimum amount of information. In most cases, algorithms that even approach the skill of humans at recognizing such patterns, to the extent they exist at all, are very, very complex indeed.Thus, as was the case with \"The Tipping Point\" (in which non-linear processes having points of discontinuities readily explained by Rene Thom's Calculus of Catastrophe Theory), again it seems that the mystery here, can also be explained thorough the formal scientific process of \"Pattern Recognition Analysis.\"But this revelation of the mystery makes this book no less interesting or less important. Again, Gladwell is on to something. Five Stars",
            "Malcolm Gladwell does a tremendous job of explaining \"the power of thinking without thinking.\" Mr. Gladwell presents the evidence for his thesis like a well prepared trial lawyer would present a case. It it obvious Malcolm investigated thoroughly the concepts presented in the book.Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking",
            "I was fascinated by the beginning of this book. Gladwell did a good job of bringing me in. I really enjoyed learning about how the brain works and processes information before we consciously recognize what we have seen. When he started his social agenda and race issues I had to force myself to finish the book. At the end of the book I felt like I was reading something from an angry citizen who felt that police officers were out to get the minority population. He should have stopped the book 100 pages sooner.",
            "I got the book because of the number of reviews. I started reading it and I didn't get the first part so I continue until I got to the middle. Nothing special.

I don't know if I need to get to the end to really understand the value of the book but currently in the middle of it I am bored and I don't want to continue. So I decided to stop and got another book. I hope I am wrong and I hope there is something else that I am missing. Maybe I will give it another try later this year but currently I am very disappointed with this book.",
            "There's very little substance here. The basic idea is laid out in the early chapters and most of the rest of the book are anecdotal examples. It is interesting and well-written, however; even if a rather superficial. Keep in mind also: the author has no credentials in psychology, neurobiology, or any other science. I believe he's a journalist.Overall, \"Blink\" is pretty lightweight stuff: good if you're stuck on a plane or need easy bed-time reading. Not for the serious reader, thought.Not recommended.",
            "The premise behind this book is to enable/train the reader to learn how to \"thin slice\" a person or situation and gain \"instant knowledge\" with very little input. The author goes on and on about various examples of how many people were able to do this. However, that's not exactly what is going on. In the first example, he uses a story about a statue that one muesuem bought that turned out to be a fake. Several experts were able to just look at the statue and get a \"feeling\" or a \"strong sense\" that it was a fake. They couldn't explain how they knew, they just knew. This is what the author wants you to be able to tap into.The reason that these experts were able to do that is because they are EXPERTS! The know what to look for instinctively. It's like an inspector examining something in their off time. They know what to look for. I have a friend who loves movies. He really enjoys pointing out the dot in the upper right corner of a movie. He tells me that they come in pairs all the time. Guess what....he is in the movie production industry. That is how he knows.Chapter 5 is more than thin slicing. It is more along the lines of thick slicing. It totally goes against the whole premise of the book. Why would an author stick something in there that doesn't support his basic idea?The nice part is that this book leads the reader to real material. You can look up the refereneces for some real reading. The author mentions Dr. Paul Ekman. Great stuff there!Also, the book is a very easy read. It is a fun read. It gives enough information that you feel like you did read something, but it is definitely nothing that I would reference in real work.",
            "If you want to be enlightened or entertained by this book like I did, you will be sadly disappointed. According to Malcolm, we must strive to rid ourselves of the horrible limiting stereotypes we have of African Americans and females, etc. However, while it is important that we do that, it is still okay to stereotype individuals experiencing Autism. In fact, he shares a few based on one study with one individual experiencing autism and expects the reader to be as ignorant of the subject as he is.",
            "I didn't finish blink, made it two-thirds of the way through. The whole premise is stupid to me, and the most bothersome part is that while the author tosses around buzz terms like thin slicing and this so-called built in ability to laser through the troublesome act of actually reflecting on a comprehensive picture, he never really touches on the fact that 9 out of 10 of his examples are the result of expert ability based on 20+ years of dedication to the respective discipline, or riding on the shoulders of the equally applied efforts of someone else. And what really bothers me is how many people flock to this *&% as this wonderful new way of thinking. I made it as far as I did because the anecdotes are entertaining, but c'mon gimme a break, and jeesh.",

I, however, have not only read it, but I have been pushing the ideas in Blink on my Advanced Placement students for several years now. The main principle is directed toward having students believe that they know the answers better than their neighbor on tests. They have to believe that and then prove it to themselves. Many have reported amazing progress in taking tests and knowing that they know answers. I am grateful every day for Malcolm Gladwell.

This is not a teaching tool by any means, but just a series of examples provided to show that there is more that meets the eye than what we see on the surface. From thin slicing to Listening with your eyes, this book skims over the first two seconds of first impressions. And that is fascinating!!If you're interested in why things work out the way they do, this book is it. Remember the New Coke campaign? It goes into details here about first impressions and other group studies about the campaign that flopped. Gladwell even writes of Kenna, a semi-famous but very talented singer who just doesn't quite make it on the radio waves. There's the statue story of where just about everyone believed they had the real thing on their hands, but to find out it was a forgery long after they've spent millions of dollars on this \"find.\" Gladwell takes these stories and dissect them bit by bit and talks about the unconcious. He explains why some of these people have a nagging feeling that something isn't \"quite right\" and how they've stumbled onto the answers that eventually proved their points.This book also explains how economics and marketing come into play as well, why some campaigns fail and why others succeed. It even attempts to explain why some athletes are more successful than others. There's even a chapter on why people pick people to be their CEOs or even their president (Warren Harding is used as an example). It is just purely fascinating and interesting! Definitely worth a read!It is a guaranteed conversation starter for any get-together! If you like nonfiction and psychology, you'll like this one!5-14-07",
            "This book was a terrific summer read. You need time to read it...and then re read it. Then to really think about it and begin to use it.I have referenced it several times during the winter. I read it last summer and finally broke down and bought my own copy recently since I had referenced it so often.Loved it.",
            "The idea is that with the correct knowledge base experts can \"thin-slice\" data to come to a determination about the authenticity of a piece of art, read the dynamics between married couples to determine survival rates and determine market share for products based on consumer data.This is an incredible read. Very quick. Educational and entertaining.Interestingly enough, when I read it my take on it was that everyone can learn to \"thin-slice\". But like another reviewer, a friend of mine who read it thought that the book showed you that you need to be an expert before you can \"thin-slice\" otherwise you are relying on faulty intuition.I think your conclusion about \"thin-slicing\" is based on your perceptions of how data can be boiled down to a quick judgement whether you are an expert or not.Absolutely fascinating!",
            "How many people have told you to trust your gut? So many that it probably got annoying after a while, especially when you had to make a very important decision and thought your gut was unreliable. This book explains when to trust your gut and when not to. It's fascinating and Malcolm Gladwell does a great job of weaving fun and relevant examples into the text in order to make his point. The only problem with it is that, just as you are convinced that your gut is your therapist, best friend and the greatest advice-giver ever, you read the final few chapters of the book that warn about trusting your gut when you are biased or have a prior experience that throws your gut off and skews your decision-making ability. This can be confusing and might leave some people back at square one asking - is my gut right or is it biased and therefore unreliable? Still, it's worth reading. It's way better than the book that came after it - THINK. You must give this book to every slow decision-maker in your life. They'll thank you for it.",
            "This book is very enjoyable and explains how we subconsciously \"think\" and react. It shows that some subconscious processes with a \"thin slice\" of data are more accurate than if done consciously with more data! Of course there is a dark side to \"thin slicing\" which is when it prejudges based on society's rules/actions. That is why he emphasizes that it takes practice to harness this power.",

            "after reading this book, i was much more aware of facial expressions and subtleties of movement, and much more trusting of first impressions and intuitions. i have a background in western philosophy, and i've been taught that (from the platonic tradition) feelings are not to be trusted without careful examination. this book gave examples of instances in which feelings outpreform careful examination, and even that careful examination can lead a person astray. this was a radically new idea for me - or at least the evidence pointed to a radically new conclusion than i'd thought. it was highly enjoyable, and sparked good discussion with a friend who was also reading the book.after reading this book, i started going to play \"the village\", which is a role-playing game like mafia. it's a game played with a group of 8 or more people, and one or two of these is randomly assigned to be a \"werewolf\". noone but the werewolf knows her status, and the group is trying to figure out who it is. it's a really fun game!i found that i was more in touch with my intuition, and found that if i paid attention to people and listened carefully, i would get an idea of who the werewolf is - my first instinct was usually right.the reason it gets 4 stars and not 5 is because i think it has a bit of a pro-market, pro-consumption perspective. since i read it a few months ago, i can't remember exactly where that bias is, but i was left with it. i also recall that some of the experiments that the book describes seem to have little flaws. for example i remember one gambling experiment with different colored chips or cards, and the conclusion was that the people knew subconsciously that one color led to good results (tested by monetering heart rate, blood pressure, etc), and the other to bad results. what the experiment leaves out is that maybe one color is more appealing than the other, and this is the cause of the difference in response, or maybe one color was always put on the right hand side, etc... anyway, the experiement could have been done switching up the \"desirable color\", but this wasn't mentioned or addressed in the book.",
            "This book reinforced some views that seem to be common sense, but it's nice to see some science behind it. The people in the world who are the best at what they do, often can't tell you why they do things they way they do...it just comes naturally.I've been able to use some of the concepts here at my workplace to be mroe efficient. Good stuff.",
            "This book was recommended from a friend who enjoys reading sociology books. Since we have that in common, I looked into borrowing this from the library. The library only had an audiobook so I just rented it. The book has very curious scenarios and focuses on the fact that American's overvalue logic & undervalue the subconscious, but possibly more reliable judgements that we make. It had great examples with research that sparked the curiousity: why Coke's sip test fails though people do prefer it to Pepsi, why U2's music took so long to be played on the radio (phone tallies said it didn't have what it should, but that method gives the wrong impression of a song). My problem with it was actually the author's voice. His inflection was good, but his tone was dull. He didn't sound like a boring college professor, but his voice is one without much variance and it could fade into the background easily or sooth you to sleep. I wish I could have gotten my hands on the book... (but I don't have money in the budget for purchasing the numerous books I'd like to read right now). Maybe I will someday.",
            "A talented writer can make any topic interesting and Gladwell is definitely that. However, in comparison to Tipping Point it pales in the revelatory value of the science. So, it is a good read but I expected more from this author.",

            "Like The Tippng Point, Blink presents an interesting perspective on the movers and shakers in today's society.

It's a little long on detail and a little thicker than necessary, yet provides that helpful nudge most of us need to get back to trusting our own instincts and initial gut reactions to decisions about our own futures, people we've just met, large /small purchase decisions and anything else that presents us with either / or, one of many choices. Now that I've finished reading \"blink,\" I need to add Gladwell's \"The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference\" to my reading list.",
            "This book is well written and easy to read. There are lots of great anecdotes and interesting observations to convey the books main ideas:* sometimes immediate, unconsidered thoughts are better than reasoned ones* sometimes they are not* experts can become very good at instant thinkingHowever, it doesn't go much beyond this in terms of insight into the nature of thinking and judgement. As a consequence, it is a bit repetitive and long winded.If you want to improve your own thinking, or even to understand what is happening when people make good snap judgements, this book will not be much help. I learned more in the first 10 pages ofThinking, Fast and Slowby Daniel Kahneman which is not as entertaining or easy to read, but has a wealth of insight based on years of research.",

I highly recommend this book especially to those who have an interest in psychology.",

            "Blink is a \" must read \" about the power and accuracy of our first impressions and intuitions about people and events. Malcolm Gladwell skillfully presents several case studies that inspire me to recognize my own intuitive talent and also to notice my tendencies to dismiss my intuitive knowing in favor of analysis and self-doubt.He cleverly examines stereotyping and predjudice, and demonstrates how this influences and distorts our intuition.As a result of this book, I feel more confident and freer to express myself spontaneously! Tuning in to my first impressions is fun and actually gives me a greater sense of well-being and living in the moment, wow!Another great source of well-being and Instantaneous Transformation is Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment by Ariel and Shya Kane.

            "I picked this up at the library after reading \"Outliers.\" Both were great. Gladwell is a gifted writer and story teller. He's able to tell five stories at once weaving them together to get across one or several points without ever rambling. I found myself reading this for more than 60 minutes at a time without even realizing time had passed. I have become a fan of Gladwell and am anxious to read his other works. I would highly recommend this book for the interested reader. Nothing in it is really ground breaking, but it's the sort of book with a lot of interesting bits of information that make you a little more interesting of a person, a little more aware of your self and others in the world, and give you an enhanced perspective on thinking.",
            "The booked arrived with plenty of time. I really like Malcolm Gladwell. I just read somewhere that he too bribes from big tobacco so I am a little wary. So far the book is good. the condition was not as good as I thought it would be but in this case I was not to upset about it.",
            "If you liked TIPPING POINT you will love Blink. I wish I could make this required reading in my university business ethic courses. It inspires people seeking guidance in the classroom for management in all areas. It is a feel good book without the warm fuzzies.",

The author does a superb job of explaining how the subconscious works, a subject that I and most people know very little about. Yet, as the book illustrates, with example after example, our subconscious plays an extremely important role in our lives. For those who want facts, this book has facts. For those who are easily bored with this sort of thing, don't worry, you will be thoroughly entertained. The blend is delicious.",
            "This well-written book shows several studies that have been conducted on how we can, in a 'blink', make an accurate assessment of any situation. The catch, however, is that one must be knowledgeable about the situation at hand.It also shows how we can be programmed into biases by those who know how to do such things.This book is very insightful on just how our brains are wired to work. A very interesting subject.",
            "It took a long while for him to reference the author of one of my favorite books, but Gladwell does an excellent job (unintentionally?) on expanding Gavin Debeckers must read work, The Gift of Fear. The idea that intuition is not mystery but science and that first impressions should (at times) be trusted above careful analysis is the bold margin notes I have written in both books. There is a very good reason to trust your gut feelings. Gladwell explores why we have them in the first place and how they can help us, get in our way, and most importantly how to tell the difference.Like DeBecker, Gladwell explains that intuition can be informed. Out \"guts\" can be taught. Buying this book and spending some time in it would be a very good idea.",
            "Gladwell did an excellent job researching people's inner sense about things, but the book seemed to meander from subject to subject with very little application to one's life.",
            "I saw this book on the Oprah show and it looked promising so I bought it. It started out really intresting and the stories were okay but it never does bring all the information together and tell you how you can use it to make better decisions. It was a quick and easy read. It just seemed like a compilation of articles and studies. Some of the interviews were pretty interesting... I'd like to know what he thinks and how I can use this in my life to improve my snap judgements. I agree with most of what he said, but it was nothing that I didn't already know.",
            "This is a good read, covering the full range of the power and dangers of first impressions and some of the psychology behind it.The only minor criticisms are that it is very US based, so does not translate into UK English in parts, and it lacks a proper summary at the end to draw all the strands together.",
            "I found that overall, Blink does not work well in Audio CD format. Gladwell uses the same words and expressions and concepts over and over. If I hear the phrase, \"thin slicing\" again, I might scream. It becomes highly repetitive and irritating. In my opinion, he speaks too slowly, and softly, which exacerbates the problem. If one were reading the book, one could skip forward or read more quickly to control this problem, and his voice wouldn't be an issue.As a general comment on the CD--and I assume this applies to the book as well-- I found that Gladwell was not very scientific. And yet, he acts like he is. Numerous assumptions are made when describing the results of certain studies, tests, and situations, and WHY they turned out a particular way. I found myself feeling irritated as the Cd attempted to push me into accepting the explanations proferred by Gladwell or the social 'scientists' whose work he was describing.I also think that ultimately Gladwell does not do a good job of actually pinning down the subject, or providing a very cohesive framework for it. He explores issues of faulty and correct decision making, and the CD provides a lot of food for thought, but if you think you will be able to increase your own decision making powers after listening to this tape, don't bet on it. The stories of how impressions can be accurate or inaccurate --regarding the authenticity of art objects, whether couples divorce, how to determine whether an artist can sell records, New Coke, issues of racial bias, etc.-- are all interesting, but don't leave one with a day to day framework for making decisions in one's everyday life. Generally, one is left with--be an expert, but don't over examine the issue to death or apart from a specific whole, make sure you are being objective, get a quick look at some types of things, but only in certain circumstances, sometimes you can't do a quick review unless you are aware of a key factor, beware of biases like looks and race, etc. Um....I either already knew it, or it's too vague to apply.",
            "This book has a very interesting opening that will draw you into the theories and ideas that make this book a great read. It doesn't preach and it isn't too intellectual. It gives examples on how sometimes, our first thought is the best one, and that maybe, just maybe we are designed that way.",
            "I loved this book. Fascinating. Compare with THINK and you have some thinking and blinking to do. I own the book and audio - time well spent.",
            "Just a short note to mention that while some of the thoughts and stories in the book are pretty interesting, as a whole it is not cohesive and often self contradictory. It's written a bit like a first year term paper. . . all over the place with no direction. Skip it.",

On what I consider to be major matters I flip to the other extreme, giving in to inferential analysis. I can close my eyes and see a bulletin board full of little thumb-tacked notes to myself, each adding or subtracting something from what I should or should not be doing. ##### This book seems to fill a void of sorts--pulling the extremes together. It teaches how to avoid such everyday dogma as leaps of faith, marshalling flashbacks without selectively sanitized nostalgia, awaiting last-minute arrival of the cavalry. ##### Overall, Gladwell's admonitions are cogent, and yes, with practice, I would think, applicable. I only wish he'd delved more deeply into the procrastination side of the \"think\" problem, the only slight \"short side\" of an otherwise splendid book.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell has posed an interesting question, \"How do you know what you know you know?\" And if that sounds confusing, then buy the book. Why do we trust brand labels? How deep do our stereotypes go? Why do we change our mind on what characteristics our ideal mate has once we meet someone we like? This book won't tell you how to think, it will make you examine your snap judgements and challenge HOW you know things.Highly recommended!",
            "It's remarkable to realize that this book represents the life work of many brilliant researchers, most of whom we would never know except for this book. Malcolm Gladwell has taken decades and volumes of highly technical research and turned it into what will surely be a best seller. He has made these concepts accessible to the average reader and anyone can see almost instantly how it applies to every day situations we all encounter. It's beautifully written, succinct and crafted so as not to intimidate.I was riveted from start to finish. I have been married and divorced twice now, yet I chose a stray dog at a pet adoption day in less than 5 minutes and was absolutely certain of the decision. My dog is the most wonderful companion one could ask for. This book explains how this can and does happen - even to those of us who consider ourselves educated, reasonable and experienced. I would highly recommend it.",

            "When I first saw this book on the shelf, it caught my attention. Blink!... So I check it out, \"thinking, without thinking.\" Making split second decisions with great results, etc... I look at the back, and I see this guy with a big poofy head of hair and a lame suit, that has wrote a book about making great decisions in a split second. My first thought, and I should have listened to it was... DON'T BUY THIS BOOK, waste of time. But, I the thought, ah, what the hek, it can't be that bad, and I may find something useful in it. Anyway, I'm about half-way through the book and today, as I was exercising on a lifestride and reading through his generalization based theories, without any supporting evidence, I seriously contemplated throwing the book down on the ground and letting my sweat saturate it and let it rot, but, I remembered something, someone told me once, you have to take the good with the bad, and seemings how I'm half way through, I might as well finish, and take it as a learning experience. One thing I have learned from this is, yes, I was a sucker, yes they are born everyday, and yes, anyone can write a freakin book and people will buy it. I can't believe this piece of garbage was published. And by the way... This is my first on-line review, that I have ever written, about a book, a movie, or anything. The fact that I am posting here is a testament to how much this book pissed me off with it's ignorance. This may sound somewhat harsh, but it really annoys me when I spend good money on something and it turns out to be trash - as I'm sure most folks feel the same.I seriously contemplated writing another book, just to contradict his empty theories and make him look like an idiot, but I'm sure after you read this, that will not be necessary for anyone with half a brain cell. I guess in the end though, he made some bucks off it, so he probably could care less.GOOD LUCK!PS.. I just read over more reviews of this book, to see what other folks thought (main reason I came here) and Gil Rosenburg's review was one I wish I read prior to reading this book. If you want to read a good book, look elsewhere. I just finished The Rule of Four and it was very good - albeit a different genre.",

            "Still reading the book but find it very interesting and informative. Explains many thoughts, behavors that I've had in the past.",
            "Every once in a while someone explains something so well that you can't figure out why you didn't see it before. Gladwell does this. I've read and studied decision making quite a bit, and most of it made a lot of sense and was based on good research. None of it--with the exception of one author--however, explained for me the reason of why people seem to \"jump\" to decisions, without following the \"rules.\" This is a great book! (The other author who explains things this well is Gary Klein (Sources of Power, Intuition at Work), whom Gladwell discusses).",
            "We have all been warned against the practice of \"judging a book by its cover.\" But is it OK to judge a book by its title? After hearing a friend talk about this book I looked it up on Amazon and was intrigued by the title. Not \"Blink\", but the part about \"thinking without thinking.\" As a person who tends to do his best when allowed to fly by the seat of his pants, I was immediately attracted to the potential subject matter of this curious little book.There are two concepts that make up the bulk of this book's foundation -- thin slicing and rapid cognition. It could be considered an expansion on the idea that our first impressions are frequently correct and that our sub-conscience is usually aware of things taking place in our surroundings much sooner that we are. The book also tells us that thin slicing and rapid cognition can be fooled or succumb to personal prejudice, and hence turn out to be completely wrong. And still Blink tells us that this can be overcome, or at least controlled, by learning to block out certain senses that cause us to proceed from false assumptions. Example: A college study where individuals were studied by two groups of graduate students. One that conduced a brief face-to-face interview, and a second that was allowed to very briefly study the contents of the individuals room without knowing anything about the person. The ones that performed the face-to-face interviews were less accurate because they made mistakes at the start of the interview -- mistakes such as this person is an athlete so he/she does not enjoy scholarly pursuits -- and so forth.The book starts off with a fascinating account of an ancient Greek statue on display in a New York museum. After over a year of scientific and historical analysis the statue is certified to be authentic. Meanwhile several amateurs begin having some interesting first impressions about the new exhibit -- guess which group ends up being correct? While there are other interesting stories and accounts along the way, once the ideas of thin slicing and rapid cognition get explained, parts of the book seem redundant and at times the book seems to get longer as one gets closer to the ending. Still, there are ideas and techniques discussed in this book that are valuable. I did enjoy the comparison between the Blind Taste test (as used by Pepsi/Coke in the late 1970's) and the Triangle test -- the concept of comparing two subjects by offering three samples and having the tester determine, not which one is better, but determine which one is not like the other two.I was torn between rating this book as a 3 star or a 4 star. Ultimately I decided to go with 4 (because I had a BLINK moment) because the ideas in the book are good ones, even if one does have to wade though some repetition. Also, one thing kept occurring to me as I was reading this book. I kept having this repeating thought telling me that this book was wrong. However, those little thoughts are largely what this book is about. If my impressions about the book are correct, then the book must be on to something. On the other hand, if my impressions are incorrect, then the book was not in fact wrong, but correct -- nice little paradox that works in Mr Gladwell's favor. See what reading this book does to a person.One last bit of closing information. This book seems to be a guaranteed conversation piece. I have had more comments book then anything I have ever left laying around the house. And it is not done on purpose. Again, something working very well for Mr. Gladwell.",
            "I like the concept of the book which is basically telling you to trust your hunches, instincts and/or gut. Good advice that is good to hear from time to time lest we forget. That being said, the book gets boring after mentioning tale after tale of people trusting their instincts in certain situations. You need only read the first half of the book (probably not even that) and you pretty much have all the info you need.Buy it used. Read it. Then give it away. Good book - just a little redundant and boring towards the middle and the end.",
            "First impression: good stuff; I understand what Gladwell explains about our first impressions and our second, more seasoned impressions, the concepts of thin-slicing and mind-reading; it's good that he uses examples to make and clarify his points.Second, more seasoned impression: Ugh! Give it a rest; confusion; way too drawn-out examples that made me put the book down for days, sometimes weeks, before picking it up again (and that's only because I have a thing about not finishing a book).I'm not a fan of filler and, for my taste, Gladwell is too verbose; the book became bogged down with too many examples and details, not to mention some confusion. In one chapter it sounded as though he was arguing for the accuracy of first impressions and in the next chapter, as if he were championing the other. All the back and forth about which is more accurate in which circumstance or given situation was unnecessary and cluttered up the message, and there were several times I found myself thinking, \"and your point is?\"I do believe that Gladwell could benefit from a piece of advice I read recently about giving the reader the benefit of the doubt when it comes to figuring things out on his or her own. Yes, it's a non-fiction, informational book, and as such, he does need to give explanations and make connections so a reader can understand what he's trying to say, but if I need that much hand-holding to get through the subject matter, maybe I should've picked up a Dr. Suess book instead.While I do feel a bit validated (if that's even the right word) in my trusting quite a lot of my snap decisions (they don't let me down often if I don't try to reason my way out of them), I don't know if that validation is worth the aggravation I experienced reading \"blink.\"",
            "In Blink, Gladwell examines how we develop our intuitions about something within seconds, and often our intuitions are amazingly accurate. Interesting observations:- By looking at micro-facial expressions, a psychiatrist can tell with 95% accuracy whether a couple will still be together in 15 years.- Priming our actions: by telling ourselves something about ourselves before doing an action like taking a test, you'll affect how well you do on the test. This demonstrates the power of positive thinking and the power of negative thinking.The information in this book will help you at the workplace, by knowing what you need to work on when it comes to \"impression management\" for your boss.",
            "Gladwell was on to something, and then he fell short of delivery when he vacillated with his latter stories and analogies. I think he should have sat longer on this before wrapping the writing up and publishing what looks to be unready. I found it to be weak in foundation and annoyingly confusing. If you have all the money to waste buy it, otherwise, look into more solid titles to spend your cash on.",
            "Many great books are ones that provide information and insights, but can be read quickly. \"Blink\" accomplishes both, and more. It's not a research book, and it's not a self-help, or awareness book. It can, help a reader perceive things they experience in life in a better way, which can help both personally and professionally.Many concepts we are latently aware of but don't consciously think about and discuss are in \"Blink.\"As we progress technologically, scientifically, and medically, we humans seem to have an urge and necessity to explain, analyze, investigate, and search for the reasons \"why.\" We categorize many of decisions we make, actions we perform. We even try to elucidate our our likes and dislikes.Numerous real-life examples are noted, and they're examples most readers will relate to.An art expert can often see a sculpture and know almost instantaneously that it's a fake. How does he/she know specifically? Sometimes it can be explained; sometimes it can't. \"it just isn't right,\" is the knowledge, but analyzing and dissecting it and then trying to verbalize an explanation, proves difficult if not impossible. Author Gladwell notes that this is fine. The concept of \"thin-slicing\" can remind one of the graduated steps of unconscious-incompetence to unconscious competence in work tasks and skills.Another example is the expert tennis coach that can accurately predict in a fraction of a second when a tennis player will fault on a serve. He just knows. In military campaigns, the Pentagon has long attempted to study how Generals make instinctive decisions in what's called \"The fog of war,\" where constant, unexpected changes, chaos, and lack of information coincide. Other research noted how doctors diagnose whether or not a patient is having a \"real\" heart attack or just suffering from chest pain. The Docs often have too much information and this leads to mis-diagnosing. Thin Slicing is also used in advertising, with some packaging tactics by companies noted.The psychological studies about our unconscious attitude towards race and first impressions were intriguing, relevant, and also disturbing. Even if our conscious minds tell us to treat everyone the same, do we actually do this, 100% of the time? Even when it adversely affects our income (costs us money)? Most of us aren't aware, when we do this. What lies behind the locked door of our sub-conscious has subtle yet influential ways of influencing our attitudes and actions in ways that we do not even know.The height factor: people that are tall comprise a very small portion of the US population. But the percentage of CEOs and those in upper management that are tall is overwhelmingly high. For every inch a person has they earn an $789 more per month. Add a few inches that the average tall person can earn several hundred thousand dollars more over the course of ones career/working years.One study revealed that car salesmen consistently treated people extremely differently because of their age, clothes, and gender even though these subjects reported the same income, residence, and education, and preferences on make, model, and price. The salesmen were unconscious of their unequal treatment, and were genuinely surprised that they were even doing so. It was actually costing them to lose money.Gladwell also points at the negative effects of \"thin-slicing.\" The negative effects of incorrectly acting upon our brief thin slices and instincts. (To me this is all-mighty \"assumption.\" And \"assumptions are the mother of all f-ups.\") Gladwell referred to this as 'negative Thin Slicing.' The Pepsi Challenge: how it motivated Coke to actually change it's recipe. But the \"Pepsi Challenge wasn't valid, and wasn't relevant. We usually drink more than just small a sip of cola, and we also do it without our eyes being covered. Nevertheless it caused a dramatic and disastrous change in one of the largest companies in the world.Another negative to improper thin-slicing is the \"Warren Harding\" effect. Warren Harding: a handsome man facial features, stature, and physical charisma that gave the 'impression' of power, strength, assurance and fortitude. was likely they major factor for his nomination and election to president. And he's rated as the worst ever. There are lots of anecdotes and few research studies. This is OK by me, and even preferred.",
            "I don't know that I buy everything (or even very much) that the author says about the whole \"thin slicing\" thing, but I enjoyed reading his ideas. I agree with Eric Antonow's review that the book contains a lot of speculation, and Gladwell does a poor job of unifying the stories, but individually the stories and ideas are fascinating. This book should be read with a healthy dose of skepticism, but do read it, because it is a fun read, and it really makes you think - always a good thing.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's book, \"Blink\" was offered up as a selection for a local reading group. Though initially less than fully interested I took the plunge and read it. I'm glad I did.Whether or not one concurs with the hypotheses and conclusions given by Mr. Gladwell, the fact that some of us are better than others in making correct decisions in a split second is a good place from which to start. He argues that, indeed, certain people have this natural (or often learned) ability to see immediately what others need to study. \"Snap Decision\" or \"In An Instant\" might have been good chapter titles for \"Blink\" but when the author discusses the downside of acting spontaneously (as in the Amadou Diallo case) \"Rush to Judgment\" would have been a more appropriate title.What gives this book appeal is Gladwell's narrative style. It's nicely paced, informative and often amusing. (see the section about Paul Ekman trying to explain how the muscles in the face work!) \"Blink\" has given me enough to savor so that I plan next to read the author's previous book, \"The Tipping Point\". \"Blink\" is a good read on an unusual subject and I recommend it.",
            "This is about choices we make 'without thinking' in an instant -- at the blink of an eye. He explains why some of \"The best decisions are those which are impossible to explain to others.\" Great decision makers are those who have perfected the art of 'thin-slicing' (the theory of thin-slices: how a little bit of knowledge fors a long way), without a large amount of deliberation.BLINK may change the way you feel about thinking before you speak and on-the-spot decisions. We learn a lot more about what people think by observing their body language or facial expressions than by asking them directly.A bad movie is always a bad movie. You hate it the first time you see it, carries over to the future. You drift away, avoid seeing movies in which those \"stars\" appear because of the awful feeling that other movie (the horrid thing you hated) left in your conscious and subconscious.On t.v. people watched 'All in the Family' about a bigoted person who was truly, absurdly bad. And yet they watched it every week. Why? Their subscious had become 'cushioned' to hear what they wanted to hear and let the rest slide.Mary Tyler Moore was every young man's dream girl. Adults, on the other hand, found her whiny and not on the up-and-up. She was great in the 'Dick Van Dyke show' but only half as good starring in her own show. She was my son's ideal woman, throwing her hat and her cares into the air, a big-city career girl. She was just a dream, not an actuality.We need to learn to listen with our eyes. We don't know where our first impressions come from or what exactly they mean. They often are wrong. We make assumptions without knowing the facts of the matter. When you get to know the person and the way he or she thinks, you realize that you miisjudged them. It's not how a person looks which matters the most but how he feels (is he sensitive or hard as nails tough?); the eyes reflect a prson's soul. If he won't look you in the eyes, he's not worth his weight in salt. He's superficial.A pure BLINK moment is when a miracle happens; they see you for who you truly are, and discover that snap decisions are usually right. When you digress or get misled, things turn out wrong.He also wrote THE TIPPING POINT: HOW LITTLE THINGS CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE which redefined how we understand the world around us. In BLINK, we learn to understand the world within. Now, I am wondering: why do we fall for tall, dark, and handsome men?",
            "Blink is just as well written as The Tipping Point, but doesn't deal with as relevant a subject matter.That said, I read it in one evening.",
            "I loved the Tipping Point and had to see what Malcom's latest book was about. Wow. I'm just blown away by the information in this book and the insight into why our first impressions are right sometimes and wrong other times. I highly recommend this book.",
            "I really wanted to like this book before reading it. I had heard so much about it and though perhaps it had potential, but alas, no. It was just horrible. I don't really have anything good to say about it. I just can't believe it's garnered as much media time as it has. Don't waste your time on this book.",
            "I was fortunate to get an advanced copy. Wow... you'll find yourself staying up late to finish this one - and when you reach the last page - you simply don't want it to end. Take your time and enjoy.Great work by Gladwell - I can't wait for his next one.",
            "Real life examples (that in this book are long, repetitve and often not conclusive) should usually back up a certain theory (snap judgment, in this case) not totaly replace it, as the author did.",
            "I am one of those that absolutely loved \"The Tipping Point\". However, \"Blink\" seems more to be a series of anecdotes in search of theme instead of, as in Tipping, a new insight into how things work, supported by a series of examples. The cover \"looks like Blink\" but the text is a far different creature. Wish I would have spent the time rereading Blink....",
            "Way to long for the content delivered. Essentially one big idea; experience, and I guess a little personality typing, makes for solid \"gut\" decision making. So much for the old saying \"don't judge a book by its cover\". If these ideas are implemented in the business world (I am an executive in the computer software industry) I guess it could lead to some real decision making efficiencies. On the other hand I can see the \"shoot from the hip types\" using Blink to justify their ongoing lack of elbow grease! By the way, the Tipping Point by the same author is a 5 star read....can't win them all.",
            "You may agree or disagree with the author, but it is a fun to read book, his examples are varied, and coming from many different backgrounds.",
            "Mr. Gladwell provides a very entertaining overview of gut feel decision making, and the efficacy of first impressions. His analysis of a N.Y.C. shooting tragedy is fairly gripping and is a clear cautionary tale for those whose occupations require split second decisions, and of course particularly those of the life and death nature.Mr. Gladwell also explains the work of scientists who have studied the myriad of human facial expressions. I found this to be the most interesting segment of the book. If you know anyone who is a superb communicator, touched on also in The Tipping Point, this work takes thinking about that talent to another level. The amount of painstaking work required of those scientists who assembled the catalog/study of human facial expressions must have been daunting.Those who dislike the book need to take it a bit less seriously. While Gladwell treats very serious subjects, in the end, 'Blink' is really just good fun.",
            "I read this book several months ago and thoroughly enjoyed it -- both at the time and on numerous occasions since, when for one reason or another, parts of it came back to mind.The poor reviews baffle me; I can only guess that a number of readers expected it to be a how-to or self-improvement book, with clearly articulated steps about how to get from Point A to Point B. What it is, instead, is the exposition of a theory, complete with a wide variety of supporting evidence.I suppose some of the evidence could seem tangential if you were looking for a quick read that solved all your problems (or at least made you *think* all your problems would be solved), but for someone who is able to see the world in shades of gray, rather than in black and white, Gladwell offers an expansive look at how influential \"gut feelings\" can be -- and why.",
            "I found this book quite fascinating. It confirms what I've always believed: go with your gut and don't waiver.I could barely blink while reading. It was that compelling.",
            "You can learn some very interesting things about yourself and others by reading this book, however the author fails to make the material interesting. Somehow, Malcom manages to make boring a discussion that should be truly riveting.",
            "I had heard about this book for a long time, so I raced on over to the website and took a long, hard--oh, I mean a short, easy blink at it. I'm not sure what it's about, but I'm sure I don't want to read it. Well, I mean, I did read it, but just really, really fast. It was great! By the way, since I both did and didn't read it, and chances are its an average book, I gave it a 3! Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",

This is definetely the kind of book that make you say: hey, I didn't know, but know that I'm thinking about, that's true!Interesting episodes that you have always lived, and know you can understand why",
            "Gladwell begins with a story about a supposed Greek statue that some experts, using scientific testing, could not detect as a fruad, while others were immediately suspicious. (So, some people look at the forest for immediate clues, before examining the trees in detail.)Another example involved a single tennis expert with an uncanny knack of foretelling when someone was about to double-fault. (The bad news is that he could not relate how this was done. Thus, what this proves is beyound me.)Still another revolved around an officer playing a \"rogue MidEast commander\" vs. the regular Army. Anyone who has been in government knows that it moves at glacial speed, and can easily be outdone by much smaller groups with a modicum of intelligence and speed (eg. Lockheed's \"Skunk Works,\" and Burt Rutan's \"space ship.\"). So the rogue officer's success is hardly suprising.To say that quick decisions - based on a few KEY VARIABLES - is better than studied analyses that include a multitude of minor issues is hardly surprising either.Finally, readers need to keep in mind that there will always be statistical abberations - eg. someone who correctly predicts the flip of a coin 50 times in a row. However, that does not prove that they have any special talent, and they are just as likely to be wrong as right on the next toss.Similarly, finding snap judgements superior to supposedly sophisticated statistical models does not necessarily support a conclusion supporting snap judgements - many statistical models are poorly specified and have embarrasingly large errors.Finally, would Gladwell ride a 747 designed in a manner he describes, buy a car similarly designed, invest in a corporation investigated in a style he supports here?Not worth reading.",
            "If you wanted to sum up Malcolm Gladwell's \"Blink\", I would tell you to see the very first \"Star Wars\" movie. Remember in 1977 when Luke Skywalker while piloting his fighter hears Obi-Wan Kenobi tell him to turn off his radar while attacking the evil star ship? Obi-Wan wants Luke to rely on the FORCE. In other words, give up his conscious thought patterns and go with your gut.This is what BLINK is all about. Our ability to instantly know what is real from what is fiction. What is good from what is bad? Gladwell is telling us to go with our right (creative) brain, and for the moment to shut down our left (logical, analytical) brain, and oh he is so right.In example after example, the author goes through diverse instances where people in just the time it takes to BLINK, can make FABULOUS decisions that turn out to be the right ones. Others using the power of their analytical minds can take days, weeks, and even months, and come to the wrong decision. There's something going on here, and Gladwell is onto it. Human beings have five million years of evolutionary history behind us, and consciousness for only the last 15,000 or 20,000 years.Somehow, we have TURNED OFF the power of our unconscious instinctual patterns, and overridden them with our super analytical ways of logic. The result is inferior decisions to what we had before we became conscious. Hey, when a lion was chasing down our ancestors for a meal, you didn't have much time to think.By the way, every page of this relatively short book is fascinating. You will literally not be able to put it down. Let's look at a few of the topics that Gladwell covers in depth and convincingly.A) The J. Paul Getty Museum & the Kouros StatueThe cash-flushed Getty Museum wanted to buy a 7-foot Greek statue for $10 million. With contract in hand they call in some of the greatest experts in the world who after running exhaustive scientific tests, agree that it's the real thing and you should jump to buy it. At the same time a handful of other experts just looking at the object instantly announce it's a fake, and you should walk away. Learn who was right and why. Hint: it took 2 seconds of looking to KNOW the answer.B) Who's a good Professor in less than 30 secondsRemember when we went to college we would attend a lecture or two to determine if we wanted to take the entire course with a certain professor. In BLINK you will see scientific studies that prove you can come to the same decision by watching a video of the professor for 30 seconds. Who's kidding whom?C) What if you could tell how long a potential marriage would last?This one is mind blowing. John Gottman of the University of Washington has shown in tests that he can do this with accuracy. Watching one hour of a couple talking, and Gottman can tell with 95% accuracy if 15 years later, they will still be married. Blink goes into it in detail. Too bad, I didn't learn about this study sooner.D) Why do some doctors get sued, and others not at all?You would think that the risk of being sued if you are a doctor is all about making mistakes, or improper medical care. BLINK shows that its really about words like \"RUSHED, IGNORED, and TREATED POORLY.\"E) Can a President of the United States be elected on looks alone?Read BLINK and you will see how an entire nation got suckered into electing Warren Warding President just for that reason, unbelievable but true. Read how and why, and be mesmerized.F) Only 14.5% of men are six feet and over. Why are 58% of CEO's six feet, or taller?Pretty wild when you think about it, yet true. Could there be some kind of unwritten or unconscious criteria for being a Fortune 500 CEO that involves height? There aren't enough tall people to COMPLETELY staff any one company. Why is it that the tall ones seem to rise to the TOP?G) Blue Team versus Red TeamThis is my personal favorite. The American military runs war games all the time. The good guys who are us are always the BLUE Team. The enemy is always the RED team. In preparation for the first Iraq war in the early 1990's, the government ran the exercise, and put General Paul Van Riper in charge of the bad guys, the RED team.The bottom line is that the bad guys blew away the good guys, the Americans by using unconventional \"BLINK\" type thinking, while the BLUE Team relied on conventional, overwhelming force, and inside the Beltway type bureaucratic thinking. This illustrates why this book is so important. You will learn out of the box type thinking.You will also learn when to use it, and when to go with your logical left brain type thinking. By the way in the war exercise when the bad guys, the RED Team beat the good guys the BLUE Team with ease, what did the Pentagon do? They announced that the game would be done over again, and they outlawed the techniques that the bad guys the RED Team employed.The result, the good guys won. The problem is that nobody told the bad guys in Iraq during the second Iraq War that these techniques were outlawed, and thus our Generals as usual find themselves in some difficulty to say the least. Read BLINK, and find out how and why. This book is FASCINATING, and NOT TO BE PUT DOWN, ONCE YOU START READING IT.Richard Stoyeck",
            "After reading this book I felt like saying, yeah, so what? The observations within are completely self evident to anyone who has taken the time to think about them and his conclusions based on these observations are nothing new either.",
            "This book was an easy enjoyable read, but I haven't gotten anything new out of it. If you are a reader of \"pop\" writing, you might enjoy it and find it informative. I was looking to learn something new, and I was dissapointed. At the end, it wasn't worth the money I paid for it.",
            "Gladwell is a great journalist and in his latest book, he explores snap judgments. This book brings intuitive decision making to our attention and will provoke more research. As most senior executives use snap decision making in their day to day activities, this book is valuable and somewhat practical.I strongly recommend Gladwell's earlier book, The Tipping Point, for cutting-edge information about marketing success through word of mouth.",
            "This is the kind of book that gives publishing a bad name. The central thesis of this book - that those who are well trained in an area of study can be incredibly good at making judgments using only a few pieces of essential information - is the stuff of a short magazine article. And since Mr. Gladwell writes for the New Yorker, it probably was the stuff of a too long magazine article.What Mr. Gladwell has tried to do is dress up a somewhat interesting idea for a dentist office type magazine article into a full-fledged book. In the process, he has made a huge mess. This book is all about asides, amusing anecdotes, and often poor scholarship and poor interpretations of existing works.I know that the price of Manhattan real estate has gone through the roof and rents are ridiculous. But Mr. Gladwell made a ton of money with his first book. He can afford just about any condo he wants. He doesn't have to embarrass himself by writing a mindless piece of candy like this.This book is all about ego and greed. Essentially, Mr. Gladwell has nothing useful to say. He just goes on and on in a meandering fashion writing about nothing. It's like a well-written undergraduate research paper full of b.s. designed to con a professor. In this case both the publisher and Mr. Gladwell are trying to con the public out of 20 dollar bills. Apparently, they are succeeding.",
            "Blink claims to explore the power of \"rapid cognition\" and \"snap judgments\" i.e. - intuition and gut feelings.The book starts promisingly enough, but it's unwilling to take a stand on rapid cognition and snap judgments, and their usefulness in life. In fact, the author basically concludes that snap judgments are sometimes good, sometimes bad. In otherwords, he's unable to make a judgment.I was given the book by a friend who thought it would help me make better decisions, but the fact is Gladwell spends little if any time discussing how rapid cognition can help us in our daily lives.Worse, the author (who's half of African descent) spends much of the book discussing the problems of snap judgments in the context of discrimination against African Americans. Racism is a terrible thing, but that's not the advertised focus of this book. If you buy this book, you'll spend a lot of time and money hearing this author's manifesto on the ill-treatment of African Americans.Finally, the book also discusses the concept of \"thin-slicing,\" and indeed this book appears to be thin-sliced. For what is a fascinating topic, the author only skims the surface, and the result is a short book with relatively few words per page. I almost get the feeling he was rushing out the door to his next NYC cocktail party.If you're considering buying this book, I suggest you make a \"snap judgment\" not to.",

What makes the book worth 4 stars is the approach, and the editors enhancement. For example this author states that your ability to make a right decision without thinking to much about it depends on your education history or data bank of general knowledge. Are we slipping so far into naiveness in the 21 century that we need to be told this? Brilliant deduction.

            "after reading all the hype and best seller list propaganda, i was extremely disappointed to find out it was just another self help book that rehashes previous chapters throughout and offers no real content.typically a traditional self help book would offer some sort of exercise, usually with regards to the topic of the book. Maybe offer you some tools to work with towards your \"embetterment\"(thanks Bush). In this case recognizing your \"rapid cognition\", otherwise known to everyone else as intuition, and how you may start understanding and working with it in its quick, micro-second changes. i.e. why does *particular scenario* make you react so quickly without thinking. this book promises to help you notice these minimal changes and to work with them. say your kid does something stupid and you immediately blow up at them. well this book, idealistically, would help you recognize and analyze that process and work with it. unfortunately this book provides nothing but a series of unsatisfying research and drawl stories that go on for ever, referencing each other without reason, content, or even climax. hmm, similar to this review...maybe next time malcom you'll be pulled over for fraud, and not your hair:P",

            "This book describes the effect of subcontinent in some of our thoughts and decisions, and provides some empirical evidence about their hypoteses.

            "I found Blink to be superficial with no serious insights. Its basic premise is to trust your snap judgement but only if you have sufficient knowledge to do so. Its other points are to think outside the box and don't get bogged down in the minuteness of knowledge.Although easy to read and somewhat enjoyable there is nothing new here, so move along.I've also read Malcom Gladwell's \"Ouliers\" which I would rate higher because it did contain some new insights for me, but it was still basic pop sociology.",
            "This book definitely explains the unexplainable. We sometimes choose logical reasoning over intuitions which leads to mistakes and even catatrophes. But the small voice inside your head saying 'yes' or 'no' to our decision making is right most of the times. This is especially true when we have less information about the decision process. Whether it be as small as buying clothes or as big as investing in a new business, the intuitive feeling can be a better guide as it is based more on experience and observation. Im marketing, that is how consumer behavior has been identified when they switch brands or buy an abolutely new product without any logical reason associated with it. The book definitely reconfirmed my conviction of 'gut feeling'.",

            "If I had the ability to judge a book's quality at a blink, I would not have bought this book. The book has some interesting facts, and interesting facts are all that the book has. Its logic is incomplete and thus its conclusion can be misleading. Furthermore, it fails to analyze or explain the reasons of those interesting facts. I got an \"ok, so what?\" feeling after reading the book.Here's an example. The author's argument is that we can judge a person we have never met before in a nanosecond and still tend to be correct. He uses the evident of college students judging their professors at their first class. The logic is: because students are good at judging new teachers, people are good at judging strangers. This is a very biased example - students are experts in judging teachers. Students have been studying and judging their teachers since kinder garden and their teachers are usually from similar culture background as the students. As a result, each student has a huge database of what they like and whether a specific teacher would meet their requirements. However, if you want a student in a completely different culture or a person who has been home-schooling to judge a stranger teacher in 3 minutes of lecturing time, I think the result is more likely to be off. The author cannot safely draw the same conclusion.Yes, we tend to make quick judgment of people, and yes, we tend to think we are right (please note the difference between \"think we are right\" and \"are actually right\"). Yet this book fails to make neither a good point nor a good explanation. If you are new to the topic of decision-making neurology and interested in a quick reading, I recommend \"How We Decide\" by Jonah Lehrer. It's easy, interesting, and actually informative.",

            "Everyone makes snap judgments about people, places, and events. Sometimes those judgments are correct, other times not. But what if you're forced to make a big decision in a matter of seconds? What processes in your brain help you make that decision, and how do you prevent bad decisions from happening?Through fascinating studies and real life examples, Malcom Gladwell explores these concepts and much more in this book. As Gladwell states, there are three purposes to the book. First, to show that quick decisions can be just as good as decisions made after slow, careful deliberation. Second, to identify when we should trust our instincts and when we should be wary of them; and third, to persuade the reader that snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled.To demonstrate Gladwell's points, plenty of pages are devoted to studies and examples that made the book sound like a marketing textbook at times. Descriptions of the many types of facial expressions were so detailed that it became monotonous. Also, I would have liked more tips about how to control snap decisions, but the book certainly gave me a better understanding of why and how first impressions are made. Having said this, Blink is a worthwhile read, and the concepts will compel you to reevaluate those snap decisions you make in your life.",

Bravo Zulu gift giver.The Power of Thinking Without Thinking is written so that the reader can relate to the material as it is devoured. Gladwell points out information you kind of thought you knew. The perpective and method in which he delivers the information allows you to understand and utiltize your unconscious thinking as well as the unconscious thinking of those around you.His method of delivery is association to everyday relative stories. Above and beyond just the mass research he has obviously spent years compiling, he dares to present material with personal biases and the power and effects biases create.I do not want to give out the score before you watch the game, but I would consider this a must read.Enjoy!",

            "Gladwell writes about the \"24/7 mental valet,\" which is really nothing more than the \"superconscious,\" the corollary to the subscious. While the subconscious is below our consciousness, the superconscious is above it, although we are no more conscious of it than the subconscious. It is responsible for the \"instinctive\" responses (yes, even humans have instincts), and is the overseer of the sleep/wake cycle. The conscious is awake during the day, the subscious is awake at night, but the superconscious is the 24/7 mental valet that controls both cycles. It also controls the 50/50 distribution of male/female children--there can be no other explanation than a force interwoven among the greater human population that controls the even distribution of children across individual women throughout all species.It is akin to the economic theory of the efficient market hypothesis, which says that all information is incorporated into the market and reflected in a random walk of stock prices. The superconscious is also akin to the \"invisible hand\" of evolution which guides all species to their highest function.",
            "Blink is an excellent book about how our unconscious affects our thinking. The book demonstrates how powerful our unconscious mind is when it comes to processing information. A lot of times we take forever pondering over plethora of information and are still clueless. On some other occasions, with a tiny piece of information we taking the most perfect of decisions. The book argues its partly because our unconscious is extremely good at weeding out unnecessary information and using just the relevant part for making a decision which is perfect and couldn't have been better. It presents numerous real life examples showing how past experiences/popular perception of people has affected their decision making and consequently results of their actions. The writing is easy to read, driven by examples and is thought provoking. Overall, its an excellent job by Malcolm Caldwell.",
            "I bought numerous copies of this book after reading it, for gifts--for the family member in intel, the family member into everything, the girfriend of Intel....There were so many stories that fed real-life knowing vs data, educated data, and gut-informed data, and how to distinguish them all. I will be looking deeper into numerous researchers discussed, and their informing of real-life settings. Very readable format; I found myself making notes so I could refer back later to name, page, etc.",
            "Malcom Gladwell's exploration of our initial subconscious reactions is an incredible read for both experts and laymen alike. I am especially impressed at the examples Gladwell presents in the book. He begins each chapter with a new example of the main point for the section. These examples are not rooted in higher learning but rather reach topics any of us can relate to. He writes about marriage, dating, art, elections...even his primary example to introduce the Blink concept is about a stature. Throughout his explanation, he constantly refers back to his original example, fleshing it out as he teaches us more and more about the details of the \"Blink\" phenomenon. The result of tackling this information piece by piece is an easy to follow guide through the otherwise confusing concepts and the creative examples help keep one interested even if s/he wasn't looking to read an academic book.I also thoroughly enjoyed Gladwell's voice throughout the book. Blink is filled with academic research to support Gladwell's claims but the writing is a departure from the often droll college textbooks and articles. Instead, Gladwell's narrative often sounds like he is telling a story rather than explaining a theory. He is not an impartial narrator but rather provides examples from his own life and writes like he is leading us through information he himself just discovered. In short, his writing provides clarity and doesn't sacrifice creativity in lieu of scientific research.In conclusion, I throw in another recommendation for this excellent book. Some of the concepts tackled in Blink are taught in University Communication, Psychology, and Sociology classes so nothing can beat a creative and effective piece of college education without the expensive tuition fees. Furthermore, Blink will persuade you to take a look at the way you react to others and what kind of messages these reactions send.",
            "In Blink, Gladwell applies his popular writing style to the investigations of making snap decisions. Gladwell uses anecdotes and the results of scientific research to illustrate several different theories into how the subconscious part of our minds will quickly sort through a vastly large number of variables and lead us to a conclusion. Blink gives examples of when our first impression are more accurate than doing hours of research. However, Gladwell quickly follows his first example of gut instinct is right with stories when gut instinct and first impressions are wrong. The final third part of the book attempts to examine when first instincts are likely to be correct, and what efforts we can individually make to improve our accuracy in making split second decisions.Gladwell contends that we develop biases that harm are ability to make accurate quick decisions. Once we are aware of these biases, rather than try to remove them from our culture, we should try to find ways to eliminate them from becoming a variable in our subconscious. He uses the example of having classical musicians audition behind a screen to avoid gender and posture biases. Gladwell argues that by gaining education and experience in a subject, we become better at making fast decisions in a given field.What is notably lacking in Blink is a defined prescription for how we can use this information to better make quick decisions, and precisely when we should deliberate long and hard or simply follow our gut. Gladwell's general suggestions do not satisfy the questions raised in the readers mind over the course of the book. Although some readers may find this annoying, I think it is unfair to hold the absence of answers against the authors work. Gladwell has thrown these ideas out into the public discourse, now as a society we can think about how we are thinking and perhaps someday research will give a nice flow chart of when we should think on our feet, control our environment for better bias control, or spend hours on statistical analysis.",
            "I enjoyed the book very much. It kept me engrossed until the end and gave me much to think about relative to intuition vs. information gathering.

            "This is a pretty good book. I really enjoyed it, but am giving it a four-star rating because it's not as good as his other books, like Tipping Point or What the Dog Saw.

            "I was at a local coffee shop which has a used book selling area. I grabbed this one for it's simplistic look as I was in the mood for noting serious... before I knew it over an hour had past and I was completely lost in contemplation. I am not too great at book reviews as I don't know what serious readers/authors/editors would say about this book.... but for a reader like me who takes things at face value this book was delicious. Without trying Malcolm had me thinking about things that up until then had only been subconcious reactions and understandings about the world around me. I grew to have a much keener mind and attitude about all things \"Blink\", and you will just have to read the book to know what I mean by that as it's not something easily described. A point I can easily make here is that Malcolm describes this phenonmenon if you will with creativity, ease and a fascinated disposition. As you read you can feel his excitement and amazement over the things he has learned, almost as though it is a treat to be telling you such wonderful and intriguing stories.I recommend this book for anyone interested in the subtleties and grey areas of life less explored. It will have you thinking philosophical, deep and profound thoughts within the first 5 pages. I am truly impressed by this book.",
            "Things may not be immediately discernible in what a man writes, and in this sometimes he is fortunate; but eventually they are quite clear and by these and the degree of alchemy that he possesses he will endure or be forgotten. - Hemingway, 1954Going with the tenet of thin-slicing, having read the first few pages, I should have liked the book cover-to-cover and lapped it up in a Sunday session of early morning's magic hours. Instead, the curiosity to discover something new unraveled over a few sessions and only the desire to finish the book had me complete it. The tagline states 'The power of thinking without thinking\", and that has a different connotation than I had imagined initially. It is not innate, it is honed over years of doing the same thing and achieving expertise in the subject, that allows someone to be on \"autopilot\".",
            "This Gladwell book focuses on the age-old question of whether to make a snap judgment decision using your gut or spend the time to gather all the information, develop alternatives, and select the best option.Humans probably have a quick built-in decision making system because we had to make up our minds quickly to run from the lion or stay and fight in the early generations of our existence.The advantage of making snap judgments is how quickly and easily they can be made. No time, effort, or thinking is required to make snap judgments.The author argues we should utilize snap judgments more often because they are fairly accurate and easy to make. He argues that 6 minute speed dating meetings are much more efficient and accurate than elaborate courting rituals. Other examples include predicting the probability of divorce by observing a couple for only a few minutes.Gladwell contradicts himself with his example of emergency room doctors. One might think experienced ER doctors should be accurate at diagnosing heart attacks. It turns out they are not accurate. A doctor spent years studying these types of cases and developed a flow chart which diagnosed heart attacks quickly based upon only a few factors. Flow charts are commonly using in industrial engineering to simplify and standardize processes. I found nothing too revolutionary about the idea of developing a flow chart to diagnose heart attacks.I had not heard of the 2 gentlemen who documented all possible facial expressions. This must have been the idea that led to the TV show Lie to Me.Gladwell argues that juries should not get to see any of the people involved in a trial. He claims seeing the people involved would bias the opinion of the jury. After having been in two trials that each lasted five weeks, I disagree with this recommendation. The subject of the trial was highly technical and I doubt the jury was able to grasp the technical part of the trial. They were able to easily able to figure out who was lying in their testimony and who was not. I'm sure that body language of the participants played a key factor in these trials.Vilfredo Pareto was an Italian economist. Around 1900, he observed that 80% of the wealth or income in Italy was attributed to only 20% of the population. He found the same phenomena in England, and it applies to the U.S. today.Pareto's 80:20 rule allows people to spend their critical time and resources on the key 20% that cause 80% of the issue being studied.Gladwell seems to argue in his book that we should try to increase our usage of our snap decision making abilities as a more efficient way to solve problems. An example would be observing a couple talk about their dog for 60 minutes as a way to predict their probability of divorce.......versus hours and hours of therapy.I also had not heard the example of the Chancellorville Civil War battle. General Hooker had more than twice the number of soldiers (134,000 versus 61,000), twice the artillery pieces, and hot air balloons for intelligence gathering compared to Robert E. Lee. Hooker successfully split his army into two and maneuvered half of his army around Lee without being detected. All Hooker had to do was commence and follow-through on the attack to defeat Lee. In sports terms, Hooker choked once the battle started and retreated. Lee won the battle.Gladwell argues that Lee won because he had less information than Hooker. He thinks Hooker had too much information and over-analyzed the situation.The most important question in Gladwell's book is not the effectiveness of gut decisions in some situations versus drawn-out analysis. The real question is...What are the guidelines for when to make snap decisions versus detailed problem-solving steps? Gladwell does suggest that gut instincts work best in complex decision making like choice of your mate or your profession.I would argue that if time permits, I would recommend doing both (gut decision and detailed analysis) and comparing the final recommendations. In the business world, one never has all the needed information. Decisions must still be made and part of the art of management is knowing how to make decisions with limited information. Sensitivity analysis can be used to help understand the impact of changes in key variables.I would like to see new techniques developed for airport screening. I would think a combination of Israeli type questioning of passengers plus facial feature recognition might end the thoughtless screening of children and grandparents.All-in-all a good read. This book was not as well designed or as interesting a read as Tipping Point.",
            "When I purchased Blink I thought that it would show me how to manipulate my subconscious or something. That was my own fault. I liked the book over all but I was frustrated while I read the book because I was confused in the direction that Gladwell was going. Some stories and results of experiments showed the strength and trust of your subconscious while other stories showed the exact opposite and by the end of it the conclusion is that sometimes you can trust your subconscious and sometimes you can't. I was really thinking this book was a waste until I read the much needed afterward by the author. I think he knew this was needed in his book because it ended with no real stated value. The afterward explains his intentions with the book which was really to have fun looking at the subconscious. Also, he explains better when it's good to trust the subconscious and when it's not good. Also, there is a challenge in his afterward that I much appreciated. This is where he shows how we can use both our split second decision making abilities and resources to make better choices, like in our justice system. Overall I like the read (with the afterward) and would suggest it to other readers. Btw...I like very much how this author writes and so far all his books are entertaining and enlightening. Thanks Malcolm! Also, sorry for the run on sentences and such. I'm a reader and not a writer! haha.",
            "Overall, this was a really great book. It was a fast read, and filled with a lot of cool information about the human mind and what Gladwell refers to as \"thin-slicing.\" It really opened my mind to what the human brain can and can't do.With that said, I've noticed a lot of people reviewing this book and complaining that there's no epiphany at the end like his other book, Tipping Point. It's clear this book has gotten worse ratings than it deserves because it's being held up to that standard. I feel like this book does a lot to reveal the potential of the human mind and shows great examples of what thin slicing can do. It's the kind of topic that can't be built up to and magically revealed at the end as a great epiphany, Gladwell has to lead you through it and build it up as you go along, and I think that's why a lot of readers feel robbed of a great conclusion.Overall, it's a great book, and while it doesn't train you to make snap judgments, it can shed light on the processes behind it, and it generally just a really good read.",
            "Very interesting and informative. It's a pretty quick read as well. I recommend this book, especially the part describing Ekman and his work.",
            "One of the primary criticisms of Gladwell's book, a criticism common to popular social science books, is that it covers the underlying research on an overly superficial level. I am not familiar with the scholarly work Gladwell relies upon, but if my experience in fields I am more familiar with holds, Blink certainly covers this corner of psychology on a superficial level. But that is ok. It would not be possible to write such a book otherwise. More important, in my mind, to this kind of book is that it clearly explain the consequences of the research to and spark some excitement for the subject in the lay reader. Blink achieves in spades on both counts.Blink is about snap judgments. Or, to put it another way, decisions made subconsciously, not consciously. Sometimes this is good (if you are an expert on the subject, for particularly complex decisions); sometimes this is bad (if the decision may be colored by subconscious, irrelevant biases). When Gladwell sticks to snap judgments (which he labels as \"thin slicing\"), Blink works. The stories are funny, relevant, and interesting.We discover that it is very difficult to really understand many, many things without years and years of experience and training, but we can still tell what is good and what we like. Gladwell uses jelly as an example, but take wine. I can tell you which wines I like and even tell you which wine I like better. But I cannot talk like a sommelier. And, as much of the research Gladwell discusses suggests, attempting to do so would interfere with my unconscious ability to differentiate good wine from bad.Gladwell also tries to show how we can use an understanding of thin slicing to make better decisions, but he tends to give answers that are less than fully satisfying. Gladwell relates how administrators at Cook County Hospital saved money and increased the accuracy of diagnoses by implementing a decision tree. It is an odd case study. Neither thin slicing nor conscious decision-making worked for the doctors; it was not an example of shifting from one to the other. It was an example of the power of narrowing focus to a few truly relevant metrics (a powerful and highly useful subject, but it is not the subject of Blink). In another case study, Gladwell never quite explains his point regarding the Kenna story, about a musician loved by record execs and ignored by the radio. Presumably he meant to imply that the thin slicing by the record execs was right (because they are experts), but the thin slicing by the radio focus groups was wrong (because they were not experts and could not identify music they would enjoy as quickly). Gladwell may be right, but that conclusion does not flow necessarily.Gladwell never really gives a solid basis for discerning when experts can be trusted. From Blink, it would be easy to over rely on experts. But a \"sort of\" expert can be worse than a layman. In the counterfeit statute case study Gladwell starts with, both those who got it right and those who got it wrong were experts. To give an example not in the books, literary \"experts\" have long denigrated the Lord of the Rings, while readers have had no trouble recognizing its brilliance (even if unable to explain why). The literary experts did not have the expertise to properly evaluate the expertise in philology and mythology that Tolkien used.Gladwell's final application of thin slicing shows a poor understanding of his own material. Gladwell observed that the percentage of female orchestra members shot up dramatically after a switch to screened auditions. Irrelevant visual signals were crowding out the relevant audio signals. Gladwell then extrapolates this to argue criminal defendants should be screened to mitigate subconscious racial bias. But a jury trial is not an orchestra audition. If a criminal defendant is on the stand in a jury trial, he visual cues are more important than the audio clues. As Gladwell discussed earlier in the book, facial expressions tell an indelible story about what a person is really thinking (he even uses an example from the OJ Simpson trial!). One of the primary duties of the jury is to assess the credibility of witnesses; how can they do this if they cannot see the person's face? That this recommendation achieved such quick support from an audience at Harvard Law School says more about the state of legal education than its merit.",

            "I had great fun reading Gladwell's 'Outliers', so I bought 'Blink' and had a greater blast. The book is packed with mind provoking examples to illustrate vividly the challenge of figuring how to 'combine the best of conscious deliberation and instinctive judgment' in our daily lives. The newly added Afterword by Gladwell also put his original writing in a concise context, with pragmatic 'call to action'. I do hope that 'Blink' can encourage one to apply its insight in solving practical problems, it certainly has the power to lead me to do so.",
            "This book is about first impressions and when they are accurate and when they are not. It is mostly examples and stories (many of which I enjoyed reading). Overall, I thought it was interesting, but a little slow paced for me. I would recommend it.",
            "If you have enjoyed any of his other books you will like this one too . . . the premise is interesting and has opened up another perceptual window. The stories relating to test marketing point to revealing how we consumers are studied and manipulated. I have recommended it.",
            "There is good reason that this book skyrocketed to the New York Times nonfiction best-seller's list. Gladwell serves up some interesting perspectives on how we make decisions. He asserts that decisions made quickly and without a lot of analysis can be just as good as, if not better than, carefully researched ones. Gladwell says it's because almost all of us possess the ability to \"thin slice\" a situation. We are able to unconsciously pick up on cues that allow us to make decisions intuitively. We can make good decisions without knowing all the information. Conversely, we can also make some poor decisions based on prior associations and impressions!Through compelling stories and significant research, Gladwell encourages his readers to be more self-aware of the power of rapid cognition and how subtle influences can alter or bias the product of our unconscious. The more sensitive we are to the fact, the more we can control the environment in which they occur and prevent making decisions based on prejudices.Personally, I took away three important lessons: The first is that truly successful decision making relies on a balance between deliberate and instinctive thinking. Secondly, if you are truly an expert, trust your instincts. You may not consciously know the rationale, but your subconscious does. The third lesson is that in good decision making, frugality matters. Take a complex problem and reduce it to its simplest elements. Even the most complicated of relationships and problems have a simple, identifiable, underlying problem.Makes you blink twice before you make a decision!",
            "It took me 2 weeks to finish the book.At the first few page, my \"Blink\" was telling me that I got the right book, the book that helps to stimulate and initiate further awareness on self-consciousness, to help us in controlling our \"Blink\".However, upon finishing the book, I was very disappointed at how much fact and experiment the book had given, but no absolute \"help\" was given. Of course, it's impossible to write a complete guide to control \"Blink\", but I was expecting a more \"solution\" to help us understand the word \"Blink\", and using it across the world instead of focusing only on \"Black\" and \"Guns\".More examples and case studies I'd like to hear are the \"poor\" and \"crimes\", how do you \"Blink\" on someone who dresses smart but is incapable to do anything, how do you \"Blink\" on a potential employee who looks promising, and whether all those \"Blink\" are \"right\" or \"wrong\" ?I'm very disappointed for the conclusion it gives, but nevertheless, it was enjoyable.",

His concept of gut feel and the \"thin slice\" reminds the reader that our instincts and our perceptions (particularly visual percepions) are powerful influencers on our behavior.

            "This book is a really quick read and easy to read. I enjoyed the anecdotes that pulled Gladwell's premise together. The ten million dollar Kouros fraud and the serial dating actually have something in common. Both use split second analysis to decide if the statue or the prospective date are phonies.Why is it some people turn everything they touch into gold while others can never make a go of something?We have all had those hunches about someone or something and then later when it all comes to light, we say we knew that the moment we laid eyes on someone or something; we just knew they were no good or we just knew we liked them from the start.Gladwell writes that we very often make very important decisions within a few minutes and often in just seconds. He helps you see how just being aware of these split second decisions can make a positive influence in those decisions.He also points out how easily we can be persuaded by subliminal messages for good or for bad. He made me realize I need to quit listening to National Public Radio as my radio alarm clock. It really puts me in a funk and now I know why... It is depressing and it really does flavor my day and up until now all without my being aware of the influence... \"The Dow Jones was down today, gas prices were up, cost of living soared to record highs, the entire planet is heating up and we are all going to die because of it.\" CLICK!",

Blink refers to the ability to make valuable decisions and judgements in just \"the blink of an eye.\" He talks about what makes these instant judgements accurate as well as the pitfalls of snap decisions and gives several examples of each.After reading his prior book, \"Tipping Point\"The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big DifferenceI've become a big fan of Gladwell's. I think every CEO, political leader, etc. should read these books. After watching the business world and recent political events, I've come to the conclusion that leaders \"Act without thinking\"",

            "This book was extremely well written and the overall premise was quite interesting.However, the author gets mired down in his own thoughts at times, lacks a cohesive centralized point, and the end result is a bunch of scattered writings that are well-written but unnecessarily verbose and leave you wondering whether you should continue reading.I forced myself to continue reading this book simply because I enjoyed the author's writing style. Plus, I thought his individual articles about the possiblities of the mind making rational/irrational decisions was quite fascinating. In essence, the subject matter was great, but the book really lacked in conveying a centralized meaning. It did whet my appetite to learn more about this subject, so I suppose that is a good thing.I give this book 2 stars simply because Gladwell is an excellent writer and his theory, in general, is great. My recommendation is to skim through the book's chapters and not invest a great deal of time reading (unless you enjoy feeling like you are trapped in a verbose nightmare.)",
            "This was an amazing book. An in depth set of thoughts on how we allow momentary glimpses of our world to affect how we think. A masterful treatise on how snap judgemments show both our passions and our prejudices.",
            "I don't know even how to begin to discrube this book. It is smart and I promisse you will learn something new. I would like to borrow Nike's slogan - Just read it.",
            "An interesting take on a phenomena already described a few years earlier by Gavin deBecker in 'Gift of Fear'. Not as good as the author's earlier work 'Tipping Point'.",
            "Perfect transaction and am into the book for 25 pages and it is great and very interesting not boring at all!",
            "I just got the book and I am about halfway through, but already I can see 'blink' working in everyday situations. A great book if your looking for a better understanding of how your brain works. My only complaint is the Gladwell has a tendency to be a bit repetitive, making it a slightly tedious read, but still well worth the time.",
            "The author describes the main subject of this book as \"thin- slicing\" which is our ability to gauge what is really important. During this we often make better decisions then a well researched decision. He also states that , \"analysis paralysis\", or information overload can often times cloud our judgment. People will need to shift their focus to only the most critical information in order to make the best decision. The author also talks about the halo effect, in which people build a perception using one or two traits that \"overshadow\" the other traits. In example, if you see someone who is wearing dirty clothes and their hair is messy, you may think of them as being poor, when in reality he could be a wealthy doctor that was just working in his yard.I never looked at Malcom Gladwells articles in the New Yorker. From reading other reviews it seems like this book is a compilation of different articles and they are criticizing that fact. It doesn't make a difference to someone like me. I find his books to be informative and easy to read. Like any business book though you may find that the author over exaggerates on a certain theory or point they are trying to make. Many business books you will find also that the same famous examples are used over and over again. Just skip over it and continue reading.My philosophy is read as much as you can, even if you don't agree with the others person or groups point of view, their view just helps you build a basis to better support your own opinion. This book is good for marketers, business owners, MBA students and people that are interested in building insight on spontaneous decision making.",
            "Overall the theory and analysis are interesting and the stories to support Gladwell's theory is interesting. I enjoyed the studies that were done and all the research for the first half to three quarters of the book but ultimatly the conclusion was incomplete and without a lot of hard core statistics to support anything.",
            "Blink deals with our innate capability to make snap judgments in the blink of an eye. Malcolm Gladwell strives to address three broad themes in this yet another masterpiece. He lays out that snap judgments could be every bit as good as ones taken after prolonged deliberation. He then states that we need to know when to trust such instincts and when we must be wary of them. Lastly, he states that the the human mind can indeed be trained to control and enable rapid cognition.What follows is a deep-dive into the way human beings judge situations and come to instant conclusions. It turns out that we are all experts at 'thin slicing' - an ability to find patterns based on choosing specific experiences & filtering out the rest. And as we are thin slicing, our subconscious mind does guide us towards a conclusion. To prove this point, Gladwell takes us through the world of art experts (who, at a moment's observation identify a fake), a marriage analyst (who, upon looking at perceptible facial expressions & hearing conversations determines the strength of a marriage) and medical malpractice lawyers (who can hear snippets of a doctor's conversation with his patient and conclude his risk of being sued). As you go through such examples, you marvel at his ability in marshaling his points and presenting them in such a manner that you can actually relate to them.But how do we sift the meaningless slices from the important ones? Gladwell states that slicing based on physical attributes, stature and stereotypes are best avoided. In other words, you change the way you thin slice. And, it would help to reasonably limit the options/choices that you use to arrive at a conclusion.While the first two objectives of the book are well structured, it is the third aspect that the book lacks, viz. how can the human mind be trained. The reader is only advised that he must 'practice'; the examples mentioned thereafter are on how repeated mind reading enabled under less pressure could lead to reduction in accidental police fatalities. While I wholeheartedly agree that practice makes perfect, I definitely would have liked better examples. Or may be, there is no better example than sustained experience?Regardless, this is yet another brilliant book from one of the world's most original thinkers. The next time you come to a conclusion in the blink of an eye, try to ascertain what you did. You may be surprised by what you find.",
            "I find it funny that people say this book is not as good as the Tipping Point. My opinion is the exact opposite. I found the Tipping Point laborious and smacking of pseudo-science. In comparison, Blink is a really good read and deals with science much better. Gladwell does have the gift of translating studies and research into a cogent narrative.",
            "This blink CD is not what I expected. I don't know if this type of CD is the only available CD or not. The main thing is this CD does not go according to the book. Therefore the purpose I bought the CD did not serve.",
            "The description that something `makes you think' no longer means that something `fills your mind with novel thought,' but rather that something `makes you skeptical of established beliefs.' The new meaning is useful, but some things out there just fill you with inspirational and amazing thoughts and those valuable things are what should receive the description. Malcolm Gladwell's `Blink' is one of those valuable things.This is ironic, of course, because the whole book is dedicated to turning off thinking--the author aims to \"think without thinking.\" Gladwell says that we may be \"better off without thinking,\" but what makes his book so fascinating is that it makes you wonder, speculate, and think.He makes his case for `snap decisions' well by describing examples when `thinking too much' led to incorrect and sometimes expensive mistakes. The book's opening example of museum curators who tirelessly studied a potential acquisition with the finest carbon dating tools and latest scientific processes was compelling. The curators concluded that the acquisition was authentic and bought the piece for millions of dollars only to find out later that it was a fake. All of their `thinking' couldn't uncover the truth that (as it turned out) experts could easily pick out in the `blink of an eye.'The moral (although not completely explained in the book) is that science, procedure, and thinking in general require `abstraction,' which is the process of reducing the whole truth into a smaller, more easily accessible truth. This allows us to expand our knowledge and hold on to it much longer than if we attempted to remember the whole truth. Since it is not the whole truth, the process of abstraction can distort or lose the truth altogether. As such, we would sometimes do better by scraping all our abstract knowledge and simply focusing on what we see in front of us. This is the central theme of `Blink.'Of course, the fact remains that without abstraction we could not know as much or remember as long as we do, and most human advance would be lost. Abstraction is a tool that has been elemental in man's ascent and cannot be discarded as completely obstructive.The author even proves this fact in his effort to diminish thinking. That is because many of his examples feature scientists' elaborate experiments aimed ascertaining the importance of simple, split-second judgment. Thinking is used to denigrate thinking.Inconsistencies like this foil any attempt at producing a solid idea and in the end `Blink' becomes not more than a series of stories. Most of the stories are really fascinating and invigorating and it must be said that they are expertly written. It is for these stories that one should pick up the book. But, ultimately, the stories (all stories) are just examples taken out of context--they are abstractions and lead to the same kind of mistakes Gladwell is trying to abolish.Read the book, but enjoy how much it makes you think and it will be worth it.",
            "\"Blink\" conceptualizes a new manner of thinking about our cognitive abilities. Rather than focusing on the power of the human mind and its ability to understand and solve problems through the development of complex statistical models and qualitative means of evaluation, author Malcom Gladwell dwells on the ability of the human subconscious and our ability to make snap decisions. Told through a series of entertaining and vivid vignettes, \"Blink\" illustrates how our thought processes can be both our greatest tool and our greatest impediment in making our most important decisions.Throughout \"Blink\", Gladwell highlights a variety of research dedicated to understanding human cognition and shows how that research can help us improve our understanding of people, our decisions, and human emotions. From art dealers to major military decision-makers Gladwell shows the role of our unconscious thoughts understanding the world around us. \"Blink\" reads like a novel, but manages to be powerfully informative.Gladwell mixes information with a deeper inquisition of the status quo and pushes the reader to challenge their perceptions of the world. He shows that we can become trapped behind the limitations of our own thinking or deceived by the falsehood of the \"truths\" we have been presented. I was thoroughly entertained by \"Blink\" and I found that it presented a similarly fresh perspective to that of Freakonomics.Gladwell integrates an underlying moral imperative to ensure that our decisions are not based upon prejudices or biases which we may be unaware of. I would recommend \"Blink\" to any reader, but it has powerful implications for those involved with the social sciences or those forced to make complex decisions with little information. \"Blink\" won't necessarily provide you with new mental tools, but it will ensure that you are properly using the ones that you already have.",
            "I have just re-read this. It first came out in 2005 and I probably read it about then. Of course, I'd forgotten a lot of the detail.The main premise is that when we make decisions we already have a lot of information in our adaptive subconscious that means we often need very little time to make our decisions. Sometimes having too much information input does not improve our decision making - we can make decisions with very little information. Sometimes our adaptive unconscious leads us to make racist and sexist decisions - despite our otherwise strongly held beliefs, but we can work around those.Easy to read - not full of jargon, but still thoughtful and thought provoking. There is a longish section about Dr Paul Ekman and microexpressions - he is the inspiration for the main character int he TV show \"Lie to Me\". I also enjoyed his discussion surrounding the Pepsi Challenge, new Coke, and taste tests.What I particularly liked about the book is the extended example - Gladwell takes one event/situation and teases it out so that the full implications/ramifications can be seen. He then refers back to some of the conclusions throughout the book, thereby cementing your understanding.An easy to read book that will get you thinking and looking at the world and yourself in a different way.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Gladwell does a great job of using real world examples to draw you in and then backing it up with research / science. The subject matter in another's hands could be deadly dull, but he's a very good writer and the topic is captivating - how we think, the value of snap judgments, and the amazing capacity of our brains to put stuff together. There aren't any final gotcha conclusions but he puts out a lot of interesting ideas and I feel like it might change my behavior in some ways. For instance, how can we use the active subconscious / quick judgments and not feel like everything needs to rely on data and spelled out logic?I definitely found myself wanting to share the ideas in this book with others. Highly recommended.",
            "\"This was a gift from my employer... a signed copy from Malcolm Gladwell ! An amazingly gripping book. Couldn't put it down!The book tells about the power of subconscious, the power and dangers of decisions that we take in a blink. I was always amazed by the current behavior of the cops in the US and why two cops don't ride together when they have to wait for a cover anyway! This book provides answers to many questions of the subconscious and poses many more which remain unanswered! Where to use the power of blink and where not! Just like the Inception !!!\" . The only reason I am taking one point off is because it left me confused.",
            "From page 1-100 I couldn't peel myself away from this intriguing concept. Thin slicing is something we all do, yet never realize. Blink shows us what's really behind that first impression, and gives us interesting insight to the subconscious. I recommend Blink to anyone remotely interesting in the field of psychology, or even if you just have an interest in the workings of your brain.",
            "Blink was a fascinating and intriguing read. This book presented detailed examples of various situations where people either went with their instinct or against it. And the book gave the coincidences that occurred when people went against their instincts. Also, Blink explains what triggered someone's instincts and usually this happens in the first few seconds. This book makes you think.",
            "This is one of those books that some people will just 'get' and others won't. For me, it was like someone finally articulated what I inherently knew about my own mind and thinking --but couldn't describe. I hope Mr. Gladwell will delve more deeply into this theory of instant perceptions, reactions and judgments in a subsequent book. I am fascinated with the ideas he presents --so much so that I am buying the book (again) for my library after having left my copy on an airplane.",
            "Interesting but not outstanding.....nothing really ground breaking..... mostly thoughts you have had..",
            "This book is a ten ton hornet's nest dropped smack dab in a city full of people allergic to hornets. The book starts out good. There's some bit about a statue. I never get a really good fix on what's happening in Blink. I recommend this book only for readers who have the time to delve into a really good story without needing excitement every page. All in all, except for a few missteps, this rip roaring yarn delivers the goods.",
            "It's kind of like an example in the book: the doctors get sued for medical malpractice because they don't talk to patients as nicely, not because they make more mistakes than others.I keep reading the book because it presents some interesting information in good writing, not because the information presented justifies the book title or I agree with Malcolm's claims.To its credit the book can provoke some thinking, but after my thinking I'm not convinced of what it tries to say. Many studies referenced in the book lack some important pieces to be convincing (e.g. showing that experiments constructed based on the negative theory yield consistently different results), while others prove much less than what Malcolm claims they prove.",
            "This was a quick and enjoyable read that helps to explain why snap judgements are so pervasive and sometimes valid, othertimes not. Of particular relevance to those in law and policing are the sections implying how deeply imbedded prejudice is. The analysis of the Amadou Diallo killing and other police shooting incidents (at the end of the book) was excellent because it makes accessible to the general public that the problem is ameliorable through better training, that it is not just demon cops or demon criminals.",

            "Malcolm Gladwell's BLINK: THE POWER OF THINKING WITHOUT THINKING offers a smorgasbourd of short essays in this extremely short book. The main premise of the book emphasizes on the power of intuition and snap judgments when making decisions, and especially first impressions which may not always achieve successful results depending on a particular situation and experience one has had in the past. In two examples, Gladwell uses Warren G. Harding, and the extremely unfortunate case of Amadou Diallo in determining that one cannot be judged by his appearance --race or good looks. In the end, these two examples led to uncalculated failure as a result of inexperience.Gladwell does not present ground breaking new hypotheses, but rather allows readers to think, \"what if...\" He reevaluates the evidence that each case study has previously concluded with, and shows in a reader friendly analysis that any person, regardless of their educational or social background, will either understand or gain new insight on a particular subject, such as assessing validity and authenticity of an ancient artifact, or picking the next \"big thing\" in the music business. If at all, BLINK may cause readers to reevaluate their own way of thinking.Overall, BLINK will enlighten any reader that attempts to read it. It's an exceptional book that only takes a couple of hours to complete. Most likely, the book will allow those who read it to engage in further discussion or to probe each issue with a critical eye.",
            "Sometimes I wonder if some of us, including me, have extended the blink too long. Maybe turned it into a nap. Malcolm provides real insight into the how consiously and unconsiously the world between our ears works. It is really all about us. Expanding our awareness, expanding our consiousness is the key to developing the skills and abilities that elevate us.Malcolm wrote a great book to expand our awareness. Interested in learning more....read the book.Enjoy!",
            "I loved this book. The idea of \"thin-slicing\" or following your gut is well demonstrated. If you like Gladwell'sThe Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference, you will love this one too.",
            "This book taught: The mind functions without our awareness, decisions are made before we enter into situations, To be awake is to know the mind self, and more",
            "I love Malcolm Gladwell. He writes well, he's funny, challenging, and never pedantic while teaching across many disciplines.\"Blink\" is my favorite of his books so far. It might have saved me from 2 bad marriages had it been written soon enough!Understanding when to trust your gut instinct or intuition and when to use your logical mind could change your life. I'll say no more, you have to read without knowing the subject matter.I'm thrilled the library had a long waiting list for this so I ended up buying it!",

            "Alot has already been said about this book, so I'll be brief. I found it not only an enjoyable read, but incredibly thought provoking. There are more than a few lessons to take with you from this book. Oh, and it's a really fast read. So don't spend alot of time analyzing, trust your thin-slice judgement, and pick this one up!",
            "This was my first Gladwell book, and so far my favorite. He covers a lot of interesting areas, although occasionally falls short of explaining them fully.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell has a rare talent for taking what we believe we understand and making it truly understandable. He has the ability to get us to stop for a moment and really think. He has a way using examples which allow any thinking person to relate what he is saying to personal experiences in our own everyday lives. This should be required reading in all of our schools.",
            "Similar in style to Gladwell's wonderful The Tipping Point, Blink provides fascinating stories and studies about how we make split decisions all the time, and how we are seldom aware of it. The studies that show our hidden biases are very disturbing as we try and assimilate ourselves into our multi-cultural society. However, as Gladwell concludes, being aware of those things that affect our decision making is the first step to changing them. The book does get bogged done a bit during countless descriptions of the mussels in our faces in a discussion about how our faces give away what we are really feeling, but besides that section the book sails quickly on Gladwell's engaging style.",
            "I really enjoyed this book. Many of the concepts presented aren't topics that I normally think about or talk about. Fascinating to learn more about what goes on in my mind, \"behind the door\" as described in the book. If you are a student of human behavior, or an interest in intuition or decision making, read this book! Very informative and an excellent read.",
            "This book is fun to read and thought-provoking. Gladwell makes the point that much of what we do is necessarily based on snap judgments. For people who understand a subject thoroughly, such quick thinking is a good thing. For people who are ignorant of important facts, snap judgments are often very wrong indeed. Gladwell uses the amusing example of Warren Harding, whose rise to the presidency was based on nothing more than good looks and pleasant manners. In office Harding's ignorance led to one poor decision after another. This sort of thing is all too prevalent today. In my opinion, it's one of the best explanations available for the lackluster political career of George W. Bush. An increase in ignorance is unfortunately a characteristic of our day; Bush's lack of knowledge is common among voters and politicians alike. The result? Believers in astrology and ghosts are everywhere. Most people have no understanding of evolution, or even of such basic facts as the origin of the irreplaceable oil we burn daily.One of Gladwell's main ideas is that humans tend to overestimate our own rationality. However, he also points out that there are ways to organize society to compensate for these tendencies. Here's to hoping we succeed.",
            "This book is full of highly entertaining and thought-provoking psychology studies, true life stories, etc.But the oraganization as a book has major flaws. Here are three:1. TMIS - Too Much Information Syndrome.2. Hard-to-follow Organization, from cover to cover.3. Evidence doesn't support main arguments.****************************************1. TMIS - Too Much Information Syndrome.****************************************One hugely ironic example: When the author tried to demonstrate that when doctors at Cook County Hospital Emergency Department treat chest-pain patients, many seemingly important medical details (e.g. drinking habits) can be ignored (for more accurate diagnosis! yes, no kidding!) and therefore help more patients, he writes:\"[The department head] was raised in New York City, the product of a classical Jesuiteducation: Regis for High School, where he had four yearsof Latin and Greek, and Fordham University for college,where he read everything from the ancients to Wittgensteinand Heidegger and thought about an academic career inphilosophy...\"How are these details related to the main message?And they are not even remotely important at all.*******************************************************Second, Hard-to-follow organization, from cover to cover.*******************************************************Just two examples among many:The introduction chapter tells the reader about the three tasks of the book. That's nice, but if you want to find them, good luck. They are buried in the middle of 2nd section:\"The Internal Computer\" (and first two tasks are in the middle of paragraphs).The closing chapter tells us the two lessons of Blink (sort of).The first lesson (\"We are often careless about our snap judgement\") isn't obvious until the reader encounters the mentioning of the second lesson and it is at the third sentence of second paragraph of page 252:The second lesson, which begins as a second sentence in last paragraph on page 252, is about we can make our snap judgement better.*******************************************************Third, Evidence doesn't directly support main arguments.*******************************************************A pair of contrasting examples of this flaw are in Chapter 4: Creating Structure for Spontaneity. From the title I'd assume the author will show us creating a structure can spawn (good) spontaneity (and maybe how to create a structure, etc.)The author presents two long, long cases.First case is about a Pantagon war game in 2002. This includes an inspiring account of the more \"spontaneous\" team won the war game. But not much is said about how structure was built or how structure helped or what the structure was.Second case is about Emergency Department of the Chicago Cook County Hospital. This example has a stunning tale of how doctors used a structured approach to improve their treatment of patients. But nothing is said about \"spontaneity\".******************5 stars for nuggets of fascinating information in this book.2 stars for many flaws for it. Round up to 4 -:)",
            "It's good to exposed to Gladwell's thinking. It can stretch you a bit.And we need to encourage good writing-that is, writing that is clear, intelligent, and crisp.All that said, there's little other than the above of value. It's remarkably thin, actually, especially on reflection. His apparent point of view is that snap judgments are good, except when they aren't.And everything he offers suggests that snap judgments-or at least those he discusses-are neither snap nor judgments. They are conclusions based on years of experience.In the end, this book dissolves into very little. You cannot say you learned much from it, or even were coaxed toward deeper understanding and insight. All you can say is that you may, or may not, have enjoyed the ride.That books like these are our best sellers may be the most compelling information to glean from all of this. There's not much here here, to steal and paraphrase from Gertrude Stein. .All this said, I will at least scan his next book, simply because the author gets access to some interesting studies on human behavior. We're better served by his New Yorker articles, not least of all because they are as long as they need to be to impart the information.Maybe a 3.5. And I do hope he keeps reporting, because he covers what others do not.",

If I ever hear the term \"thin-slicing\" again, it will be too soon!While some of the examples were good, there was just too much repetition. Basically, it reads like a textbook. I expected to learn how to use the information provided, rather than read the same examples over and over again. This information would have been better shared in a magazine article with a handful of examples. There is no way this book deserved the acclaim it has received. Do not waste your money.",

He tries to impress you with stories of the rogue general who beat the big bad US, and about the classical archeologist who just felt something was wrong. He tries to tell you about the 1920 election and the most perfect yet ugly chair. He tries to explain that all of these ideas are related to a power none of us can control or really understand.

Paint drying boring.Gladwell's epiphany: humans make quick subconscious decisions that are often correct. However, sometimes subconscious stereotypes can result in wrong decisions. Duh.If my review can save two people the pain of purchasing and attempting to read this book, at least I will have gotten some value out of the book.",
            "After his bestselling book brought the phrase \"tipping point\" into popular usage, which is that moment when an idea, product or concept suddenly catches fire with the population at large, Malcolm Gladwell now gives us two more phrases that are likely to become equally well-known: \"blink\" and \"thin-slicing.\"We \"blink\" when we think without thinking. We do that by \"thin-slicing,\" using limited information to come to our conclusion. What's interesting is that in our age of information overload, according to Gladwell, we often make better decisions with snap judgments than we do with volumes of analysis.The book opens with what reads like a heart-racing detective story about the discovery of a statue that initially fooled one group of art experts for being genuine and was later shown to be a fake by another group. The first group had exhaustively studied and analyzed the statue. Members of the second took one look --- \"blinked\" --- and declared it suspect and ultimately a forgery. And they were right. Why? How did they know? Why was the first group so wrong? Are there dangers in overanalyzing? Are we always right when we blink? Can we be wrong, even dead wrong? What is the science behind blinking? What can we learn from this phenomenon?Gladwell addresses these questions and gives a wide range of examples of blinking from the worlds of gambling, speed-dating, tennis, war games, the movies, malpractice suits, popular music, and predicting divorce. Interspersed are accounts of scientific studies that partially, but never completely, explain the largely unconscious phenomenon that we have all experienced at one time or another in our lives. Nevertheless, the hypotheses, the scientific experiments, and the examples are very interesting.A researcher tells the story of a firefighter in Cleveland who answered a routine call with his men. It was in the back of a one-and-a-half story house in a residential neighborhood in the kitchen. The firefighters broke down the door, laid down their hose, and began dousing the fire with water. It should have abated, but it didn't. As the fire lieutenant recalls, he suddenly thought to himself, \"There's something wrong here,\" and he immediately ordered his men out. Moments after they fled, the floor they had been standing on collapsed. The fire had been in the basement, not the kitchen as it appeared. When asked how he knew to get out, the fireman thought it was ESP, which of course it wasn't. What is interesting to Gladwell is that the fireman could not immediately explain how he knew to get out. From what Gladwell calls \"the locked box\" in our brains, our fireman just \"blinked\" and made the right decision. In fact, if the fireman had deliberated on the facts he was seeing, he would have likely lost his life and the lives of his men.It took well over two hours of questioning for the fire lieutenant to piece together how he knew to get out. (First, the fire didn't respond as it was supposed to; second, the fire was abnormally hot; third, it was quiet when it should have been noisier given the heat.)One take-away from the book is that how we blink is a function of our experiences, training, and knowledge. For example, prejudice is so unconsciously woven into our society that, despite our best intentions, at an unconscious level it can lead to really bad blinks. This is partly why tall people are frequently seen as natural leaders when there is no basis in reality for that belief. And, in the case of the Amadou Diallo killing in 1999, it is why four policemen incorrectly thin-sliced a situation and wound up killing an innocent man by mistake.Gladwell is obviously fascinated by the phenomenon of blinking. Properly understood --- and properly prepared for --- it is a valid way to make decisions. Gladwell says, \"A world where snap judgments and thin-slicing is taken seriously is a better place.\" I know some people who might object to that viewpoint, particularly when it comes to decision-making in foreign policy, but if you want an entertaining read, fast-paced, rich in entertaining anecdotes and some unusual scientific research, then BLINK is worth picking up.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's Blink is about decision making, in particular about making decisions on the spur of the moment. Gladwell's contention is that, however counterintuitive it may be, snap decisions are very often superior to those resulting from long hours of thought and research: having too much information, it turns out, can impede decision making. The trick is that the person dong the deciding must be sufficiently informed about a topic that he can, consciously or not, isolate the salient factors in a given situation, disregarding extraneous information, and come to a conclusion based on them, a process known as \"thin-slicing.\"Gladwell peppers his book with intriguing examples of real-life thin-slicing: a fireman's snap decision while spraying flames in a burning kitchen to order his men out of the building--moments before the floor collapses; the immediate certainty of a number of art experts upon looking at a particular statue, a Greek kouros which exhaustive tests had indicated was genuine, that it is in fact a modern forgery--a suspicion later proved correct. In these cases the experts could not explain at once the reasons for their snap decisions. Their unconscious minds had sifted through enormous amounts of information--about the fire's behavior and sound, for example--and had spat out a conclusion--the floor is about to collapse--without their being aware of the thought process. The examples Gladwell unpacks for us are unusually dramatic, but in fact we thin-slice all the time, when we interpret people's facial expressions, or decide whether a potential suitor is desirable or not, or determine whether it's safe to cross a heavily trafficked street.Snap decisions, Blackwell demonstrates, can be very powerful, but they can also sometimes be very wrong. Gladwell explains how stress and the weight of our prior associations with what we're observing can pervert our first impressions. It is in this context that Gladwell discusses the police shooting of Amadou Diallo in the Bronx in 1999, a tragic case of individuals in a stressful situation being unable to \"mind read,\" to properly discern another's intent from his behavior and facial expressions.If my explanation of Gladwell's argument has been at all dry, then I have done his book a disservice. Blink is a simply fascinating read, studded with little mysteries--about military strategy and emergency rooms and Warren Harding and the Pepsi Challenge and innumerable other topics--that will keep readers glued to the page. Blink is also well researched and well argued and--and I don't say this lightly--stylistically flawless. This is nonfiction at its best.Debra Hamel -- author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in ancient Greece (Yale University Press, 2003)",
            "I picked up Blink solely on Gladwell's prior work, The Tipping Point. I should have allowed thin-slicing to work and passed this by.Oh, if you wish to read what dozens of other researchers have to say about snap judgements and why we make them, it is a passable read. However, if you are looking for the application in your own life...look elsewhere.Along about page 100, I wanted to put it down because it seemed to have little to say. Another thin-slice I missed. By the time I got to the end of the book, I felt like my time had been wasted...not to mention the money. The good news for me is that I got the book at a considerable discount.I agree with one of the other reviewers here, i.e., \"take a nap, instead...\"",
            "Malcolm Gladwell is a talented writer. He summarizes some good researchers' work in a very readable way (i.e. the thin slices research that was popular in academic circles a few decades ago). You'd have to be a professor to not learn something from this book, and you'd have be a Pulitzer prize winner to not appreciate the quality of the writing. These positive features earn the book 4 stars in spite of what I view as a profound flaw.The major problem with Blink is that it has no explanation for when to trust our instincts. The book title suggests that non-cognitive and rapid judgments are good. As amply pointed out by other Amazon reviewers, this idea is ludicrous. Gladwell provides no roadmap of when to trust our first impressions and when to attempt to override our first impressions.First impressions are sometimes good and sometimes horribly wrong. Now what? Gladwell provides no answer.In my own academic research, I investigate what I call the \"lizard brain\". We use our brain's prefrontal cortex when we attempt to think rationally; however, our behavior is often influenced by the rest of the brain, the lizard brain.In Gladwell's language, the lizard brain is sometimes right and sometimes wrong. The answer to knowing when to trust the lizard brain and when to shackle the lizard brain, I have come to believe, is to understand the logic of the lizard brain.The lizard brain is great for lizard activities like finding food and shade. Yet it can be terrible for other decisions. By understanding the lizard brain we can figure out when the lizard brain will help or hurt.\"A pile of sundry facts\". The great biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky said that behavioral study without underlying theory is ultimately unsatisfying. With the light of the correct theory, everything makes sense, but \"Without that light, it becomes a pile of sundry facts -- some of them interesting or curious, but making no meaningful picture as a whole.\"Because Gladwell does not understand the logic of the lizard brain -- the source of so called non-thinking -- he has produced a series of fascinating stories that make no meaningful picture as a whole.Terry BurnhamCambridge, Mass",
            "Ok! Now I read this book and thought it would be something totally out of this world (considering the buzz about it everywhere and nearly every excutive I meet citing terminology from it), but after reading it, I feel cheated out of the money I spent on it. So what does this book teach you? In one word \"nothing\" other than relating a whole spread of stories about people who can take instantaneous decisions. It is very ironical that Gladwell who exhorts to not overanalyse things spends so much time himself on the topic.Bad read for people who aim to learn things, more suited to people who are accustomed to reading publications that provide more gossip and little useful information. I think folks who shop the HSN will identify very well with the Blink way of decision making.",

If you are hoping that this book will give you some insight into how you can make more good and immediate decisions in your life you can forget about finding it in this book.This writer has the ability to puff up what should be a 3 page Reader's Digest article into 300 pages (albeit big print) and then present you with no real conclusions other than the fact that the more experience you have the better your self-conscious will help you to make good decisions, quickly.

            "I finished reading it in one sitting as it is a highly readable and entertaining book. That said, it has to be admitted that it did not reveal any significant new bits of information to me. Most of the assertions of the author are already well known. Actually little has actually come out of the authors mind and a vast portion of the book is made up of nothing but a series of anecdotes collected from various sources. The anecdotes are interesting but I did not see any of them supporting his cotention that \"blink\" judgements are better than deliberate judgements.At times I felt as if I was reading a book on the art of marketing products and services to consumers.The reason that this book is a best seller is probably because, in this age of information overload, people just do not have time to analyse all, or even part of the information available before making a decision. So, when someone comes along and says that snap decisions made on the spur of the moment can be as good, or even better, than ones reached after much deliberation, people can heave a sigh of relief for all the hard work that this will save them. However the book does not provide any guidelines as to how this \"power of thinking without thinking\" can be implemented in real life, especially in life and death situations, or in situations that impact us greatly on an emotional level. Additionally, even Gladwell admits that only the snap judgements of experts in their own fields have any validity to speak of and the snap judgements of people not belonging to that field are nothing more that random guesses.Even after reading this book I do not think anyone will actually come to completely trust his or her \"blink\" decisions. If anything, I am afraid, this book may lead many people to suddenly think themselves as expert mind-readers and lead them to form unjustifiable prejudices against many people who they meet by \"thin slicing\" a twitch of a facial muscle.If you want, just borrow this book from a library and make notes in your diary. The notes will occupy barely two pages. Save your money.",
            "In Blink, Gladwell assembles from many case studies, a strong argument for the amazing way we humans are hot-wired to make correct snap decisions based on minimal evidence. For sure, there are some astounding examples - of which the material on reading the micro-expressions of humans is the most illuminating. Clearly some people have a \"facial literacy\" that is quite astounding.But if you want to explore the reliability of the decisions we make in a blink of an eye, read up some of the writings of Kahneman and Tversky, who - on their way to winning a Nobel Prize - explored the perceptual and logical flaws commonly made by people. Or try the excellent prizewinning volume by Scott Plous: \"The Psychology of Judgment and Decisionmaking\" - which is a revealing look at our strengths and weaknesses in making judgments. In other words we're smart, but we're far from infallible. I feel Malcolm Gladwell could have balanced up his arguments somewhat without losing the immediate sense of marvel that he brings, so engagingly, to all his writing.Incidentally, another title you might check in this category is Sources of Power by Gary Klein, which looks at how people make decisions. I found this and Scott Plous' book a nice twin-act to go alongside Blink.",

While others of you with a mystical bent have seen many of these ideas already presented in Buddhism.

            "He promotes his book as a new contribution to the way we see and think, and that you would chance the way you see the world. He called it blink or thin-slice. However, he just rediscover the wheel because thin-slice is pretty much a synonimous of \"clinic eye\" and this concept is very old. For instance, I heard about clinic eye about 15 years ago, and I know that it was not something new at that time. Clinic eye is like when you mechanic tells you what is wrong with you car in a few seconds by just looking its smock. Clinic eye is when a police think somebody is suspicious by just looking on his behavior and look in a few seconds. Clinic eye is when you mother tell you that somebody would not be a good fried in a few seconds by just looking at him. Pretty much this book is about \"clinic eye\", but he called it \"thin slice\". The book would not teach you how to improve this skill or how to developed this skill, but it will give you a bunch of examples of clinic eye that pretty much you wont need. IT IS OFFICIAL, THIS BOOK WAS ABSOLUTELY A WASTE OF MY TIME. PLEASE DONT READ IT!!.",

All the relevant information is presented in the first few chapters : the rest of the book is pretty much a \"repeat and rehash\" of the original concept. Which by the way is not a novel one at all.

            "I thought the examples were good. If the research was accurately presented, it was compelling.

There is the suggestion that it is possible to develop this capacity. I felt like a salesman had gotten me all excited about the features of this new, fabulous, remarkable car, then walked away from me refusing to work with me to buy it. SUMMARY: A big buildup to a big let down.",
            "I started this book in the early morning and couldn't put it down until I had read it all. The author challenges the traditional notion that intuitive decisions are based on mounds of subconscious information. He shares his concept of \"thin slicing\" with compelling examples. A worthwhile read.",
            "As a political organizer I found Gladwell's \"Tipping Point\" to be essential reading for anyone looking for a better understanding about how to change people's minds. I had hoped that \"Blink\" would offer further insight. On some levels it does - Gladwell's theory seems to be accurate. Despite being an excellent writer, however, he harms his thesis by using poor examples.The general idea behind \"Blink\" is how to make better snap judgments by examining those who are successful at making such quick judgments and those who have made blunders in various circumstances (whether they be expert or not).On the issue of having excess knowledge Gladwell uses the example of the US military practicing for Gulf War II against an \"unnamed Middle Eastern leader.\" (It's obvious the person they had in mind was Saddam Hussein.) He repeatedly refers to this leader as having \"strong religious support.\" Illustrating Gladwell's unfamiliarity with the topic he fails to mention in his analysis of the military that Saddam was a _secular_ leader and was viewed as evil by Islamic fundamentalists. In other words, one of the key elements of the _premise_ created by the military (which Gladwell does not question) is obviously false.Gladwell insinuates that the US military has had trouble in Iraq because it concentrated on having too much intelligence and can't filter out what is important. While they may or may not be true as a contributing negative factor, it is an argument that shows a lack of political knowledge. There is clear evidence, as stated by the former head of the National Security Agency and Counter Intelligence at the CIA, that the Bush administration pushed for analysis that would reflect their goals. These obvious political motivations don't even enter into Gladwell's analysis. But then, that would destroy this example as a metaphor for his overall (legitimate) thesis.This failure to question the premise for one's actions shows up in one of his most central examples - the NYPD shooting of an unarmed black man who was reaching for his wallet. Gladwell isolates the incident to a few seconds. This fits his theory. He never addresses the general NYC environment in which many New Yorkers felt they were under assault by the police. This environment, combined with an obvious focus on racial minorities, helped create the shooting. Obviously, the police didn't intend to kill an innocent man. But their actions took place within a larger context - and Gladwell ignores it completely.The most glaring flaw in Gladwell's examples is his insistence on using issues of personal taste as proof that someone is somehow an \"expert\" or \"knows more than others.\"For example, Gladwell repeatedly talks about the singer Kenna and how he was shafted by the music industry because flawed surveys showed that the public wouldn't like his work. I listened to several Kenna songs after reading this book. I don't like Kenna! But this doesn't make me right and Gladwell wrong. It just means we have different tastes. It comes off as nothing less than arrogance on the part of Gladwell to argue that experts inherently know more when it comes to something as personal as musical preferences which are so obviously linked to culture, family upbringing, etc.Despite these huge criticisms, I think Gladwell's theory is correct. We can make quicker judgments if we're able to filter out all the excess garbage. This works when we're dealing with a B&W; outcome. For example, is this art real or fake? Does this medical procedure help or harm patients? Does this police procedure benefit the commuhity? These are all examples used in the book. They work. It's just a shame that Gladwell had to muddy up the water with all these other inappropriate examples.",
            "Gladwell writes in an engaging manner, but his methods are suspect. Thousands of psychological experiments are conducted each year at universities around the world in an effort to advance knowledge. Cherry-picking the ones with broad appeal and presenting them (out of context and without mention of their methodological constraints) is just plain wrong. Fine for a superficial understanding of certain topics. Read Roy Baumeister for a better integration of experimental findings and real-world concerns.Note to Gladwell: psychological questionnaires are not \"highly respected\", they are either valid or not, that is they either adequately measure the targeted psychological characteristics or they don't.",
            "The main idea behind \"Blink,\" is how to make fast judgements by examining those who are very successful at doing so. I would suggest reading the conclusion first, then the whole book. The author's thesis has merit, we can learn to make better, & faster decisions when we filter out all the excess data.Here are some of his examples. Does the new Police procedure benefit the community? Will the new medical procedure do more harm than good? Can we determine a persons character by observing their living space? The author gives various examples where the mind works based on biases that are not always in the realm of the conscience thought. That clearly is true. Mr. Gladwell is good at recognizing interesting things, whether it is rapid cognition, or a tipping point.A fine example of this was President Warren Harding on pages 72-75, about appearances being favored over substance. But, after page 98 I felt that he posed more questions than he answered. His example about \"Gulf war 2\" being against a fundamentalist leader, showed historical ignorance. Saddam was always a \"secular dictator.\" He also negates to analyze the politicizing of U.S. intelligence information about the Iraq war. It seemed simplistic not to question the premise for someones actions. His examples about the awful Police shooting in N.Y., & the music of Kenna are isolated to fit his thesis. He tries to hammer a square peg into a round hole. This illogical insistence on using matters of personal taste as proof that someone is an \"expert,\" takes away from the positives of the book. In conclusion, I think forty Percent of the book is a worthy read. The remaining sixty percent was too anecdotal for my taste.",
            "I will start by saying that this book does make some interesting points about using our current understanding of the brain and human reactions under stress within institutional frameworks in ways that MIGHT help make a better society. It even may inspire a few people to be more conscious and alert to their surroundings. But an epiphany or cure-all pill for humanity it is not. If you're looking for personal realization you might try meditating for few years. Much of the personal aspect of this book can be had from far more ancient wisdom that doesn't cost $18. I should say that there are some interesting bits of information and the reading is easy so the fluff doesn't seem so bad, but Gladwell stretches his arguments pretty thin and comes to some dubious conclusions. In many ways this book lulls you into thinking that it might actually have something to say and in the end all you really have are a few more trivia facts on modern psychology and neuroscience and few opinions about why some musicians are overlooked, some police make mistakes and some museums dupe themseleves into buying counterfeits. For me it was an easy read that I didn't have to think about too much about that got me through a very very long excursion in todays world of US airports. Take what you will from this.",
            "In education, standardized tests have become a way of life. As a student, I happened to be very good at these types of multiple-choice tests. One reason I was good at these tests was that I realized something early on: my first instinct was almost always right. The few times I thought over an answer and decided to change it, I nearly always changed the right answer into a wrong one.This experience came to me as I was reading Malcolm Gladwell's book, Blink. Essentially, this is a book about making snap judgements. As Mr. Gladwell points out, all of us are constantly making choices \"in the blink of an eye.\" The question is, why are some people better at making these kind of snap judgements than others?The answer, as Mr. Gladwell describes it, seems to be: preparation. All of us make our judgements based on our experience--experience that becomes so ingrained that we can become ultimately unaware of why we know what we know. I was a rigorous student, so I was prepared to make the right judgement on tests and I learned to trust that judgement. In his book, Mr. Gladwell describes a number of interesting instances of this: art critics who can instantly recognize fakes, tennis coaches who can predict a double fault before the serve is complete, the counselor who can tell which marriages will fail from listening to a couple converse with each other. He then goes on to describe research that can pick apart these situations and help us understand what in these persons' experience has given them these abilities.But Mr. Gladwell is also aware that snap judgements can lead us into error. In Blink, he looks at some great failures of judgement like the Diallo shooting, the election of Warren G. Harding as U.S. President and the introduction of New Coke. What seems to set these events apart is that, whereas in the successful examples the judgements are made by individual experts in narrow fields, in the failures the settings are social ones where the decisions are made by groups. In these groups, cultural influences have colored our experiences and often in a negative, albeit unconsciously negative, way. The subtle associations of African-Americans with crime and charisma with success can lead us down the wrong paths in ways we may not even expect.How, then, to successfully \"thin-slice,\" as Mr. Gladwell calls it? Awareness. Once we become aware of our prejudices, we can mold our minds and sharpen our experiences. Then we will be better prepared to make choices. In this powerful book full of excellent examples and descriptions of current research, Mr. Gladwell has provided a step to that awareness. It is well worth reading.",
            "Blink is disappointing.The theme is good. The value of snap judgments and thin-slicing is useful. And enjoyable. And entertaining.So what is wrong?Well, Gladwell says it all in the first 5 pages. The rest of the book is examples, and more examples and many more examples.He should have realized that we will 'get it' in a blink. And then left us alone. Except for the beginning, the book is probabaly aimed at satisfying the minimum word count for publication.Just read the reviews and summaries. The book has nothing to add.",
            "This is a readable and even engaging book on decision making, but although I sympathize with the author's main thesis about rapid judgments (people are often right about these, but then, they're often wrong, too), he's a little too facile in discussing some of the more technical psychology and neurobiology and whether that evidence truly supports his thesis. For example, as another poster here mentioned, the fusiform gyrus isn't a piece of software but is an anatomical area of the cerebral cortex. But Gladwell not being a trained neuroscientist I can forgive him for confusing anatomy with functionality.However, Gladwell's theory that accomplished experts in various fields can often intuit, or on the basis of very small \"slices\" of information, often make quick and very complex decisions is nothing really knew, and it might or might not have anything to do with the ability to make snap judgments in general. It could be that such experts are quite competent in a particular area that taps into their cognitive and analytical strengths but they are incapable of making such decisions in other areas. It's more likely that people who have the ability to make quick judgments in many areas function differently from those who don't. For example, I can make quick analyses and decisions in two or three areas that I know well, but in other areas of my life I have to sit down and think and deliberate more. All this means is that some decisions are information intensive and some aren't, and if you're skilled in a particular area you can function faster than someone who has to work more slowly through the relevant information or decision-making steps.Another important point to remember is that power doesn't always equate to speed, either. For example, it's said that Einstein wasn't a very quick thinker, but leave him alone with paper and pencil and his mind could go further than any physicist of his generation, because of his powerful analytical and visual/spatial skills. Hence, rapid decision making, although perhaps useful on the battlefield or at the yearly stockholder's meeting, doesn't necessarily equate to quality and depth which is probably more important in the long run. It's also sobering to consider that more and more we seem to be electing politicians on the basis of their ability to come up with facile and great-sounding 20-second sound bytes that are hardly a realistic test of a candidate's ability to actually lead, govern, or come up with new and viable policies and solutions to our social problems. By that criterion Einstein couldn't have gotten elected to his local city council. But he's definitely someone you'd want on your team because of his ability to think creatively and deeply about many problems.That having been said, much of the organization of the human brain relates to generalized, quick decision making, although mostly on a sensory processing level. The human brain is extremely adept at combining inputs from all the sensory modalities in real time and being able to select and make decisions on the most vital information. This is aided by multi-sensory and multi-associational neurons in the anterior parietal cortex just above and to the side of the visual cortical receiving areas. The technical jargon aside, this makes perfect commmon sense if you think about it. If something is stalking you and may eat you, and you hear a twig snap, well, it could be your buddy, or it could be a big tiger or other predator. All animals (including humans) know when to haul a_s and get the hell out of there when they see or hear or smell something suspicious. These sorts of sensory abilities make such quick, selective responses possible. This is actually the most convincing evidence for the sort of abilities Gladwell is writing about, but it's not discussed in the book.One other minor technical point, I also agree with the previous writer that I don't understand what the author means by rapid heartbeats shutting down the motor systems. Obviously, certain abnormal cardiac conditions can impair motor functioning (it only takes about a four-second interruption in blood flow to the brain to result in unconciousness, which would certainly tend to interfere with motor control :-)) But other than a heart attack or a loss of blood circulation to the brain or serious arhythmias, such as fibrillation, which, depending on whether they occur in the ventricles or the auricles, can be potentially fatal vs. merely annoying and slightly debilitating, I'm not aware of anything like that. However, I'm not a doctor (I'm a neurobiologist by academic training) so I don't claim to be an authority on that area.However, I give the book 3 stars for effort, and some of the stories and info was interesting.",
            "Let me start off by saying that I read this book and really liked it. In fact, the pragmatic side of me is refusing to find offense in a chapter of the book that would highly offend others with loved ones with Autism. This book was fascinating and will change the way I think and behave.And then the other shoe drops...I never would have read this book if someone had mentioned the chapter using Autistic as an adjective. And maybe it would have been my loss, but when you live, breathe, and lose someone to the quiet of Autism, you lose a part of you--even if they eventually become high-functioning and casually indistinguishable from their peers. I can't imagine how hurtful this book might have been to someone with a newly-diagnosed child or an adult family member struggling to be independent.Let me include some quotes. This is how Autism is introduced: \"...the way that people with autism see the world gives us a very good sense of what happens when our mind-reading faculties fail.\"(I guess the fact that I still capitalize Autism--when I know it's not technically capitalized tells you I'm not as far removed as I pretend, but anyway....)Gladwell goes on to describe studies on those with Autism and layer by layer establishes that the subjects of these studies lack social awareness including missing social cues and relating to people as objects and often as tools. For those unfamiliar with Autism, this could be a really good look at the symptoms and thought processes of some in the Autism spectrum.For those familiar with Autism and those who've just read this book on how stereotypes color our blink reflexes, his use of the term \"normal\" to describe those in the studies without Autism or just everyone without Autism--grates. In a clinical sense, are Autistic people abnormal in some ways? Yes. Would you ever describe someone's loved one as abnormal? I hope not.And this is where this book fails in my opinion. Gladwell's distilled use and portrayal of Autism as a set of abnormal symptoms often displayed in cases of heightened emotion where people behave rashly and even kill innocent people--is insensitive and possibly even offensive. Our society needs to stop seeing Autism as a clinical term and as a set of symptoms and, now, in a blink--Gladwell has just reinforced them as abnormal.He doesn't imply that Autistic people are unintelligent... in fact: \"Peter is a highly intelligent man. He has graduate degrees from a prestigious university. His IQ is well above normal...\" But then: \"But because he lacks one very basic ability--the ability to mind-read--he can be presented with that scene in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and come to a conclusion that is socially completely and catastrophically wrong.\"Catastrophically wrong.He says an Autistic man's inability to get the commonly-accepted message in a film as catastrophically wrong.Gladwell then goes on to relate many negative, violent, and often fatal situations where \"They didn't take the necessary steps to steer clear of temporary autism.\" \"What police training does, at its best, is teach officers how to keep themselves out of this kind of trouble, to avoid the risk of momentary autism.\"The chapter's primary focus is on the 1999 shooting of unarmed Amadou Diallo by four policeman--who fired at him 41 times when he went to get his wallet out. The police officer was \"not mind-reading now. He's effectively autistic. He's locked in on whatever is coming out of Diallo's pocket, just as Peter was locked in on the light switch in George and Martha's kissing scene.\"A police officer who kills an unarmed man is not effectively Autistic, but using the word in this way is effectively offensive to those dealing with a disorder that now effects 1 in 88 children.Having said that, Gladwell in his typical brilliant way presents the subject of split-second thinking very well through-out the book. I can see what he was trying to achieve here in this chapter by relating it to Autism, but not all disorders can or should be boiled down and dissected to using a part to present the whole. His clinical portrayal of a disorder as only a sum of symptoms can be and probably will be offensive to some. At some points, he swapped out the term \"mind-blind\" and I wish he'd stuck with that.For the record, I couldn't bring myself to knock off a star for this because it's obviously the viewpoint of someone not personally affected by Autism. He didn't get a five star rating because I thought his concluding points in this book weren't as strong as he finished in Outliers.",
            "About three years ago, I read an article in \"The New Yorker\" about microexpressions. They're these fleeting and nearly imperceptible expressions that cross a person's face so quickly that the average observer can only see them if you slow down recorded images.These expressions cannot be consciously controlled, and they betray your true feelings. (The mental image I particularly remember from this article is of normally mild-faced Kato Kaelin snarling at Marcia Clark during the OJ Simpson trial for a split second. You don't remember seeing that, do you? Me neither.)The weird thing is that, after enough practice, you can learn to see those microexpressions.The possibilities! If I could see microexpressions, I could have the world trembling at my feet! I could become what amounted to a mindreader.Since I'm not really a megalomaniac, that feeling subsided, and I hadn't thought about that article much until recently.But now I've read \"Blink\" by Malcolm Gladwell (also the author of that microexpression story in \"The New Yorker,\" also the author of \"The Tipping Point\") and have spent some time thinking about what can take place in a split second.Among other things, Gladwell looks at various marketing successes (like the Aeron chair, first saddled with the moniker \"The Chair of Death\" due to its perceived aesthetic shortcomings, now you're probably sitting in one (or a knock-off of one) as you read this) and failures (like New Coke) and compares how these decisions were made.In order to make a good rapid decision, it's necessary that you know (instinctively) what information to accept and what information to discard when you're being bombarded by too much of it.It seems that it goes pretty much like this: if you already know a great deal about the subject at hand, you're pretty good at making quick judgments about something.If you haven't been trained, had a lot of experience, or practiced, well, then it's likely that you're not very good at it.In other words, if you aren't looking at exactly the right variables, you might end up making a colossal mistake. And how can you determine what those variables are? Well...by knowing through experience.Although sometimes you do just know.There's a lot going on in your brain that you simply aren't aware of-you might instinctively act one way without being aware of your reasoning for it until afterwards.It's also important to note that there are a lot of variables over which you have little or no control when it comes to making a judgment in a snap.Like it or not, each of us has prejudices, and they're difficult to abandon when you're in a situation where you're making a decision very quickly.All of these subjects are covered in great detail in the book, both the cheery and the dark sides of rapid cognition.Here's what Gladwell says are the tasks of his book:1. To convince us that decisions made quickly can be as good as those made deliberately2. To flag the reasons that our instincts can mislead us3. To convince us that our snap judgments can be controlledDoes he succeed on all points? Well...yes and no.When I started this book, I admit that I was seized by the same kind of excitement as I was while reading about microexpressions. (My productivity will increase! No bad decisions again!)After reading \"Blink,\" I'm convinced that my snap decisions can sometimes be as good as my most careful ones. And sometimes not.I do see why my instincts can mislead me at times.And, I am convinced that my snap judgments can be controlled. Up to a point.However, if you're looking for Gladwell to teach you how to \"thin-slice\" and make great quick decisions, if you're looking for him to teach you how to control your snap judgments, you won't find that in this book.What Gladwell does do is unload a quick succession of stories and research that loosely interweave to form a book that is chockablock interesting material.\"Blink\" is nothing if it isn't entertaining, and if you're intrigued by the complex inner workings of the human mind, it is a book worth reading.But if you're interested in takeaways beyond thought and theory, your time might be better spent researching your decisions instead.",
            "\"Trust your instinct except when it's wrong\".There, I just saved you $10. No kidding, that sentence is the entire book. Sorry Gladwell fans, I must say this book is terrible. For the first few chapters, Gladwell talks about all these instances where lives, money, and prestige were saved thanks to people who trusted their instincts (or where all this was lost, because people did not trust their instincts). So you're thinking, great, you should trust your instincts. Then without warning, all his stories start to shift to ones where people trusted their instincts and turned out to be wrong. The End. And you're left wondering, why did I just read 10 stories where people who trusted their instincts were sometimes right and sometimes wrong? Of course that would happen.Skip this book.",
            "This book is one among a number of recent volumes which speak to quirks in human decision-making. Each emphasizes that our brains are not ideally constructed to make rational decisions; some of these argue that rational decision-making may not be as effective as many think; some argue that the use of quick and frugal \"rules of thumb\" are (or are not) pretty effective. Works addressing such issues include: Tavris and Aronson, Mistakes Were Made (But not by Me); Gilovich et al., Heuristics and Biases; Fine, A Mind of Its Own; Gigerenzer, Gut Feelings; Linden, The Accidental Mind. And now \"Blink,\" by Malcolm Gladwell (author of the best seller \"The Tipping Point\").The book begins with a vignette, focusing on the Getty Museum being offered the chance to purchase a particular work. The Museum used scientific methods to try to determine if the object was legit--or a phony. They decided that it was good and purchased it. However, a handful of experts, after just a quick glance at the object, concluded that it was a fraud. Later research agreed with those snap decisions.This illustrates a key point made by Gladwell: Sometimes quick and dirty decision making is actually better in terms of outcomes than agonizing efforts at rational analysis. He points out that this is what evolutionary cognitive expert Gerd Gigerenzer calls \"fast and frugal\" decision making.A number of examples are used to illustrate how well \"thin slice\" decision-making can work. In a war game, one side (the Red Team) used \"out of the box\" thinking against the other side (The Blue Team), which represented the United States. The latter team used rational decision making efforts, did after action analysis at each step, and tried, in short, to use \"best practices.\" The leader of the Red Team worked more by \"feel,\" allowing his subordinates to take initiative on their own. End result? The United States was defeated! Gladwell's conclusion is that thin slice, fast and frugal decision making was more effective.He adduces any number of examples as to why quick decision making works better than rational analysis. This is firmly in the tradition of Gigerenzer and his collaborators, extolling the virtues of fast and frugal heuristics (decision making shortcuts).However, Gladwell understands that there is also a darker side to this thin slice decision making. Stereotypes can end up guiding decision making. He wonders if this explains the disproportionate number of African-Americans who are imprisoned, if this explains why some people get better deals in negotiation with auto dealers than others, if this is why Amadou Diallo dies in a hail of gunfire from police in the Bronx. And this is the side of decision making shortcuts that Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, and their colleagues address (see the volume earlier mentioned edited by Gilovich et al).The final chapter is Gladwell's effort to somehow encourage the positive payoffs of the use of these quick and dirty decision making processes while minimizing the negative consequences. Convincing? I'm not so sure, but the author surely makes us think about these issues. A very well done book.",
            "\"Blink\" does a fine job of shedding light on the decision making process. The primary concept of the book is \"thin slicing\"--making decisions quickly on a minimum of information. The author shows when it works and why. He also shows when it doesn't work and why. Finally, he shows the reader how to improve on his/her \"thin slicing\" ability.The concept of \"thin slicing\" is a great one, and the book is well written and easy to follow. Several reviewers were critical that the book was overly repetetive. I felt the author was simply doing a good job of demonstrating and reinforcing his thesis.After reading this, I think I will pick up a copy of \"Tipping Point.\"",
            "This book uses a lot of words to say very little. Basically, snap judgements and gut reactions are the result of very quick processing of information by our subconscious mind, and if we try to think hard about why we feel the way we do, we'll come up empty because that information isn't accessible by our conscious minds. So we should trust our intuition...except that we shouldn't, because our gut reaction can also reveal our inner racist and cause us to elect people like Warren Harding. So we shouldn't trust it...except that many major decisions can and should be made using a very small amount of information, because too much will hinder your decision-making process...but you can't know which information is critical without a lengthy and detailed study of all possible factors. So...trust your gut only if you're highly trained and not under very much stress. I guess. I was tempted to put down this book several times, but the writing style is actually quite engaging, and I had faith that the author would somehow tie up all his suppositions into some kind of generalized theory. He doesn't. He shares a lot of marginally interesting anecdotes, but I was definitely unimpressed. So if you enjoy arbitrary and often conflicting psychological conclusions supported by loads and loads of case studies from a large variety of fields (from New Coke to marriages to police brutality), you will like this book. If you're looking for a cohesive explanation or even a concrete argument one way or another, you will be left wanting.",
            "Blink is well-written, hard to put down, makes one feel he is learning yet another great secret of the universe thanks to the NY Times Bestseller List. And Amazon, of course. We live in an age of information overload. Thus, we need to have an indigestible surfeit of technical gobbledegook predigested for us like a cow predigests its curds.Cut to the quick: basically, some of us have more blink than others. Many of us can train to improve our blink. Blink is useful, sometimes vital - remember those old 'New England Life' insurance commercials about two men talking near a tall apartment building, you know, the one who has blink looks up to see a grand piano falling right towards his companion (who doesn't have blink) and pointedly asks, \"What's your insurance company?\" Reply: \"New England Life, of course! Why?\"Paradoxically, some blink is bad. For example, those implicit assumptions about people who are handsome or beautiful: Wrong! That's the Warren Harding error - the handsome, skirt-chasing nincompoop U.S. voters elected to the presidency in the 1920's. Bad blink. Remember U.N. ambassador Shirley Temple? Bad blink. First impressions can be dead wrong. Get it?Information overload can stifle your blink. Regard the U. S. military or the C.I.A. as hog-tied by too much data, too much systems babble. A little Via*gra might help them get some blink. An enemy hand-delivers messages, gives local commanders autonomy, strikes at will, refuses to fight pitched battles, employs lethal low-technology weapons (think: Molitov cocktail). Sound familiar? It's worked from the American revolution to Iraq. Large organizations always get their blink bent.Thinking about something is bad. When one goes on an introspection trip, their blink takes a U-turn. Fill out a questionaire on WHY one likes something and the answer is different from the original blink impulse of liking it. Hmmmmm. Very interesting. Only experts can retain their blink whilst they report their findings to major corporations: you remember 'The Pepsi Challenge?' We flunked it. Coke is better. The experts knew it all along. They had trained their blink to stay up longer.Lastly - I'm sure you were waiting for this review to end - there's that darned abnormal ventral temporal cortical activity shutdown. Huh! What? It turns out that when your heartbeat goes much over 170 per minute, you have about the same ability to discriminate nuances as your cocker spaniel does. Remember cops doing the Rodney Ki*ng thing? Or Amadou Dia*llo? Over forty 9mm slugs into a hapless guy who was just trying to pull out his wallet to identify himself to them. Time. Give yourself time to recover to under 150 heartbeats per minute so the deepest recesses of your frontal lobes (those are the ones you use to impress your date with how bright you are) will resume functioning normally. Eh! voila. You're a reasonably normal, sensitive human being again.This generation of readers, you, my friends, doesn't read Dicken's novels to get it about how to act in society. No, you read books like this one. What you want is a techno-novel like Blink. Everything you already knew, explained to you in pleasant, condescending detail. You'll feel as you did after you finally learned how to factor quadratic equations in Intro to Mathematics 101. A little smugger. Water cooler chatter. For $25.95 list. Such a deal.",
            "This book has one of those eye-catching titles (congratulate the author for that marketing coup!) that makes you want to read the dust jacket. I found the first part of the book interesting, and the last half a bit confusing. In the first part, I suppose the key point was: at least give your first impression a fair hearing - maybe a book can be judged by its cover, and Mr. Gladwell sure tried hard on his own book. I do not agree, though, that this first impression, the \"Blink,\" is an irrational process, as opposed to a thought-out course of action. That blink is just as rational and natural to the human brain, only much faster. Rational thought and action doesn't mean writing every decision out on 85 pages of 8x14 legal paper, in ink and in grammatically correct sentences.The second half of the book was less interesting. I still do not understand Mr. Gladwell's story about the SWAT team shooting, much less which point he is trying to make. Should the \"Blink\" have been ignored, or should it have been trusted? Nevertheless, the first part was good enough for me to recommend reading the book. The part about judging someone by what their dorm room looked like was quite good, based on what I have seen through the years. The impression shouldn't be of how smart the dorm-room-owner is, or how kind he/she is, or how effective. Dorm room condition does seem to be a good indicator of the person's mental process - how neat or sloppy, how careful or careless with property.I didn't buy it, but rather waited for it to become available in the library. Best way, I think.",
            "Perhaps \"Waste of Time\" is a bit harsh of a description for this book. While there are concepts and ideas inside that may be fresh to most people, some of the subjects Gladwell focuses on can be a bit boring or even a stretch to back up his point. He talks about how Coke changed their formula after the Pepsi taste tests showed people in favor of Pepsi, and a police force that guns down a child they thought was pulling out a gun that was actually a wallet.In regards to the stories Gladwell uses to back himself up, he gets into explaining how our tastes change when we consume larger or smaller quantities of a product, which is why Pepsi fared better in taste tests. He also got into how causing people to describe their feelings ended up changing the outcome of test results. I guess he was trying to prove how initial feelings can be different than secondary ones, but is this really a new concept?In the beginning of the book there was something strange about him saying that he was only going to focus on what he calls \"thin slicing\" (a term he uses annoyingly often), and wasn't going to wander off into other topics. Why would you have to say this to the reader? I find when authors try setting up thier books in such a way, they end up straying from their original intended purpose as Gladwell greatly does. While he says he spent a long time writing this book, the topics he chooses seem somewhat of a stretch to his original point that snap decisions are usually the best ones.What does all this tell us? At the end I can't say I have a convincing argument as to how snap decisions (thin-slicing) are better. In life I have found myself glad for not making quick decisions, rewarded by balancing all of the correct data. I feel as if Gladwell could just as easily write a book as to why weighing all the options equally prove to be just as rewarding.",
            "I note that many reviewers have condemned this book seemingly with a \"blink of the eye\". It has been criticized for lacking technical background, offering too much background, providing too few hard examples, speaking out of context...the list goes on. While the overall structure could be \"firmed up\" and some repetition removed, it is still a provocative study of snap judgements and unconscious decision-making.Many reviewers have confused two distinct issues: The first one concerns everyone and how they unconsciously hold prejudices and attitudes, mostly cultural, that affect decision-making. The second concerns those individuals who, after only a sliver of data, can discern truths that stun in their accuracy. The author stresses repeatedly that this second group is NOT a random group of folks from the local bar but is composed of experts in their particular fields - food tasting, military prowess, counseling, \"reading\" faces, tennis, insurance, art. etc.Many of his \"solutions\" for overcoming societal or cultural biases seemed fuzzy at best. \"Putting ourselves in situations\" where we feel comfortable with all types of people sounds great but that is a conscious decision that one must make to affect our unconscious attitudes - a contradiction. The many tests were interesting and revealing and while some may ask whether only examples were offered that supported the author's thesis, it is safe to say that he is correct in the germ of his argument.What I fault the author for is suggesting that anyone can \"blink\" like an expert. That is simply not possible. All the experts were highly qualified, most all highly educated with curious intellectual abilities not shared with the general populace. His most telling point is that studying of \"blinking\" decisions can lead to safer crime patrol, fairer hiring and other admirable societal goals. A very worthy, provocative read.",
            "This extended journalistic essay is a fun ride. I like that Gladwell drew his examples from a wide variety of professions and contexts: the world of marketing and advertising (the Pepsi challenge), the buying and exhibition of antique art (the Getty's purchase of a fraudulant kouros), political campaigning (Warren G. Harding and Bill Clinton), rock music (the not-easy-to-classify artist Kenna), hospital emergency triage work (Cook County Hospital's introduction of a simple diagnotic protocol to determine which chest pain patients were most likely to succumb to a full-blown heart attack), orchestra auditions (the increasing use of \"blind\" auditions to force judges to base their assessments solely on what they hear), and police work (the Rodney King and Amadou Diallo fiascos). He augments these ancedotal findings with more scientific studies (such as findings from an extensive breakdown and cataloguing of facial expressions and work with an autistic man). The snap decisions we make, called \"thin slicing,\" can help us make urgent, life-saving decisions, or can (under certain circumstances) guide us to make the most disastrous of choices. Gladwell seems to be fair in considering the pros and cons, but in the end his project seems mainly to be to inspire in us a sense of awe for the powerful gift we all have, one which ultimately eludes logical explanation.Great for the beach on long train ride.",
            "I have been a major Malcolm Gladwell fan for years. But for all of the hype this book has attracted (and that might well be part of the problem), this one doesn't even come close to meeting the standards of his past efforts in terms of the calibre of the research, fresh perspective, new insights and writing. I have found that much of his work in The New Yorker of late falls short on the same counts. Perhaps he has forgotten that less is more and that his fans expect him to meet the high bar and standard he set for himself in the past? Or maybe someone should tell his publisher to stop hounding him for more books that don't make the grade to fill their pipeline?",
            "The author references some very interesting studies, including how one professor is able to predict with 95% accuracy whether or not a married couple will still be married in 15 years by observing the couple for 1 hour and identifying some key behaviors. Overall though, the author never forms conclusions that can be applied to life. After reading the book, I wonder to myself, how am I better informed about making snap judgements than I was before? I honestly don't think I am. Good start to the book. Poor finish. Also, many of his anecdotes are lengthier than they need to be. All-and-all, it's thought-provoking, but not instructional at all.",
            "This book was very interesting to me, though I will admit it got boring at parts. Some sections were just very repetitive and seemed to be overkill, but the overall message the book sent was intriguing. It helped me understand the way the mind works and how people use this knowledge of their minds for good or evil. No, I wouldn't read this book if I didn't have a good understanding of the English language. And no, I most likely will never use the information I gained from this book for anything other than answers to Jeopardy questions or a means to impress someone. However, if you're interesting in the way that the mind works, I suggest this book. It's not as overly confusing as many other books about the same topic and it uses real-life experiences to help you understand what is trying to be conveyed.",
            "This is a book about snap judgments, decisions we make in the blink of an eye. It starts with wonderful examples, but it ends with the far more numerous disasters. If anything, Gladwell is too generous. Snap judgments are familiar to all of us. They are often at the beginning of some sequence of events we have regretted for years. Gladwell suggests we take new interest in this dangerous decision making strategy. Therefore, be warned. This book can be dangerous to your health!The book is an extended collection of magazine articles and seems to skip from topic to topic. The journey can be engaging, but the 'grand' theme gets obscured. Fortunately, the book is a quick read. Unfortunately, it doesn't cover anything in much depth. The most glaring omission is any differentiation of neural activity in the enteric (gut), limbic (lizard brain) and neocortex (mammal brain). But, it isn't necessary to know these neural mechanics to get something from the book and that is why many intellectuals will hate it.Gladwell suggest the odd notion that thinking in words can be counter productive to good decision making. The argument has obvious merit to the pragmatist, but telling someone 'in words' to 'avoid words' is somewhat paradoxical and will cause the word academic intellectual much distress. To make sense of this, Gladwell is advising a balance of word and action (rehearse, rehearse, rehearse). But, how do you get the reality of this across in words. Gladwell doesn't investigate this conundrum.Additionally, several arguments will upset the intellectual reader's sense of propriety. First, Gladwell has the temerity to link genetics and intelligence. Actually, Gladwell is smart enough to avoid the direct argument, but he does present an alias: genetics provide us with snap decision making skills, some people have better starter set than others. For many academics, this is proof Gladwell should be sent to the gulag.It is tempting to dismiss the importance of snap decisions since the 'really important' decision must be reviewed and people have been arguing over how to decide things since time immemorial. Don't take that escape route. Consider the autistic individual, someone who has no social timing and cannot successfully decide what to focus upon. This person will often never learn to speak. The ability to make snap decisions is critical for simply existing as part of society. Understanding the process is central to assisting those who have difficulty joining us.Here is an outline of Gladwell's argument:1. The best decisions are snap decisions: Gladwell has lots of examples demonstrating the idea that 2 seconds is about one we need:a) Reading faces in such a way it seem you can read minds (hint: Look for defensiveness, stonewalling, criticism and contempt)b) Saving museums from fraudsters.c) Winning warsd) Gambling to win2. Words are the enemy of good snap decision makers:a) gamblers in tests figured out stats for winning before they could 'tell' someone the rulesb) sports greats don't know what they do that makes them winc) It is easy to unconsciously prime someone to act as you wish them to actd) The ventromedial prefontal cortex makes the decision and you can't control ite) We seem to have (at least) two minds, conscious and unconscious. both are always working to find answers, sometimes the conscious listens to the unconscious, sometimes it doesn't. Use of the 'conscious' mind can overshadow and supress the 'unconscious'3. Your starter set of 'snap decisions' will remind you of a 5 year olda) We cannot help but be attracted to tall dark handsome archetypes, so we elect empty suitsb) Clinical tests prove almost everyone's snap decisions tend toward race and gender bigotry.4. But, don't give up. Some have snap decision skills that can be developed:a) Learn the rulesb) Practice the skills,c) Engage in full scale rehearsals (examples: army exercises and impromptu comedy)5. Roadblocks to training (1): verbal overshadowing:The left hemisphere thinks in words and the right hemisphere thinks in pictures. If you happen to watch a bank robbery, then describe the event in words, something happens. The words displace your visual memory and you can't identify the robber in a lineup. In another study, people who were asked to write about their thoughts solved 30% fewer puzzles than the control group who were allowed to simply cogitate. Avoid thinking in words, they will hide anything your gut might have to say on the matter. Intellectuals are not going to like this advice!Gladwell's solution: put the words in a decision tree so you preprogram the information search to allow your gut a chance to get involved. (see cardiac arrest decision tree)6. Key roadblocks to training (2): misguided simulationsa) Bad market surveysb) Bad military simulationsSolution: Knowing how people make decisions is more important than any single fact or opinion. (Gladwell is very brief here)7. Key roadblocks to training (3): stay in the zone (manage your body to insure you can think)The archetypal 'blink' disaster is a police shooting some innocent man. Gladwell connects the high speed chase and group dynamics of the cop-car with the disaster. The high speed chase put the body with adrenaline, thus predisposing the policeman to use the reactions of a 5 year old. In particular, a cop with elevated heart rate and lots of adrenaline cannot read faces as well as the calm cop might do. Much of face reading is timing (something autistics lack) and in their 'rush' of the chase, cops will operate like autistics. The group dynamics provide a false sense of 'order' since everyone in a chase is basically 'out of the minds'. The solution is self-management. Keep the heart rate low, don't rely on others, fall back on rehearsed responses.",
            "Don't Think..Blink, that is the premise of this book. The author, makes an attempt to explain our instincts using some extremely flimsy scientific reasoning. The examples that are provided are real life and very interesting, however when it comes to backing them up there is a serious lack in depth and research.I did not find this arguments in any particular way convincing. Each chapter a reveals a real life story which is followed by some half-researched scientific explanation and in order to get the reader to believe: \"wow, I think like that!\".I give this book three stars, for the fact that it does point out the obvious that would otherwise go unnoticed by us. Where the author strays is in doing his research and backing up his findings with anything solid. I felt that the book's research appeared to be flimsy even if it had been exhaustive. The writing is at a medium level and easily accessible though to weighed down with scientific names in certain sections.Over all, read the book if you are interested but make sure to pair it with something with more substance.",
            "This book is nothing more (or less) than an intriguing and entertaining collection of anecdotes. Gladwell presents these as examples of how a finely tuned unconscious can make near-instantaneous decisions that are superior to the results of extensive information-gathering and analysis. Unfortunately, nothing of any substance is offered in the way of how to train your mind to \"thin-slice\" or how and when to trust it (Gladwell points out that the unconscious can also be disastrously wrong). Perhaps the author has left that for his next best-seller?",
            "I enjoyed the book and found it to be well written overall, though there was a bit too much handholding at times. I will certainly never be able to look at margarine or tall men the same way again and my interest in investigating human facial expressions has been irreversibly piqued.Given his discussion, both in the book and in interviews, of being mistaken for a criminal -- a rapist, and on 14th Street -- I can't help but think that Gladwell should have drawn a larger parallel between his own situation and that of Amadou Diallo (who worked on 14th street and was mistaken for a rapist). He instead opted, perhaps with a nudge from an editor or his mother, to look at that parallel through a very broad lens and wrote Blink when a different book should have emerged.That being said, Gladwell is to be applauded for providing in chapter 6 the most sober, intelligent and considerate explanation I've read for what happened to Mr. Diallo on that fateful night in the Bronx. In this final chapter, he brilliantly gives us an all-too-salient real world example which illustrates so many of the elements that he describes throughout the book.",
            "This book is about the all important two second decisions or impressions that our \"adaptive unconscious\" leads us to without the rigor of detailed analysis that we otherwise do. Instantly, I realized that my decision to buy this book from amongst a large display at a book shop at the local airport was one such \"blink\" decision.The author introduces the concept very well. I was immediately convinced that it is important to realize the power of \"thin slicing\" and the need to understand and cultivate the skill of harnessing its power in personal and professional life. The quantum and the degree to which it exists and manifests differs significantly in each of us. The book aims to explain the phenomenon, situations under which it is mostly right or consistently flawed and the means by which one can build on this powerful mental resource.The chapters that follow are exciting with numerous cases across diverse fields that can interest a wide range of professionals. As the pages flow, it appeared to me that this was a case of discussing the concept more and more without following a systematic framework for analysis and application. No doubt the case studies are interesting, but then the objective of the book should have been beyond narration of stories and to build and present a powerful tool for successful deployment. The author does discuss one such model used by doctors in a hospital for diagnosis of heart attacks which substantially improves the chances of correct diagnosis.Worth reading once. However this can wait till you finish reading other books in your priority list.",
            "This book is a classic example of how good editorial style masks the flaws of poor writing. The thought leadership in Blink could fill a postcard--at most a sheet of note paper, if you wrote in big, loopy cursive. But Gladwell's anecdotes are entertaining (if loosely tied to the premise) and his prose clips along (if repetitively), making for a mildly entertaining read.The first half of \"Blink\" is about why you should trust your instincts (the orchestra story). The second half is about why you shouldn't (the Amadou Diallo story). And very little effort is made to reconcile this self-canceling arrangement. As for the promised \"how to improve\" and \"how to overcome\" sections, they largely fail to materialize.On a positive note, the book is self-fulfilling in one way. My first thought when I saw Blink is that it was another phatic suit-narcotic. Now that I've read it, I can confirm empirically that my instinct was correct.",
            "Gladwell can write, that's for sure. It's not often that I can finish 250 pages of utter B.S. The claim was essentially regressing psychology. To me, it suggested that anecdotal evidence was often more valid than empirical evidence. Anyone who has ever studied a science knows that is a rrrrridiculous statement.Basically, Gladwell described the remarkable gut instincts of experts of a particular field. The truth is, he was describing a population of elites, not normal people. This book was advertised as a book that could be useful and enlightening, but I would say it's more akin to reading Teen People or whatever you may see while standing in the line of the grocery store. In short, some people are exceptional and different. I'm so glad I read a whole book to have that illustrated for me over and over and over and over again!Logically, I have to pan this book because of its lack of pragmatic value, however, it was a somewhat entertaining read. Some of the experiments described where interesting (although validity was rarely discussed) and the flow of the writing was engaging.My conclusion is that Gladwell would do well to try a different topic that he is better suited for, and if psychology and cognition is his expertise, then he should stop insulting the reader by glorifying anecdotal evidence",
            "I thought this book would be interesting. I was disappointed. Starts off talking about a statue in the Getty Museum. Trained experts ran tests and were sure the statue was genuine (from 600 BC or so). Other authorities on art did not run tests, but could tell just from looking at the statue that something was not quite right. However, with all their training and education, they could not put their thoughts into words. This is \"blink\". When you decide something, based on your past experience. Your decison may be right or wrong, depending on what your past experience is.So, stuff you already knew, basically. Because we all know things we don't know how we know, we just know. But personally, I have enough sense to know when I don't know. Gladwell thinks that Warren Harding was elected president solely because he fit the American's ideal of what a president should look like. I must have missed the \"What An American President Should Look Like\" class in 5th grade.Gladwell kind of jumps around. He talks about a professor who studies married couples, and based on whether they show contempt toward each other (rolling eyes), can predict whether or not they'll get a divorce and in how long. What's the point of this? Is this important work? Gladwell also introduces a used car salesman, who never jumps to conclusions based on someone's race, sex or attire, and offers the same price to everybody. He's fair, and he makes a lot of sales through word of mouth and repeat customers. Something any car salesman could learn if he/she had been in business long enough. So - that's not blinking.Gladwell doesn't back up his stories with any proof. It all comes across as his own flawed opinion, or maybe just some hokey made-up stories, and I'm not buying it. I thin-sliced and decided not to finish this book. Luckily I didn't contribute to his wealth since I borrowed it from the library.Interesting idea, but Gladwell does less than nothing with it.",
            "This book starts off with an interesting notion: There is a level of circuitry in our brain beyond our consciousness (or rather beneath it), that is capable of making sophisticated statistical judgments far quicker than our conscious minds know. This makes sense if you think about it, pattern recognition being a necessity to survival throughout the generations of any of our mammalian ancestors. If you are skeptical, Gladwell provides some nice experiments that seem to support the premise, lab experiments demonstrating physiologic reactions to patterns before the subjects can consciously verbalize the pattern or even alter their own strategy to these patterns. Somewhere deep in our minds is a great calculator, unshakably logical by design. But the conscious mind complicates things, because we desire certain outcomes and thus, also demonstrable, we are more likely to believe things we want to believe.Gladwell's suggestion is that we can benefit from training our minds to hear the little calculator, that the best decisions are the ones made in a blink. What we call gut feelings and intuitions are actually the more dispassionate mechanism lying within.To me it seems that there are certain kinds of analyses that benefit from being made in that logical processor and others that are hindered. After nearly a decade in school or training, my tendency is to think in medical analogies. Any radiologist that has been reading chest X-rays consistently for over ten years is welcome to interpret my films in a blink. And cardiologist who has been interpreting EKG's consistently for over ten years is welcome to eyeball my EKG and diagnose me in seconds. In my field, the answer is more complicated, which is one of the reasons it never gets dull. In Psychiatry, a pharmacologist who goes from symptoms to diagnosis to treatment in a linear fashion can probable do so in the twenty minute visits that are now the insurance industry's dictated standard. Likewise, a well trained psychoanalyst, a specialty equally prone to simplistic reduction, can come up with one of their fairy tales in a matter of seconds. But a broad-minded psychiatrist who employs a combination of psychotherapeutic modalities in the context of prescribing medications, a doctor who integrates thoughts on the mind, the brain, and the body that houses it, should not be coming to conclusions in a blink. Less is more only when less is more. However, Gladwell's book does a universal service in alerting us that this is in fact what we are prone to do whether we know it or not. Good mindfulness is being tuned in to our pattern recognizing processors, but also knowing when to feed it and when to starve it, realistically confronting it when called for and then immediately resetting it so it stands as a linchpin. It stands as the stake that tethers the generous leash of our doggie Buddha Brains, giving us some slack but then snapping us back, always reminding us it's there, the Now that cradles the past and imagines the future.This is a worthy read. Good food for thought. It's good to once in a while stop and think about how you stop and think about how you stop and think. So thumbs up. Stuff it in the novelty oversized sock of a loved one this holiday season. Along with a couple of those little nip bottles of Tanqueray, a handful of lottery scratch tickets, and some Sudoku pages from last June of your forgotten Sudoku-a-day 2006 calendar. Okay. What else can I tell you?",
            "Interesting but not great or revolutionary, There seems to be some publicity machine behind this book to make it in so many media reviews.The readers that think this is a great book, must have never read similar subject matter. It is a fun and interesting read at times. I enjoyed reading research studies that verified ideas I've read in other books about intuition and also how our thoughts affect our actions and behaviors. The problem with this book, as other reviewers have mentioned, is the fact that he just reports the studies, but doesn't give a plan on how to use this information in your everyday life. Having read many other books that are only about how to apply these concepts , this was not a big problem for me ,but it does leave the book lacking. It is a very interesting read and has good stories, worth reading but not buying. Of course, I usually limit my buying to books I want to read more than once or use as a reference. I definitely do not understand why it is on the top seller list and frequently mentioned in the media. The book is good, but not that great or revolutionary. He must have some amazing publicist!! Hope this review helps the undecided. First, try getting this book from your library or review thoroughly at a book store. Definitely worth reading, and it is very interesting, but it reads very fast and once read few will want to read again.",
            "Blink's subject matter is completely different than Malcolm's first book, The Tipping Point, yet it shares the same wonderful flow of great story telling which has become Malcolm's signature writing style. Each chapter shares a compelling story which leads you to rethink and then think again about how you make decisions. After reading Blink I had to stop and question what may be behind some of my own snap judgements.I had the wonderful opportunity to meet Mr. Gladwell at a book signing for Blink. After hearing him discuss some of the topics in his book, I'm ready to read Blink for a second time. I anxiously await the next topic he chooses to tackle for his third book and I highly recommend both Blink and The Tipping Point.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed reading this short and engrossing book. It was a great read, and once started, I could not put it down. Blink refers to snap judgments (really reactions more than judgments) particularly where these reactions have life or death consequences, such as a policeman deciding to fire his gun. In the tragic case of an innocent person being killed by four New York cops, there was no decision, no judgment, only reaction, a bad reaction in this case. In the case of the Getty Museum getting duped by a fake 2600 year old statue, the true experts immediately knew that the statue was fake, and their reaction was good. Gladwell makes useful points, such as : That the blink can trained and cultivated resulting in better reactions; that expertise and real experience usually results in better blinks; that if the situation is intense enough, many physiological systems shut down - including hearing, and bladder control; that additional information can actually lead to a worse decision by bringing in nonconsequential factors; being reflective in sports hinders performance and often a superior athlete gives the wrong explanation of what he's doing; that trained readers of faces can do a much better job of sizing up a person instantly. The story about Silvan Tomkins handicapping horses by looking at their faces was fascinating.Why the \"but\"? Well, I'm not sure that Gladwell is properly trained in this area and has the academic credentials to qualify as an expert in this area. Also, a lot of this is obvious, such as a trained expert would make better snap decisions than an ignoramus. Nevertheless, Gladwell is a fabulous storyteller, and he provides a great deal of things to think about. The points he makes are supported by beautiful real life stories, told in an artful manner. This is the heart of the book. If you don't read this book, you'll be missing out on a real treat.",
            "i would definately reccommend this book. it is an interesting subject, it is well written, and it makes you step back and realize how we take a large portion of our thinking for granted. when he talked about how words that we barely acknowledge can make subtle changes in our behavior and actions, it made me more aware of the potential of our brains, as well as more aware of what i am reading or seeing. this is not a self help book that tells you how to increase your thinking power. this book tells you that you already have the ability to make sound snap decisions and you should realize that.",
            "The first chapter was the hook, but as it went on it began to get a little repetitive. It wasn't really adding anything new and the topics began to feel scattered. It was as if the author had a bunch of really cool stories and facts that kinda-sorta all fit together, so he slapped them in.That said, I found most of it very interesting. It was also pretty easy to read - despite feeling scattered. If you're interested in a collection of psychological research in a fun, easy to read and understand format, pick up a copy of Blink. I enjoyed reading it.",
            "This book is basically a collection of various stories and their relationships to \"Blink\"ing, or \"thin-slicing\". The stories are interesting, and the book is somewhat engaging, but it all seemed somewhat incoherent. I came away from the book feeling as if I didn't gain anything new other than a couple interesting stories and maybe a fact or two. It's a good rental from the library, but nothing I'd buy again.",
            "This book is 50% \"thin slicing\", 50% lesson on stereotyping, and no real explanation on how to improve our already innate ability to thin slice. \"Don't rush to judgement without a sufficient knowledge of the subject and don't question yourself too much if you have sufficient knowledge of the subject\". That's pretty much the whole book in a couple sentences.",
            "I am a market research professional. As soon as I started reading this book I saw all kinds of practical applicatons in my work for using the knowledge in this book.I doubt many people will see this in such a tangible way as I do, but anyone will be fascinated by this book.It is a quick and easy read. I finished it pretty much in two days, but then, I couldn't put it down!There are techniques in here that can help you pass exams, feel better about yourself, just feel better etc. In a sense you can use this as a \"Self-Help Guide\" in that way.The main thing you will pick up from Gladwell is to learn to develop your \"hunches\" and your first impressions, and to trust them, because sometimes they are better than what you come up with from detailed rational analysis.All my life I have been told to analyse, analyse, analyse, get the data and let the data drive the decision. Gladwell is not saying \"throw all that away\". But he is saying that if your first hunch is negative and the data says positive - beware of the data. Trust your instincts.",
            "Although at times this book could be quite interesting, I found it to be unenjoyable. Often I felt as though the author was talking down to the reader and wasting time explaining himself too much.Gladwell does a decent job of introducing topics and concepts, but spends too much time telling explanatory stories and not enough time expanding upon the princpals behind them. Even with my rudementary understanding of psychology I often felt like I could have written a more through explanation of some of the topics. Perhaps Gladwell has a great many accolades in the area of psychology that I am unaware of, but after reading this book I have no reason to think that he does.If you are looking for an easy read that will not rot your brain or challenge it too much, this is a good book for you. However, if you wish to delve into the workings of the human mind and read something of a challenge then keep looking. I would reccomend Dr. Viktor Frankl's &lt;U>Man's Search For Meaning&lt;/U> as it provides much deeper analysis from the unique perspective of a concentration camp survivor.",
            "Unlike many of the unpopular reviews Blink has received on Amazon, I enjoyed it. While much of the information about our ability to make snap judgements versus using logic is not ground breaking information, Gladwell uses interesting examples and case studies to support his points; he successfully demonstrates how our intuition can be both useful in making decisions, yet harmful and ridden with stereotypes.The experiment which includes subjects who were asked to judge strangers' characters by visiting their dorm rooms (subjects observed belongings, judged how clean the room was, etc) was fascinating; the strangers who viewed the rooms were more accurate in judging character than the closest friends of the dorm inhabitants.",
            "An effusive monologue fortified with contrived oversimplifications does not make something factual or profound. In the end - I am right back where I started - only slightly chagrined for expecting to have gleaned some cogent insight regarding the recent advances in cognitive science in exchange for time invested.Granted, he's a deft writer. However, if you've had a college level introduction to psychology - you will struggle holding back natural questions that one would assume he would address in the succeeding pages - but no. Consequently, your \"bovine excreta detector\" will(or should) remain illuminated throughout the entire book.",
            "It is absolutely amazing how much we take for granted about our abilities as human beings with an amazing brain and its capabilities. I think that I read this book in one night. I was drawn in by the stories and the science and experiments that offer support to the ideals that Gladwell writes about. This book really made me think about not thinking about everything (excuse the pun). I learned alot about the unconscious mind and have learned to apply some of the ideals of this book to my life.",
            "In just a few short days of reading I was able to understand that those moments of clarity of purpose, those insights to my understanding why people do what they do, is actually me making a judgement in a \"Blink\" of an eye. Not based on ESP or clairvoyence but because my mind is preprogrammed through my lifes experiences and education to make instant judgements. An eye opener for me was that within one week of reading Blink I was faced with reversing my opinions of several very fine people who I had underestimated based on their appearance or their mannerisms.",
            "Blink is an entertaining read. Lots of interesting stories and anecdotes. It was also a quick read. Nothing too terribly deep or thought provoking to slow down for and contemplate. The actual \"lessons learned\" are few and far between, and not well tied together. I did find the book changed my perspective somewhat, but not in a significant way.",
            "Gladwell is certainly more talented than I am. If he were to write the review I am writing now, the review would be 8 pages long, it will make essentially the same point that I will, but you won't get bored at all.That's my impression of Gladwell based on Blink. There is, IMHO, exactly ONE point conveyed by the book. There are numerous examples that I have (and you too could) used to start or maneuver cocktail conversations. But the insight from each example is the same. It is ridiculous that any review of the book basically gives this away also.It is interesting and light (mostly) - so it makes good reading material for bedtime or the subway.But this is not a book you want to buy - this is poor reference material, and you could borrow it from your library and return it in two days anyway!",
            "This book relates the work of different psychologists and scientists who have done research on the power, benefit, and downfalls of split-second decisions. This research is combined with the experiences of those involved in the arts, sports, advertising, law enforcement, sales, and other activities. Gladwell weaves together a work that clearly explains how often split-second decisions are made, even in important matters. While Gladwell explains the benefits of this decision making, he also highlights the possible pitfalls of quick decisions, such as the different biases that might come into play.Quote: \"The power of knowing, in that first two seconds, is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few. It is an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves.\"I really enjoyed this book considerably at the beginning- I learned some new things, thought of things I already knew in different ways. Although I thought the book began dragging in the middle, to me it was not enough to prevent the book from being enjoyable.",
            "I was really excited to read this, but I thought it was just okay. He kept repeating the same idea over and over. It was one idea stretched ad infinitum. I don't regret having read it, but I still don't think it's brillian by any means.",
            "I have completed 75% of this book and found very interesting to read. I feel that there is a lack of information on how to use the information the author has presented.",
            "I enjoyed this book because Gladwell attempts to quantify and describe something that many people recognize on a subconscious level - that first impressions are very important and that your initial reaction of someone or something often turns out to be strangely prescient. It's that gut feeling you have upon many encounters, and combined with ongoing new research in the worlds of sociology, pyschology, and even physics (energy + aural relationships) it is very OTM - of the moment.Gladwell uses a sharp, chatty style to the book which makes it a quick read, and the lessons are not difficult. In general, I would say its better than his first book, which was already an achievement, but the idea is less zeitgeist that The Tipping Point was. Its more a form of threaded common sense, which seems to be a Gladwell Trademark.It would have been great to see Gladwell focus a bit more on the business side of Blink, like how to use it, but hey, you can't have everything. It also would have been nice if Gladwell had addressed the Hub Culture angle to the book: social globalization has created this common, linked urban community around the world, and it would be interesting to see how well he thinks they interact, read, evaluate and act upon their first impressions of eachother as they increasingly mingle through travel and virtual communication -- i.e. the modern world isn't just about the US and US examples.",
            "I finally got around to reading a book that's been talked about a lot in blogging circles... Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell. I found it fascinating, and it certainly explains a lot of things that I've often wondered about...The main question here is what happens in those first couple of seconds when you observe something? Without often knowing why, you make some snap judgements that can often be extremely accurate. But when asked to explain why you felt that way, it's nearly impossible to pinpoint the correct reasons. This process of decision-making is called \"thin-slicing\", and it's the stripping away of various inputs that don't end up affecting the outcome of your decision. If faced with 100 items of information about a decision, it's often just a small handful of items that consistently predict success or failure. The subconscious can often find those points and sift out the pattern without us being able to know why. Experts in a field, due to their exposure to the subject, can thin-slice even more quickly. They stand a better chance of being able to explain the \"why\" behind it, but even then it's somewhat iffy. Once you're aware of the thin-slicing phenomenon, you can start to accept it as a valid way to aid in the decision-making process.It wasn't covered in the book, but an application of this is something I've always found irritating in sports broadcasts. You have color commentators taking a play and dissecting the smallest movements in the players, explaining how each one made conscious decisions to shift the hips here or move the arm there. In reality, there's little conscious decisions made at all. The players are really thin-slicing the situation based on their past experiences, and making split-second reactions. The more experience and practice, the better the thin-slicing. All the extraneous action and information is stripped away, and the things that matter are handled instantaneously. If this type of thinking was more well-known, color commentators could be out of a job... :)Definitely worth reading and pondering. You may not agree with Gladwell, but it will force you to think about things...",
            "Nothing in Blink is groundbreaking, but it is illuminating. While you may find everything here to be merely an expression of \"common sense,\" sometimes being reminded of the obvious has real value in that it re-focuses and re-emphasizes simple truths. It is the loss of those simple truths - the inability to differentiate the meaningful facts from the overburdensome ones, the need to \"slow things down\" to give yourself enough \"white space\" to allow your intuitive skills to operate properly - that is at the core of the book.Most everything is presented anecdotally, and social scientists, psychologists, etc, will likely scoff at the presentation, even if the conclusions are correct. But Gladwell is a business writer, and for the general/business reader, the anecdotes permit an identification with processes that may otherwise be overcomplicated. Gladwell does a good job at tying what may otherwise appear to be disparate problems together and Blink is extremely readable. And the anecdotes are fascinating little stories on their own to boot - especially the section on the Pentagon's Millenium Challenge.",
            "I just finished reading Blink by Malcolm Gladwell; it's a fascinating little book about how some people make extremely accurate split second decisions. On the back it suggests placing the book in the \"Self Help/Psychology\" section of the book store, which I find a bit perplexing, it is about psychology, but it's nowhere near a self help book, in fact it reads like an extended New Yorker magazine article, which it might be, since Gladwell writes for the magazine. I remember reading some of his pieces before, and I've been recommended his web site by a friend. Anyway, it is interesting why some people are able to see things in a glance that regular people can't. I particularly found the section, 7 Seconds In The Bronx, which discusses what went wrong in the 1999 Amadou Diallo shooting (he was basically in the wrong place at the wrong time and took 41 bullets for it) and what it says about people under pressure and police officers in particular was quite revealing. But all of the chapters were equally interesting and well written. I found it though provoking to evaluate how I personally used \"thin-slicing\" (looking at limited individual moments of time with scrutiny) in daily life.",
            "I enjoyed reading this book for understanding how humans make subliminal decisions during an on-going decision process. The research showed results of what some call the 6th sense.The first three quarters of the book was interesting to read since the author was writting about the \"blink\" concept in our minds and actions and backed it with different examples.The one example that I thought was interesting was the commander beating the computer in simulations, although another insight to that was how humans are enhancing computers to start thinking like our \"blink\".The last chapters of the book were not interesting since it seemed the author ran out of examples and kept repeating himself, and started writting more about technical data.",
            "The first 100 pages sped by in virtually the blink of an eye. They gave me a significant amount to think about, and how I could particularly apply the concept of adaptive unconsciousness (thinking without thinking) in my business. In fact I have already begun to explore how a simple prompt can be imbedded within a process to unconsciously produce a desired end result.If you have ever said, \"If I only get a single good idea from it, the book would be worth it.\", then a) buy and read Blink, and b) set higher expectations.I am giving this book three stars because the second half moved slowly, and I have read a few other books recently that I thought provided even more food for thought - and action.",
            "This book is extremely easy and interesting to read. I wouldn't consider it a serious scientific endeavor in how the mind works, but for a general overview and introduction to decision making, it's fascinating.Gladwell spends the first part of the book crediting the amazing power of the brain to \"thin slice,\" or make seemingly instantaneous subconscious decisions. Midway through I was ready to always trust my first instincts and gut decisions. However, the latter part of the book explores how our brains gets \"thin slicing\" wrong.The book is thought provoking in that it allows the reader a glimpse into faulty assumptions and biases that strongly influence thoughts and decisions. Particularly of interest is the discussion on marketing and the IAT (Implicit Association Test)research done by Harvard.Blink is a fun read, but I'm glad that I borrowed it from the library and didn't buy it.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's book is a very lively read, although one of his central premises is somewhat contradicted. Yes, it's possible to hone your instincts so that you learn how to better anticipate things. However, that seems to happen by itself, not by anything on your part.In essence, intuition is the experience you have in your subconscious mind. When a veteran police officer approaches a potential criminal, he or she is using the experiences of many similar situations, most of which happen in a matter of seconds. But they still collect as memory in the subconscious mind. I would argue that you can't just make a New Year's resolution to learn how to use your intuition better. It takes life experience and a number of parallel situations to get to that point.The case studies and vignettes in this book are very entertaining and cross a wide variety of disciplines. They make for a very fast read because people can relate to many of them. But don't expect them to teach you anything by themselves. Many people, however, could read them and relate to experiences in their life where their instincts have taken over. And this book might help explain how they got there.",
            "Having enjoyed his previous book on idea manipulation and selective networking, \"The Tipping Point\", I am happy to report that New Yorker columnist Malcolm Gladwell has come up with an even more interesting treatise in \"Blink\" about overcoming our biases against first impressions and snap judgments. Once again, he does a superb job in integrating anecdotes with some impressive research data to present his theories without pontification. I really like how he makes the seemingly obvious utterly fascinating by turning upside down our preconceptions and lifelong learnings. In fact, Gladwell sometimes runs the risk of turning his concepts into arguments against intellectual rationalization, i.e., why study and analyze anything if our gut reaction is so sound? But before one can dismiss his thinking, the author comments repeatedly that he is not advocating abandonment of careful research. In support of that perspective, he talks specifically about the \"Warren Harding error.\" Voters across the nation voted for Harding for the White House because he looked and sounded so presidential. But he was poorly prepared to serve as U.S. president. Underneath the faade, he was deceptive and morally at odds with the first impressions he made on the country. Gladwell asserts that guarding oneself against this type of error is key in harnessing the power of using first impressions on important decisions.Consequently, it's not the gut feeling of the layman that counts but that of the expert who has been trained to feel correctly through thousands of relevant experiences. I like an example he used in relation to a Greek statue acquired with great fanfare by the Getty Museum. When the new acquisition was unveiled to renowned antiquities historian Evelyn Harrison, she blurted out, \"I'm sorry.\" Her instantaneous feeling that the statue was faked wasn't based on a careful examination or any quantifiable factors, just her sense that something was wrong with the artifact in front of her. As it turned out, she was right, and Harrison's two seconds uncovered a forgery that 14 months of work by the museum's team of scientists could not. The reality is that those who harness the power of first impressions most powerfully are ready to do so through years of preparation, in the science laboratory or in the realm of day-to-day life. The origins of Gladwell's book provide one of the most telling observations. The author, who is half-Jamaican, half-Caucasian, began to build his theory based on a personal experience. When he wore his hair closely cropped, police never hassled him. When he grew an Afro, he found himself hassled more than once. He understandably wondered why were police making incorrect snap judgments based on hairstyle. Gladwell's natural curiosity about his own situation has led to this wonderful book. Strongly recommended.",
            "This book makes for a very enjoyable and illuminating read, full of fascinating ideas and information. There is no explicit theory that Gladwell relies on, and neither does the book make any clear cut conclusions. This however should not be looked upon as a flaw-rather I am of the opinion that Malcolm's sheer enthusiam for genuine discovery and making these ideas accessible, makes this an extremely gratifying book to read. Gladwell is an immensely gifted writer, and his narrative skills are superb. This book is defintely worth a read.",
            "I read Outliers and I decided to buy Blink as well. It seemed like a good idea. BLINK is possibly the worst book ever written and believe you me, i will return it to amazon for a full refund. I have never felt so strongly about a book.THERE ARE NO LESSONS LEARNED from this book but mere long and boring examples of fast thinking. OH GOD !If I can save one person from buying it, my job is complete !",
            "I'm sorry, I must be way out in left field or somewhere. I missed something. I stayed with the boring statistics but Life is short, so get to the nitty gritty, and give us what you promised. Unfortunately the author doesn't follow through. It's been referred to as a hunch, a sixth sense, even just a feeling. And we're probably all familiar with this stuff. Nothing new here at all, however, it would have been nice if a smidgen of information regarding how one could use the information reliably was provided as promised. Who are they that give high ratings to this ilk. Hey, I want my money back.",
            "It starts out very nicely, it makes you to read more and more in the beginning. However, as I was turning pages after pages, I lost the main point. When I reached the conclusion part, I said to myself... so what was the point of this book? This book had too many examples and yes it's fun to read results of those psychological experiments and real life examples but they were just too much, I coudln't connect the dot at the end.",
            "This is an incredible concept: the idea that your gut instinct is better than your most thoroughly researched decisions. The idea may have specific business applications, but more importantly, the stories that Mr. Gladwell weaves into to prove his theory make the book very entertaining.",
            "the logical extension of the author's contradictory thesis is essentially that prejudice and thoughtlessness are better tools for judgment than deliberation and evidence. what would gladwell make of racial profiling? isn't that blink? and aren't most the examples he gives the results of EXPERTS' informed judgment and NOT blink? the only reason this book got published is Gladwell's connections.",
            "This was much ado about nothing. Don't understand the good reviews on this book. I kept reading thinking it was going to actually say something, but finally had to toss it.",
            "Blink flies by too fast. It was to me like reading a series of newpaper articles. But very interesting nevertheless.",
            "A better (and I think, more accurate) title would be Bllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllink.It actually put me to sleep on several occasions, then I just gave up and quit reading it.",
            "I think this book would be a pleasurable and interesting read for those of you who have never taken a psychology or biology course in college (or even high school). I am very interested in the human mind and have taken a few psychology courses in college, and I thought that this book would enhance my knowledge. Unfortunately, there was absolutely nothing new that I took away from this book. It was basically an over-simplified repition of things taught on the very first day of an introductory psychology class. If your time is valuable to you and you really want to learn something substantial on the subject, don't bother with this book.",
            "This book is more of a collection of short lackluster stories that have no real bearing with the true purpose of this book (even if there are any bearings, the author is done a poor job of articulating them)It's too late for me but you please save yourself some time and money by not buying this book",
            "Fortifies, with proof, the belief that trusting your own instincts may be one of the most important of all life's lessons. There's so much more to your \"gut feeling\" then you can ever know.",

            "Not as gripping as Tipping Point, but Malcolm has a way with words and offers us a fascinating read in Blink. A nice breezy read like Eightstorm and obviously a lot more thicker.",
            "This books providesa good insight on how our minds work when perceiveing most things, and clues on how to avoid being lead by the wrong impression when making our choices.",
            "Overall, loved it. Gladwell uses real life examples to support the basis of the book, which is essentially about the power of our subconscience. It discusses how we have been conditioned via all the elements in our lives (media, education, etc.) to react quickly - and sometimes with extreme prejudice - in any situation. The book illustrates how our minds can be a wonderfully useful tool, or by contrast, a dangerous liability.",
            "its ok but not that in depth. if you realy want to learn about this read a thicker book :-)",
            "A great book about how the mind functions in the subconcious, essentially thinking and making decisions without thinking. Very interesting with some really good insight. Its not the most entertaining read and is a little dry, but if you like this sort of book its one of the best of its kind. In my opinion, its a little better than The Tipping Point.",
            "I read Gladwell's 'Tipping Point' this summer and was just as impressed with Blink. Great insight.",
            "this book has some really interesting segments that were entertaining to read, and good for casual conversations as everyone else ive mentioned parts of it too is also interested. however, i was expecting to gain a much more profound or higher understanding of the subject...enhance my consciousness i suppose. this is not gained by reading the book. entertainment value only, and somewhat informational. good for someone wanting to do their own research into this subject and take it further as this book should have done.",
            "I really enjoyed this audio book. The author brought to life how we can tap into our unconcious mind. His utilization of real life examples is what really made this book enjoyable. The author also provided the audio reading and was easy to listen to and follow. Definitely recommend this book to anyone trying to further develop themselves.",
            "If you liked Tipping Point, you'll love Blink. Same writing style, completely different topic. Gladwell is terriffic - in my opinion the best - at making his research come alive through his convincing writing style. He gives great insight into how we think, great statistics and studies to support his theories, and ultimately - as only he can - makes the light bulb go off over your head. If you like smart, well researched and convincing books... read Blink.",
            "I finished this book over a month ago and to this day think about it every day. That is the power of this book.I strongly recommend it to every working man or woman.",
            "The points Malcolm Gladwell makes in \"Blink\" are immediate and straightforward. Trust your intuition. People who overanalyze problems will most likely come to flawed conclusions and stale perspectives. Malcolm sets out the ideas in story format that is easy to read and maintain the line thought. Not only is intuition often your best guide to reach logical conclusions, but the process can be streamlined to aid decision making.Whether or not to read \"Blink\" is an easy decision. Do it. And enjoy the process.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell tells an interesting story about the decisions we all make in the first 2 seconds of a situation. The book is fascinating at times and confusing at others. I bought this book thinking it would help me better understand how these decisions are made and guide me on how to make \"better\" snap decisons. While Gladwell enumerates throughout the book on the point that these decisions are in fact being made averyday he does nothing in the way of teaching the reader how to hone this innate ability to make more accurate judgements. Entertaining and easy to read but not really educational.",
            "This book is based on the observation that, for better or worse, we make decisions in the blink of an eye and that the ability to \"thin slice\" information is often crucial for timely action. This is all well and good, but I was hoping for information on how to cultivate this skill, avoid misusing it, etc. All the book gives is example after example, after example. Might be worth reading if you've never thought about it before.",
            "This book is a fast and interesting read, but don't let that mislead you: the information Mr. Gladwell presents is extremely substantive. What could be more crucial than having our eyes opened to the way we stereotype and misconstrue important information (such as peoples' characters and abilities) in the first few seconds of perception? Of equal interest is the way that \"thin slicing\" of limited initial information can at times yield incredibly accurate results. This book has helped me, as an artist, understand how art is perceived and perhaps how to better evaluate my own work. There are times we should trust our gut instincts (our lives may even depend on it), and other times when our judgments could be vastly improved if we were to consciously override our initial impressions or screen out prejudicial information. While making the distinction between these courses of action can be tricky, training exercises and other techniques are available which would make operations such as law enforcement safer and more effective. Mr. Gladwell offers a concise and well-researched roadmap through this complex but fascinating terrain.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's follow-up to \"The Tipping Point\" is not just an interesting read. He tells us how companies try to get inside our heads through marketing strategies, how the U.S. dismissed a creative \"war games\" enemy's tactics just before heading into Iraq, how we think wthout thinking. Snap judgments can't always be right, but Malcolm shows up how and why we \"thin slice\" and are not even conscious of the process. A brilliant book. Involved, but overly complicated, easy to understand and each page is there to make you think. And you will think about the snap decisions we ALL make on occasion.",
            "My sister recommended I get this product and I generally take her advice, so I jumped on this without thinking. I am easy to please, a good story or meaningful self help idea is always appreciated.Having said that, I would not recommend this product. It felt to me as if the author was writing a PhD dissertation with this audio. He went into such colorful detail on tangential themes in order to attempt to relay his points that it became difficult even in the car to sit and listen to. His points were not that difficult to relay, but one got the idea that he had to fill space/time, and a lot of it. That is exactly what he did.Unfortunately, I can't even say that his ideas were very creative. It was a serious chore to listen to the 6 or so CDs, I NEVER would have sat and read this material.For those people that prefer to get to the meat of a subject and do not have the luxury of having immense amounts of time needlessly wasted, I cannot recommend this product.",
            "The Big Idea in this book is that it's possible to know something without knowing why we know. We need to accept this - and sometimes we''re better off this way. If we all took our instincts seriously we would live in a very different and better world.Analyzing why we think what we think or know what we know can radically change our thoughts. Often people give extremely different answers to a question when they need to explain or justify their answer - introspection can sabotage solutions.Our \"Adaptive subconscious\"\" makes these quick decisions for us (it has nothing to do with Freud''s subconscious, The Oedipus complex, or any other such psycho-mumbojumbo). It throws away most details and concentrates on what it considers to be most important in order to make quick decisions. In general it is remarkable at making great decisions very quickly with very few facts available.Our subconscious can certainly make errors as well. For example, Warren Harding, perhaps the worst US President ever, \"looked\" presidential. Everyone thought he would make a great president based on his appearance, but apparently they were extremely wrong! Another example: US CEOs average approximately 3 inches taller than average. There is no link between CEO ability and height, but certainly an ingrained bias that tall men are leaders (or something like that).This is an engaging book with many well-researched examples, each of which is fascinating in it''s own right. This was a hard book to read in two days -- I wanted to read it cover to cover. It was so riveting that although I started reading it at night when both mentally and physically exhausted, I seriously considered making coffee when nodding off around midnight so I could continue reading!",
            "Blink is an intriguing essay that dives into the human mind and explorers the power of the unconcious mind. Gladwell catches the reader right from the start and tries to get the reader to come to become more self-aware of his or her unconcious mind through reading the book. Gladwell makes it very clear from the beginning of the book what he is trying to prove. First, he wants to prove that the decisions made instinctly (snap-judgments) are just as valid and sometimes even more valid than decisions made through concious analysis and rationalization. Gladwell provides a plethora of examples to aid this argument, and although quite interesting, he only proves that snap judgments are worthy of more attention than they currently receive. However, Gladwell is unsuccessful in proving that snap judgments are just as valid as a concious, rationalized thought process. He provided many examples; however, at times he is \"blind\" to the comfort and logic through a concious thought process. If he were to give more credit to the importance of the concious mind, his argument regarding snap judgments would have been more effective. Gladwell's second task was to prove that we should trust our instincts. Again, he provides plenty of examples to support this, and offers detailed analysis, but the argument is nothing more than an intriuging theory. Gladwell's third task is to prove that snap judgments can be educated and controlled, and he is very succesfful with his argument. Through his examples of the IAT Tests and War Games in chapters 3 and 4, Gladwell proves that snap judgments can be trained, and that the snap judgments of experts in certain areas are more valid than that of the \"Average Joe\". In conclusion, Gladwell's overall argument isthat if snap judgments are seen as valid and trustworthy and if snap judgments are educated, the world would be a different and better place. Gladwell is not directly effective in proving this to the reader. He provides few strong examples, such as the Diallo case, and he is unable to substaniate that very large claim. However, indirectly, I feel that Gladwell is successful in his purpose. I feel that Gladwell targets this book at more of a younger audience with the idea that although we will not take direct action to train our snap judgments, we will unconciously begin to question our actions and motives after reading the book. Although Gladwell is not able to get his readers to go out and speak up, he is able to indirectly and unconciously make an impression on the readers' frame of thinking towards the world around them. After reading Blink, go to a public location where there are a lot of people. See if you act differently than from how you would before you read Gladwell's book. You'll begin to notice a slight change in the way you think.Overall, Blink is an excellent book that is most intriguing to younger audiences but still has something in it for everyone. Next time you meet somebody new, size them up in a second...in the blink of an eye. Do not forget your intial impression of them. Then, after you've known the person for a while, compare your intial impression to your impression after knowing them for a long time. Where you right? Where you off? Why? Did something in your mind cause your intial impression? Did a false intial impression prove to be harmful to your relationship with the person? Blink investigates these questions, and surfaces their disastrous outcomes, yet promising potential.",
            "Our mind, faced with a life threatening situation, drastically limits the range and amount of information that we have to deal with. Narrowing allows to focus. In good decision making, frugality matters. Even the most complicated of relationships and problems have an underlying identifiable pattern. Less is more. Overloading the decision with information makes picking up that signature harder, not easier. To be a successful decision maker, we have to edit. Malcolm Gladwell learns that thin-slicing is doing just that. Blink is about the process of editing unconsciously. The book is a fun read as the writer is a great story teller and is able to translate several research fields to wonderful stories.",
            "I wasn't going to read BLINK at first. While I highly enjoyed THE TIPPING POINT by Gladwell, the idea of an entire book on what boiled down to snap judgment simply did not appeal to me until someone who read it shared some insights. I read it and I am glad I did. It's another wonder-inviting investigation by Gladwell in his pitch-perfect voice.Specifically, Gladwell is talking about the ability to process a reaction so fast, at a subliminal level, that one is already acting before actual thinking or articulation set in. This works well for some and it works disastrously for others. Much depends on how well the subconscious is informed and practiced. Gladwell visits cutting-edge research on the subject and provides dramatic accounts of how snap judgments have played out. The latter range from art expert Thomas Hoving instantly identifing a sculpture as a fake, when panels of professionals sweated it out through long examination and came up with the wrong answer, to the sad case of the African immigrant gunned down by police who thought he was a criminal they were chasing. He visits an actors' improvisation group and studies how a few years ago the US military participated in a simulation that bears a resemblance to what the Middle East shortly after became and applying its traditional strategies was defeated by a group of improvisational thinkers.I never realized there was as much to instant judgment as Gladwell kicks up. He kind of peters out in the last chapter, but even that is interesting. Will this book become viewed as an \"answer\" that will find put it at the center of workshops, think tanks and book groups like THE TIPPING POINT? I doubt it, but it is still good information, thought-provoking and fun.",
            "I bought this book just because of all the noise surrounding it as being one of the best sellers, etc. Well, all what this book is saying is that you should trust your subconscious because your first impression or decision is basically your best .

            "Interesting enough but to add any real depth and concrete info Mr. Gladwell should do further research into the conscious and unconscious minds. The entire book discussed the surface matter (Blink) but without any clue about the actual foundation (namely the conscious and unconscious minds). I was very disappointed with the book as there was no significant conclusion or something concrete I could take away that would have meant the time I used reading the book was worthwhile. The book is just story after story that backs up his blink theory...I got it after the first 2 and did not need to read another 20 all saying and proving the exact same thing. Meaningless and pointless and yes I'm disappointed because this was my first Gladwell book and it will definitely be my last.",
            "I read this book in a day and a half. I could't stop reading it. It was smooth as reading a novel, yet so full of information and concepts. Throughout the book the author Malcolm Gladwell is smarting moving gradually from concepts more easy to grasp and accept to more difficult ones as he touches issues we perhaps don't want to accept as easily.The book starts by making a very interesting point regarding the \"blink\" we are able to have, the intuition we have that something is either wrong or right, or one way or another, and how that may well be the better judgement we can ever make of something. The book then follows on and shows how this intuition, this understanding from the unconscious mind as he calls it is a quick unconscious interpretation of all the information we have stored in our heads, which we cannot correctly and quickly enough analyse with our conscious/thinking mind, but which we can with our unconscious mind. The author then goes further and shows how these unconscious decisions are either correct or wrong depending on the accumulated information we carry on our minds.The unconscious mind making a good decision: the tennis coach that could correctly predict when a player was going to double fault in a match with 90 to 100% precision, but could't understand how he was predicting it.The unconscious mind making a bad decision: the orchestra conductor systematically not hiring women specially in instruments traditionally considered man instruments because their ability to listen correctly and have a good judgement on whether the player was good or not was affected and influenced by their unconscious mind and all the stored prejudiced against women players.And just as I was finishing the book and thinking to myself: \"This is very nice information and sure explains a lot of the behaviour I see around me but how do we use it to our advantage? How do we go on implementing it, how do we fix the bias and use the intuition capacity of our mind to our advantage?\", the author dare us to think in our lives, to think in the processes we lead or participate in, what information is in excess and is confusing our mind to take the correct decision and filter that information so that we do not have access to it. He gives the example of the orchestras in the US which in 25 years of having behind the screen auditions increased the number of women players form 5 to 50%. The author suggests something similar is done in courts where people should not see the person being accused of a crime.I hope the book also get reads by physicians. The example the book gives of a doctor which was able through a mathematical and statistical approach identify the key parameters in confirming whether a person was indeed suffering a heart attach and draw an equation and a decision tree based on those parameters is nothing knew to science and engineering. I hope the medical community starts doing more of that. What an statistic and mathematical approach to the issue at hand is able to do is to put into an equation the knowledge otherwise acquired only through experience. By doing so, our mind is then free to grasp other principles which somehow we have not been able to put into equations (and perhaps we never will) and can only be gained through experiences and be processed in our unconscious mind.Different people will get a different perspective of the book depending on the circumstances they are living, to me the above is a summary of what I got most from the book.",

            "BLINK by Malcolm Gladwell.I smiled a lot as I listened to this book. It's about a dozen different stories illustrating how people think, feel, judge, and decide. Some show us that our first intuitive impression is better than lots of detailed technical analysis. Some show us how we do better by not listening to that first impression. We see examples of people who think they feel one thing, but the truth is different.Some of his examples and conclusions might not stand up to scrutiny by psychology/sociology experts. I could see a psychology student bringing up one of these examples in class, and the professor would debate and quote some research for and against. The debate would be fascinating and fun. Just know this is not textbook stuff. This is dinner topic fun. I love nonfiction that is fun. And this author has the talent to bring it to us.The author has a very good writing style.

These guys are great at what they do and they have a very simplistic writing style that makes for easy reads.This book is perfect for a short, thought-provoking read. It's made me question snap decisions, though I'm not entirely convinced that they are better than well thought out decisions. However, I do believe that first impressions are real. A sneaky person is still a sneaky person 3 months later. Also, our environment can impact these first impressions.I kept thinking about how environment impacts student learning and interactions at school. Possibly, better snap decisions can be made about poor instructors and disruptive students. A student's environment can also give us better insight into how they learn best and how they interpret content.",

            "I enjoyed reading \"Blink\". The whole issue as to whether or not we are \"robots\", and the nature of our \"programming\" and \"input-output behavior\", can be seen very starkly in sitting at the \"closed door\", as Gladwell describes the interface between environment and brain. One can illuminate much in considering the \"trendy\" subjects that occupy us: science, technology, war, politics, racism and sexism. I like the manner in which he criticizes, with an edge of objectivity, and appears to expose weakness, and yet displays a balancing compassion. He handled the case of the autistic person in a particularly sensitive manner which I appreciated, as a mathematician, since so many good mathematicians seem to be at least borderline autistic. Having myself been mistaken sometimes as having Asperger's syndrome, I could relate quite personally to what he described. Ultimately, we do not currently understand how to open that \"closed door\", but it is quite fascinating to sit at that edge that separates us from the inner life of the brain and the rest of the world.Much of the work seemed to be speculative, without a focused scientific basis, or rigorous theory. I can see that the numerous connections drawn in the course of developing these ideas could seem tenuous or superficial. One sees the overall connection converging on the \"closed door\" (more a metaphor than a true dichotomy between the inner workings of the mind and the external world), and just as with contemplating the significance of the event horizon of a black hole, one is aware that this is a crucial meeting point of disparate theories.",
            "The individual chapters in this book sparkle, like everything Gladwell writes, but the book isn't a coherent whole. We get the idea that we're better off being able instantaneously to \"mind read\" (i.e., read someone's intentions or emotions from their faces) than being like the autistic person who can't process these signals, and that those few of us who must make split second decisions like the police need to have such skills, but would we truly be better off in a universe where all of our thoughts and emotions could be read by others like an open book? If we had such a society wouldn't we all just have to spend time learning how to mask our emotions? A trope through the book is the fact that a couple of art experts knew \"right away\" that the Getty kouros was a fake, but Gladwell doesn't mention the fact that other art experts equally well respected thought that it was not a fake. (He sets up a dichotomy only between the one group of art experts and the science expert, ignoring the other group of art experts and making this seem like an open and shut case when it clearly wasn't.) Gladwell gives us no clues as to how we are to choose between competing groups of experts each relying on both their intuition and expertise. He raises the situation of medical experts having to triage patients coming to a hospital with chest pain (\"too much information that we attempt to analyze rationally leads to error\") but it turns out that analysis of vast amounts of objective data yields four factors that alone have virtually certain predictive factor as to whether a patient with chest pain needs to be admitted to a hospital. It is true that physicians were getting distracted by too much information and also true that the Getty curators were getting a lot of scientific information that turned out to be irrelevant. But beyond this similarity, the chest pain problem could be resolved only by close examination of the relevant data which turned out to be counter-intuitive, not by intuition. In the case of the kouros, Gladwell is making the opposite point that the \"real\" art experts can't really say how they knew it was a fake and therefore intuition, based on experience, should properly rule in these sorts of cases. Some fakes, however, will fool virtually everyone, and given that such an approach yields no method of resolving honest disagreements among experts with equivalent credentials, a modern society must reject it. In both cases the actual issue is the same: how to determine what we should measure, how to measure something in a way that will produce \"real,\" objective, verifiable data, what weight to give to each piece of data, etc. The problem with the kouros was that some of the information that the Getty was relying on was fake and that there was no agreement on what factors to analyze or measure and what weight should be given to those factors. The fact that the art experts who, in hindsight, turned out to be right can't articulate what led them to conclude that it was a fake does not prove, as Gladwell argues, that such determinations should properly be deemed to be forever beyond our reach.",

            "After reading Malcolm Galdwell's first installment,The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference, I had some idea of what to expect from Blink; a lightweight and anecdote-laded book that appeals to a mainstream audience.Blink is about gut feel, snap judgments, first impressions, interpreting facial expressions (which Gladwell calls mind reading) and a little bit more. Again, all backed by interesting stories of people and events more so than empirical research.The three tasks of Blink are:1) Convince you that decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.2) Answers the question: When should we trust our instincts and when should we be wary of them?3) Convince you that our snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled.These snap judgments and first impressions are what Gladwell refers to as \"thin-slicing\", meaning \"...the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behavior based on very narrow slices of experience.\" (pg. 23).If you enjoyed the Tipping Point, then you'll certainly love Blink; more of the same Gladwell writing style and stories.",

What many of us, not excluding myself, sometimes fail to recognize about the current understanding of the brain and human reactions - Gladwell saturates himself in. Secondly, being a lifelong fan of the Getty - I was pleasantly surprised with his remarkable insights into the museum as well.",

            "This is a book about using your intuition to understand situations and how to read people. As with books about intuition, it takes using your intuition or imagination and having facts that makes this book make sense.Simply put, each story shows us how intuition is used in trying situations or in critical situations where a judgement must be made. How the experts just seem to 'do what they do' without explaining it, or how sometimes we interpret what we see, ignore what is obvious and look back and wonder why we did not pick up on the clues.If you wonder 'how do they do that?' when you observe an expert, Blink can answer that question some of the time. An expert can make a decision using a flash of insight, or as with war, use their overall resources to make a decision in the heat of battle.In the introduction he says he wants us to find the value of 'a blink of an eye' and see that it sometimes is as valuable as deep rational analysis. Then, we see the anecdotes for what they are, rational analysis in the blink of an eye at times.There seems to be subjects here for everyone, an eclectic look into decision making, not scientific completely, maybe even a stretch, but the book is such a quick read as to really keep your interest. I liked his analysis of sports figures, Ted William for one. Williams said he watched the ball hit the bat when would hit. The book reveals that in reality, that is just not humanly possible. It was something else, Williams, an expert, doing what he did best, could not fully explain how he did it.Interesting too is Gladwell's review of the science of reading faces. I was fascinated that the human face has so many expressions that, according to research, may reveal what someone is thinking. My only concern with that, may be that a flash of expression, may be an initial thought, followed by reality. However, if someone is continually flashing an expression, it may reveal some deep seated feelings. One case he uses is in a court room where someone flashes an expression of discust. It is brief and we are not sure where that evaluation is leading, so, was the person discusted at the question or the facts behind it? How can we know?Blink will open up some very interesting perspectives for you who read it. I think it was worth my time and money spent. I believe that we cannot judge (condemn)others from expressions, but awareness of the world around us is really something we all need.",

After all, everyone and their mom was raving about what an 'enlightening' experience this book was. Gladwell does little more than give new examples to old ideas, and I'm not really sure if he thinks split-second decisions are a good thing or a bad thing. I quit reading after the chapter about Van Riper's big victory, so maybe all the interesting stuff is in the end of the book (I wouldn't know because I kept falling asleep by this time). This book was overrated. If you want to hear a bunch of mindless psychobable, just watch the Dr. Phil show (cbs 4et,3ct)",

            "I was assigned this book for a graduate diversity course and was initially excited. In fact, it was on my must read list. With an open mind, I began reading. However, I struggled to finish this book and became increasingly troubled. Why? From a diversity framework, I agree that we do \"blink\" however, we should do so based on educated, seasoned experiences which could help us think/decide with fewer personal biases, prejudices, and negative encounters. Honestly, most people live very busy, complicated lives and most don't have the opportunity/time to think and decide from this conceptual base. In addition, the theorists quoted seemed to brush aside or negate the value of thinking based on popular and accepted theories in sciences, math, philosophy, and anthropology. From a business and political perspective, I wondered if \"blinking\" was the methodology used by Bush administration officials--thinking (deciding} w/out rational analysis/reasoning rooted in sound, reliable, tested and re-tested data? I think this book encourages some to rush to judgement--to think without thinking.Overall, I do appreciate having read it and respond in an academic community full of opportunities for a robust debate. But, I am troubled because I can see evidences of blink being used and causing harmful outcomes.",
            "Most of the best-selling business books are used to offer readers with different tactics on how to make decision on the basis of detailed information and rational thinking. Any decision that is made within a flurry of moment may easily lead to inadvertent slip or more seriously, disastrous consequence.Contrary to other magnum opus pertaining to the subject of decision making, Malcom Gladwell suggests that adaptive unconscious is a powerful decision-making apparatus that is different with the conscious strategy and it is capable of making quick judgements based on scanty information. It does an excellent job of judging people, setting goals, developing new products and initiating action under stressful conditions. The decision quality is as good as decisions made in months of rational analysis. According to him, the ability to use adaptive unconscious can be educated and controlled.This book provides readers with full understanding of the power of adpotive unconscious. It is incontrovertible that we are now living in the business world which is more uncertain and turbulent than what we encountered during the last century. Gladwell guides readers to understand something in the first two seconds of looking in a sophisticated and efficient manner.",
            "I spent my life wandering the Matrix of religion and vague spiritualism. People are said to be born with talents, and these talents are said to come from a higher place beyond ourselves. My grandmother is a published writer whom says she lets the hand of God pass through her to pen. My mother was a high caliber artist and like her, I am a successful designer with my own business as well. One could say artistry runs three generations in my family. A gift from God, or something else?Blink, by the cleverly eloquent Mr. Gladwell, led me astray from the Matrix and into a world of explanation. The most horrible thing about this book is that it not only made sense, it was cleverly woven with intersecting plot lines. This is Christopher Nolan on paper. Its title sexy. It's narrative seductive. From the first sentence you are drawn into a world of \"thin-slicing\", the science behind the power of the single glance and its implications on our intuition.Gut feelings, instinct, and vibes are all carefully explained, from subjects ranging from gambling to speed dating, and even predicting divorce. How many times have you ever KNOWN something, only to rationally explain it away. Or you were in a situation where it felt so right to do something, but logically that decision made no sense. This book is your answer.Forget The Secret. This isn't wishful thinking. When I say this book will change your life, it's because you will finally understand why talent runs in your family. Why you were a natural at whatever it is you do. And why something is off about that stranger you just met. Take control.If you have a feeling to pick up this book, it's not because the spirits are guiding you. It's because you already know the answer subconsciously. It just hasn't filtered to your surface mind yet. You will not regret this purchase.",
            "The idea of \"Blink\" is that the areas of our expertise generate some of the most reliable gut instincts and impulses, and how we can come to use these impulses in a controlled way. \"Blink\" also tackles the ideas of where these impulses fail, and investigates why.As a whole, concise book, the arch of the elements involved is a little wobbly. Each chapter feeds into the other, but the ideas come across as initially disparate, a bit of a shock to a reader expecting a smooth reading experience. What kept me tied to the book was the idea of applicability. As I read through each part of the book, I found myself evaluating my own experiences against the ideas of the experiences presented in the book. In that respect, I found the book invaluable for helping improve my own rapid cognition by evaluating some of the misconceptions I might have about it.The plus and minus of the book is that it, in itself, is \"thin-sliced\" as far as subject matter. No segment is comprehensive. In some cases this is due to interest; I can envision the publisher/editor saying \"well, the details of this study would be great to go into more detail about, but people will snore.\" In other cases, it seems like it may be due to the lack of tangible concepts in some of the examples; How does one truly evaluate the nature of a person on a scientific level when it seems to be all a matter of opinion?The advantage of this is that the final message of the book, the closing element, brings together both the positive and negative aspects of snap judgments. One person's auditory rapid-cognition can be completely clouded by their visual rapid-cognition.The advantages of knowing what to trust and when is critical, and in this case \"Blink\" helps explore reasons and examples of exactly that.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's Blink shows how most thought processes in individuals can happen in a split second, like when Vic Braden can decide when someone will double fault in Tennis right before they do it. Braden had no true rhyme or reason for knowing when it would happen, he has been around Tennis most of his life, but that doesn't mean you should have some type of ESP for when someone is about to do something a normal person could not possibly predict.Gladwell continues to say that the brain can even be primed to act a certain way without you even realizing it. Gladwell portrays this when psychologist John Bargh gives a group of undergraduate a test that has certain words that will prime the brain to either be aggressive (with words like intrude, infringe, interrupt, etc.) or polite (with words like patient, respect, courteous, etc.). They are then put into a situation where they can either interrupt the proctor to tell them they are done or allow him to continue talking to his visitor, over 80% of the people who were given the \"polite\" test never interrupted while most of the \"aggressive\" students did after five minutes. The mind is a powerful object that can be molded in many ways. It can allow a war veteran to win a war game simulation under almost impossible odds; it can also make mistakes about Warren Harding being President. Even worse, it can cause you to kill a man because you thought he had a gun in his hand, when really, it was just his wallet.The human mind is a funny thing. In most cases it will help you understand a situation better or explain things to you before you even realized it was doing it. Gladwell says \"And what Blink is - what all the stories and studies and arguments add up to - is an attempt to understand this magical and mysterious thing called judgment.\" However, it's not magic; it's simply a lifetime of experience and repetition that leads your mind to fully understand similar situations. It is the knowledge that you may not even know you have, but it's the knowledge that separates the war veteran from the well informed adversary, the knowledge that allows you to \"blink\" and understand.",
            "The Book Review: Blink VincentThis book is about those first two seconds. Two seconds does not necessarily mean you have to decide things just in two seconds, it means you have to choose from all the alternatives and make your decision in a short time. The author (Gladwell) expresses the idea that our brain uses two different ways to sense the current situation. The first one is, many of us are familiar with, the conscious strategy. And the second one is the adaptive unconscious. From this book, Gladwell wants to tell us some good points: Sometimes, we should convince ourselves that the adaptive unconscious is way too better than the traditional conscious strategy. Also, we need to know when to use the conscious strategy and when to use the other one. If a person uses the wrong strategy under an unsuitable situation, the outcome may turn out badly. What is more, the snap judgment and first impressions can be trained and controlled (most important point).In my opinion, what makes Gladwell's books so well-known is that he uses many examples in daily life in order to inform his audiences about his notions. Fortunately, I have met some examples in my life, which related to his ideas.1 In Gladwell's Nissan case, the dealer is doing a really awesome job because he has two characteristics: He uses the customer-centric method and treats every customer equally. He doesn't judge people by their appearances (fight the Warren Harding error). When I was in China one year ago, I saw a man wearing shabby clothes went into a BWM store. It seemed that he was poor and could not afford even the cheapest BMW in that shop. When he laid his fingers on a BMW X5, one salesman forbade him to do so and said some unrespectable words to him. However, a female saleswoman came out and treat this man like a potential buyer. She gave the man a cup of coffee and introduced all the detailed information about that BWM with smile on her face. The man thought for a while, and then he made a call. After ten minutes, his son came in with two huge briefcases. When his son opened these two briefcases, what were inside made me surprised: they were about three million cash (RMB). His father bought two BMW X5 by cash and this activity made the female saleswoman gain a lot of commission. From this case, I get to know that \"Warren Harding error\" is common and it is especially harmful for a salesman/saleswoman.2 Around two years ago, the luxury brand - Louis Vuitton wanted to open a shop in Nanjing (my hometown city). However, the marketing people in Louis Vuitton were not sure about whether citizens in Nanjing could afford this expensive bag. One top manager, who was in charge of affairs in China, arrived in Nanjing. He didn't bring with him a professional team and order them to do analyses that would last several months like many other managers. He just stood near Xin Jiekou (a famous business circle in Nanjing), felt the surroundings, and counted the amount of luxury cars like BMW, Benz, Lexus, and so on. He finished counting after several minutes. After five months, Louis Vuitton opened its Nanjing store. You know what? The first year's revenue of this store was about 100,000,000 RMB and it meant this store sold nearly 30 bags in each day (this is amazing in China). In my opinion, this was a \"blink\" method although it took several minutes. The manager used his initial feelings about Nanjing and made a successful decision.After reading this book, I will consider the incoming problems from a different angle. I always hear the saying \"haste makes waste\" and think it is true. However, I will use the \"blink\" method to solve some problems when circumstances permit in future.",
            "Recently, I watched the TV play of Lie to me, in which the expert can tell whether people lie just by a glance at people's faces. In the play, the expert learned a lot about people's expressions and psychology. With the abundant studies and experiences, the expert can tell what a person is thinking about by looking the person's expressions. In the book of Blink, Gladwell also gave a similar example about the theory of mind reading.The book is mainly talking about making decisions by rapid cognition. It concerned with the content and origin of those instantaneous impressions and conclusions that spontaneously arise whenever we meet a new person or confront a complex situation or have to make a decision under conditions of stress. Gladwell took so many interesting examples in the book to describe how people make decisions instinctively in a short moment and what impacts the accuracy of our judgments.According to the author, the book is to convince readers of a fact that decisions made very quickly can be equally as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately. In addition, the book is to answer the question that when should we trust our instincts and when should we be wary of them. Moreover, the third and most important task of blink is to convince readers that our snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled.In the daily life, we have to make lots of decisions. Sometimes we spend a lot of time and energy to consider a lot to make sure that we can make the correct decision. However, we may finally make the same decision as we decided before the deliberately consideration. Or even worse we may find that our first decision is better than the decision made after the cautiously thinking.For example, when I am doing multiple choices, there is a problem I'm not sure between option A and option B which option is the correct one, so I just pick A instinctively. When I recheck my answers, I begin to analyze the confusing problem: I'm familiar with the concept of option A and I also have impression of partial information in option B. After a carefully thinking about the options, I ultimately choose option B. However, after the examination, the teacher tells us that option A is the correct one.It's interesting that the situation above always happens to many students. It seems that our decision made by the first impression often is the best decision. As the author said, sometimes we should take our powers of rapid cognition seriously. Although making decisions through cautiously consideration of large amount of information is a good method to determine things, the instinctive judgment can be a good way to make decisions. Since the instinct is based on our past experiences, we should pay attention to it.By combining instinctive judgment and analytical consideration, we are more likely to make right decision. Besides, it's also important for us to learn how to simplify complicated information to solve problems because sometimes the more information we know the more confused we are.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's Blink provoked some great thoughts on the power of the human subconscious and rapid cognition. It's amazing to think about the split second decisions we make every day that are based on first impressions or hunches and how they impact our lives. There are so many interrelated factors that we are somehow able to instantly process react accordingly. More interesting is that these \"thin slices\" usually generate a reaction that is pure, meaning it is very close to the truth or the best route to take in a given situation. Blink discusses both the good and the bad ways we do this and how controlling the process and focusing on the right information can benefit us.In my experience, when people over-think a situation or a problem, the end result can easily end up being worse than if they would have trusted their first instinct and gone with it. That being said, there are definitely times where a rational and well thought out decision making process is key to success. The trick is knowing when to rely on the power of thin-slicing and when to opt for a more robust process. In business, it is easy to see the struggle between the two approaches.Organizations rely on research, planning, and process to make important decisions on finances and strategy. Going this route is certainly prudent and leads to desired results. However, this corporate bureaucracy can also be a huge waste of time if applied to every situation, and can cause companies to be very sluggish in responding to change and getting things done. Conversely, if companies don't do their due diligence and are too quick to react, they can cause tremendous damage to their financial situation, reputation, and brand. Companies need to carefully manage when they rely on bureaucracy and when they can leverage thin slicing techniques to just react and move on.",
            "Blink: The Power of Thinking; Without ThinkingThis book is about how we process our mind. How the subconscious take places before the conscious. The author presents a series of studies and experiments to supports its point. So Blink it is that nano second that human's take to have a feeling about a situation or event. I really enjoy reading this book and could relate a lot of the book facts with my professional experience.Some of the examples that Gladwell, the author, gives are very real, although the book was written to the United States environment with some minor modifications it is possible to adapt to different cultures around the globe. The main point is that we can have an opinion and a certain hunch before we have a logical explanation for the fact. One of the most amazing examples was about the couple forecasting of the probability on the divorce. The book show studies that with as little as three minutes of tape of a couple it be done this forecast. The thin slice technique gives the researchers a great ability to forecast.The IDAT test is amazing, test that requires the person who is taking the test to associate groups or categories to words or pictures. For my professional experience we had to educate our work force, over and over again, to avoid unconscious associations that would result in a lost of a sale or reduce value perception in our service quality.Another point that the book make is how easy, or at least predicable is to marketing once we understand the Blink decisions of the general market, the point here was proven with the President Harding election, although he was one of the worse president in the American history, he had the physical imagine of a tall and strong person, and due his imagine he was elected the president. This point was also made with the CEOs of big corporation which also prefer to have a tall and strong male.The counterpoint of a success auto sales man proves that the individuals or companies that prepare them to have an open mind, the results of IDAT test will be change and the potential of a greater positive result in the market place are astronomical.My personal suggestion is that every decision maker has to address cultural issues and deal with the subconscious. And the more knowledge on these topics it is best to forecast, and gain market share of profitability. So use this knowledge to address advertising campaign and sales strategies.",
            "Blink: The Power of Thinking Without ThinkingSummary\"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\" talks about how everyday decisions that we make almost subconsciously tend to be more complex than we may realize. Malcom Gladwell points out how some people aren't better than others at making decisions necessarily because they spend the most amount of time thinking about them, but more because they are good at picking out the important factors in a problem from the sometimes overwhelming number of variables in a given situation, and therefore focusing on these factors in order to make a decision. The author talks about how some of the best and most urgent/important decisions that we make occur based on judgments made at the \"blink\" of an eye.Gladwell uses the term \"thin-slicing\" to describe how when faced with a problem or situation, we tend to almost immediately unconsciously begin to filter out information that is irrelevant to the situation at hand, while we simultaneously subconsciously start to focus more and more on important \"slices\" of information with each second. The author elaborates that much of this thin-slicing analysis is based on knowledge and experience that we posses from previous situations, much of which is stored behind a \"locked door\" (i.e. we often cannot explain in words why or how these \"snap judgments\" that we make actually occur). He cites research conducted by a psychologist named Jonathan W. Schooler in noting that the brain's two hemispheres work completely differently, in that the left hemisphere often works in logic and words, while the right hemisphere is very visual. While we often use the aforementioned thin-slicing techniques to make snap judgments that are fairly accurate most of the time, when people have been asked to put the logic behind this quick thinking into words, it often not only causes them to falter in their explanations, but also overshadows and clouds the original thinking that subconsciously took place in their minds.The author cites many examples and analysis to bring to light the true \"power of thinking without thinking\", since many of us truly do not realize how much of our thinking is truly done in our unconscious. He explains that if we can learn to improve the quality of our decisions, we need to acknowledge and respect the fact that we may not always be able to know the true basis behind our thinking. Furthermore, a true balance between deliberate and instinctive thinking is key. If we allow our unconscious to take over 100 % in our decisions and analysis/judgment-making, we may end up with results that are too shallow. On the contrary, if we rely too much on deliberate analysis, we may overload our brains with information and overlook the crucial part of our unconscious that is part of human nature and serves as a key element in allowing us to make even better and more accurate judgments and decisions than any amount of research and analysis could ever produce.Response/OpinionI personally enjoyed Malcom Gladwell's \"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\", especially because I feel as though I can relate very closely to the underlying premise of what Gladwell is talking about in this book. Gladwell's main focus in \"Blink\" is about the human subconscious: the thought process that is performed in almost every situation of life that occurs unconsciously. The author further emphasizes the true importance of this ability that we humans posses, and how it is even often more essential to our everyday lives than in-depth analysis and active thought processes.Gladwell uses the example of the Getty Kouros, a Greek statue dating back to the sixth century B.C. that had been discovered by Gianfranco Becchina and presented to the J. Paul Getty museum in the early 1980's. Because such discovered kouroses are typically heavily damaged, worn, and visibly apparent that they were dug out of the ground, the fact that this kouros was in such good shape made many wary as to its authenticity. As a result, months of analysis and testing were conducted on the kouros, all of which pointed towards the kouros being the real deal. Nonetheless, experienced historians and experts such as Federico Zeri and Thomas Hoving took a look at this kouros, and almost at first glance, something told them that it just \"wasn't right\". Whether it is the statue's unusual flawlessness, or even something odd about its fingernails, many experts in this field had a strange feeling when observing the kouros no matter what the analysis and evidence had shown. Hoving even stated that the first word that came to his mind when seeing the marble statue was \"fresh\", a word obviously not fitting for a kouros that is supposedly over 2,000 years old. Though it still has not been determined whether or not the kouros is a true work of art from the sixth century B.C. or simply a well-crafted replica, many historians were able to make an almost instantaneous suspicious judgment about the statue just by looking at it. What is even more interesting is that if they are truly right, their instinctual \"snap judgments\" made by \"thin-slicing\" (that in the end these historians could not even explain in words) would prove to be more accurate than months of analysis and testing.The author discusses other examples that cite the mysterious ways of our subconscious, such as in the case of speed dating. He makes the interesting point that even though speed dating only allows people to have six minutes with each other before moving onto the next person, this time is enough for most people to use their instincts and snap-judgments in order to determine whether or not they think this person may be a potential fit. Or, another example cites an experiment where a Marne, Paul Van Riper, and several Marine Corps Generals traveled to the Mercantile Exchange in New York to meet with a group of Wall Street traders. After the market closed for the day, these Marines participated in trading games. Afterwards, the traders were similarly taken to a military base and participated in war games on computers, as well as live tank exercises. What was ultimately found was that both groups did extremely well on their simulations and games. Because Marines and traders both work in positions that require them to make frequent, spur-of-the-moment decisions, they both think the same way. Both groups were used to working under pressure and relying on thin-slicing and snap judgments in order to make effective decisions, and therefore did very well in their respective exercises.Whether it be Marine Corps, stock brokers, historians, or any other type of human, Gladwell points out that we all \"think without thinking\" on a daily basis. I particularly enjoyed his analysis because I am frequently someone who has trouble acting on what my brain tells me, since I usually concurrently have a stronger gut-instinct present within my heart that can conflict with my logical side. I think that a lot of what Gladwell elaborates on when he compares snap judgments that come from our subconscious versus more drawn-out, deliberate thinking processes relates to \"thinking with your heart\" versus \"thinking with your head\". Because I am, as I said, someone who frequently lets his heart win over his head, this instinct versus logic battle is something that I find myself struggling with on a daily bases since I am also largely a logical thinker and always analyze everything before making a decision. In fact, I frequently find myself trying to teach myself to think a different way in future situations after I find myself regretting making a decision in which I either let myself rely too much on my heart, or too much on my head.Gladwell emphasizes the fact that as humans, we need to try to find a balance between deliberate analytical thought and instinctual thinking. Because this has long been a struggle for me, I thoroughly enjoyed Gladwell's analysis and examples. He makes the interesting point that though all humans naturally use thin-slicing to make snap judgments that we often cannot even explain, people who are \"experts\" in a particular field tend to make less shallow judgments because of their experience and stored knowledge. I think that as time goes on and as one gains more experience through a repetition of similar types of situations, we naturally become \"experts\" in dealing with certain types of situations and decisions. The problem that I have come across however is that I tend to forget knowledge that I have gained from past experiences too easily, and I end up making the same mistakes in my analysis and decision making processes by repeating these mistakes throughout time. I think that Gladwell's insights have taught me that I personally need to work more actively towards keeping track of my experiences and using this gained knowledge in the active sector of my thinking process when situations arise. Yes, I will never be able to change the fact that I think largely with my heart (which I should not want to change), but if I am able to store this experience and knowledge effectively, I will be able to use it to my advantage in being able to make more in-depth and knowledgeable decisions in the future, especially when it comes to applying more of a deliberate thought-process in counteracting some of my snap judgments that may be somewhat incorrect.Overall, I really enjoyed \"Blink\" and what Malcom Gladwell had to say in this reading. I think his analysis is very pertinent since this is a topic in which every human being can relate to. Furthermore, it is most certainly applicable to everyone's lives, whether personally or in the business world. In relation to this course and in measuring customer value, I think Gladwell's analysis is especially pertinent since much of the perceptions and decisions made by marketers often rely on thin-slicing and snap judgments in addition to in depth analysis and market-research, especially in face-to-face, real-time situations with customers. All-in-all, I think that this book was an excellent read and is very relevant to our society in many ways. I would highly recommend it to people in all walks of life, as it is an easy read that can be very beneficial to people's lives and future decision-making.",

            "Just finished Blink, I read it in just 2 days which is very fast for me. It's a very good book. Most of the stories he uses to convey the ideas are interesting and valid, and much of the information is incredibly intriguing. I would have said the book was excellent but something happens to the author about half way through and all the \"Oooo, Ahh..Awesome\" gets clouded with the author's obvious liberal views, and the previous astounding theory and fact is replaced with righteousness and opinion. The ending was anti-climatic, and my copy had the add additional afterward which I read hoping for a little better closure, but ended up with more opinion. The entire book is still very good the content is valuable, and I believe most people I know will enjoy it.I recommend it to anyone in management (decision making positions) or anyone simply interested in how the mind works. It is not so much a book to train you to think in the blink of an eye, as much as a book to make you realize your mind already does that and how to be aware when those thoughts are valuable or not.",
            "Gladwell Delivers again. He goes into detail about an art forgery that fooled many but not if they had trusted their initial instincts. It is an amazing window into the decision making process and in fact reveals a great deal about what it means to make a first impression and why they really are so very important. Highly recommend this book!",
            "On the average I read about 6 books a month. In the last 12 months this is the worst book I've read. It's not just boring it's simply awful. Imagine a meal where they served up a decent salad then your second course was another salad not much different than the first, then your entree was a really big salad and the meal was finished off with a desert of, you guessed it by now didn't your, salad.This book is a series of stories about how things happen really fast and that some people can tell really quick whether something is authetic art, a dangerous situation, whether someone is a virtuoso muscian, etc.But the \"meat\" that's missing from all this salad is the basics of how to develop that skill and whether there is really any difference between intuition and dumb luck.The chapters second guessing law enforcement officers that have to make life and death decisions in nano-seconds is particuliarly egregious.This book is sold on a promise of a premise that would be useful in everyday life.

I usually like to wait until books come out in paperback before I buy them, but I was so intrigued by this author and book, that I purchased it right away.What I found, was the book is written at a very basic educational level. Because I have a BA in Psychology, I have already heard about most of the phenomenon's he discusses in the book. So, most of the book was a repeat of my undergraduate social psychology course. Also, most of these phenomenon's and methods for testing have technical terms in psychology. Instead of using any of these terms, he makes up his own terms as if he read a few research papers and then decided to write an entire book about a subject that he doesn't know a lot about.If you didn't go to college, or haven't had any psychology courses, then you will probably enjoy this book. But, if your background is similar to mine, then avoid reading this book. It reads like really bad cliffs notes from an old textbook.",

The book's premise and assertions are its strength. The writing is engaging but the packaging a bit too commercial and in some spots faulty.

But, as Gladwell shows, you can educate and exercise your rapid cognition to avoid critical traps.As someone interested in psychology, I read Blink with great interest: I learned from it and will definitely strive to \"slow down\" when decision-making under pressure.But, at the same time, I'm sorry I just finished reading the book.

(A teacher, I put my students to work doing a bunch of soul-crushing busy work so I could finish reading it during classtime.)It's full of great anecdotes, and Gladwell has a lucid and engaging style.The problem is this: as far as what Gladwell's actually saying, his observations don't sum to much.The basic thesis -- as I'm sure you know -- is that people in certain walks of life are frequently found to exhibit eerily reliable snap judgments, whereby they can arrive at the core of (what seem to us) monstrously complex problems in only a second or two.Fair enough. The phenomenon certainly exists. Gladwell documents it well and you find yourself convinced that he's not making this up.Alas. The book attempts to go further than that, and that's where it falls flat.Gladwell never successfully articulates exactly how it is that his various \"thin-slicers\" actually work their magic. Further, he fails to give proper weight to the counter-evidence: loads of cases where snap judgments fail. Offhand, I would imagine that judging situations based on one's initial impression is, on average, a dumb way to go most of the time (even perilous in some contexts).But so enthusiastic is Gladwell about the laundry-list of exceptions he has collected that it's almost to the point where he's implying that preternatural snap judgments are USUALLY reliable, rather than OCCASIONALLY reliable. Which is quite the daring claim.Finally, Gladwell fails to provide any guidance on the question of how one could systematically learn to hone such a skill, assuming that it can even exist in one's discipline (I remain to be convinced that snap judgments have a role to play in all walks of life).The end result of these shortcomings is that the only thing \"Blink\" does effectively is point out that the phenomenon exists. By itself this is not terribly useful.",
            "Let me start by saying that each chapter in the book is very interesting, easy to read and engaging. A real page turner from this point of view.Now, having said that, as a whole I couldn't see what was the author getting at through the book. The book starts with the premise that some people can make a snap decision about something and be right, which is interesting. But then, the book goes into chapter after chapter of examples on exemptions to this. Which at the end feels like the original premise is completely false. The only conclusion I could get is that some expert in something might be able to make a quick decision and be right, which is mostly chance alone.So in essence I found this book to be mostly unimportant.",
            "This book is definitely worth reading. We all need to take a pause now and then to reflect on what it is that we are doing. I especially enjoyed the chapter on mind reading. It is amazing how many facial expressions we use!",
            "This \"book\" is written as a 10 year old would write an essay.Not worth the price.It's cr*p. Completely useless.",
            "I gave three stars because at least it was easy to read. But it lacked any real depth or insights.It is more like talking in a bar to some guy who has some insights but takes a very long time to convey them.For some light reading it is fine. I am not sure the book is usful in any real way.I suggest Predictably irrational by Dan Ariely. It is also light and easy to read but you may come away with an idea or two.",
            "Having just readPersonal Best - How Ordinary People Achieve Extraordinary Success and How You Can Too,I was keen to read this book to keep the momentum going . I have read many books on personal finance and wealth building, but this one by Malcolm Gladwell is really good. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. And a great book that everyone should read. Malcolm Gladwell ties his stories well together - he is a master at making things previously unnoticed incredibly interesting. I highly recommend this book.",
            "I enjoyed reading this book. It was a fast read too. Malcolm, as always, writes very well. Lots of great information packed in this book. It was worth my time.",
            "This book is worth the read if you a fan of Malcolm Gladwells writing/thinking style. I believe people too often compare this book toThe Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Differenceand are therefore disappointed in this title. However, it's a different book with a different spin on how we think vs. how we feel. The main point to the book is that too much information can cloud your judgment and make it difficult or impossible to make the correct choice. Rather, we are often better served by listening to our intuition. I saw that other reviewers were pointing out flaws in his \"proof\" or pointing out that there could be other variables at play. Yes, of COURSE. However, the fact that there are other variables is exactly the point. The variables are endless and sometimes it's better to go with a \"Blink\" decision. Ultimately, like explained insomething like God: Six Weeks to Spirituality, there is a greater power \"out there\" in the universe, and by tapping into it, we can sometimes make better and quicker choices. Heck, if it's the \"wrong\" choice, at least now you can adjust your path as opposed to always wondering \"what if\" for the rest of your life. :)",
            "Definitely enjoyed this book! Not only was the subject thought-provoking, there were a lot of historical examples used throughout the book that were also interesting. Would recommend to all \"thinkers\" out there that are looking for a light and quick read.",
            "This book was an eye opener!! He really describes the way we may decisions in the \"blink\" of an eye. But he also discusses how there are times when you cannot make decisions like that. I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanted to learn more about non-verbal communication. The book also gave me a better understanding of autism.",
            "I am a huge fan of Gladwell. I loved the Tipping Point. The man seems to spend his time observing the obvious - yet in doing so he seems to see things others don't see. Once he talks about it, one can't help but become aware of what he is saying. Ah well I am blithering here, but I want to say that I recommend this and all Gladwells books. Wrong or right, he does give one something to think about. Intuition is something that has been around forever, but Gladwell explains it.",
            "I did not like this book because to me it felt like the author is providing unnecessary details to fill pages of a book.The underlying theory is well understood, but the narrative is too verbose.",
            "Nice book to understand our emotions while we are deciding about very complex subjects, and narrated by a genius writter as Malcom !",
            "As a Psych minor in college I read this book to see what it had to offer. I discovered while reading it that I began remembering lectures from college that where along the same line. I think this is a great book that is very insightful. Could be read by psychology buffs or practically anyone interested in thought processes. Would recommend this book and The Tipping Point!",
            "The book is an easy read and full of wonderful stories and vignettes that illustrate Malcolm's points. Essentially the book is about how people make rapid decisions, often before consciously processing the available data, and the good and bad consequences of this. We are all familiar with some of the negative consequences - racial stereotyping for instance - but Malcolm discuses some of the positive ways this impacts effective decision-making. Using a relatively small case of characters and some richly described stories he leads us through an understanding of how rapid cognition works, why it is different from how we analyze things and how it can be more or less effective that any approaches to problem solving.I particularly enjoyed the stores about people who had trained their snap judgments so that they could make quick and accurate assessments of situations while not being distracted by misplaced reactions and those about how hard it can be to describe a reaction, even if it is a good one.This book is highly recommended for anyone interested in how people make decisions.",
            "Even though this book starts off with a bang, I did not find the information conclusive. Based on anecdotes, the book lacks empirical data. Gladwell points out that once we have acquired a significant amount of information in a particular field, then related decisions tend to be more accurate. His \"thin slicing\" concept is worth a read. I recommend the author's previous book, The Tipping Point.",
            "This book is a revalation in new thinking! Easy to read, although I read it in one sitting. We just need to trust our instincts, and say \"I don't know\" more often. Buy it!!!",
            "I heard a book review cum interview on NPR with the author. The social implications that they talked about in the show was definitely interesting, so I bought the book - its still on the best seller list, if it means anything to any one - and I couldnt put it down. Its one of the few non-fiction books that has had been rivetted. It is written in a very organised way, in very simple lay person terms and also explains every concept with examples. It demystifies, without reducing the respect for the phenomena. I would recommend it to anyone who is curious about social psychology.",
            "Blink reminded me of what Bruce Lee had said: \"Master the lessons in this book and then throw it away.\" He meant that once you have it down, his fighting style is automatic; you no longer have to think about it, and the structure of thought is no different.Another book is relevant here; Moral Armor. Blink discusses cognitive action in slices; a better mind works with manageable slices while a slower mind attempts to work with too much information. Moral Armor describes the moral pattern of thought, which isolates its essential elements and makes decisions efficiently with an additional facet: complete moral certainty.In Blink, it is said that those at the top make decisions with much less information than one would suppose, but I'm inclined to think that like Bruce Lee, they have mastered their realm so completely that they can strike fast, precisely due to that prior foundation of experience.Perfect action in thought is based on Aristotelian logic, which is algebraic. Lethargic thought such as Blink's thick slices is evidence of a mind that cannot tell the difference between what is essential or inessential in any given context; such a person lacks a clear standard of value. In Moral Armor, that standard is shown to be life itself, where any speed of mind will reach the same end if only the way is known.I like both concepts. When you reach the point beyond all doubt that your moral course is correct--the point of total conviction by rational means--you become untouchable psychologically. To know what is right and how to get there, I'd love to get there in a Blink!",
            "I devoured this book, it's an interesting, quick and fun read. Initially I was convinced the author had conveyed some brilliant insights, and my life was changed. A few days later, though, I kind of think that his insights are interesting, yes, and thought-provoking. But not really much more than common sense would lead any intelligent person to conclude.Still, I do recommend it as an interesting book.",
            "As a New Yorker, Malcolm Gladwell could not resist the distractive style of writing of an urban writer. Though the book title is concise and descriptive, the entire book brings to my mind a scenario of a preacher reading a convoluted long story in a bar crammed with drunken folks. Too many stories on psychoanalytical research, of military personnel, musicians, corporate deals, police incidents, attacks on the president on USA, etc., are unnecessarily inserted and are confusing the main theme of the book. You won't escape plenty of unnecessary journalistic events such as the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan in the afternoon of March 30, 1981, the Michael Jackson's speaking for Pepsi Corporation, the Amadou Diallo's 1999 murder by police, or the O.J. Simpson verdict.Thus, instead of tackling the subject of interaction between the unconscious and conscious minds and the environment during decision-making, the author opted to use thousands of words in order to describe the simplest of the thought processes. The chapters' titles show how circumstantial the book presentation is, as follows.The Introduction, \"The statue that didn't look right\" confuses the error, on the part of an antiques dealer, in consulting inexperienced experts with irrelevant background for evaluating a statue for authenticity with the poor decision-making despite the abundance of information. The author attempts to show that the real experts that discovered the fake statue had made inexplicable, yet correct, snap-decision. He omits the fact that their pervious and long experience was the reason for making such right snap decision. Thus, they did processes abundance of data over many years before reaching that top-notch ability to decide in a blink.Chapter 1, \"the theory of thin slices: how a little bit of knowledge goes a long way\" attempts to dwell on facial expressions and personal conducts to reach quick conclusions on issues such as love relationships and judging the professionalism of doctors through first impressions. It lists many stories in order to reach the conclusion that one could discern a whole lot of information by mere glancing. It ignores the fact that individual circumstances dictate different reactions.Chapter 2, \"the locked door: the secret life of snap decisions\" contends that people are not free at will when making decision but rather operating at autopilot mode, with their prejudices and instincts through previous priming forces.Chapter 3, \"the Warren Harding error: why we fall for tall, dark, and handsome men\" shows how circumstantial the author could get. Instead of analyzing the issue of prejudice and scapegoating based on physical appearance or racial bias, the author wastes many long pages on personalizing the character of senator Warren Harding in the year 1914.Chapter 4, \"Paul van Riper's big victory: creating structure from spontaneity\" dwells on story of a Vietnam commander to advance the importance of spontaneity and the value of relying on less information in making sound decisions.Chapter 5, \"Kenna's dilemma: the right-and wrong- way to ask people what they want\" discusses the issue of general impression and perceived image in the success of a musician, the Coca Cola's image, and other corporate advertisement.Chapter 6, \"Seven seconds in the Bronx: the delicate art of mind reading\" attempts to explain the process of thinking of the police officers who shot Amadou Diallo in 1999 in the Bronx. The author list three arbitrary mistakes that led to the tragically flawed decision to shoot. He omits many confounding factors such as the white race of the cops in a black neighborhood, the questionable level of training of the cops, the unfortunate situation of miscommunication with an immigrant unfamiliar with police procedure, or the possibility of foul play by the cops.Had the author avoided personalizing the underlying processes of thought-making and adopted more systemic psychoanalytical explanation of snap decision-making, he might have been able to present a more credible book.",
            "I had high hopes for this book. It actually has some insights that are worth listening to. But ultimately it turns into a culturally biased commentary on why you are racist whether you know it or not. Also, we are reminded that the author is better than you, particularly if you are a white male. And finally, he manages to make the book political by using only examples to support his arguments that are out of the liberal playbook of stereotypes and false premises. I actually think some of his points are valid, but if he cannot see past his own viewpoint that racism is under every rock and behind every tree (which is patently false if you are a liberal reading this) how can you trust any of his conclusions?",
            "This book is extremely interesting and thought provoking. It is all about a concept called \"thin slicing\" which is a fancy term to describe the intuitive first impressions that humans make upon other people. There are tons of historical facts, astonishing quotes, and scholarly references that will absolutely blow your mind. This is my first Malcolm Gladwell book, but definitely not my last.",
            "I am a fan of Gladwell's work but his book \"Blink\" seemed a little light. Increasingly, when modern research is telling us that our brains are easily tricked, this book seems to go against this trend. I understand the concept of a gut check or gut instinct, but Galdwell seems to stress this above logic and sound reasoning. I was always a fan of before any hard decision - sleep on it. It is almost like he is saying that you can judge a book by its cover? Isn't this how con artist operate (or shady used car salesmen). They assume you will make snap decisions without really thinking it through. In the end the book felt a little like a series of articles or short stories. It never really felt whole. If you want one of Gladwell's better works, read \"Outliers\".",
            "I thought this book would teach me how to make decisions faster but really leaves you wondering when to make quick decision or not. It does not guide you it how to make quick decision as we often need to do.",
            "My brother had told me about this book and some of the social experiments that were talked about in it. I thought it sounded pretty interesting, so I bought it. Now, I'm not quite finished with it as of yet, but I'm really into it. It helps you think more about smaller things and pay more attention to things you normally wouldn't.I recommend it.",
            "I really enjoyed this and other Gladwell books. His ability to intertwine different, yet related, topics is fresh and keeps readers entertained!",
            "`Blink' is aptly named, as it provided enough entertaining anecdotes to while away a rainy weekend. However, this work falls short of Malcolm Gladwell's more credible treatise, `Outliers,' because its central thrust leans clumsily on psychology, in which the author has no training whatsoever. The result is not particularly cohesive, and Gladwell often comes to fore-head slapping conclusions at times. For example, he cites a psychologist who is able to tell if a marriage is on the brink because he can detect `contempt.' The characters in the story fit the argument too neatly to be credible.The book has repackaged popular psychological ideas (many were explained in Nassim Taleb's `The Black Swan') about intuition but would have been better coming from someone more authoritative. Steven Pinker, perhaps. Half the time, I found myself wanting to read the psychological studies themselves, skipping Gladwell's buckshot summaries of them.However, the chapters closer to the author's own knowledge base are satisfying. In particular, Gladwell draws from a deep well as a former Washington Post reporter to present fascinating insights on various police issues. Those are Blink's best chapters.",
            "Most people have always grown up with the belief that good decisions require planning, and lots of time to take in details. Malcolm Gladwell, writer for New Yorker and best-selling author of The Tipping Point, Outliers, and What the Dog Saw: and Other Adventures suggests we do not give our own intuitions enough credit.Blink shows us the many times where split-second decisions have ended in positive results. Gladwell shows us scenario after scenario of times when our intuition gave us the ability to make accurate decisions.In one example, Gladwell talks about a musician named Kenna. Immediately upon hearing ten seconds of Kenna's music, Craig Kallman, co-president of Atlantic Records, decided the Kenna's music may have a home with his company. In the end, Kallman didn't rely on his sixth sense and decided research Kenna's selling ability. Though Kenna already had a small fan base, according to the research apparently the selected audience seemed very unexcited to hear anymore of Kenna's music and Kallman never signed him.Through the example, Gladwell poses the question that perhaps if the Kallman had listened to his instincts instead of doing a load of research Kenna may have proved to be a pretty successful artist.The book consists mostly of more examples among these lines, constantly showing how some of the best decisions have been without having to give them much thought. The idea is very interesting, and the first few chapters and examples are very thought provoking. However, the book quickly digresses into heap of repetitive examples. The book leaves us convinced but confused, without any explanations of how or why our brains make good quick decisions. After awhile the book became difficult to read.The book seemed very good overall. It has very exciting ideas. However, I believe that it could use some more insight and fewer examples. This book entertains the audience and will leave the reader wanting to know more.",
            "BlinkThe power of thinkingwithout thinkingBy Malcolm GladwellBlink, the unconscious awareness that sits in the subconscious helping people assess the situations and problems in their lives. Communities unknowingly have a blink tendency that was experimented on and shown in a study perform by a group of scientist from the University of Iowa that showed with a simple gambling test that anything that is not good for us or that place the slight bit of stress on is recognized but not reacted upon.The recognition occurs within seconds of any said action/problem being started or observed, this means that people have the capability to access, understand, and adjust to any situation or problem within a blinks time.The brain sends different signs to inform that it has unconsciously decided what we are going to feel about an object or situation, like the palms of the subject's hands becoming sweaty from the gambling experimentof the study by the University of Iowa scientist, or the \"Intuitive Repulsion\" that Angelos Delivorrias felt when she got the chills and instantly knew that the Getty kouros.The reader is initially stirring with questions, \"Why should I trust this response?\" \"When should we be wary or trust the intuitive response?\"It is very easy to make mistakes; this was shown with the four police officers who shot and killed Amadou Diallo. One officer, Sean Carroll said that Diallo appeared \"suspicious,\" a man sitting around, he then said he was amazed because of the fact that he didn't run at the sight of police and called him \"brazen,\" a man standing outside observing his surroundings is brazen?Finally they said he was dangerous because they miss read the snap judgment, or intuitive repulsion that they felt as he reached into his pocket before they opened fire, feeling as thought there life was in some kind of imminent danger.Too often as humans do we misread our snap judgments and blink responses because of an emotion, which a previous occurrence has, lead us to form, this is the sole problem that people have with interrupting these early notification signs today. It is good that there was someone who was able to publish work in which readers can understand that they may be making these mistakes without recognition, and doing it in a way that the readers remain interested and entertained. Malcolm Gladwell made this scientific study amusing and easy to understand a great trait to have in any book published for the masses. Because this book was so interesting, it should be instituted in to school classes, instead of some of the books that are so dreadful to read and relate to. This is a great read and I would recommend this book to anyone without hesitation. we",
            "What provides the best results: Careful and complete deliberation, or making a snap decision; gathering all the information available, or using a few selected facts; a blind audition, or watching the performer? Are our best decisions made by our unconscious mind, \"behind the locked door,\" so to speak?In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell uses dozens of illustrations and experiments to answer these and other questions, alluding to a power in \"thinking without thinking.\" One of several propositions in the book suggests that too many details actually hamper good decision making rather than helping.After reading Blink, I felt dazed by too much scattered information. Perhaps Gladwell should follow his own advice and cut to the chase rather than dragging his message out ad nauseam.It's not that Gladwell, author of the # 1 bestseller The Tipping Point and staff writer for The New Yorker, has written a boring book. I found the stories and experiments in Blink both interesting and edifying; however, the key points sometime seem illusive and maybe even contradictory on the surface. For example, one illustration emphasizes the importance of, \"mind reading,\" by careful study of facial expression, while another advocates blind auditions to avoid letting our eyes, biases, and culture taint our decision when selecting a musician for our orchestra. Blink uses so many stories and illustrations that the message becomes scrambled, if not lost.The final chapter in Blink takes off on yet another tangent rather than developing any sort of conclusion or summary of the previous dialog.Interestingly, the most concise and poignant message in Blink, comes in the \"Afterword\" chapter, pp. 273-276, \"A Call to Action.\" In two short pages Gladwell presents a convincing argument and recommendation regarding the justice system in the United States. Move the accused in a criminal trial out of the courtroom, Gladwell suggests, answering questions through an intermediary. Eliminate any evidence and testimony that tips the jury off to the age, race, or gender of the defendant, anything that could affect impartiality. The statistics on conviction rates of black men vs. white men in our country drives home this point in a powerful and convincing way.Now, if you will excuse me, the book Blink has \"primed\" me with the overwhelming desire to stock up on Coca Cola, buy some Knott's Berry Farm jam, some Christian Brothers brandy, and one of those unsightly but very comfortable Herman Miller \"Aeron\" chairs. Then I want to kick back and watch some Kenna videos on MTV2. If you read Blink I'm sure you will understand.",
            "The working of the human mind, one of the oldest mysteries remains the largest, most bizarre of frontiers. From the very beginning men like Freud and Wundt have been trying to unravel this mystery. They have attempted to map out and stake a claim on this measureless frontier. While we have came a long way and we do know more about \"knowing\" than we have in the past, there remains a great deal that we are ignorant of.Malcolm Gladwell uses Blink to stake his claim in the frontier of the human psyche. His book arrives as a fresh and interesting proposal about how we make decisions, process information, and take in the world around us. Gladwell, staff writer for The New Yorker and author of The Tipping Point, beautifully weaves together anecdotes, research, personal experience and interviews in order to prove his suggestion that the human mind processes information much faster than we are consciously aware of. Gladwell's first anecdote proves his point nicely; he tells the story of a Greek sculpture called a kouros. The owner of the kouros wanted ten million dollars for the statue which he claimed was from the sixth century. The J. Paul Getty Museum launched an investigation; fourteen months and many tests later they believed that the statue was authentic and purchased it. However, as soon as the statue went on display it was obvious that something was amiss-- every expert in Greek art who looked at the statue immediately felt that it was \"wrong\". One even going so far as to say he felt an \"intuitive repulsion\" after looking at the statue for only two or three seconds. At the end of the story it is discovered the statue is indeed a fraud. Gladwell states that our \"adaptive unconscious\" uses a process that he calls \"thin slicing\". This process is where our brain takes in a small amount of information in a very short time and arrives at a complex, and many times correct, hypothesis. However, Gladwell also shows \"our unconscious is a powerful force. But it's fallible\"Gladwell brings out the \"mind reading\" parts of thin slicing \"are subtle and complex\" and \"sometimes goes terribly awry.\" In the case of Amadou Diallo it went very wrong indeed. Diallo ,a black man from Guinea, lived in the Bronx. On the night of February 3, 1999, four plain clothes police officers mistakenly identified Diallo as a known rapist. As they approached him, he ran inside of a building and pulled a black object from his pocket. He was gunned down by the four police men. The black object was only wallet and the four police men had just experienced the dark side of thin slicing and snap decision making.Gladwell goes on to prove his proposal by interlacing many other anecdotes and research involving war games, gamblers, former president Warren Harding, and even rock and roll musicians.Gladwell uses a clever set up, a thorough introduction and is precise in proving his theory. He does a fantastic job in all aspects related to his proposal about our subconscious. While his use of research gives his proposal credibility Blink is far from a boring unimaginative list of statistics. His masterful use of a wide range of anecdotes and interviews invites the reader to continue exploring the topic. Gladwell's idea about the human mind and the way it operates is complete and made believable. Gladwell's writing style and presentation of facts creates the feel that you are having an intriguing and enjoyable conversation. His writing style and the organization of his information really adds to the appeal of his book, his proposal, and the likeability of Gladwell himself.",
            "Got this book from a reading list for a Critical Thinking class I attended. I struggled through the first couple chapters of the book thinking the support for the conclusions to be rather weak. But as I got further in I was finding it more interesting and meaningful. The book finished strong. I've since purchased a couple of the books referenced in Blink. I gave away my original copy and will buy another. I thinking my second reading will put the first few chapters in a much better light.",
            "\"I believe . . . there can be as much value in the blink of an eye as in months of rational analysis\". Gladwell promises to show the reader that quick decisions can be \"every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately\", when we can and can't trust such snap judgments, and how they can be \"educated and controlled\". He fails. Entertainingly and informatively, but he still fails.Blink analyzes decision making in everyday life, sport, crime, war, and emergencies of various kinds. Each individual case study is presented admirably, showing how experts make their decisions in that particular field. The problem is that the lessons are usually not transferable. What can we learn from the following?-An art historian, with one glace, identifies as fake a statue that months of scientific tests had pronounced genuine. She can't say exactly why. It just doesn't look right.-A decision tree based on a few simple questions gives better results than the expert clinical judgment of doctors in an emergency room. The tree is derived from extensive statistical analysis.-Psychologists can make good predictions about the durability of a relationship (not perfect, but much better than chance) after watching a couple interact for only a few minutes. They do this by watching for signs they have picked up by watching hundreds of hours of slow motion videotape of other couples.-Professional tennis and baseball players believe in and teach techniques that they do not use in practice (\"roll the wrist\" and \"watch the ball onto the bat\" - the former causes injury and the latter is physically impossible!).-People who believe themselves unprejudiced reveal unconscious bias (with regard to race, sex etc) in word association tests and auditions.All of the brilliant \"blink of an eye\" decisions are grounded on knowledge of many previous decisions and their outcomes. (With a formal decision rule, the decision maker need not possess the knowledge personally, but it is guiding their actions all the same.) It seems an almost inescapable corollary that there is no generalised skill called \"good judgment\". One heart attack or statue is enough like another to permit useful generalisation, but heart attacks and statues are different enough that the rules for one are useless for the other. Sometimes decisions are made quickly because they have to be, and sometimes because there is no gain from waiting for more information or analysis. Sometimes the logic of the decision can explained rationally to a non-expert, and sometimes it can't. Expertise can come from formal training, or years of practical experience, or just following the instructions, dummy. And prejudice based on irrelevant information can bias even the most expert.(Scene: foot of bodhi tree. The Author, sitting in great serenity, is approached by a worshipful Reader.)Reader: So, Mr. Gladwell, can I learn to make quick, accurate judgments?Author: Of course. Just make sure that you consider all relevant information (but not irrelevant information, which might cause prejudice), and take as much time as you need (but no longer).Reader: How do you know which information is relevant and how long is long enough?Author: Well . . . you just know! You are an expert.Reader: But I'm not an expert. That's why I bought the book! [Reviewer's confession: I actually borrowed it from the library.]Author: Well, in that case I suggest you work and study hard for many years, and then you will be an expert.Reader: In decision making?Author: No, just in whatever subject you spent years studying.This is just how the world is, so it might seem unfair to blame Gladwell. But the whole book is explicitly about \"the power of thinking without thinking\", one might say intuition for short. The promise was insight into decision making in general, not just about the authenticity of art or heart attack treatment. An impossible promise, maybe, but all the more reason it should not have been made.",
            "I absolutely adore Malcolm Gladwell and pretty faithfully follow his work in the New Yorker and on his website, as well as his other works. (No, I'm not a stalker, just a fan hee-hee). However, I didn't love this book quite as much. I won't summarize it again here; I'll just leave a few quick complaints.1. It's possible to read the last two paragraphs of each chapter and pretty much get the gist of the whole chapter. If the paragraphs leading up to these last two were interesting and thought-provoking, I wouldn't do this, but by the end, I just wanted to finish.2. The pattern of each chapter follows a predictable course: introduce an eccentric real person, introduce a concept related to our brain's ability to make a snap judgment, and then combine these two to show how that eccentric person is or uses an example of neural abilities. Oh, and then follow-up with a quickie bit of advice on how to apply this to our own lives.3. None of the eccentric people or neuroscience is especially new or thought-provoking anyway.So, save yourselves some money and continue reading Malcolm's work in the New Yorker online.",
            "A book obviously intended to entertain as opposed to educate. While the premise is interesting, the science does not support the jumps that Gladwell makes. Read Damasio, Baars, or even Dennett to get a better idea of recent brain science from people actually in the field.",
            "the idea of the book, the fact that someone outside the narrow specialized groups of people who actually experiment with \"thin slicing\" put all the information in one place and presented it to general public is amazing.kudos to gladwell for seeing the thread and making it into a book of fascinating data. however, he did not manage to make the book itself fascinating. maybe its a criticism i should direct at his editors.book is slightly all over the place, it does not lead to a conclusion, it is more like a collection of information, ideas, stories, examples, anecdotes, many of which get rehashed almost ad nauseam.the good thing about it is that it gives a lot of sources for further research.worth reading, even if it leaves you a bit wanting at the end.",
            "The writing was very good and kept my attention and the book was enthralling. The whole point was how our mind is so powerful that a lot of times it can make instant decisions better than if we thought on something for a long time. It taught that \"gut instincts\" are a lot of times our brain making subconscious decisions based on our past knowledge and experience.Also the book showed how prejudice and ignorance can also cause the wrong instant decisions. It is a good read but it really had no final big revelation.",
            "To start with the positive, this book is very well-written and hooks you in. The author makes great use of interesting stories to highlight points or lead into new discussions. Unfortunately, the stories end up being told to lead you down a very specific path.This book is marketed and touted as being an interesting psychological and science-based discussion of the power of first impressions, gut reactions, and/or intuitive thought. However, the book fails miserably in the credibility department once the reader realizes the author's social/political agenda. After spending the better part of half the book making the case that snap judgments and shoot from the hip decisions are the key to a better life and more efficient workplace, Gladwell then plays the cards of racism and sexism to suggest, that these sole areas are reserved for careful thought and reason. Gladwell acknowledges at the end of the book in the acknowledgments that one of his motivations for writing the book was his concern for racial stereotypes. He is half black apparently, and was razzed by the police a couple of times in New York city because of his afro. Seriously, he talks about this at the end of the book.If Gladwell wants to write a book about race relations, that is fine. But this book is really a load of pseudoscience laid out to make the case that people need to watch their stereotypes. That last argument is a valid one, but after reading this book I felt that the presentation and marketing of the book was very misleading. In the end, \"blink\" does not make the case or provide any real evidence for the proposition that initial impressions are consistently better than logic and thoughtful decision making. In fact, with all the discussion of racism and sexism, Gladwell shoots himself in the foot and explains just how unfair, foolish, and even dangerous it can be to try and analyze a situation in the \"blink of an eye.\"",
            "The premise of this book is that accurate decisions often can be made without an abundance of data, and that in many situations, too much data and analysis actually hampers the ability to make an effective decision. In particular, Gladwell posits that persons with an expertise in a specialized area of concern often develop a keen sense for making quick decisions, a concept Gladwell refers to as \"thin-slicing\". At it's best, the book is well-written, evokative, and entertaining with its myriad examples and anecdotes. But at it's worst, we are left with merely a \"common sense\" awareness that experts can (and often should) rely on their \"gut feelings\" about situations within their specific realm of expertise. Reading this book left me asking \"so what?\" and wishing for practical information about how persons like you and I can develop skills to take advantage of thin-slicing. I think this work would have been more revealing if Gladwell had gone on to apply how concepts such as situational awareness can be used to enable persons to develop better perceptions of their environment and thus develop thin-slicing skills of their own. More information about situational awareness can be found at:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_awareness",
            "This is a subject of great interest to me: what kind of thought goes on that we are not \"conscious\" of. What powerful, parallel algorithms are executed by the brain, but outside of the step-by-step process we call rational thought. The anecodotes are great and give a real feeling for the wonders of the mind, but Gladwell's analysis seems a little sketchy. The fundamental criticism is that the experts he discusses have spent years learning their unconscious skills. Gladwell is obviously aware of the theory of learning, how sequential thought eventually gets turned into pattern-matching parallel systems in the brain, but the tone of the work is more \"magical\". This makes for fun writing, but leaves you feeling a little disappointed. I would really rank this as 3.5 stars...it is better than average, but there are lots of 4 star books out there one could read instead.",
            "One of the criticisms of this book is that is nothing more than a string of anecdotes. For the first few chapters, I was of the same mind. However, even if that were the case, the anecdotes themselves are interesting enough to keep one moving through the book at a rapid pace. In the end the stories drew me in, convincing me that there was a real phenomenon that the author describes as \"thin-slicing\" (making a decision at an essentially subconscious level based on a few pertinent pieces of data). I was intrigued enough to finish the book, hoping to see if Gladwell succeeded in his goals of describing where thin-slicing can be successful, where it fails, and what one can do about it.I would say that he had mixed success. Does he lay out a comprehensive blueprint for using thin-slicing - no. However, he does succeed in raising awareness about this phenomenon and where it might apply in daily life. In particular, the descriptions of situations in which thin-slicing breaks down are generalizable.For example, after reading the book, I am now more open to the possibility that bias might color my hiring decisions. The description of the results of blind versus unblinded auditions can be applied to any interview situation. In the future, I will take more steps to avoid this.Another example is the description of how our ability to read subtle clues breaks down in high-stress situations. I work in the medical field, and these lessons can be used to minimize decision-making failures in medical emergencies.Finally, the description of how over-analysis can paralyze judgment can be applied in any catastrophe. In the twin towers attack of 9/11, there are reports that workers in the second tower were told to wait for more information before acting. Some did as they were told. Others trusted their gut instinct that things were not safe and left. The ones who \"thin-sliced\" are the ones who lived.So - if you understand that this is a superficial introduction to a complex topic, I think it is an enjoyable and thought-provoking book. It reads very quickly. If you hesitate to pay for a hard cover that you will finish in a few hours, this might be one to put on your paperback watch list.",
            "Gladwell knows he's no expert--he's a researcher and a writer, a listener and a storyteller. Attempting to pull together the fascinating and at times mind-boggling stories and facts in this book into a neat package of conclusions is best left to academic experts and pompous quacks, so Gladwell steers clear. You shouldn't expect to read this book and walk away with six points to remember and apply. But you can count on enjoying the sharp writing and the engaging stories. It's unbelievable that a book about the human mental capacity to make split-second decisions could be this readable.This book ultimately adds up to a great big \"something to think about.\" But the earnest work and feeling Gladwell has invested in this book of real substance make mulling it over deeply rewarding.",
            "\"Blink\", by Malcolm GladwellThis was a fun book to read. I've always been fascinated by my powers of intuition, and have long wondered how to more effectively - and proactively - tap into them. Mr. Gladwell analyzes various aspects of our intuitive natures, and his use of real-world examples helps to demonstrate how to apply various techniques he explains in the book. He also provides insights into a means of tapping into our self-conscious minds. Contrary to everything I'd read previously, this appears to be a skill which can be acquired with practice.The chapter on mind reading was also quite interesting; although I must admit I skimmed over the section which articulated the names of each of the facial muscles (there certainly are many!). I'd never before noticed how peoples' ability to read minds is so dependent on minute facial expressions.Having read Mr. Gladwell's book, I now feel equipped to progress my intuitive skills by using the tools his book has provided.If you're interested in intuition and \"being in the moment\" - which is a requirement if you wish to use your intuitive powers - you shoulddefinitely read another wonderful book authored by Ariel and Shya Kane entitled, \"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work\". This is a really fun book to read and offers an easy approach to living in the moment, and tapping into your natural intuitive abilities. Both are highly recommended!",
            "Second reading from Gladwell, with first one being \"The Tipping Point\", naturally. I am almost finished with this book so I might be doing a premature review. The book starts off strong, and captivates your attention from the start - the observations on small details and sub-conscious thinking that goes on in our brain is fascinating. I just wish the experiments listed were a bit more specific; as in the test environments, and all the control subjects. Sometimes I wonder well, did they look at this scenario vs. that one? I wonder (just slightly) if some of the conclusions might not be a bit premature. It is however an extremely stimulating read. I do like this type of modern pyschology and I do like how well the author writes. I do recommend it.",
            "As I read this, I kept asking myself if I really needed a book to tell me that at times my \"adaptive unconscious\" made quick decisions and that sometimes this was good and others bad. As obvious as some of the points in this book seem, it is important precisely because snap judgments are so natural I have rarely thought about the phenomenon.Several folks I know who have read this have asked me what is the point. To me that is the point. Gladwell does not provide definitive answers of how and when to use our adaptive unconscious. Instead, he provides us with plenty of information to make us more aware of how and why we make decisions. The real benefit of this book is that it leaves the reader thinking about blinking. This is no small feat considering it is something that I (and I suspect other readers) rarely thought about--in spite of the fact that we do it daily--before reading this.Hardly weighed down by excessive theory, the book's other charms are the innumerable entertaining stories and examples Gladwell marshals in support of his points. A good read that will inevitably influence the way you think and make decisions.",
            "Whereas 'The Tipping Point' seemed to lose me in how the total arguement was strung together, 'Blink' got a little tedious in that it spoon-feeds the storytelling yet never seemed to go anywhere. I consider it a quick, easy read and therefor worth the time and money invested. On the other hand, I want to say that it lacked depth even though I can't logically explain why that is. Certainly there are enough examples presented throughout and each was thoroughly over-explained. (Ugh.) Still, I finished the book wanting more...a stronger connection or something. The entire book felt like the build-up to a grand denouement that never arrived. It doesn't live up to the hype so just read it with realistic expectations. It *is* entertaining, let's leave it at that. ('The Tipping Point' was a much more satisfying read.)",
            "I often hear an interview with an author or read a review of a book that sounds terrific, only to learn when I read the book that I learned about all I need to know from the interview or review. Unfortunately BLINK fits that category although Mr. Gladwell does make some interesting observations that fall into the sad, the fascinating and the obvious.It is sad, for instance, that in the year 2005 we are still programmed by racial stereotypes when we blink. The shooting of Amadou Diallo is an unfortunate example. Police officers see a small black man on the street after midnight in a bad neighborhood in the Bronx. When they drive by him he does not run. Then he finally runs, attempting to get into his apartment and reaches for somethig that turns out to be a billfold. We know how this incident ended. Mr. Gladwell goes into great detail to explain all the mistakes that the polices officers made. For instance, if they had paid attention to his face they would have seen that he was frightened rather than dangerous. It is incredibly sad that in an experiment where black college students, when given twenty questions taken from the GRE, the standardized test for admission to graduate school, if asked to state their race on a pretest questionnaire, the number of questions they would get correct is cut in half, they are so programmed by negative racial stereotypes. (Congressman John Lewis has spoken out recently on racial profiling at airports.)Some of Mr. Gladwell's facts are fascinating. Shoppers will pay more for the same amount of ice cream if it is packaged in a round rather than a rectangular container, for instance. Then there is the Pepsi v. Coke taste test. Fanatics swear they can tell the difference, and many drinkers can. However, if you do the triangle test, where you put the same cola in two glasses and the other in the third glass and ask a thousand samplers to tell you which two colas are the same, only about a third of the testers gets it right. That, according to the author, is not much better than chance, so we might as well guess.Many of the author's observations and conclusions are obvious: what he calls the Warren Harding error-- that we often vote for attractive political candidates regardless of their qualifications; and that tall white men get promoted over black men, white women, black women and short white men; and that blinking or \"thin slicing\" is more accurate if it involves something we care about and are good at, i.e., we have experience in the area. He gives example after example of this: the psychologist who through years of study can predict from a short interview with a young couple- even if they are just discussing a pet-- if they will get a divorce down the road; the art critic who spotted an expensive fake immediately because she had studied ancient sculptures, the seasoned tennis pro who can predict when tennis players will miss their second serve.The Seventeenth Century philosopher Pascal is way ahead of Mr. Gladwell since he said something similar a long time ago: chance favors the prepared mind.",
            "Malcom Gladwell does a great job of discussing the pitfalls and powers of our instant perceptions. His concept of gut feel and the \"thin slice\" reminds the reader that our instincts and our perceptions (particularly visual percepions) are powerful influencers on our behavior. It is important to remember and understand our influencers and not allow them to disproportionally or irrationally impact our decision making processes. A great book to better understand yourself, others, and the psychology of interaction.",
            "Can non-fiction be well written, beautifully researched, entertaining and informative without succeeding in making it's case? If you've read Malcolm Gladwell's Blink, your answer is very likely to be affirmative. By Blink, Gladwell is referring to your first impression. Call it intuition (he won't); call it thin slicing (he does); his thesis is that first impressions can tell you much more about a subject than a lot of extra thought can. Never mind sleeping on a subject, or studying it; go with your instincts, first impression; go with your first blink. To make his case, Gladwell starts with some really good examples. He cites art experts that can pick out a well- engineered fraud in an instant. Then there's the military expert who uses quick thinking to defeat a superior force in a blink. By about a third of the way through the book, you'll be thinking, now this guy is on to something. But, alas, as you get into it, the examples get weaker. Doubt sets in. Indeed, some later examples completely refute his original organizing hypothesis that first impressions are more valid than too much analysis. Finally, in his nice conversational style, Gladwell cites several examples of policemen, who, in stressful situations, racially stereotype. What? It seems here the rule reverses: Don't jump to conclusions. At that point, you'll be saying Huh! By the last chapter, you'll be wondering if maybe they should change the title from Blink to Think.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed this book. As a non-fiction piece it is a quick, easy, compelling and even entertaining read. It's real value to me was in the individual anecdotes, particularly the ones about the Cook County Hospital and heart attack cases, the case of discrimination against women in European orchestras, and the Milennium Challenge in the Persian Gulf military exercise, all of which show how `thinking differently' can solve big problems without extended hand wringing, reports, and excessive committee meetings, the result being quick effective decisions. The documented studies he offers in some instances are helpful in justifying his conclusions.Gladwell addresses what must surely have crossed all our minds more than once, that too much information is just that - too much information. (In our `information age', internet-connection, and cell-phone-texting times, we are prone to just such overload, in my opinion.) But Gladwell shows how little information is very often needed for good decision making. He does not offer a formula, but rather stimulates thought about decision making, about the value of split decisions as well as the need in some cases for a more analytical approach. The challenge, in my opinion, is knowing when which application is appropriate. The value of experience is validated in this book.I would not want to have missed this book. It's too easy to get swept along in the information age, and miss our most valuable personal assets, our own experience. Gladwell helps.",
            "BLINK: THE POWER OF THINKING WITHOUT THINKING was a very interesting, quick read, that made me think of other books I've read recently on cognition, knowledge and decisionmaking, such as The Wisdom of Crowds by James Surowiecki (another New Yorker writer), The Logic of Failure by Dietrich Dorner and The Gift of Fear by Gavin de Becker (whom Gladwell references in this work). This book is about how we know what we know, how we decide when to act on that knowledge, and how our other emotional needs and underlying associations enter into our process to disrupt it. Gladwell writes about his premise linearly, developing his ideas and enriching the concepts as he goes along with rich examples from sports, pop culture, healthcare and psychological research. It was a fascinating and educational read.The subject of BLINK is that the human mind is capable of quick, decisive, correct thinking -- we can know things in the blink of an eye. Gladwell's introduction focuses on the Getty Museum's purchase of a kouros that turned out to be a fake. All the Getty's tests confirmed that the kouros, though very rare, was authentic, but when outside art experts saw it for the first time, they knew instantly that it wasn't at all authentic. How did they know? Some of them couldn't articulate this...they just knew that it was wrong.Gladwell states that this ability is founded on \"thin slicing\" -- the ability to separate necessary information for decisionmaking from \"noise.\" Gladwell then explores the \"locked door\" -- the premise that a great deal of our \"thinking without thinking\" goes on in our subconscious, and try as we might, we cannot understand how we know what we know. In this chapter, Gladwell explores psychological testing of human subjects with \"priming\" -- planting certain words in subjects minds and then watching how they behave in social situations (like planting polite words and observing heightened polite behavior or, conversely, aggressive words and aggressive behavior).In further discussion of subconscious influences on conscious decisionmaking, Gladwell uses the Warren G. Harding case as an example of cultural preferences for certain traits -- preferences that are rooted in the subconscious, of which we aren't even aware. In this discussion, Gladwell uses the Implicit Association Test research at Harvard (a fascinating experience...you can take your own at: https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/demo/) that measures the degree to which one holds preferences for thin or young people, or relates images of weapons to black men or science and math careers to men. This is cogent to the discussion of quick decisionmaking because these views may be predictive of how we may act in certain kinds of spontaneous situations.The subject of spontaneity leads to a fascinating chapter on a large war game, the Millenium Challenge, and the two approaches taken by its combatting leaders. The Blue Team used copious amounts of data, slicing and dicing. The Red Team, didn't believe that the fog of war could be lifted and went into battle giving a great deal of control and autonomy to lower-level soldiers and commanders. The Red Team won (until Blue changed the rules and started again!). Gladwell uses this example as a way to illustrate the damage too much information can do. A discussion of expertise follows in which Gladwell points out that experts snap judgments are different from the rest of the population's quick impressions because they are more informed. And this is, to me, the nut of the whole book. Blink thinking works best for those who have a basis of knowledge on a topic (such as the art experts' views of the fake kouros) because whether their decisions come from behind the locked door or not, they are informed by years of knowledge acquistion. They are often better able, as well, to understand some of the key aspects of their responses. The penultimate chapter is about the Amadou Diallo case in the Bronx, in which four police officers fired 41 rounds at an unarmed black man standing on his stoop after midnight. Gladwell's dissection of the case is fascinating and enlightening, as he takes the position that the police were neither racist nor blameless. Due to two aspects of the situation that makes people \"mind blind\" -- increased situational \"arousal\" and lack of time or \"white space\" to assess the situation, the officers acted out of their basest instincts because the situation (of their own making) reduced their ability to \"read the mind\" of Diallo. The final chapter includes an example of how our first impressions can be misshaped by other information that isn't exactly relevant, women earning positions in symphony orchestras by playing anonymously behind screens.Gladwell's work is so readable and fascinating and is a great reference for work, home and group decisionmaking because it explains our intuitive knowledge, when it functions best and when it misfires. I STRONGLY recommend this book!",
            "I've read the book a few times. The first couple of times I agreed with the criticism that it is a bunch of interesting anecdotes that don't actually come together into a theory. But now I think that all the examples do contribute to one idea and the problem is that Gladwell doesn't explain clearly exactly what he is doing. The confusing thing is that he is not just showing us examples of people caught in the act of rapid cognition. He is also showing us examples of things in nature and society that have data that could be processed in a rapid way. He is describing examples of the known along with examples of the knower.For instance, he shows that of all the data we could gather to determine the health of a marriage all we really need to pay attention to is whether or not the couple show contempt for each other. And that there are only a few things you ought to know to best decide whether chest pain is a heart attack. In the case of heart attack detection, he doesn't show anyone actually thin slicing. Instead he shows how a hospital set up a kind of artificial thin slicing by forcing its doctors to ask a specific set of only 4 or 5 questions instead of the tens or hundreds they possibly could attend to.The book goes on to describe ways in which people study a set of data for a long enough time that the detection of it has become part of their unconscious. It also describes methods people use to either avoid bad thin slicing or create the proper context for their thin slicing to work. For instance, he describes police departments that set up procedures to avoid getting into situations where they would have to depend on a rapid cogition that in times of crushing stress can move so fast it shuts out vital information. A good section of this book revolves around the idea that what an expert is is someone who has in one way or another developed his or her ability to thin slice and who also manages this ability by controlling the environment in which thin slicing is going to occur. Gladwell has not declared war on abstract thinking. He just thinks that one of its uses should be to open up more circumstances where rapid cognition can be used effectively and to avoid situations swhere its use is ineffective. It is hard not to agree with this once you consider how many times each of us has made a split-second mistake that botched a moment with a loved one or let the opportunity to do the right thing pass us by.I think the book is coherent, it just explores different facets and implications of rapid cognition without doing an adequate job of explaining its movement from one facet to another.",
            "More detail might have been useful, but overall \"Blink\" does a reasonable job of describing and quantifying the once-elusive skill of \"intuition.\" Those who don't get it might do well to review Gavin de Becker's \"Gift of Fear\" or study the materials and research papers in the annotated bibliography.It is often said that muggers take about 7 seconds to size up potential victims. However, potential victims can be equally adept at recognizing threats. I saw this in South Side Pittsburgh a few months ago; a serial armed robber was apprehended because a clerk spotted \"suspicious behavior\" from across the street. What was this behavior? It wasn't waving a gun or screaming threats or looking like a character in a Spiderman comic strip with big teeth and a handful of chains and tire irons -- it was his simple failure to look like he had any destination and looking too long and lingering at passersby -- or their pockets and purses.\"Blink\" does not go into bad guys on the street as de Becker does. Nevertheless, he ranges through brand loyalty, prediction of divorce, and how we see each other -- for good or ill. It starts with gut responses to art forgeries (more reliable than the scientific testing) and ends with why music auditions are now conducted behind screens to the enormous benefit of female musicians who were once blinked out of competition.Loved \"Tipping Point\" and this is another excellent piece of work.",
            "While this book has some fascinating sections (see the section on autism, as well as the opening chapter) mainly I found Mr. Gladwell's latest release to be boring overall. Some of his examples of 'thin slicing' were far fetched to say the least, and he did not explore the other possible reasons behind the failure of certain of his examples. Read it for a book club, and everyone else liked it to give the author credit... but I won't read any of his other books on my own. After the interesting first chapter I was expecting better, and was let down. And there was absolutely no reason to include every muscle twitch in the body language section.",
            "it's not the deepest thing and it feels more like a compilation of other people's ideas... but is that bad? it's a very interesting read. and quick. I recommend it, but it won't change your life forever, I suspect.",
            "Like the author's \"Tipping Point\", \"Blink\" gives a fascinating hypothesis that will change your marketing perspective dramatically and forever, whether you're pushing yourself or a product.The only problem is: in both books, Gladwell's unique, little brainstorms could easily be reduced to about 25-30 pages without losing a thing. Once his theory has been expressed and examples given, there is not much else to say, but Gladwell goes on and on and on...and on. I have to admit, I could not make it all the way through either title. I felt like I was being repeatedly beaten over the head with the same information, just formatted in different ways.Would have made a great, A+ school report, but a book??? Now THAT'S marketing!",
            "Some insightful stuff, but not a lot earthshattering. Intuitive listening is the principle, and some time spent on how that is used against you (not actually your intuition, but basic assumptions that have you make snap judgements).The key is to be able to distinguish between intuition and preconceptions. It takes awareness, the book does not provide means to develop this. Instead it merely documents the phenomenon.There's probably a lot better material to spend your reading time on. Like The Tipping Point, I think the concept can be garnered quickly, you really don't need to read a whole book to get it.",
            "Gladwell, following up on his big literary hit, \"The Tipping Point,\" cranked out another interesting life/leadership/decision making book in \"Blink.\" The premise is pretty simple, go with your gut, and heart, before you go with your head. He gives example after example of research that shows your instinctive reaction is better than your thought out response. I agree, but also have known this since 2nd grade when our teachers told us to go with the first answer that we put down.Gladwell rightly also makes the point that these gut decisions can be patently wrong as well, getting into race relations and gender among other topics. The book kind of fades at the end after a strong start. Probably could have been 50 pages shorter. Anyway, you will enjoy most of this book - Joseph Dworak",
            "In the blink of an eye we gather huge amounts of information. The author, Gladwell, likens our brains to giant computers capable of processing lots of data in a flash. I found it fascinating how we can use this information either for survival purposes and / or we can apply our intuitive knowledge to any given situation. The author coins the term \"thin slicing\" to explain the process of applying one's intuition. He states that we are often suspicious of trusting this intuition because it's so quick and easy, even when it's on target. He relays experiments where instantaneous \"thin slicing\" has amazing results, sometimes in life and death situations, but also explains what can cause the skillto fall short. The reason often being that we are not truly living in the present moment.Two books that easily guide one into the present moment are Ariel and Shya Kane's \"Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment\" and \"How To Create A Magical Relationship\". These refreshingly fun and practical books effortlessly get the reader into the present moment where enlightenment resides. In an instant life can become brilliant and magical. Both of these intelligent books have shown me that life needn't be hard work in order to be amazing.",
            "Even the staunchest critic of Malcolm Gladwell's \"Blink\" should readily admit that his writing style is clear, concise, and extraordinarily accessible. While it is true that he focuses this literary effort upon only one core theme, (i.e., that our brains are capable of far more rapid clarity and raw computing power than we normally take advantage of), I find that the numerous and diverse real-life examples that Gladwell uses to illustrate this central theme provide considerable, and nuanced, food for thought. Of these examples, I find that those illustrating how the use of \"thin-slicing\" or rapid cognition can lead us terribly astray are particularly intriguing and thought-provoking.The juxtaposition of good and bad results leads to healthy self-examination. How is it possible that, in one example, the human mind can be trained to discern with astonishing accuracy (over 90%!)whether two spouses will remain married based upon a few emotional markers that are observed in the course of watching 15-minute videotaped segments of seemingly mundane arguments between spouses? Yet, in other dramatic examples, how is it that seemingly infallible physical senses are so warped by biases that they are able to betray the brain's recognition of reality? How are these same \"thin-slicing\" techniques as practiced by experienced police officers able to result in the senseless beating of Rodney King in one instance, and the tragic slaughter of unarmed Amadou Diallo in another? How often in everyday decisionmaking are our brains betrayed by the background noise of miseducated prejudices, or by information overload? What are the consequences of these failures for the world we live in today? What are the possibilities for our future if we can learn to overcome these cognitive failures?Gladwell's greatest strength is in telling the stories; summarizing plausible scientific explanations and theories for the good, the bad, and the ugly of thin-slicing; and finally, in raising the \"what if\" possibilities for a world in which we consciously seek to minimize \"the bad and the ugly\" influences on our powers of rapid cognition while simultaneously embracing the enormous (and largely untapped) powers of discernment that are locked away in our collective grey matter.Gladwell's greatest weakness in this work is that he barely scratches the surface in providing concrete solutions and strategies for taking our subconscious minds to a higher level of discernment. We are left to guess about what we should do next to raise our thin-slicing batting average. However, there is considerable merit in Gladwell's willingness and ability to illuminate the tough issues. For this reason, I give this book four stars instead of five. Perhaps a \"how to\" manual from Mr. Gladwell will be a worthy sequel.",
            "Blink is about the first reactions you have to things. Whether it is your first impression of a new co-worker or your gut instinct on the court, these quick contemplations have serious repercussions in our subsequent actions.If you think about that for a minute, you'll realize that the better your first impressions/gut instincts are, the better you will have positioned yourself for further action. Gladwell manages to take this one idea and fill it out to almost 300 pages. Not to spoil the book for you, but the premise is simply that the better you've trained yourself (priming), the more appropriate your \"blinks\" will be. Bad or no priming leads to poor initial reactions. Good priming leads to good initial reactions.There are a lot of allusions to real research, but no real research is presented. There are lots of anecdotes, but anecdotes are just helpful stories. On the surface, this book would seem to be a loser.What makes this book worthwhile is not its single insight. Rather, it is Gladwell's writing itself that keeps the reader interested. His breezy manner is welcoming and enjoyable. His recounting of anecdotes is interesting and funny. He never hesitates to put himself in the middle of the action, so we readers never feels like we're standing too far from the topic at hand.I liked the book, and took away from it its singular lesson. If you like this kind of pop psychology, you'll really like this book. It's accessible for anyone with a few hours to spare. 4 stars for a readable and enjoyable lesson in quick thinking.",
            "The author begins with the claim that when making decisions, we frequently place too much value on thought and deliberation, rather than intuition (or what he calls, \"thin slicing.\"). However, although using our gut feel can sometimes result in brilliant outcomes, at times it can be disastrous. Things like prejudice or even product packaging can interfere. The solution appears to be that one must first become an expert through in-depth study and practice. Further, the environment must be controlled to eliminate prejudice and other factors. Only then can a \"pure blink\" moment be created.I fear that many who don't read the entire book will mistakenly walk away with the idea that their practice of making decisions without doing their homework has been validated, when in fact that is simply not the case. Hopefully not too many have \"thin sliced\" the initial concept of this book and have read through to the end to get the full picture.Nick McCormick - Author, Lead Well and Prosper: 15 Successful Strategies for Becoming a Good Manager",
            "Blink is a \" must read \" about the power and accuracy of our first impressions and intuitions about people and events. Malcolm Gladwell skillfully presents several case studies that inspire me to recognize my own intuitive talent and also to notice my tendencies to dismiss my intuitive knowing in favor of analysis and self-doubt.He cleverly examines stereotyping and predjudice, and demonstrates how this influences and distorts our intuition.As a result of this book, I feel more confident and freer to express myself spontaneously! Tuning in to my first impressions is fun and actually gives me a greater sense of well-being and living in the moment, wow!Another great source of well-being and Instantaneous Transformation is Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment by Ariel and Shya Kane. This lovely anthology gives me a window into living with ease and transforms everyday circumstances into life giving opportunities. I can experience enlightenment now!

            "Blink! explores the phenomena we have all experianced, that initial feeling we get when exposed to something new.Initially I was a bit skeptical of the premise. It sounded like one of the New Age self-awareness books. I was mistaken. Instead, Gladwell makes two, very important, statements.First, those gut feelings can be very accurate when an expert gets them. That is, someone who has a lot of experiance with an item or situation is able to judge that situtation rapidly and fairly accurately. Further, expertise does not mean college diplomas but experiance. We are all experts, to a large degree, at reading faces because we have been doing that all of our lives. So we can rapidly, subconciously, arrive at a conclusion about someone we meet for the first time because of their expressions. Our brains perform activities below the conscious level, and our conscious selves can access the results. (In a way, this is a neat argument for consciousness being an artifact of cerebration and not the other way around.)Second, even experts can be fooled when the cues we subconsiously use to size up an item or situation lead us down a the wrong path.Blink! is about intuition, and illustrates the power, and flaws, with intuitive thinking. It is another demonstration of the superior power of rational thought over intuition.",
            "Malcom Gladwell is really eating his own dog food. In Tipping Point he discussed how you create buzz and get your ideas into the mass market and market acceptance. He has executed this plan with Blink -- a book that basically reviews psych studies conducted by others in the 80's and 90's into an interested but uninspiring tale.Gladwell is pushing the book in every avenue possible -- inclduing a segement on CNN entitled \"are you a racist?\" A piece of jaundiced journalism if I have ever seen one. Generating buzz by this means is low and beneath any credible author. I stopped reading the book and decided to write this reveiw after seeing the piece on 4/12/05The material in Blink is mildly interesting, but its not Gladwell's work. He is at best an editor putting interesting ideas and stories together to tell a story, not provide soemthing to help you improve your business.The Tipping point brought you ideas from the 1970's and this book does much the same. I am not smarter nor more aware after reading this book. It is shameless commerce and promotion for Gladwell's brand that I would rather not participate in.",
            "There is plenty of food for thought in the pages of Blink. Malcolm Gladwell does indeed, to some degree, inspire you to rethink your whole way of thinking. I'm not sure how much of a practical effect the book has on a reader, though, because Gladwell never really comes out with a systematic method for training yourself to think differently. I would sum the book up this way: Your unconscious is smarter than you are - but not always. It isn't that radical of an idea. We've all been such advice as: if you don't know the answer, go with your first instinct; you never get a second chance to make a first impression; and the ubiquitous follow your gut. What Gladwell does is validate these sorts of common sense notions. Going further, though, he also describes situations in which your unconscious can lead you astray. Ideally, one must strike a balance between instinct and deliberation.The book features all manner of excellent examples to fit Gladwell's argument - although at times, it gets a little bogged down in minutiae (such as a veritable laundry list of scientific names for facial muscles). First, he talks about a Greek statue that was scientifically verified as authentic but almost immediately declared a fake (and rightly so) by a number of experts in that form of art. How could these experts see the truth instantaneously? Why can other people see and know things that logic dictates it is impossible to know? These are the questions Gladwell asks. It all comes down to thin-slicing, he tells us. Thin-slicing involves the filtering out of all but the most relevant data, and the human unconscious thrives at this special skill. Then comes the more interesting part - ask someone to explain how he knew something spontaneously, and he/she will struggle to do so. What is more, the very effort to describe one's reaction makes the person less sure of his/her conclusions. From here, it's only a hop, skip, and a jump to the argument that too much information can sometimes be a bad thing. This would seem to be bad news to those of us who prefer to sit and study about something before coming up with an opinion. It isn't always the case, mind you, but too much deliberation about too many things can be more of a hindrance than a help.Thus, after showing what an unacknowledged genius our unconscious is, Gladwell proceeds to demonstrate how the unconscious sometimes gets things horribly wrong. He uses real world examples such as the Pepsi Challenge (and goes on to explain why New Coke seemed like a good idea at the time yet failed miserably), the shooting of an unarmed man by police officers, and the success of market-testing failures such as All in the Family. A number of fascinating insights are gleaned in the process: perception affects satisfaction, stereotypes (even those you strongly rebuke consciously) affect feelings and behavior, mood can be affected just by adopting certain facial expressions, spontaneity is not random, and others.There is a level of contradiction worked into the book. Sometimes, for example, first impressions are right on the money, and sometimes they are not a good indicator at all. How do you know the difference? Sometimes, less information is more valuable than more, but sometimes it isn't. Gladwell's point is that sound decision making is borne of a balance between instinctive, reactive realization and deliberate, studied conclusions. I think he pretty well proves the point, but he doesn't really give us a road map for finding that balanced place. Thus, the book is made up mostly of thought-provoking, fascinating stories and examples. It makes for fascinating reading, but I'm not sure it will actually change the way I think about things on a routine basis.",
            "I was first caught by the title and cover of this book. It was fairly plain with \"Blink\" written boldly across the front. I read the blurb on the inside cover about what it was about and thought I would take a chance at reading it.The book starts out great with a few stories about people making snap decisions without knowing they were doing it. That drew my attention and I kept reading. The theories that the author was giving seemed to make sense and were interesting to think about.However, towards the middle of the book the tone of the writing changed. I am still not able to put my finger on how it changed but it almost seems that the author was hurried to get the book done and to the editor and so he became less thoughtful and more erratic in his theories and explanations.The worst part of the book is that it just ends abruptly. There isn't really a review of what was talked about and how it all fits together. The last theory is given and the book ends.If you have time on a plane to read the book, it might be worth it. But I'm not sure I would sit down and read this book for fun knowing what I know now about it.",
            "Like Gladwell's first effort, \"The Tipping Point,\" this book is fun and easy to read. Gladwell uses well-chosen stories to illustrate each of the points he makes and has a gift for telling the stories in a way that flows and keeps you interested. That is the great news about this book.Unlike \"The Tipping Point,\" however, \"Blink\" doesn't arrive at a coherent and usable conclusion. It starts with the promising premise about the power of first impressions and gets you interested to learn how you might be able to make first impressions - both your own and others' - work better for you. It seems a very reasonable expectation if you've read \"Tipping Point.\" Unfortunately, \"Blink\" breaks down into an ambiguous \"sometimes first imprssions help, sometimes they hurt\" conclusion that leaves you underwhelmed.If you haven't read \"Tipping Point,\" go there first. If you have and you really liked it, you will get more of the great writing and story-telling from this book, but not the useful conclusion.",
            "This book is well-written and engaging, but it only states what most people already know. One of the book's concluding points is that if you are skilled and experienced in your field, then being able to quickly make decisive and correct decisions will come naturally. Nothing new there. Some people would simply say \"with experience comes intuition.\" The author further notes that unless one is fully trained, the initial gut reaction can be misleading for a number of reasons, such as subconscious bias or stress. An abundance of stories is presented to support all the points in the book, but most adults will have already come across all the issues through lifelong experience.One thing for which I was hoping was a discussion on how to hone yourself to make better \"blink\" decisions outside your field of expertise. The author does not address this at all except for one small suggestion saying that it's better to reduce the amount of information one has to process in order to make a good decision. This approach is a good idea, but the author delves no further.",
            "I've never seen a more transparent effort to cash in. This is a (really) dumbed down psych lite book about nothing. At times, Gladwell's effort to make a strong point in confusing (I suspect there is no point). At other times, he provides mini-overviews of the examples discussed in the book in case we couldn't remember them...There is nothing interesting and nothing to gain from Gladwell's flimsy theory about \"thinking without thinking.\" If you're interested in the thesis \"the power of thinking without thinking is so strong unless it's a situation where regular thinking is required,\" buy the book. Because that's all there is to it.",
            "Gladwell, who is one of my favorite nonfiction authors and New Yorker writers, walks over a dangerous line with his latest book. As always, his book is full of interesting anecdotes which support his primary premise. But in Blink, unlike his terrific earlier book, The Tipping Point, Gladwell moves from reporting journalist to corporate keynote speaker wannabe. He's got a central idea and he's going to prove it. In Tipping Point, he moved from the other direction... he gathered a series of seemingly unrelated incidents and events and brought fascinating clarity to the reader. It was excellent writing, research, and journalism. But in Blink, I couldn't help but feel I was simply being sold a clever idea, something that seems terrifically obvious with a catchy name given to it. I suppose it's somewhat like when Dylan went electric. Some will like it. Some will think he sold out. But I have no doubt, he'll be extremely successful on his dinner circuit.",
            "\"Blink\" is an appropriate title for a book about the snap decisions that we sometimes make when heeding our instincts rather than making a detailed analysis. Malcolm Gladwell says that \"thin-slicing,\" or the use of narrow slices of experience to find patterns in situations and behavior, is often a more effective way to make a decision than through a lot of thought and an abundance of facts. He starts off with the story of a statue, purportedly rare and ancient, that was asserted to be genuine through careful analysis, yet was felt to be a fake through the instant intuition of some experts. He then presents a number of interesting examples, from speed dating to conducting warfare, from selling cars to interviewing job candidates, that demonstrate how to effectively make quick decisions based upon a small amount of data. Again and again he reminds us that less is more.There are fascinating anecdotes here that demonstrate the power of our subconscious mind. Gladwell presents some people whose sense of intuition is uncanny: a psychologist who, after observing a married couple for fifteen minutes, could tell with ninety percent accuracy whether they would still be married fifteen years later; a tennis coach who could tell when a player was about to double fault; a psychology professor who could read faces so well he seemed to be able to read minds.Unfortunately, there are two problems with this book that detract from its strengths. First, there is little or no explanation given for how or why we might experience these phenomena. It is not a how-to manual, as there are no hard and fast rules on how to thin-slice our way to brilliant decision-making. And second, Gladwell cautions that we can often be misled by our snap judgments due to priming, prior bias or associations, and stress. He contends that we tend to base our judgment about something as much on its physical appearance or packaging as on its actual function. Doing incorrect thin-slicing led to the New Coke marketing fiasco, led to the election of a president who was handsome and charismatic but one of the worst leaders in U.S history, and kept many talented women out of top professional orchestras. Will this book change the way I come to decisions? No. But it has been an informative read nonetheless, and it has given me more reason than ever to admire the mysteries of the human brain.Eileen Rieback",
            "Great concept, but the book is simply too repetitive. After the first few chapters, you get the point - gut decisions are about as good as long, thought out decisions. It would've been a nice magaizine article, but didn't justify an entire book.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell takes E.M. Forster's famous instruction, \"Only connect,\" to heart in this fascinating little tome. Around a few key situations--a marriage counselor who can tell in 15 minutes if a couple will stay together, a group of art historians who figure out in two seconds that a statue is a fake while the museum buying it spends 14 months convincing itself the statue is real, a musician whose music is adored by those who give it time but shunned by focus-group testing, a group of police officers who make a tragic, split-second error in judgment--Gladwell builds a narrative that never ceases to engage the reader. How are our perceptions of the world influenced by the calculations our unconscious mind makes in the first moments of any encounter? Gladwell makes the case that these calculations can change everything, from who companies hire into positions of power (tall white men, more often than not) to the way we all know when someone's being insincere not by the words they say but the way our brain processes their facial expressions.If this sounds like a lot to cram into a 250-page book that can be easily read in one day, it is, and that is the book's chief flaw--we're left wanting more, a lot more, about all of the anecdotes introduced during the book. Gladwell is a master storyteller, and while we're happy to float from one example to another with him, at the end of the book I was left feeling like I'd touched only shallowly on a great many topics about which I'd like to know a lot more. But then, if the worst I can say about Gladwell is that he's piqued my curiousity, that's some pretty faint criticism, isn't it?Highly recommended.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell turns in a rare achievement: a clear, coherent book about a concept in science that isn't all too well defined, which draws from stories and examples that at first seem unrelated. In other words, a new synthesis, instead of another book on \"the story of _____(fill in the blank with your favorite scientific theory)\". \"The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\": it sounds like anathema to practitioners of careful, methodical science. Yet Gladwell presents a strong argument for the potency of thin-slicing and the rich, nimble workings of cognition that lie below our conscious level of experience.In this book we get to meet policemen in the heat of a chase, couples who seem happy but are actually, almost imperceptibly, frayed, a singer named Kenna, speed daters, and a rogue commander. The book itself is something of a \"blink\"--a light read, leaving me wishing he had included more detail about the concepts he was presenting. Lots of fun, however. It's certainly a fresh entry in the science section of the bookstore. I haven't finished reading his first book, 'The Tipping Point', but I think 'Blink' is much better.",
            "The author and publisher wasted a lot of time on this book. My time. From the start I was disappointed in just about every conclusion and assertion Gladwell made. For example, he said most doctors who were sued for malpractice were sued because they had bad personal rapport with their patients and not because they were incompetent or negligent. He said that in fact many of them were very good doctors. Then on page 43, he suggested that patients choose doctors on the basis of their inter-personal skills or personal feelings about the doctor. This does nothing to improve a patient's chances of finding the best medical help. In fact, using Gladwell's information (highly suspect) presented to describe doctors who get sued, points in the opposite direction - that a person should pick the doctor they hate the most in order to have the best chance of getting the best medical treatment. The rest of the book was just like this. At least up to page 188 where I finished the book. It is in the dumpster now to prevent some other human from wishing they had that part of their life back spent reading Gladwell's stuff. Go read V. S. Ramachandran's Phantoms In The Brain for some real information.",
            "There are some books that are the brain equivalent of cotton candy-- satisfying but with no real nutrition. There are other books that really stretch your brain but also throw it into cramps trying to understand what the book is saying, so you end up grabbing your head shouting \"ow ow ow!\"Blink is a great example of a book that really blows your mind without causing it any pain; it is an entertaining, accessible introduction to a fascinating but little known field of research known by various names such as \"adaptive unconscious\" \"thin-slicing\" or as the author likes to put it \"thinking without thinking\" (see, simple words, no brain cramp there!).What is he talking about here? Simply put, most of us divide our brains into two functional parts, the part that does things like control our muscles and breathing (unconscious) and the part that composes poems, makes mathematical calculations, and decides where to go on vacation (conscious).However, our brains have a third distinct type of function: subconscious processing. Every second we are awake our brains are compiling huge amounts of data that our senses are feeding us, then making complex decisions about that data instantaneously and continuously, then feeding those decisions to us subconsciously. We don't even realize this is happening-- it's often what we call \"our gut\" or \"intuition,\" but in reality it is an incredibly sophisticated and powerful processing ability that is beyond anything that a computer can do.Gladwell uses a variety of entertaining, thought-provoking, and sometimes alarming examples of both anecodote and detailed research to open our minds to what our \"adaptive unconscious\" is doing for us every day. For instance, one research project he mentions in the introduction found that,\"A person watching a silent two-second video clip of a teacher he or she has never met will reach conclusions about how good that teacher is that are very similar to those of a student who has sat in the teacher's class for an entire semester. That's the power of our adaptive unconscious.\"So, what does the book cover? Gladwell himself outlines three major tasks that he wanted the book to accomplish:First task: decisions made very quickly (through our subconscious processing abilities) can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.Second task: That we can learn about how this subconscious processing works and when it can be trusted and when to be wary of it.Third task: that \"our snap judgements and first impressions can be educated and controlled... as we can teach ourselves to think logically and deliberately (better), we can also teach ourselves to make better snap judgments. The power of knowing, in that first two seconds, is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few. It is an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves.\"Along the way, the reader is intrigued and entertained by a wide variety of little known research facts about human behavior and thinking. There is the marriage researcher who can predict divorce with 95% accuracy years before it happens by only listening to a couple have a conversation for a few minutes. How does he do it? By focusing on the ratio of conscious and subconscious positive to negative emotion expressed (a ratio any worse than 5:1 positive:negative is bad, and any expression of true contempt is a death knell).Then there is the online test you can take to show whether you have a subconscious prejudice against blacks (80% of whites and even 50% of blacks do). And how you can influence how patient a test subject will be by having them read sentences that have words like \"patient\" in them before they have to wait on someone. And his interview with a lady who can separate the taste of Oreos into ninety separate components (eleven of which are critical, we are told!). And the team that has calculated every possible anatomic facial expression, what they mean, how some cannot be faken or hidden, and even that the mere act of forming some facial expressions trigger the autonomic nervous system on a subconscious level (in other words, smiling really can make us feel happy!).So, by the time you turn the last page, how well does Gladwell succeed on each of his three tasks? For task #1, he does great. Time after time he convincingly shows the power and the wonder of our subconscious processing, and how often it is superior to what we normally think of as \"thinking.\" I gained a great deal more respect for the incredible things that my brain does and what an incredible creation of God it is.What about the second task, to understand how this works and when to trust it? This is much harder, because we are just beginning to do serious research on the nature and extent of our subconscious processing. He gives a few good examples of where our \"gut\" doesn't do a good job, such as when evaluating people by stereotypes such as height or race, or having to make certain decisions in rapid high stress situations. But that's really just the tip of the iceberg regarding the limitations of our subconscious.Unfortunately, with the third task (to make better \"snap judgements\") no book can deal definitively, because generally you have to thoroughlly understand how and why something is going wrong to correct it, and our limited understanding of our preconscious really hampers our ability to proactively improve and correct it.All in all, this is an enormously fascinating and entertaining book that is both an important and a fun read for anyone. To better understand both the power, extent, and limitation of how we \"think without thinking\" is of value to all of us. Unconditionally recommended.",
            "I've read both the Tipping Point and Blink, and I've felt the same way after each: Gladwell has a knack for describing fascinating research studies and observations, but the conclusions he draws from them are not always logical. I don't doubt the accuracy of his reporting of studies and events, especially since I studied a lot of the research he describes as a psychology major. What turned me off were the giant leaps he takes in drawing conclusions from his stories.For example, in Blink he describes a study that found that the amount a doctor is sued for malpractice is not correlated with the number of mistakes they actually make. Instead, it is correlated with the manner in which they speak to their patients. Domineering doctors are more likely to be sued, regardless of their skill. So far, so good. However, Gladwell goes a step too far in concluding that if you get a bad feeling when you're with a condescending physician, listen to that feeling because it's your intuition giving you a sign. A sign of what? All Gladwell has shown is that this doctor is more likely to be sued -- not that she or he deserves it.Overall, I think this is an entertaining read that tells many interesting stories. I just recommend reading it with a healthy amount of skepticism for Gladwell's conclusions.",
            "I confess, I was disappointed.Gladwell is one of a current generation of authors who wears his learning light with the benefit of a hip, punchy tone. He identifies a marketable idea and uses it to hang his various, jumble bag of ideas on. In Blink, the key is 'thin slicing' - in other words, the practice of judging a book by its cover.Does Gladwell think this is a good idea or not? At first, it seems yes. He kicks off with the story of the Kouros statue in the Getty Museum that an art expert was able to identify instantly as a fake, overriding the detailed analysis of the museum curators. Similarly in the case of Paul Van Riper, military maverick. He destroyed a team of military brains in a Pentagon war game by his radical, guerilla, instinct led tactics.Ah, but thin slicing is not always a good idea - take the case of Coca Cola. In blind testing, Pepsi always comes out on top. Coke CEOs changed the recipe based on this and the result was a disaster. Why? Because in a sip test, Pepsi wins, over a whole can, Coke is preferred. Should have done more tests.Then there's the difficult area of instant racial profiling. Gladwell mentions the common racial test which proves that many of us have an unconscious wiring that prefers whites to blacks. In split second decisions taken by armed police this can be fatal. Thus poor Amadou Diallo, an innocent black man in the Bronx pulling out his wallet from his pocket found himself pounded down with bullets. So thin slicing not such a good idea there.What is the lesson Gladwell is trying to teach us here? He says he doesn't aim for all encompassing, overarching theories. Fair enough, but this doesn't excuse blunt contradiction. Seemingly, we should set up structures to ensure that our minds become conditioned to make the correct decision in the thin slicing moments. Gladwell concludes with a description of how orchestras stopped discriminating against female musicians by setting up auditions behind screens so the expert committee could make their correct intuitions based fairly on the sound produced.So if we are already an expert with world class knowledge and the conditions are fair, it is okay to trust our gut instinct. If we are not, then it is better to stop and think things through to avoid disaster. This seems to be the lesson, but little is resolved at the end of Blink despite its many impressive fragments.George Bush trusts his instincts - does Gladwell support every decision he makes? The reality of things is complicated, and the useful substance in Blink is pretty thin sliced fare.",
            "The book is a very easy read and the lessons are absolutely fascinating. Some of the insights about humans, how they think, how they interact and how they make mistakes are downright scary. Unfortunately, I am left wondering what to do about it. If people make judgments in 2 seconds then how do I prepare for my next job interview? when should I work hard to overcome my gut feel about something and when should I just trust it? How would I do it anyway?...There is not a person whose life is not affected, on a daily basis -- both on the receiving and giving end -- by the phenomena described by Gladwell. Anybody who wants to influence people needs to be aware of Gladwell's warnings. For the real lessons, however, we will need to look elsewhere.",
            "The basic ideas of Blink are that people make snap judgments, some people are good at it, sometimes snap judgments reflect prejudices, sometimes too much information can cloud thinking, using both snap judgments and deliberation can be effective, and it's never too late to give up our prejudices (well, that's how Thoreau put it). Gladwell documents these banalities with anecdotes (some interesting, some not) and bits and pieces of marketing analysis and/or research.Really, there isn't much more to say about it than that. There is nothing here that is groundbreaking or original. In essence, this New Yorker writer wrote an extended magazine piece and put it out as a book. I think a better title would have been Snap!, but I'm not a marketing analyst and that's just a hunch!Borrow it and pass it on.",
            "This book seems to have been written only because of the success of the Tipping Point, not because of a worthwhile subject matter. It jumps from facts, to anectodes, without a strong enough argument. After reading the first one, I was very disappointed.",
            "I made the snap decision thinking this book would be good. I was wrong. He spends the entire book trying to explain snap decisions are right the majority of the time. I made a snap decision to buy this book because it looked interesting. I was wrong. I give him credit though because he tried to tackle a very \"gray area\" topic. Snap decisions are often times correct, and I hoped I would hear some logical reasoning to this. I had high hopes after hearing his first test, the Iowa Gambler test. He though, always fell short by never answering WHY anything was the way it was. Since he stated he had 3 objectives in the beginning of the book, and failed to meet any of them, I had to give him 2 stars.The entire book had the following theme:1) Tell a story that dealt with somebody making a snap decision instead of an informed one (always was a story that only would take place on the rarist of circumstances).2) Inform the user this thought process has a psychological name.3) Re-iterate story inserting psychological name all over the place.4) move onto a similar story or new chapter5) repeat",
            "Blink is a compilation of the work of certain researchers that is cobbled together to create a \"book\". There are different names than people I have studied, different research than I've previously read, but the subject matter, results and observations of the researchers is similar enough to not add a thing. In the end, the book is a fast read because it is slick and glossy, cotton candy for the mind.",
            "Malcom Gladwell has done an outstanding job examining a little understood process. While we all realize that we make many snap decisions, Gladwell looks beneath this simple fact to uncover how we make these decisions and when we make them poorly.He discusses four primary mechanisms:1. Our ability to recognize a signature that pervades a person's behavior or an object's coherence.2. Our ability to strip away unimportant information to make snap decisions -- or conversely to be confused by too much information.3. Our inability to make clear decisions when confronted with our built in prejudices.4. Our inability to make clear decisions when forced to make decisions too quickly in unfamiliar situations.Gladwell uses stories about real people to illustrate all these behaviors and thus gives us the ability to recognize new situations where our ability to make \"Blink\" decisions may be helpful or compromised.The stories themselves are also fascinating, for example there is a professor who can analyze 15 minutes of conversation between a couple and predict, with 90% accuracy, whether they will be divorced in 15 years. Blink explains how he does this in clear and entertaining language. A great read.",
            "Blink is the diet version of Gladwell's previous book: The Tipping Point. It is neither original nor thought provoking. The bottom line of the book is that we are influenced by our snap judgments in our everyday life. However, some persons are more capable than others in that craft. Yes, that's true. And Cialdini's book: \"Influence. The Psychology of Persuasion\" says the whys and the hows.",
            "When reading \"Blink\" it's important to keep in mind who Malcolm Gladwell is. Gladwell is a writer and reporter by trade. As such, he needs to bring things, that may otherwise get overlooked, to general public's attention. Moreover, Gladwell has to work through psychological studies that left to themselves serve as insomnia cures, but once translated into useful knowledge, have the potential to alter how people act and think.\"Blink\" is such a translation that makes the reader question, \"How do I \"know\" what I \"know\"?\" We have, according to some numbers, over 50,000 thoughts a day. And if you are not careful about what you are thinking, in a blink, you can have 48, 500 of the same exact thoughts the next day. If you hear and see something often enough, you come to believe it. So if we follow this reasoning, if we don't filter our thoughts we'll begin to believe that same material we re-play in our head each day (regardless of whether it is true or false). This locks us in a life of mediocrity. Gladwell proposes to crack the monotony by asking a question about the very foundations of our belief and \"knowing\" systems.Granted Maxwell's treatment and examples such as how an art expert can spot a fake sculpture in a second, and how day traders can overpower five-star generals in a two day war may seem cursory. Should he have delved deeper, Gladwell would have risked boring the readers and never attained the overarching goal of getting the masses to re-think their split-second thinking processes, judgments and decisions.",
            "Mr. Gladwell does a wonderful job of piquing the interest of the reader. I thought this was a very easy book to read and also very interesting. Some of the information I knew, but Gladwell has a way of clearly examining things that we may \"know\" but not know how to explain. I also have spent quite a bit of time at the Implicit Association Test, looking at the unconscious biases that I may have. I found that to be one of the most interesting things in the book. It makes perfect sense, but I had not heard it so succinctly posed and I have had to look at my own unconscious responses to others. I would highly recommend this book if you wish to challenge your sense of self and look a little deeper into how you personally operate. Great book, great read.",
            "Blink is comprised of a combination of multiple stories that are used as examples to demonstrate Gladwell's ideas of how individuals think and how decisions are made. Gladwell focuses on how important first impressions are and how individuals focus on the small things that eventually led him to the power of thinking. In my opinion this is a book for anyone, it is very insightful for any profession and every day life occurrences. It encourages one to trust our instincts and describes the power of our intuitive ability. Blink would also be good if one is curious about how the mind works and the process of thinking. I would recommend this to an individual who enjoys books with case-studies and is looking for a good book that is a fast read. I enjoy reading books with case-studies and I believe that they help one to understand an idea and technique, but I thought Gladwell used too many. I thought he could have fully developed some of his ideas and eliminated others. In addition, I thought he developed his ideas in a chaotic manner. In some of the case studies he started explaining the story and then stopped without finishing. He would then start another case study and finally later on the chapter he would go back to the first one. It made it hard to follow and some of his ideas were confusing. I often did not understand how the case studies fit until he finished them in his later sections. I think his greatest flaw is his randomness. I enjoyed the stories and I found his ideas and techniques insightful, but I believe they would be easier to follow and more effective if they were written in a more organized manner.",
            "A lot of prior reviewers seem disappointed in this book, but I found it interesting. Maybe it is because I spent 15 years as a newspaper editor and the past 21 years as a domestic violence counselor. Perhaps I have more experience with \"snap judgments\" and with \"social science research\" than many readers. Author Gladwell contrasts the two ways of making decisions, and attempts to explain why the quick, instinctive opinion often works out better. The book has a little too much repetition, and jumps from one situation to another without always connecting the former with the latter effectively----but those are small flaws. Consider this short work an introduction to the topic of instinctive responses, not the final word, and you should be content. His section on traumatic, temporary autism as an explanation for things such as police officers shooting suspects who turn out not to have been threats will be controversial, but makes sense to me. So does his contention that \"contempt\" between spouses is the best predictor of divorce. I'm glad I read it. If you are cautious due to the reviews which are not as positive as mine, just go fetch your copy at the library, as I did. Then, if it does not hold your interest, you are only out a little time, but no dough.",
            "This book attempts to provide insight into intuitive decision making. Gladwell starts strong with his prescription for data selection reinforced with fascinating case studies, but the book loses steam. I definitely prefer his previous book, The Tipping Point, which is more substantive. For solid information on decision making and optimal choices using logic with intuition, read Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self.",
            "When I first heard about this book, I assumed it was about how an untutored, hasty, first impression would be just as accurate as a thoughtful, studied examination. I was wrong on two counts. To begin with, it seems the judgement formed in an instant may be more accurate than the one created with labor and agony. Finally, the rapidly formed judgement is not an impetuous, irresponsible act. The attention of the cognoscenti focus on points that make a difference. Excessive information is ignored as obfuscating clutter. In a blink, judgement is rendered.Certain jobs require snap decisions as a matter of course. Soldiers, police, firemen, athletes and courtroom lawyers have jobs that cannot abide quandries. How do they ready themselves? Clearly the successful ones have prepared for their momentous minutes with countless hours of training. If you have only your first impression- count on soon being wrong, ignored, disgraced or dead.Malcolm Gladwell applies psychological observations to the real world with a delightfully engaging narrative. However, I am concerned about --Blink's-- lessons being misapplied. Recently, I saw a political roundtable discussing the book and a pundit suggested that the successful politicians were the ones whose values and vision were so ingrained, they could make snap decisions and never regret it.How we love those leaders of certitude who valiently sail the course of righteousness. What citizens of a democracy most need is to recognize when obstinacy, prejudice and weakness is concealed by a patina of bluff and guile. I would much prefer to be led by an expert who assembles other free-speaking experts, takes a vote and abides by the majority. (See --The Wisdom of Crowds-- by James Surowiecki, who like Gladwell, writes for --The New Yorker--.) That said, I have nothing but praise for this book's observations.",
            "What is behind the split decisions that we make all the time? What mental processes go behind our first impressions and our snap judgments?Malcolm Gladwell, the best selling author of The Tipping Point, explores these questions in his challenging book Blink. Gladwell draws from a fascinating array of stories of people who rely on their first impressions--art critics able to identify a supposedly ancient Greek statue as a fraud in mere seconds, a psychologist who is able to predict whether or not a married couple will stay married after a single session, and a tennis coach who developed the ability to predict when one of his players was about to double-fault.What do all of these people have in common? According to Gladwell, these people all have the ability to \"thin-slice.\" Thin-slicing is the ability to draw conclusions by looking at a small piece of data--the moment takes to form a first impression. Thin-slicing is a survival skill, our nervous system is constantly taking in overwhelming volumes of information and \"thin-slicing\" is how we quickly make sense of that data.Gladwell respects the dangers of our ability to process information quickly. In Chapter Three: \"The Warren Harding Error\", we find that our thin-slicing has a dark side. Gladwell points out that inherit in thin-slicing is a susceptibility to fall victim to the power of stereotyping. We meet Warren Harding, who is widely recognized as one of the worst presidents in our history. Why did voters place him in office, in spite of his lack of qualifications? Thin-slicing. Harding was tall, handsome and looked the part of a leader. This chapter points out how thin-slicing is related to racial stereotyping.What are we to do with this new-found knowledge that we \"thin-slice?\" Gladwell suggest that while we can't stop thin-slicing, we can train ourselves to pay attention pertinent factors-- factors that will help us make accurate and valuable decisions in a blink.Gladwell has given us a brilliant read that entertains and informs. Gladwell effortless delivered a lesson in neuroscience to his readers. However there's nothing \"textbook\" like about Blink. Blink is a compelling, fast-paced read that is sure to get you thinking about how you think.THINK:* In Chapter Three, Gladwell writes about the Implicit Association Test developed at Harvard University.

            "I've always had these \"gut feelings\" that I couldn't explain, but which I've learned to trust. Much like a woman's intuition or a cop's hunch, there are things that sometimes you just know, even though an attempt at explaining them would only leave you questioning yourself. Blink explains these things, finally providing quantifiable meaning and terminology for the abstract \"hocus pocus\" of those things we just sort-of know, without knowing how.The chapters don't really flow the way I expect a book to flow -- each chapter is a wild departure from the last -- but they are tied together well enough to remind you of the overall theme. The up-side of this is that each chapter allows you to look at the topic from a completely different point-of-view.For me, the best thing about this book is the wealth of real-world material used to make examples of the ideas being presented. An amazing amount of leg-work must have been done to gather all this material and put it together under the common theme.Also, as a side-note, I find the concepts presented in this book to be useful to me as a software developer, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone who works in a design capacity in their own career.",
            "Gladwells book in an insight to the measurement of ROI. Hardly a week goes by that there isn't a new article about how to measure ROI, as requested by corporate headmasters to justify expenditures. The rational formulas that have been outlined have to be tempered with the unconscious atmosphere. Understanding event functions and the value they bring is a starting point on the measure of return. Trade shows, sponsorships, product launches and seminars can be measured only in a superficial sense, leads, positioning, placement, all are the means to the end of a sale. Language is so limited in the expression of motivations and reasoning that it has to be tempered with emotions, do we abandon measurement, of course not. Madison Avenue realizes you can't force branding, people have to come to you. Their strategy now is shifting from rational logical reasoning to emotional reasoning.

            "I picked up this book without any expectations but I was pleasantly surprised! The book is very well written, the author has a really nice style, he gives you a lot of details but it's not boring at all, organized and narrated in an engaging way. He not only talks about a premise but he actually supports it with a lot of scientific data. I like that a lot. The premise of the book is that you can have a really good understanding of something in a very short amount of time and spending more time on it does not necessarily result in a better judgment. I was a little skeptical about this at the beginning but the author did a really good job of supporting his thesis which is rare to find. He also provides a lot of evidence on when the snap judgments can go wrong. I feel like he's not really trying to prove anything, he just puts out data supporting his thesis and he also shows how his thesis can be challenged and at the end, he lets you decide and I think this is what makes his book unique. I'd say it's a book on human psychology but written for ordinary people. It's very engaging, easy to read but at the same time, quite thought provoking.",
            "Great audiobook, and I think perfect for that medium. I like to hear the inflection an author gives the work, and Gladwell read well. Gladwell also excels at story weaving -- starting an example, giving more information/research, then more story, then more information/research, then concluding the story.There are a lot of people I want to recommend read this book--my brother for the Marine who won the war game thing (reminds me a lot of an uncle), my friend the auggie cop for the story of the cops who shot Diallo. I was personally fascinated by the study of facial expressions and musculature and would love to read more about that.But the shortcoming of this book is that it doesn't really help one be more blink-ful, or blink-wise. It isn't a self-help book. There is also research in the book that I don't particularly buy the premise of, such as that having trouble categorizing disparate things into falsely dichotomous categories reveals culturally ingrained biases.But it is a fascinating listen, engaging, and I'll be looking for anything else he has written for his style is terrific.",
            "When I picked up this book, I was hoping by the end that I would be better equipped to make those \"thinking without thinking\" sort of judgments more reliably. While there was a lot of interesting and thought provoking stuff in the book, I felt like I missed the \"meat\" I was after, in that there was no lesson in how to apply everything. Mostly, the book just prompted me to look further into other research, which Gladwell summarized in the book.",
            "Most of us have had those moments in life, when we have made a decision in snap; probably because of lack of time as in an emergency or we heard an inner voice prompting us to take that decision. At a later date, we can not actually justify or explain as to how we were able to reach such a brilliant decision in almost no time at all. This book is all about those decisions taken in a blink.The book gives a fair treatment to the topic and talks about those snap-decisions, which were successful and it talks about those, which were disastrous as well. It also talks about in order to understand a person you don't need to spend a good amount of time with him/her; instead, a thin slice of interaction with that person will be good enough. The book comes up with lot many surprising and paradoxical statements and then gives logical and scientific explanations for the same. As an example consider this - \"we are a bit too quick to come up with explanations, for things we really don't have explanations for\".The book, by any stretch of imagination, is not a step-by-step guide on how to make better snap decisions or how to replace your elaborate decision making processes with snap decisions. It does talk about how a snap decisions based on our pre-judgements can have disastrous results. One very startling conclusion made by the book is \"information overload prevents you from not only taking a quick decision but even a correct decision\". Now this is contrary to our belief \"more informed you are, better are your decisions\".Where it is even difficult to write a paragraph or two about our intuitive decision making ability, the book really does a commendable job in discussing various aspects of it in such vivid detail. The book is full of examples which make it a very interesting read. At the end, you come up with more respect and trust for your intuition and suddenly you have discovered a new friend in form of your inner voice.",
            "This should really be titled \"Blink for People in Areas of Their Expertise.\" Gladwell points out that we should often trust our gut instincts more than we normally do. Fine. But he also points out plenty of instances when we should not. For example, he notes that we are more likely to sue doctors who are not nice, rather than those who screw up in diagnoses or operations. That's not an example of strong blink instincts. However, he notes that people who have LOTS OF EXPERIENCE IN A FIELD SHOULD TRUST THEIR INSTINCTS. Now that makes sense to me and my big gut!Also interesting: a story of a military guy who challenged his bosses in practice wars. The US military should have listened to this guy BEFORE Iraq.",
            "\"Blink\" is a very interesting book to read. Plenty of stories that really make you think about how people make decisions, even first impressions. The reason I gave this book 3 stars instead of 5 is that though the book is interesting, after finishing it, I'm unsure of how to apply what I have read or even if there is any benefit to applying what I have read. The book's focus is on the bad and good decisions that people or companies have made in the blink of an eye. But, even as I write this, I'm still left with -- what did I really learn and can I apply it? It's still a good read but I wish I would have borrowed it from the library instead of buying it.",
            "I thought that this book, though well-written and easy to read, didn't really teach me much that was useful. Perhaps my fault for setting expectations too high, but I thought this book would offer insights into how WE can go about improving these gut-decisions that we sometimes have to make. I don't think I got anything like that. Outside of some interesting data points on how accurate some people's instincts seem to be or how, with training, we can discern some of the causes underlying some of our decisions and prejudices, I thought this was just trivial.",
            "This book is a prototypical bestseller...entertaining and just vague enough to appeal to a mass of readers, whether they are firm believers in love at first sight, analytical engineers or somewhere in between. This book is a bestseller precisely because it will validate your thinking no matter where you fall in the spectrum. Hopefully it will also challenge you to rethink how analytical and/or how emotional your decision-making process really is.What stood out to me about the book was how Gladwell proves the main thesis of his book: that your subconscious is capable of filtering out superfluous information in order to make snap judgments based on the few details that really matter. His proof lies in various examples of how experts in particular fields can within seconds create a diagnosis (even without understanding or acknowledging all of the symptoms).One of the examples he uses is of a professor who has been studying couples' communication for many years. This professor can apparently, within 30 seconds of viewing a taped dialogue between a couple, determine with 95 percent accuracy whether or not the couple will last. The proof of Gladwell's point is supposed to come from the fact that increasing the amount of taped dialogue viewed by the professor does not improve his accuracy.It was not lost on me, however, that all of Gladwell's core examples (including the professor) involve experts who have been studying their particular fields for many years. This is not something clearly pointed out in the book, but something that certainly deserves mention. It would be easy for an inexperienced investor to walk away after reading this book with the notion that he or she should make more investment decisions by trusting in his or her gut. Yet the proof of Gladwell's point relies on people with large amounts of specialized experience.Gladwell does make a valid point that many people spend too much time fretting over the minutia. This is all too true in investing. Many investors acquire too much information, much of which is probably irrelevant (or at least too unpredictable to quantify as part of an investment decision). This can lead to either making decisions based on unimportant variables or in complete investment paralysis.Here's hoping you discover someplace in between,Jeremy Ames, Executive Editor",
            "\"Next time you meet a doctor, and you sit down in his office and he starts to talk, if you have the sense that he isn't listening to you, that he's talking down to you, and that he isn't treating you with respect, LISTEN TO THAT FEELING. You have thin-sliced him and found him wanting\" (p. 43).\"Perhaps the most common -- and the most important -- forms of rapid cognition are the judgments we make and the impressions we form of other people. Every waking minute that we are in the presence of someone, we come up with a constant stream of predictions and inferences about what that person is thinking and feeling.... We easily parse complex distinctions in facial expression.... You wouldn't need to hear anything I was saying in order to reach these conclusions. They would just come to you, BLINK\" (p. 194-195).In Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, author Malcolm Gladwell (The Tipping Point) discusses that \"first impression,\" the \"BLINK\" moment, or the \"thin-slice\" of cognitive judgment. He basically is saying that gut feelings are more often right than wrong. Unless... they are wrong.Gladwell gives examples of the subtle reasons why, in vocal inflections, facial tics, or some other type of unknown mechanism leading to our impressions of people, things, or events, we know something is \"wrong\" immediately. In fact, he argues that some issues are pretty darn predictable from those first few precious seconds of exposure: lying, incompetency, forgery, longevity of marriage, and evaluation of musical talent.I agree, to a degree. I find his case history summaries intriguing and interesting. I've participated in the Harvard Implicit Association Test. I seen first hand the gender schemas addressed by Virginia Valian (Why So Slow?) that affect hiring processes and decisions. And, like most humans that have ever lived, I've had my own \"gut feelings\" that I've regretted not paying closer attention to.Gladwell made the same mistake in his best-seller The Tipping Point, however. He \"reverse-engineered\" the issues. An event happens. Later, somebody (usually not Gladwell) goes back to see if there was a clue to the lie, the malpractice, the divorce, or the hiring bias. Ah-HA... there is the clue! [Read -- there is the tipping point.] You would think, however, with something so clear-cut -- we now know the behaviors (or lack thereof) of liars, spys, mistake-prone surgeons, and cheating spouses -- that we could USE these behavioral cues in court, in police investigations, in premarital discussions (perfect for those required church premarital conferences), and in choosing a physician (see that first quote in my review, above).But we don't. In part, this is because Gladwell also notes cases where those \"thin-slices\" of impressions are wildly and catastrophically wrong.Ah-ha.So, I am intrigued but not convinced. This IS interesting stuff, and I thank Gladwell for summarizing it for me. I need more evidence, more studies, and a demonstration of greater utility.Oh, and do you think that there is a \"tipping point\" in the \"thin slicing\" when we unconsciously flip our impression from one conclusion to another? Maybe this issue will be the last portion of this trilogy!",
            "The book is an entertaining read filled with stories suggesting that our quick decisions made \"in the blink of an eye\" can be just as good as (or even better than) decisions made cautiously. The first part of the book gives examples when snap judgments have turned out good, whereas the second part of the book provides examples when such decisions have turned out bad. The question then becomes: \"When should we trust our instincts?\"The author suggests that we need to work out the \"right mix of conscious and unconscious analysis on a case-by-case basis.\" Although this statement may appear vague for someone who is looking for a direct answer, I believe that Gladwell does provide guidance when one reads the entire book.In the end, I believe the author is trying to make us understand our decision processes a little better. We need to be wary that we all have snap tendencies based on our own experiences. As such, decisions would be optimized if we try to identify and filter out irrelevant biases.",
            "I first read Tipping Point in 2001 and was blown away by its message. I found myself quoting him at parties, thinking about my life in relation to the book etc. So I was very interested to read Blink. But 6 years later, I'm not sure if it was my more advanced knowledge of the topic over time that made it less intriguing or if the book itself was just less ground-breaking.Blink is about how we all make immediate gut decisions on things and we don't even know it - and how this impacts us in both good and bad ways. In Blink, Gladwell's style is to let readers uncover the point of his thesis themselves as he makes his points through a series of short stories. I admit I got a bit bored by the stories at times, just wanting Gladwell to get to the point rather than labor on with examples. But I found after reading the book that it was the stories that stuck with me long term - meaning the book's value seemed to linger and grow as I thought about it later. In all, it's a worthy read for anyone that is a student of human psychology - in business or in life. But I just didn't revel in its message like I did his first book.",
            "Gladwell's book is a nice collection of interesting stories. It is an easy read and generally entertaining. However, beyond that, it does not hold up to the other reviews in my opinion. In one instance, he insinuates that we should trust our first instincts yet points out many cases where are first inclinations are not correct. If you are looking for a book to teach you how to hone your intuition and first instincts, this is not it. Beyond the storytelling, there is not much in terms of deep analysis to help an individual learn to utilize their instinctive abilities. Nice stories but little else in my opinion.",
            "Gladwell spends half the book telling you how we are capable of making incredible, enlightened deductions in an instant thanks to our subconscious. He leaves you hoping the next half of the book will tell you how to harness and refine those deductions so you can use them in everyday life and decision making processes. Instead he goes on to reveal how we override our initial intuitions with conscious thought, and interestingly, vice versa. He ends by giving examples of how we make errors in judgment by relying on our intuition too much. So what was the point? Not the treatment on the subject I was hoping to receive. Basically he says the subconscious is capable of powerful things. Great. Now buy a book that talks more about how to use it to your advantage.",
            "Blink is about those first moments whether it's looking at an ancient relic or taste testing Pepsi & Coke. When applied to this book, my 'blink' was that this is going to be a great book. As I continued reading, I realize it lacks a huge amount of substance. For the most part the book is about a concept, blink, followed by numerous examples filling out the book.About halfway through, I started fearing that I wasn't going to have my curiosity satisfied. What I was hoping for were some detailed ways we could apply or improve our 'blink' ability. I wanted something practical, not just an intellectual tease.Also, some of the things the author says are just unsupported by any facts. I found him drawing conclusions from certain 'blink' situations, and I'd be able to reason out other conclusions. Maybe these are all addressed by his sources, but why not explain fewer examples of blink in detail, rather than discussing numerous examples from a shallow perspective? I'd prefer depth over breadth.I think many of you will like this book. As far as being a book about interesting anecdotes/stories, Blink does a solid job. I think the author is decent (but possibly overrated), so I'll most likely check out the Tipping Point in the future. However, I tend to be a curious person, and for me this book just didn't go in detail enough. Sometimes your 'blink' is just wrong.",
            "But, I didn't like tipping point. Anyway, Gladwell has some interesting points about how we reason and make decisions. First third of the book shows why we should trust our instincts, next two thirds shows why that's a bad idea. Not sure what he really believes. As with Tipping Point he expounds on some intersting social science studies that often but not always have something to do with the point he's trying to make at the time. The studies are interesting all by themselve, but sometimes I think they're there only to make sure the book has the requisite number of pages.",
            "There is just something about this book that holds it back from greatness...Gladwell writes well and presents his stories and illustrations admirably, but he bills this book to be an argument and it simply isn't structured to be a good one. The most glaring shortcoming of the book lies in its failure to recognize the role of preparation in the conditioning of the subconscious. He draws from examples of doctors, gamblers, and art historians to support his argument but fails to reflect the immeasurable effort and experience that positioned such experts to deduce and calculate in ways beyond appreciation.Flaws aside, this remains a provocative read from a fascinating voice. It does succeed in instilling or at least encouraging a sense of confidence in one's subconscious, and as such it will long remain a valuable (though potentially dangerous) book.",

I think of this book as the next level to a movie like Crash. Crash is an icredible film that illustrates how connected all of us are, and how convaluted our decisions can become if we rely merely on prejudice and stereotypes. Blink tells us why we do that. Blink explains why we make these snap judgements and touches on how such snap judgements can be helpful or detrimental. Blink also talks about cultivating our subjective unconsciousness into something that we can use in our everyday life, whether it involves love or the work place.This one is for the human who are dedicated to take their intelligence to the next level.",
            "What a bore! \"Blink\" is a grab bag of platitudes that leads absolutely nowhere. The core thesis is risible. The author basically argues that under the right conditions, humans make better decisions when they use their instincts. He then states that under the wrong conditions, decisions based on instinct can be disastrous. Jee-whizz, Malcom, thanks for the insight! The book is hype and empty of any valuable content; it will certainly become standard reading in MBA programs.",
            "_Blink_ is certainly an entertaining read, and the author does an excellent job of staying on track and using many different areas of study to buttress his major topic. However, the book never provides a payoff of WHAT should be done now. According to Gladwell, \"thin-slicing\" is good, unless it's not good. It's good when it works, but otherwise it's bad. There's no step forward here, and the only applications provided are the politically-correct ones that one could presume without even opening the text. It's a good book, but not the masterpiece that many seem to be seeing here.",
            "I enjoyed reading Blink, but don't think it needs your immediate attention.This is a book about judgments, snap/subconscious decisions, and what we can do to trust them or try to change them.I think that Blink flowed really well and had some good arguments, but I don't think there is anything new here. Nothing in this book is spectacular.Putting all of the examples together and analyzing them does have some interest, but there is nothing striking about Gladwell's arguments.I think that the idea behind this book is very important, but needs more work.",
            "definitely more of a \"rental\" (i.e. used) than a purchase. It's a quick read, starts off with an interesting notion, but the second half of the book didn't have much to say nor did it deliver a strong conclusion. There are some interesting stories in between, including evidence suggesting we are all biased in some ways, but nothing original. The bottom line here is that with experience, your intuition on areas of YOUR expertise improves. Wow.",
            "The author's first book was pretty damn good. (The Tipping Point). here he attempts to tackle to subject of intuition and gut feeling but it never really suceeds.

            "I had high hopes when I bought this book, but it turned out to be a big letdown. Rather than a manual about how to refine one's snap judgments, the whole book is a series of how quick decisions can sometimes be better than careful reasoning. As I read, I kept thinking, \"Great, snap judgments might work sometimes. How do I improve them?\" but he never got to it. The examples were interesting, but to write a whole book about them and only them...it makes you wonder if the author just wants you to go through his book without thinking.",

However, I felt I wasted my money on too much description, and dismissal of intuition, knowledge, or experience that may be contributing to a person knowing something is awry...one who may be thin slicing (Blink Thinking I believe would be a better term).He gave examples of how it works successfully for some people, but he didn't or couldn't explain very well why it happens, nor could he give guidance for people to improve their own thinking. Then he gave examples where it didn't work, so the reader wonders, \"What's your point? Does this work or doesn't it? If you say everyone can do this, well, HOW?\"He went on tangents (face reading could be a book of its own, and I would be very interested in that) and tiptoed into areas that might be a bit political - casually saying it's not working for the police who shot someone, it's not working for the military who doesn't want to work off of \"hunches\", though in some cases it HAS worked for a leader or two. It dismisses market research almost entirely, because a singer (who is obviously a favorite of his has yet to make it big), because test audiences didn't like his music, yet thin slice thinkers must. He seems to contradict himself with his own examples.Again, not an unpleasant read, but I was craving more. It's an unfinished work.",

            "I was enjoying the interesting concept of this book until, in the last half, Gladwell's agenda came out with clear force. I was set-up. Use real world cases and all sides of the case until you want to push the agenda and then tell only one side, and what only one side should have done to avoid snap judgements. It's incredibly irresponsible to have left out what was left out of the last half of this book.If there's 100 points of data that tell the whole story of \"blink\", Gladwell hand-picks the 20 that fit his desire to demonize police while laying no responsibility on individuals who act as criminals and completely disregards crime-to-race proportions. You must suspend reality to believe Gladwell's assumption that gun-related crime is totally unrelated to race in bad neighborhoods. Because clearly no one should assume based on real numbers and shady behavior in an out of the ordinary situation that anything out of the ordinary is occuring. Gladwell would have us assume, and control our reaction in a life or death situation in the \"blink of an eye\", that dangerously acting individuals in incredibly dangerous places and situations should be treated as if they were 80-year-old grandmothers in broad daylight.No mention is made of what the criminals could have done to avoid the confrontation. Perhaps he left it out since my 8 year-old nephew could spell it out. If police yell \"POLICE! DON'T MOVE!\" then you might want to stop moving. If you continue to move and dig in your pockets you are not only asking to be shot, you should be shot. Gladwell's one-sided agenda is sickening in this particular part of the book.It's a clearly picked-evidence piece that takes a conveniently limited, one-sided cross-section of the research to slide it's agenda onto the bestseller list under assumed pretenses. If you appreciate personal accountability, total fairness on all sides of a situation, and true responsibility, don't bother buying/reading this biased disappointing opinion.",

            "This book questions if believing in scientific research or gut instinct is the right thing to do. The author talks candidly about his new Afro hairdo which brings him unwanted attention from the law, which questions if subconsciousness stereotypes our ethnicity. Blink questions if incidents such as Rodney King bashing by the police or the shooting of Diallo in front of his house are due to racism or due to our mind not functioning rationally when we have very little time space to spare. Subsequently, he questions if those \"temporary insanity\" is equivalent to people who has autism. Then, there are also discussions about food, drinks, and music tasting and how focus groups would have gotten them so wrong. The author continues to add that people know what they know when they like or dislike something but when they are told to justify why they like or dislike certain things, that's when things get pear-shaped. Does that mean just because we aren't able to justify things constructively, those results are proved less useful? We also then question if gut instinct is in fact a constructive symptom at the first place? There are also many illustrations about face reading, body reading and the author endeavours to justify that if we hone in our critical assessments of those subtle clues, maybe, we are able to \"educate\" our subconscious to discern certain situations and circumstances which ordinay people aren't able to pick up. This book is foremost thought-provoking and entices me to see things from a new dimension, or shall I say, a new paradigm shift. It's entertaining and highly enjoyable to read. Avid readers would appreciate that the author works with David Remnick who himself has written a few best sellers himself.",

            "\"Blink\" is the first two seconds of your thoughts. It's when cognition takes place.And in the blink of an eye, we all make decisions based upon our past experiences.Yet, if you were to ask someone what their basis for their decision on something that was important to them, you'd probably get an answer like, \"I don't know why. It just is.\"This is much like Michael Angelo's response to \"How did you know that you created David?\"And the essense of his answer was, \"I knew it when I saw it.\"\"Blink\" is about trusting your instincts. It's also about conditioning yourself to make educated, controlled snap judgments, also known as \"thin-slicing.\"Of the many case studies presented in this book, here are the results of three of them:1. Doctors who take the time to use \"orienting\" comments withtheir patients, such as \"First, I'll examine you. Then wewill talk a the problem over,\" are less likely to be sued,even if they made life-threatening mistakes.2. The Warren Harding Error:In 1920, after years of everyone seeing this tall manwith \"Roman\" features as presidential material, he becamepresident. And after serving two years, which ended indeath from a stroke, historians described him as one of theworst presidents in American history.Snap judgments had been made, not by is leadershipabilities, but by his external image.3. And then, there's a shooting where one police officermistakens a wallet for a gun. His snap decision was basedupon his presuppositions and distance.\"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,\" is a great social science book, loaded with case histories, and questions that lead readers to rethink how they make decisions.It's just as good as \"Tipping Point.\"",
            "Gladwell has made the obvious---obvious. Think about the first time that you met your wife...you get that bolt of lightning in your stomache, its mixed with lust of course but then it settles down to some thing more permanent. When you are with your beloved you are constantly getting affirmative reactions from her eyes, her veldtenschund and her very being. So you get married lust lasts about 2 years and by then a baby now makes your family 3 and you can bond with your wife on a more permanent basis. This book describes how we get initial impressions that we call intuition, understanding or a general gut feeling. We do it all the time. Look at your surroundings and see how people are conversing, sizing each other up and having a dance of feelings which sometimes have nothing to do with their expression. Gladwell intimates that we are hard wired to do this from birth--the flight or fight syndrome makes a good case for following his ideas as men as hunters had to make decisions in the blink of an eye in order to get food, clothing, shelter and a mate that would give him a helper. One thing that could have been tied in here is the phrenomes that humans have. Phrenomes are scents that men and women have that we are not aware of. It is thought that these phrenomes have something to do with the attraction of a woman to a man or vice versa.",

            "New Yorker columnist Malcolm Gladwell noticed that when he wore his hair cropped short, the police hardly noticed him, but when he let it grow out into an Afro highlighting his Jamaican side more than his Caucasian half, the police hassled him more than once. So began a fascinating investigation into first impressions - how we make them, how accurate they are and how to make your first judgments more accurate.BLINK is entertaining, illuminating and at times humorous. In a highly readable account, Gladwell gives a clear description of implicit cognition and explains the most up-to-date theories of neuroscience and psychology through a series of fun and accessible stories. The examples, drawn from a wide range of situations and fields of human endeavor, illustrate the complex thinking processes that support \"snap judgments.\" With case after case, Gladwell demonstrates how the depth of knowledge and expertise developed over years of observation informs the mind to \"thin slice\" - make quick decisions at the blink of the eye that seem instantaneous but are actually based on years of experience. Thought-provoking, entertaining and worth a read.Charleen Touchette Author of IT STOPS WITH ME: MEMOIR OF A CANUCK GIRL",
            "After his bestselling book brought the phrase \"tipping point\" into popular usage, which is that moment when an idea, product or concept suddenly catches fire with the population at large, Malcolm Gladwell now gives us two more phrases that are likely to become equally well-known: \"blink\" and \"thin-slicing.\"We \"blink\" when we think without thinking. We do that by \"thin-slicing,\" using limited information to come to our conclusion. What's interesting is that in our age of information overload, according to Gladwell, we often make better decisions with snap judgments than we do with volumes of analysis.The book opens with what reads like a heart-racing detective story about the discovery of a statue that initially fooled one group of art experts for being genuine and was later shown to be a fake by another group. The first group had exhaustively studied and analyzed the statue. Members of the second took one look --- \"blinked\" --- and declared it suspect and ultimately a forgery. And they were right. Why? How did they know? Why was the first group so wrong? Are there dangers in overanalyzing? Are we always right when we blink? Can we be wrong, even dead wrong? What is the science behind blinking? What can we learn from this phenomenon?Gladwell addresses these questions and gives a wide range of examples of blinking from the worlds of gambling, speed-dating, tennis, war games, the movies, malpractice suits, popular music, and predicting divorce. Interspersed are accounts of scientific studies that partially, but never completely, explain the largely unconscious phenomenon that we have all experienced at one time or another in our lives. Nevertheless, the hypotheses, the scientific experiments, and the examples are very interesting.A researcher tells the story of a firefighter in Cleveland who answered a routine call with his men. It was in the back of a one-and-a-half story house in a residential neighborhood in the kitchen. The firefighters broke down the door, laid down their hose, and began dousing the fire with water. It should have abated, but it didn't. As the fire lieutenant recalls, he suddenly thought to himself, \"There's something wrong here,\" and he immediately ordered his men out. Moments after they fled, the floor they had been standing on collapsed. The fire had been in the basement, not the kitchen as it appeared. When asked how he knew to get out, the fireman thought it was ESP, which of course it wasn't. What is interesting to Gladwell is that the fireman could not immediately explain how he knew to get out. From what Gladwell calls \"the locked box\" in our brains, our fireman just \"blinked\" and made the right decision. In fact, if the fireman had deliberated on the facts he was seeing, he would have likely lost his life and the lives of his men.It took well over two hours of questioning for the fire lieutenant to piece together how he knew to get out. (First, the fire didn't respond as it was supposed to; second, the fire was abnormally hot; third, it was quiet when it should have been noisier given the heat.)One take-away from the book is that how we blink is a function of our experiences, training, and knowledge. For example, prejudice is so unconsciously woven into our society that, despite our best intentions, at an unconscious level it can lead to really bad blinks. This is partly why tall people are frequently seen as natural leaders when there is no basis in reality for that belief. And, in the case of the Amadou Diallo killing in 1999, it is why four policemen incorrectly thin-sliced a situation and wound up killing an innocent man by mistake.Gladwell is obviously fascinated by the phenomenon of blinking. Properly understood --- and properly prepared for --- it is a valid way to make decisions. Gladwell says, \"A world where snap judgments and thin-slicing is taken seriously is a better place.\" I know some people who might object to that viewpoint, particularly when it comes to decision-making in foreign policy, but if you want an entertaining read, fast-paced, rich in entertaining anecdotes and some unusual scientific research, then BLINK is worth picking up.--- Reviewed by Anne Miller",

            "Gladwell's \"Blink\" tells us that we can learn as much in 2 seconds as we can from a detailed study. That summarizes his entire book. Spending any more time on his book will provide no greater insight. Take his advice - accept this 2 second summary of his book, and move on. There is nothing more to learn from reading it. Apply this to Tipping Point's basic idea - if a phenomenon achieves a certain critical mass, it will grow exponentially. Now you don't need to read Tipping Point either.",
            "I didn't expect much when I started BLINK. Then only a few pages in, as Gladwell is describing the manner in which a University of Washington professor is able to tell with 90% accuracy if a couple will divorce based on 5 MINUTES of speaking with them based on snap judgments, I WAS HOOKED. I spent the majority of the three days I took to read the book periodically stopping and then reading allowed passages to anyone who would listen.Although Gladwell covers a wide range of scenarios from music, to relationships, to merchandising, to police brutality, to prejudice, everything was well connected through the theme of how our snap judgments affect even the smallest portions of our lives. Two seemingly random scenarios were illuminated and connected in ways I might never have thought.I walked away from BLINK hoping that I could take his advice and that by being aware of my snap judgments I could hope to have a deeper understand my subconscious. Although I feel that I may never really understand my own snap judgments, it was wonderful while reading this book to at least begin to 'try.'",

I am happy to report that I was not!This book is well organized as the author takes you through various case studies and research experiments. The logic was easy of me to follow and his style of writing kept me entertained. More than once I stopped in the middle of a chapter to write down a term, person, or website to look up online.

            "I didn't care for this book much--certainly not as much as I did the author's previous Tipping Point. This one seemed no more than a bunch of magazine articles strung together, with no over-arching vision or even a unifying thesis.Ostensibly, it's about the power of the unconscious in judgment. But there's no Freud in there (neither Siggie nor Anna) except an interesting quote that a reader of the first edition sent him that Gladwell stuffed into the \"Afterward.\" There's also no Butler (who wrote several books on unconscious memory--including one entitled Unconscious Memory) and no William James, who discusses the nature and power of unconscious thought very interestingly in Varieties of Religious Experience as well as in his massive Psychology. In fact, Gladwell doesn't seem very widely read in this subject at all: he just goes the interviewer route here, talking to loosely connected \"experts\" from a wide variety of fields (from battle strategy to auditioning violinists) and then making a half-hearted effort to pull their comments together--all with no any cohesive theory.Sometimes the \"blink judgment\" is desirable (as when a tennis pro can tell when a server will double fault on his next serve or when an art historian can tell a fraud immediately with little or no examination). At other times it may only result in discrimination against female musicians or black pedestrians. But Gladwell knows neither when it should be trusted, nor how it knows what he thinks it sometimes knows. These are issues that have been studied for the last couple of hundred years, yet Gladwell doesn't cite a single source in his book and doesn't seem to have read a very much on the topic.But well, why should he? It reads quickly and is a best-seller anyways. Besides, Gladwell's got his next golden goose to think about....",
            "My waking eyes have been opened to what my subconscious has already seen . . .

            "I am a big Malcolm Gladwell fan. He has a way of weaving very dry, scientific material into great stories in which you learn not only what he's intending to advocate, but also about miscellaneous, interesting topics. In short, you become a great guest at cocktail parties because you have fun topics to chat about with other people.He's tough to recommend, though, since the subject matter can be a bit dry and bog down at times. I am also sometimes challenged by the leaps he makes that A automatically equals, or leads to, B, without giving me more support for why. But, I still enjoyed the book (although enjoyed The Tipping Point a bit more). All in all, very interesting, though.",
            "I really enjoyed Malcolm Gladwell's first book, Tipping Point. He offered some significant insights in this book, and because of this, the book became a blockbuster big seller. I wish I could say the same thing about his second effort, Blink. Don't get me wrong, Blink is interesting. But at best, Blink should have been a long article in the New Yorker, not a whole book. If Gladwell had not been so successful with Tipping Point, I doubt that this book would have received the accolades that it did.Blink discusses the age-old concept that first impressions are lasting impressions. Gladwell spends a significant amount of time looking at the science behind first impressions, including the fact that most first impressions are made sub-consciously. But he spends so much time on the science behind this theory, that the book becomes uninteresting, and he feels it necessary to make his point in numerous ways. I've talked to people who have read this book, and they all say that they loved it. When asked what they loved about it, the readers find it difficult to recall any distinctive take-aways.All I can say is that I knew Tipping Point, and this is no Tipping Point. You can read this one, and it won't be a waste of time, but I doubt you will walk away saying you loved this book.",
            "The blink of an eye only takes a moment, as does the making of a first impression. Sometimes first impressions are incorrect, but my fantastic first impression of Blink by Malcom Gladwell, the best selling author of The Tipping Point, could not have been more spot-on. Gladwell's use of specific stories and case studies opens the reader's eyes to the possibility of the mysterious subconscious and the effect of subliminal thoughts on judgment.Included studies address the causes of discrimination and autism, successful relationships, police experience, and human fraud-detectors for artwork. Each topic goes into a different detail of the subconscious. Discrimination is generally not on purpose, but studies find that it is inevitable in the world that we live in. Society's general views of a race or gender are engraved in our minds to the point that we are not even aware that the thoughts occur with every person we meet. Human fraud-detectors for artwork have studied pieces of art with such intensity that they can tell a sculpture is fake by glancing at the fingers. Gladwell also goes into Ekman's famous studies on facial expressions and expertly explains how faces naturally give away genuine emotion in the blink of an eye.Gladwell's Blink was a joy to read and I am a strong advocate for everyone reading this book. Now, after reading Blink, I actually think about my immediate judgments of people and try to be more open when meeting someone for the first time. Gladwell's novel is mind-changing and I believe that Blink can benefit anyone who is willing to read it.",
            "A very interesting book that can help you learn to trust your own decision making processes. Teens often try to blame their behavior on other things or people. One of my favorites is, \"I blacked out and didn't know what I was doing.\" While we are all responsible for our actions, our brains can go on automatic pilot from time to time. With this phenomenon laid out, we can learn to control our thinking a bit more than the average person who seems to always fly on auto. Also, Gladwell discusses intuition quite a bit and how if we listen to our deepest self, our decision making can really improve.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell has written yet another thought-provoking book. In Blink he postulates that often our first impressions or gut instincts are more likely to lead us to the the correct decision than if we spent a long time gathering information and weighing out the pros and cons of the particular situation. In other words, you should \"trust your gut\" In trademark Gladwell fashion he uses many entertaining stories and case studies to illustrate his points, while at the same time cautioning against trusting your first impressions too much. I don't think his arguments are as well articulated as those in The Tipping Point, but I'll leave that up to the individual reader to decide for themselves.My previous complaints about Gladwell's organization, and the repetition of his writing are still valid. I find reading the beginning of one of his chapters to be a very enjoyable experience, but by mid-chapter I usually find the going excruciatingly slow, and by the end I feel as if I've been wandering around the desert for days, and have finally found my way back to civilization.Despite these minor flaws, at the end of his books I always find myself excited as to what his next project might be, and eager to share his insights with others.",
            "This book was fascinating... Malcolm Gladwell can sure tell a good story and run a persuasive and provocative argument. As I was reading, I had some concerns about the implications, particularly about stereotypes and marketing, but Gladwell not only addressed them, but put them in a deeper context. An insightful read!However...I did get the uncomfortable sense that there may be studies or examples out there that did not agree with Gladwell's hypothesis, and that he just ignored them. I assumed he just cherry-picked the studies that would help his case. I also couldn't figure out enough ways to apply this personally to my own life and my own actions.Ultimately I am a very practical person, and I want to know what to DO with the information, not just have random facts floating around in my brain somewhere. I also was concerned about the marketing implications of this book, even after Gladwell's discussion.",

Both as a psychologist and a woman, I have grown to understand the necessity of learning how to tune in to one's intuition, understand as much as possible about our \"gut\" feelings (and from where they may originate), and to reduce the self-talk or rationalizations that may cloud/squash our instincts.Mr. Gladwell's insight is remarkable; he views the world in creative and non-ordinary ways that allow readers to experience \"A-Ha!\" moments, offering them a guide to building their ability to see their world differently as well.",

            "The 1000th something review, so I'll keep it short.Blink is Malcolm Gladwells second book (after tipping point) and in it he looks at making decisions \"in the blink of the moment.\" Are these decisions better or worst than carefully analyzed decisions.The first part examines why they are actually better. It looks at the unconscious part of the brain and how we can use that to make quick decisions that are often better than decisions that are well analyzed. However, on the second part, he looks at the mistakes we humans make when making quick decisions. It gives advise how to train your unconscious brain and how to use it effectively for making quick decisions.Unlike most other reviewers, I enjoyed blink more than \"the tipping point.\" I felt the structure to be more coherent. As his previous work, most of the book are stories trying to make or break a certain point. Malcolms writing is excellent, but that ought to be expected from a journalist of such caliber.All in all, blink is worth reading. It is still written for a general audience and often didn't go into the depth I would have liked in books. Still, a good book and excellent writing.",
            "Extremely interesting examples how we react to information and have no idea that the process is occuring. The section on how we respond to cultural cues I found very eye-opening. The fact that someone who was aware of this phenomenon, took the Implicit Association Test every day, and yet discovered that the day that his score changed was a day he happened to watch a documentary on Martin Luther King Jr beforehand- which he didn't even realize until he sat down and analyzed what was different about that day. The flip side is the Warren Harding effect, where we make an assumption based on surface factors and never revisit the matter, often to our detriment. Again, just really thought-provoking. And the example of the way that women and black men are given rock-bottom car prices that are $750 to 1500 more on average than those given to white men is very eye-opening and practical information to have- not based on racism or sexism as such, and the salespeople have no idea they are doing this.

            "I felt this book came as a highly rated \"Bestseller\" but I find I am disappointed. While I haven't completely finished the book yet it seems to contain several very long descriptive stories of how people behave according to their preconceived ideas. An interesting phenomena, but it gets beaten to death by the author. I have just received my order of \"Outliers\" and hope I enjoy it more than this one.",
            "this follow-up to The Tipping Point was a bit of a disappointment. There was a lot of good data in it, but I felt that his entire thesis was flawed. Its all about \"thinking without thinking,\" by trusting your \"gut.\" Yeah, that always works out... there was some good data about folks who could read emotions by observing facial muscles, and how the mind operates when under stress, but otherwise it wasn't very thoughtful.",
            "I breezed through this one. It could have been condensed into a long article but is worth it none the less. I think it is both provocative and thought provoking. I particularly like d the idea that a relationship of many years can be summed up in a matter of minutes by people trained to do so.",
            "Anyone that enjoyed tipping point needs to get this. I skipped over it a couple of times in the bookstore until I finally decided to spend my giftcard on it. It is a great hub of ideas that deal with how we can develop & depend on our instincts. I've already found myself using the ideas in this book at work to justify some of my approaches. I've also photocopied a chapter & distributed it amongst like-minded coworkers to convince them to read it. If you need a free mindmap of this book or 'tipping point' please email me at kharsakk2000@yahoo.com",
            "Lots of great stuff to chew on here. Not sure that it can all be scientifically backed up, but this info can come in handy for many who are in jobs/roles where they need to trust their gut instincts.",
            "The concepts described in the book could easily git a single chapter or be summarized in a magazine article. Thin-slicing is a concept researched by author, where the humans frequently make decisions based on the first impression, and sometimes those decisions tend to be correct right away, sometimes they are totally wrong. It's the book about gut felling and horse sense with some academic research supplied by the author.But right as you are about comforted with the fact that you bought a book that is a bit scientific and enriching, the author moves on to tell how how racist your sorry ass is, and how you're subconsciously biased against black people, and how you should watch Olympic games and listen to Colin Powell to get rid of that bias.The point is well made, but Gladwell goes at it at length, like a senile Grandpa at retirement home starting with his war stories and never knowing when to stop. Gladwell is repetitive, often redundant and way too verbose. For simple concepts that he's describing, he could've easily written a book with 5% of the pages that \"Blink\" has and still make a point. You wish you could smack him on the head and say \"Enough! I got you. Move on, please\" throughout the chapters.",
            "the book began with lots of interesting observations and new ideas, really eye catching so to speak but after a couple of chapters, it is the same thesis rehashed many times with different stories to illustrate the same concept(s). i thought the writer could have done a magazine feature article on this topic instead of writing a full length book. so, definitely borrow the book from the public library as you can finish the whole book in 2 hours. on content alone, this book does not deserve a \"buy\" but deserve a \"borrow\".",
            "The first chapter was enthralling. It tells us how a number of art experts, using the latest available scientific techniques, failed to spot a fake whereas a few other experts, believing in their gut reactions spotted the piece of art work as a fake. Great start.But then the obvious question arose. We all know how our gut reactions, our instincts or 6th sense, call it whatever you might, have failed us in the past. How does one tell the real McCoy from the fake one? I was hoping that the book could help answer that question. It didn't.So what does it make this book? An entertaining read. That's all. It really hasn't changed my decision making process in life, and I doubt it will change anybody's decision making process in their lives either.",
            "After reading this book, never again will I think about thinking the same way again. Never will I look at someone's facial expression and not analyze what they might be thinking. I will hopefully make better split of the moment decisions in things like war simulation games, sports and other high tense situations that may occur. Thin slicing, the new miracle of personality analysis. I will now constantly thinking about why I am making an opinion about someone and try not to have biased opinions about things, I will try and base my thoughts on people about how they act and not things like appearance, age or environment. I will try and listen to my subconcious mind more often and go with my instincts. See with my eyes as they say and not with my mind. I reccommend this book to anyone willing to read it. For anyone who likes to know about themselves and how the brilliant mind works.",
            "I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in understanding human behaviors and why we react the way we do under certain circumstances.I particularly fascinated by the cop's reaction after a speed trace and the research done on facial expression. A lot of decisions can be made in a blink, some are good, some are detrimental. After \"Tipping point\", this is another great work on human instinct and psychology.",
            "Gives you this whole new insight into looknig at things,Amazing new perspective,,,have to put them to practice though",
            "If you've ever wondered why or how snap decisions are made, this book will be of interest. Gladwell explains how controlled experiments have explained some of that mystery. He then goes on to illustrate how those quick judgments can err as easily as they can prove accurate; but, moreover, how it is somewhat possible to train the accuracy of our instantaneous judgments.",
            "Having read \"Outliers\" and \"The Tipping Point\" I was excited to start \"Blink\". That excitement quickly subsided. The book starts out great. Gladwell does a great job of drawing the reading in an capturing their attention. The problem appears to be that he doesn't know what to do with the reader's attention once he has it. His other two books kept me hooked from cover to cover. This one lost me halfway through. Some of the examples he brings up in the book seem out of place to say the least. He also skips around a lot from example to unrelated example trying to make his point. By then end of the book, I wasn't even sure what his point was. I would definitely recommend \"Outliers\" and \"The Tipping Point\"; however, don't waste your money on \"Blink\".",
            "I'm not someone who reads a whole lot, and I hadn't read but one book book cover to cover in over two years until I heard about Blink. The book focuses on how people unconsciously know much more than they give their brain credit for, and that the unconscious is qutie good at picking up on subtle signals and processing them very quickly. The key to harnessing the unconscious is not only know when to use it, but also recognize when ingrained yet unjustified biases interfere with our otherwise sound snap judgment. I read it at my leisure in only a couple weeks and really enjoyed it. I had read Gladwell's The Tipping Point and it really made me think. That prompted me to investigate further into Gladwell's writing. Blink made me excited about reading again, which is something I never thought I'd say. As soon as I finished this book, I went out immediately and bought Gladwell's What The Dog Saw and can't wait to start reading that. This book is definitely worth your time. Gave me insight into areas ranging from the power of \"thin-slicing\" in order to predict the overall longevity of marriages all the way to examining how the perceptions from the autistic person's point of view can give us better insight into our own minds.",
            "Gladwell is one of the best at integrating massive amounts of research into easy to understand themes that are transformational. Blink is a great example of how he helps us understand how we think.",
            "The book was a good quick read. He has an easy writing style, but tended to dwell on points a bit too long for my tastes.In general he sought to discuss the power of thin-slicing situations. He successfully showed how its something everyone does subconsciously; sometimes to our advantage otherwise not as much. He includes a plethora of examples when \"first impressions\" save us misery, give us superior insight but contrasts them with examples of the opposite. He had also set out, according to his introduction, to discuss how to hone one's \"thin slicing\" ability, but here he fell short. The book had a very abrupt ending.",
            "Before purchasing this novel I had read Outliers and enjoyed the book so much I decided to pick up Blink. Gladwell's prose is very clean and straightforward, which leads to a quick and interesting read. Blink did have some intriguing chapters but as a whole, the book left much to be desired.The author attempts to elucidate how our subconscious quickly makes decisions in a real time environment. Further, the author draws the conclusion that more often than not we should trust our instincts and our ability to \"thin slice\". However, the book lacks the execution that is characteristic of his later novels.I would recommend this book to those who are interested in psychology because some areas contain merit and this book may be more attractive to those who are in the field.",
            "Awesome book!! Have read The Tipping Point and the Outliers by Malcolm McDowell as well and they are all excellent. He writes in a way that holds you from page one and reads like a fascinating novel. Blink is my favorite as it is amazing food for thought, insightful and makes you look at things in a whole different way. I've recommended this book to many people.",
            "I enjoyed Blink's concept which is based on a theory someone can learn in a psychology course. Basically, the author states that people can make snap decisions that are just as good as thought out decisions. The rational is that the human leverages the knowledge is learned throughout their life and subconsciously processing these decisions without knowing. I am not sure if I completely buy into this theory however, the author provides back-up to reinforce his points. I think this book would be an interesting read for some and should be considered if you are looking for something different to read.",
            "This is a very interesting book. With his characteristic easy-going style the author examines the first two seconds of human observation. He refers to them as intuition or snap- judgments first and later as intuition. The book is well articulated as he explores different parts of this phenomenon through different chapters. He states that there is a sophisticated unconscious process that takes place whenever we are facing a situation in which we are required to take action. This process is much faster than our conscious thought and rationalization process, he points out that this ability it is related with a particular area of the brain's frontal cortex located behind the nose. He points out experiments in which patients with brain damage were unable to choose between two sets of alternatives with their pros and cons detailed laid out by themselves.Gladwell also points out that there are many unconscious associations that are transmitted to us by our environment. Moreover, he asks the reader to engage on some exercises and test throughout the book in order to experience this and other assertions made by him. One direct implication of the previous is that our unconscious process can be educated or trained. Another implication is that these implicit associations may bias our intuition which reveals that our intuition can also lead us to make mistakes. Still this doesn't mean that we must only use our conscious rational thinking process as the only way to solve problems as data can also fools us. Worse, having extensive data won't necessarily protect us as too much data can prevent us from seeing the forest because of the trees. Information or knowledge means nothing if there is not any understanding of what these information means. Our \"intuition\" works with understanding, understanding requires a lot of preparation, education and experience, the alternative is just making random choices.Understanding translates into \"good\" judgment and \"good\" judgment into good decisions. In situation in which we are overwhelmed by information, variables and intricate consequences \"intuition or judgment\" is found by Gladwell to be better at making the call that our traditional conscious logic and verbal analysis, which ironically has proven far superior for making simple decisions.The book ends with a reflection and a call to action. Both methods of taking decisions have their strengths and weaknesses; there is no panacea but a need for balance between these two methods. Moreover the observations made on this book are here to stay, but now that we have this knowledge about the human decision process, how are we going to use this knowledge to overcome the current deficiencies that we as a society have when taking decisions.Along the book there is a Gladwell signature everywhere, the language is clear and direct, the message is relevant. Gladwell is not trying to construct a classical scientific theory, but to transmit his observations as directly and clearly as possible. In short , a fine reading.",
            "Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell is an influential book that analyzes the decision making process in humans. The first part of the book deals with unconscious decision making. The book thoroughly describes the experiment done by a psychologist. He records the conversation of couples and can tell if they are going to be together in a few years or not. The psychologist analyzes different reactions of the partners and can tell if everything is right or something is going wrong. By doing this study for a long time he has come up with \"four horseman\" that can give information about a relationship. They are defensiveness, stonewalling, criticism and contempt. Even by listening to a couple's conversation for 30 seconds he can tell if they are going to make it or not. It is also important to stress the fact that none of the partners know themselves how they react.Then the author goes in more detail on unconscious decision making. The author believes that sometimes we are better off by making snap decisions then making decisions based on too much information. He uses the example of The Pentagon strategy game to illustrate this idea. The Blue Team representing United States that had an enormous system of information and The Red Team representing a rouge country that was very limited in information and communication. Despite these differences, the Red Team won because they used snap decisions made in the field while the Blue team was lost in the huge amount of information it had. Oftentimes we believe that what we think is free will but in fact it is our unconscious that is doing everything for us. As the author says : \" Much of the time we are operating on automatic pilot.\"Then the Gladwell also talks about the downs side of quick judgment. We often judge people by their appearance and this can lead to a wrong conclusion. Warren Harding was a tall dark skinned man that imposed authority and respect. People voted him to become president of the United States because of these attributes while overlooking other most important elements required in a president. He came to be one of the worst presidents in the United States history.Up to this point the author seemed to be contradicting himself. Should we trust our gut feeling or not? Our first impressions may seem that snap decisions come from nowhere, but in fact our unconscious is making these very fast decisions based on our experience and on the environment we live in. By changing our experiences we can change our first impression judgments. So the core idea of the book is that we should trust our snap decisions and that experience improves our instant thinking. We should often make decisions based on our first impressions if we have a good amount of experience.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell has a reputation of integrating researches and studies into his books. Blink definitely followed the same path. The opening story of the Getty museum is compelling and leading to a question of the reliability of snap judgment or in the first two seconds. Malcolm argued that the first two seconds is very important when it comes to making a decision. Too much information and data often overwhelm and cloud the real truth that he/she is looking for.Though, the first two second rule does not always apply as Gladwell cautioned in his book which he called the Warren Harding error. Because human brains are pre-conditioned by individual experience, we often make our snap judgment based upon our past experiences whether or not we are conscious about it; so snap judgment can sometime be wrong and unreliable.The conclusion of a good judgment as point out in his book is that experiences play an important role in order to be able to rely on one's snap judgment. People usually misinterpreted their own feeling and did not say what they really felt and it became a big problem when we started relying on a market research data that contains misinterpreted information of such group.In time of overwhelmingly massive information at our fingertips, Blink is a great book that reminds us of our conditional snap judgment and the problem of too much information in making everyday decisions. It is a norm now before buying something that you have to google the product, read the reviews online, comparing the product with other choices and exhaust any available information before deciding not to buy one. We spend too much time and read too much information that ends up clouding our thought and real feeling. Blink tells you to consciously listen to your intuitive, together with organized information; you will have the power of thinking without thinking.",
            "Good in-depth book, that makes you rethink the way you make decisions. I use this as a leisure book and really enjoy it!",
            "Grabs your attention from the first paragraph. Provides real world examples to support his observations in a way that helps you understand it on a deeper level...Just get the book....",
            "This book has some wonderful suggestions which we are trying to apply to prevention education and volunteer programming. I'm really looking forward to seeing, what I believe will be, great results!",
            "In theory, this book was good. It had a great concept, but it could have been explained in just a few chapters and not an entire book. The examples went on and on and on and on. I was bored with the book by the time I got to the end.",
            "Another excellent Gladwell book. I love Malcolm Gladwell's books. They are so intelligent and informative and thought-provoking. They should be assigned reading in college if not high school. They are very entertaining too.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell always writes on interesting about unique topics, and this book is definitely that. You'll learn a lot from reading it.",
            "Great read!Made me think in a different manner about my \"knee jerk\" decisions. Trust them a little more and don't analyze things so much.Gladwell was a little long-winded in some points, but overall was well written.Would recommend for everyone of any age.",
            "I enjoyed this talking book immensely. Well read by the author (a rare feat). Facinating research. A little drawn out towards the end. I will use some of the material in customer service training.",
            "When you see someone on the street, what goes into your instinctive judgment about whether they're trustworthy or shifty? If you've ever wondered that, &#34;Blink&#34; will sort you out. Gladwell is an excellent writer, and the research that he puts into his examination of split-second decision-making will leave you astonished. You'll be glad you read it.",
            "I have read all the books of Malcolm Gladwell so far and though this is not his best work but still the book has a lot of insights to give. The only thing I didn't like about the book was that sometimes it became a little vague otherwise a great book.",
            "Blink is about trascending what we think we know and trusting our inner self. It's about realising that we take our life's most important decisions in an instant, in a blink of an eye.Whenever we meet a new person, in fact, we acknowledge and decide we like or dislike him/her in less than 5 seconds. In that very moment, we are entirely guided by our unconscious and if only did we learn to listen to our purest, most recondite emotions, we would not be so surprised to discover, at a later stage, that what we thought of something or someone was not exactly right.So many of our decisions are driven by the passionate desire to find a feasible solution, a hint, an answer. Yet, the more we dwell into the process of decision-making, the more we risk to make the wrong choice.Blink revolutionises the worldly wisdom that invites people to sleep over a problem before trying and face it. All in all, Malcolm Gladwell invites us not to think... At least, not the way we are used to, but start relying on and embracing the beautiful, infinate possibilities of our mind.",
            "Under normal circumstances, it's a given that all books you must read for classes are not enjoyed. (That's some thin slicing for those who have already read this book.) But here, I was skeptical because I really enjoyed the class I was supposed to read it for. Good thing I was!This book demonstrates the idea that the first little snap judgments we make about things tend to be more accurate than the lengthy analyzations we make, and does it in a non preachy manner (even devoting an entire chapter strictly to its flaws). The chapters are more example-based than textbook-based, meaning that they consist of real people demonstrations (as if news articles are intermixed; was Gladwell a journalist?) of whatever the chapter's topic is. It's quite fascinating.If for nothing else than a reason to reconsider your first thoughts on ANYTHING and learn how they might have been MORE ACCURATE, read this book!",
            "Blink is an amzing book to say the least. Gladwell is able to take years of in-depth research and studies from diverse areas of psychology and sum them up into one umbrella idea.As a recent psychology graduate who actually reads a few journals to keep current on studies it was amazing to find this book. The wealth of science in Blink is \"dumbed down\" enough so that anyone can understand what each study was about; however, it still provides all the key information for the professional to find the study and do further research.Overall the ideas presented in Blick are not etirely new. The thing is they have never been put together in one place. Everything you wanted to know about some of the most complex processes of the brain is put into a novel like thread that is easy for anyone to comprehend and put together but will leave even the ardent professional amazed at the systehsis of ideas.A must read for anyone interested in the human mind!",
            "Full of useful and more importantly need-to-know information, \"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\" by Malcolm Gladwell is one of the books that brake out of the traditional non-fiction genre to deliver more than the promised and subsequently anticipated content. The title is engaging in a sense that it reflects some powerful and mysterious skill set humans possess but are somehow not aware of. However, this is not a self-help book but one that none the less helps with its message. Its multiple examples reveal what once seemed conceivable but not cognitively possible. Who knew there is a study proving men over 6 feet earn on average $5,000 a year more than shorter men do? And how stunned can one be if one learned facial expressions are not necessarily evoked by emotions, but quite the opposite - facial expressions do evoke emotions (try it yourself, force yourself to smile for 5 minutes and observe the results afterwards)?The author constructs the book by offering remarkable incidences and then examining the core networks of their causes, while at the same time drawing some powerful conclusions. In the end, even if you are unsure about the book, whether by looking at its cover, or reading reviews about it, I encourage you to pick up a copy in a bookstore or at the library and read the first 10 pages- you wouldn't be disappointed. Overall, I highly recommend it.-by Simon Cleveland",
            "Im not sure why I, as a 14 year old, chose to pick up a book such as Blink and read it for fun. But nevertheless I did. With my dictionary handy and my advil on the beside table I opened the book.As I began Blink I thought I was in for 288 pages of sheer philosophical confusion. But I am glad to say I was wrong. Malcolm Gladwell is a very understandable and vivid author. Blink is a book about the phenomenon of split second thinking, or \"thin slicing\" as he refers to it. Thin slicing, is the art of taking apart a decision into sequential segments and deciding the most beneficial option for the situation. The beauty? This all occurs within about two seconds, almost a first instinct if you will. All of this process occurs unconsciously, under your radar of noticing. The problem with individuals today is that we have been taught that thinking a problem over, evaluating each part, and probing it dry. Thin slicing is often correct but society doubts the reliability of the quality of a 2-second decision.Gladwell conveys this fact with the help of a series of very interesting examples. Each example tells a different story that somehow relates to thin slicing. This is probably my favorite part of the book. Such stories such as: marriage, heart attack triage, speed dating, choking on the golf course, selling cars, military maneuvers, and that coke really IS better than pepsi. These stories each push his point and give different examples on how thin slicing really is a very useful tool.So if you have a few empty summer days, or some snowed in winter nights pick up this book. You will be amazed at how amazingly clear Gladwell tells about these \"blink of an eye\" decisions. A very enjoyable story, I found my self laughing out loud at times, and sometimes I found my self sitting there thinking \"wow\".",
            "The capacity to assess situations or circumstances shrewdly! That is merely the definition of judgement, right? Well, the nudgers and whisperers of psychology will reluctantly agree that \" Blink \" contains the all the parts of life`s thought tapestry. Founded on the jaw-dropping studies of human reactions, while breath-takingly displaying the intricacies of the mind, Malcolm Gladwell begins to rout out how one`s sequence of thought works! After studying how the journey through life is fraught with peril, he explains how we are under growing pressure to reach a conclusion. Such is the devasting picture of Military, some may be trying their darndest to flog the one most likely to provide a soaring rise of defiance. The luvvy intelligence of a man as vitriolic as Gladwell is worrying enough! But the thinly veiled attack on Politics will surely unleash a foul-mouthed rant from some. Still, it comes as little surprise that the rising tide of facts will underpin his argument, hence making the book enjoyable yet compelling. With astonishing Biological savvy, including information about the real causes of heart attacks, this book will undoubtedly stand at the seemingly glittering summit of Psychology! While some pick apart the wholly improper acts from authority, doctors are just as worthy the potshots! Armed with Political genuis, threating a wide-spread revolution in society, the Messiah`s mutterings of slipshod work from the bureau might stun those who are easily offended. Nevertheless, this book is fascinating! If I had learnt so much, you will gain knowlegde in abundance, but you will still enjoy this piece of work. I recommend this for everyone!!!",
            "I'm really shocked at the few negative reviews - some want more scientific language describing what is known about how the brain works - others think this is too anecdotal and is NOT scientific. I think it's brilliant stuff - it draws from existing studies and maps out a practical guide as to how people can craft protocols for reaching better decisions, i.e., when to trust snap judgements and when you have to look further to make sure you are not introducing bias. This is heavy sledding and requires a lot of thought, but Mr. Gladwell makes it easy to read and understand. Applying it is hard, but he give plenty of examples. I'm not sure what more he could do to bring this topic to life?",
            "This book is about the power of quick, almost instantaneous, decisions that some people make with excellent results. It is about the value of intuition. Our subconscious mind can integrate small, even subtle, clues to very quickly make great decisions. Of course, not everyone can do this. This book, in part, is about who has this power, how valuable is it, and what can be done to acquire this power. The second part of the book is about how we often get these quick decisions wrong.",
            "In this book, Gladwell reaches the astounding conclusion that EXPERTS know more than other people. That if you spend YEARS doing something, or researching it, or training, you will be able to spot more details than others. A real eye-opener.",
            "Jameson Thottam: Don't blink or you'll miss a truly good readDo you ever wonder why you have such strong instinctual responses? Ever curious as to why your gut feeling is almost always right.For those of us who fell in love with his Tipping Point, it was big news when Malcolm Gladwell announced that he was tackling the topic of thin-slicing. In plain english, this book is all about how our mind makes snap decisions, and what we can learn about that process to make ourselves better decision-makers.What's it about? (James Thottam)Much like Tipping Point, this book is much more observational than conclusive. Gladwell's stated purpose is to make us more aware of the thin-slicing we do on a daily basis, and to understand the pros and cons of this natural behavior.Method of Teaching (Jameson L Thottam)The way the book teaches is through groups of anecdotes, each focused on a different facet of thin-slicing (reading faces, understanding vocal nuance, etc). Generally Gladwell will tell a \"framing\" story, outline the teaching point and then reinforce it with a number of smaller examples that prove the same point holds true in a variety of environments.The War Games Story (Jameson Thottam)Personally, I found the war games story that Gladwell dissects to be most informative. Focused on the Millenium Challenge, a competition in which a retired military officer know for his lack of process went head to head with senior armed forces leaders who had the benefit of a staggering amount of tools and data. The key there is staggering, and as we watch the inevitable defeat of the better educated team we learn a number of critical lesson about why learning to trust the ability to thin-slice can prove more valuable than any artificial thinking or technical solution we can develop.The Main Opinion (Jameson Thottam)I strongly recommend this book, which is a very quick read by the way, to anyone who is interested in better understanding human behavior or looking to refine their own self. Also, this is nearly guaranteed to be a business \"it\" book in 2005, so you marketing/strategy/sales folks should be prepared to talk about it at cocktail parties and strategy sessions all year long.Strengths: (Jameson Thottam)1.The stories that Gladwell uses are incredibly engaging and the run of topic areas. Something here for everyone (romance, military, medicine, etc).2.Stylistically, this is one of the most engaging books of its type that I have read. Crisp, clear and written in a colloquial narrative style, it's actually fun to read.Weaknesses: (James Thottam)1.As I have said before, Malcolm Gladwell is the John Grisham of the non-fiction world. If you are looking for a strong ending or a conclusion that will distill this books teaching points, you are in for a disappointment.2.Outside of the facts of the anecdotes themselves, Gladwell doesn't bring much hard data to the table to enforce his wider hypotheses regarding quick decision making.Enjoy the read,Jameson Thottam",
            "The author, who previously wrote The Tipping Point, a book about the spread of ideas and fads, takes us on a fascinating discussion and exploration of how we make snap decisions and how effective our first impressions and decisions can be.Through a wide variety of examples Gladwell helps us see how we can be better decision makers in all parts of our lives without necessarily collecting more data, but rather by focusing on the most important information.The author writes in the introduction, \"I believe - and I hope that by the end of the book that you will believe as well - that the task of making sense of ourselves and our behavior requires that we acknowledge there can be as much value in a moment as there is in fourteen months of rational analysis.\"I can think of several reasons to read this book, among them:- You read and loved the The Tipping Point.- You think the premise is interesting.- You want to be among the first to read what I believe is destined to be one of the most talked about books this year.Any of these are good reasons. This book is interesting, well researched and extremely well written. I recommend it highly.",
            "\"I didn't like his face.\"It's an apocraphal story of Abraham Lincoln and a favorite for preachers everywhere. As a young lawyer, Lincoln allegedly once rejected a prospective employee on the grounds that he didn't like the man's face. When his fellow lawyers incredulously pressed him to explain, Lincoln responded that every man older than 40 deserves their face.In his latest offering, Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, Malcolm Gladwell examines the snap judgements we make every day and our own inability to understand what prompts us to make them. From the experts who had a vague intuition that an artwork was a fake--an intuition that was later confirmed--to the rest of us, who will choose one product over another because of the packaging and context in which we see it, subconscious judgements affect every aspect of our existence, including race.Much of Gladwell's work does focus on the fact that these snap judgements can be trained, which often separates the expert from the rest of us. When music industries heard Kenna sing, they knew he was special. The rest of us, though, are still catching on. Yet there is one qualification to this: in one study regarding our responses to jam, college students and experts ranked six jams nearly the same. However, when a different set of college students was asked to describe their reasons for their preferences, the similarities went away. \"By making people think about jam,\" Gladwell writes, \"[the study] turned them into jam idiots.\" Sometimes, our unreflective judgements are the most reliable.To draw a parallel, it seems Gladwell demonstrates what deconstructionists have contended with respect to literature: that the unconscious perceptions of authors shape their texts and meanings. Rather than descend into the world of suspicion, however, Gladwell repeatedly exhorts the reader to have charity toward the subjects of his examples.Like The Tipping Point, Blink could have been 75 pages shorter. But Gladwell's style is engaging and readable, which makes the repetition somewhat more bearable. Regardless, Gladwell has produced a provocative analysis of a difficult and intriguing aspect of the human experience.",
            "The book tells of how there are people who know, but dont really know how they know. The stories/cases that are presented in the book about snap judgements are interesting. Gets a little to technical in a few cases, particularly the part about reading faces. It doesnt leave you with a sense of \"hey, I can do that too\", just makes you think \"oh, ok, well thats nice\"",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's Blink is an extremely interesting read, and I would suggest it to most who enjoy reading. It makes you think, and understand what's going on in your brain just a little more. I highly recommend this, especially for people in, or entering, the psychology field. I can't wait to read The Tipping Point.",
            "This book was given as a required reading for a yoga teacher training course I participated in. It was wonderful! I'm so glad I had the opportunity to experience a book that made so much sense!I would highly recommend it for anyone,for those who already believe in intuition and especially for those who don't.",
            "This is the author of \"The Tipping Point\" and Blink is about how we make choices, decisions, impressions in a blink of an eye with some doing it very well and others not so well. How some people can go with their \"instincts and win while others stumble into error\". Gladwell tosses on it head the notion about waiting to get all of the information necessary, making analysis before making decisions. Whether one is looking at great or fake art, the reasons why \"New Coke\" failed miserably or why police make split-second decisions that can be horribly wrong or predicting a professional tennis serve in or out or whether a marriage would succeed or fail was fascinating.Gladwell writes of a concept called, `thin-slicing' or `the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behavior based on very narrow slices of experience.' Whether one is concerned about marriage, suing a doctor, marketing, speed dating, taste tests, electing a president, pop music or `listening with your eyes', this book is fascinating and has a lot to say to us about our decisions, our context, our environment, our experience and how we process information in a moment, make impressions and make decisions.This book will change the way you.......",
            "Some very interesting case studies. Some very obvious (not so interesting) case studies. Decent writing. Overall, worth the read (or, as in my case, the listen-to). In the past, I have enjoyed Gladwell's writing in the New Yorker Magazine. Blink is like several NYM pieces strung together, not fully satisfying for the stringing, but entertaining enough, and occasionally thought-provoking.",
            "Looks like a lot of people have written reviews, so there is no need to comment on the content in detail. I especially enjoyed the unabridged audio book. I istened while commuting mornings and evenings, even though I commute pre-dawn and after sunset in the winter --something harder to do with a book. Some comment that the \"science\" may be flawed; I don't really care if it is or isn't. For me, the basis of enjoyment is to consider a lot of what goes on in my business and social life, a new way to think about what is really going on.The problem of using the audio version is that you can't stop and listen to just a sentence or two again and again (at least not on my MP3 player). The advantage of the audio version is that I stopped thinking like the student compelled to put those bright yellow marks over everything deemed important, and I could listen for the broader concepts. After all, I am not going to be tested on who did what experiments, or if the psychology is sound. I'm listening to this book to expand my own range of thinking.I enjoyed it thoughly, and now want a tangible copy to keep in my office bookshelf for easy reference.At first I thought that the voice would be monotonous and would lull me into a bored stupor. But, the narrator does a fine job of voice inflection, emphasis, and pace change. You can tell when he is moving from anecdote to concept presentation to summarization pretty easily. And, if I fell asleep on the bus while listening to this, it was because I was going on only 5 hours sleep, and even the most noisy music would not have kept me awake.",

About first impressions, snap judgments (and misjudgments) and facial expressions and from topics ranging from marriage to military war games, this book kept me interested from beginning to end. It is definitely not a \"thriller\" since it is not fiction but spell binding nonetheless. The author quotes from relevant research and it does made me wonder how much control my sub conscious actually has over me.The narration for the audiobook is by the author and is read in a matter of fact and conversational way, which is easy on the ears.A must read if you loved Freakanomics and/or The Wisdom of Crowds since I feel the book belongs to same genre.",
            "I read this book aloud to my friend while he did the driving on one of our road trips. It not only was a great read; the words were absolutely glorious when read aloud. Mr. Gladwell has cleverly combined a necessarily impressionistic study with some hard \"research\" of a sort.I frequently evaluate books by their transformative power. After reading Blink, I'll never think the same way about ciminal due process or belittle my own (if unconscious) prejudices.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell did a great job explaining thin-slicing. His examples were very memorable and easy to connect with for the most part. I couldn't put this book down! I am going into education and find this book really interesting on how we can set up schema's and think so quickly. In this book I found out just how important our unconsciousness is. This book is great if you want to learn about how we have a reason for something but can't really explain it. It is also great if you are one of those people with a gut feeling and have no real reason for it. I would recommend this book to anyone. I want to read the tipping point I hope that it will be just as entertaining as blink!",

            "In short, it is a book about when we can rely on our instincts (gut feeling) and when we should use our head and think things through. It also touches on how and why our instincts are sometimes wrong or unreliable, and how we can try to \"teach\" it to work better.Very interesting, with great options for further reading and great stories and examples throughout.",
            "In this highly engaging book, Gladwell explores a human brain model that assumes two separately functioning thinking paradigms: a subconscious, intuitive, fast, and intellectual, analytical, slow. He shows how the two thinking paradigms sometimes help and other times hurt and impede and confuse us, and how to develop and control them.Highly recommended easy reading to anybody interested in human psychology and development of computer applications in Artificial Intelligence.Yuval Lirov, Practicing Profitability - Billing Network Effect for Revenue Cycle Control in Healthcare Clinics and Chiropractic Offices: Collections, Audit Risk, SOAP Notes, Scheduling, Care Plans, and Coding",

            "While I'm a bit surprised to find that many people didn't care for this book, I found it fascinating. I had no idea that there was so much going on in our brains that was subconscious. Knowing that the shape of an ice-cream container changes the way a person enjoys the product or why Pepsi wins the sip contest over Coke may not change my life, but the fact that there are reasons that can be measured and explained intrigued me to no end. And the items that related to race were both scary and very sobering. I've listened to this book on audio several times and enjoy it every time.",
            "Not just another self-help read, this book leverages research, statistics and ethics to suggest a path towards a healthier society. Well worth your time and money, especially for the therapized who \"run away\" (sensu Monty Python) from enlightment through blaming.",

            "The people who reviewed this book poorly may not have to deal with race issues. Even though I'm Navajo, Gladwell makes some astute humanitarian and race observations that have whirled around in my head for years. He makes affirmations about my theories of race and our denials of our repressed feelings. I did the test of associating good with African American image, and I even struggled with it. I liked Gladwell's honest approach.He also exhibits a great writing style. Though I read Blink several weeks ago, I'm still talking about it. My gushing comments inspired friends to buy the book for friends, spouses, and even themselves. Get this, I broked away from my gym workout to discuss Blink with a friend. Since I take my gym seriously, this is an all time new one. I've lent my copy out, and when I get it back, I want to explore the researchers of classifying facial expressions. In the meantime, I'll get Tipping Point.Thank you, Malcolm, for your work. It's great to find an author who sees the world as I do. We must find avenues to get along without the superficial talk and denial. I'll write again if I mimic my reaction at the gym after reading Tipping Point.",

In the end I was trying to figure out if my sometime \"Shoot from the hip\" method of decision making I use when under pressure is flawed or not. In the end Malcolm tells us in some situations yes it is perfectly reasonable to make a decision in a \"blink\" but in others more than \"one blink\" is necessary. Gee thanks for the insight.The best thing about the book it gave me renewed confidence in making quick decisive decisions. That in fact, there are many things that make up our decision making thought process and sometimes it's not possible to explain your answer. In other cases it would take a team of people weeks to prove your \"blink\" decision.",
            "Book Review submitted by: Stephen J. Hage, SteveH9697@aol.comGladwell is able to take complex situations and reduce them to ideas and concepts that cut through the complexity to reveal an incredibly simple structure. And, it's that structure that becomes the focus for not only wading through but ultimately being able to understand what's \"really\" going on.He revealed that ability with his first book, The Tipping Point and carried it through in writing blink.In trying to understand what blink is about Gladwell explains it best:\"It's a book about rapid cognition, about the kind of thinking that happens in the blink of an eye. When you meet someone for the first time, or walk into a house you are thinking of buying, or read the first few sentences of a book, your mind takes about two seconds to jump to a series of conclusions. Well, Blink is a book about those two seconds, because I think those instant conclusions that we reach are really powerful and really important and, occasionally, really good.\"We're taught early on that the right way to make a decision is to gather as much information as possible and carefully weigh all the pros and cons. But sometimes, there just isn't enough time or information. Other times there's just too much of it. Those are the kinds of situations blink is about; situations like war, street shootings and dealing with things that appear to be something they are not.Gladwell's approach is lucid and satisfying. His style is conversational and avuncular.The subject is serious but the read is comfortable and easy. And, when you finish it you truly will have learned something valuable and useful.Read blink and I promise you won't be disappointed or sorry you did.",
            "I was looking forward to reading Blink. The combination of an interesting topic and critical acclaim had me excited.The first few chapters of Blink were moderately intriguing. Gladwell seemed to be getting at the point that thin-slicing (drawing instantaneous conclusions subconsciously) is both powerful and accurate. Then the book starts to wander though and the reader is presented with many examples of thin-slicing being incorrect and even deadly. Gladwell then wraps it up (sort of) by offering that sometimes thin-slicing yields correct conclusions and sometimes it yields incorrect conclusions. Really? That seems like a trivial thesis and one that I probably didn't need to read 300 pages to reach. The material in this book could have been parsed significantly and served as the basis of an article, with greater final effect than this book.Although there are some good stories along the way, I doubt many readers will find it hard to put this book down at points. Those that truly enjoy it will probably do so more for the anecdotes than because it offers any deep insight.",
            "As it's title suggests `Blink' is essentially about what happens within those first few seconds of meeting someone new. Reading the book, we quickly learn that first impressions are more important than we realize.Gladwell uses stories as diverse as dating scenes and military maneuvers to show us just how powerful a first impression is and then shows us how we can use this to our advantage.For a job seeker in particular, this can be a very powerful tool. Knowing how to give the right first impression can make an astounding difference to how successful we are in job interviews and life in general.Danny InyAuthor of the free eBook \"Forget Everything You Know About Looking For a Job...

            "Having read The Tipping Point for our book club, I was looking forward to reading this book with the same group, and was not disappointed. Fascinating insights into a fairly obscure topic. Makes one really think about ones own prejudices and intuitions.",
            "Although I found \"blink\" engrossing, Gladwell's talent as a writer often lets him get away with murder. The distinctions he makes sometimes seem arbitrary, particularly if one takes just a little more than 2 seconds to mull things over. Some of his extrapolations not only seem unjustified but mislead. For example, in his discussion of malpractice, Gladwell urges his patients to find their doctors \"wanting\" if they appear not to be listening or talking down. But the research on which Gladwell bases his malpractice discussion simply found a correlation between this sort of behavior and a physician's likelihood of being sued. There was no discussion of whether the physicians who were sued more frequently when this sort of behavior was present also had delivered less appropriate care with any greater frequency. While many of us would prefer a doctor who takes the time to listen, we also want a competent doctor. Would it necessarily be wise to pass up a doctor with an excellent clinical reputation simply because he/she was a cold fish? In a discussion about hospital emergency departments, Gladwell asserts that \"what screws up doctors when they are trying to predict heart attacks is that they take too much information into account.\" He bases this conclusion on research performed in the 1970s that produced an algorithm for determining heart attacks that considered far less data than traditional methods of diagnosis and was far more accurate and safe. What seems obvious, however, is that the algorithm worked better not because it required less information but rather because it had identified the right information to use. And the algorithm had been developed after only \"feeding hundreds of cases into a computer\", so there also appears to have been nothing intuitive about which data would prove to be the best data to use in assessing the likelihood of heart attack. Gladwell ends his Afterword with the suggestion that, given the demonstrated bias against black defendants in criminal trials, \"the accused shouldn't be in the courtroom\" and \"should answer all questions by e-mail or through the use of an intermediary.\" In this manner, the jury's and judge's bias would be mitigated. Constitutional issues aside, if juries and judges are on average (at least unconsciously) biased against black defendants, why shouldn't those same biases affect jury and judge perceptions of black witnesses? Do we also need to remove all witnesses from the courtroom? But after having removed all witnesses and defendants from the courtroom, how much potentially valuable information is lost by the inability to view witness and defendant (if the defendant chooses to take the stand) facial and body language of the sort that Gladwell earlier in the book asserts is so meaningful? Has one type of injustice been \"solved\" in exchange for creating the possibility of many more? My gut tells me that figuring out how to remedy courtroom racial bias is going to require more thinking than blinking.",
            "Let me being this by saying that reading Malcolm Gladwell's books are always a pleasure; he constructs his works like a documentary film, and that makes the complex topics he writes about both engrossing and more approachable. If a reader were to read only the first half of this book, they may have a more positive impression of this book then it is worthy of.However, this book is an utter disappointment because it never reaches a conclusion. I feel like Mr. Gladwell started this book in support of the unconscious mind as a powerful, accurate decision making force; and as he researched further, grew less sure of this position, until near the end of the book he warns us against relying on the unconscious At the very end, it's apparent that the author doesn't really know where he stands on this topic, and in the afterward, the reader is ping-ponged back and forth as Mr. Gladwell argues with himself.His final conclusion that he leaves us with--that juries should not be allowed to view a defendant in person--flies in the face of other research that he presents earlier in the book--that the unconscious mind is able to pick up on \"micro-expressions\" that reveal obscured emotions and motivations.Mr. Gladwell is clearly unable to make a decision on this topic, and that only leaves his readers ultimately confused.",
            "Malcolm blends storytelling and journalism into very interesting reading. Somehow the reading is not entirely satisfying, because there's really no point. Most readers take from the book that we can make decisions within a couple seconds and that can be more accurate than taking weeks or months to study the situation. Often it boils down to experience. At the same time, the book talks about how wrong our initial impressions can be, because of bias, stereotypes, and pressure.So the lesson is that your initial impressions made within the first second or two can be dead on right...except when you're dead on wrong. Fun stories, though.",

While it lacks in the self-help department, it does not really tell you what to do to become a better thin-slicer, it makes up for by superb storytelling and thought provoking essays.An interesting side note, I picked this book up because I was acquainted with an individual in one of the studies it uses. From listening to his best friend describing the relationship, I without any doubt put in my two cents from my thinly sliced comprehension aka \"gut\" - that the marriage is over. His best friend got angry and yelled at me for not understanding completely and my negative judgement. A month later they filed for divorce. A year later this book was published. I like that it uses their taped interaction many years ago as an example, because it validated my personal \"Snap judgement\" and lets me know my gut is doing a good job.",

Using many psychological, sociological, and educational research studies, as well as personal experience and anecdotes, Gladwell gives many examples of how people reach conclusions and decisions.This is, again, a book that as I was reading it I was discussing it with other people. I can't wait till Gladwell's next book. This guy is brilliant.",
            "After his earlier success with The Tipping Point, there must have been some pressure on this author to come up with another brilliant theory \"on the cutting edge of neuroscience and psychology\" (the dust jacket proclaims). Problem is, it isn't so easy to be so refreshing and revolutionary on schedule for publishing a new book every few years. But then, relatively few authors have the resources of a staff writer for the NY Times.Malcolm Gladwell has compiled a lot of anecdotes together in a book about \"the power of thinking without thinking\", i.e. \"thin-slicing\". Simply, the first two seconds of our decision-making process is largely subconscious and is when we filter the information we need to make snap judgements. He enriches this premise by including a wealth of case studies from various fields; a military campaign, art historians at the Getty museum, political coups, relationship psychology, car salesman, police. It makes for an entertaining read.There are two problems with Blink as I see it. First, thin-slicing is easily recognizable as a repackaged version of temperament theory described by Myers-Briggs as Intuition. Everybody has some degree or another of Intuition, but some are born with greater natural tendencies to be Intuitive - and it's really not something that can be learned or honed. There seems to be a hint of purpose when Gladwell describes one psychologist's detailed method of analyzing videotapes of faces, but such a laborious process is the antithesis of intuition. You really can't teach this instinct.Secondly, Blink really stretches points about how all its anecdotes connect to form this thin-slicing theory. It fails to clearly define and investigate thin-slicing/intuition, barely scratching the surface of the phenomenon and even muddling the picture at times with examples of when thin-slicing fails us, without getting to the heart of why. Interesting enough, but it doesn't hold together well.I really gave Blink 3 stars based on its efforts to be new and original as a theory of psychology and/or sociology. The long rambling stories interspersed throughout were absorbing and earned it an extra star for entertainment value. Nice Effort.-Andrea, aka Merribelle",
            "Great Book! A \"blink\" of a read but full of valuable insights.Gladwell's anecdotes were sometimes quirky and at the same time serious. Great tool for those wanting to refine their own decision making skills.",
            "A series of interesting anecdotes create an enjoyable, effort-free and disposable read. Gladwell shares other people's hard work and hard-won insights, but by the time it gets to us it's conversation-piece material.The stories themselves are interesting and well-told. The case of the ghastly series of errors of police officers and a man standing on his stoop was expecially compelling.",
            "In a book as research-rich as this one, I expected the writing to be \"scholarly\" and dense -- the opposite was true! I was surprised to find Gladwell's writing to be accessible and easy to read. I do wish there were more of a take-away, though -- is the conclusion to trust your gut because it's founded in conclusions drawn from data? Or not to trust your gut, because it can be wrong? Or only trust your gut if you're an expert? Not sure. But I'll trust my gut and recommend this book.",
            "Blink explains that.I love this book because it explains how I think and it will explain how you think and how you come up with brilliant insights into truth.This is a book about intuitiveness but not about the \"woo-woo\" kind of intuitive thinking many books describe.While not a scientific treatise on how thoughts work or are created, it explains in detail how flashes of brilliance and deep understanding without explanation work and why.You'll find yourself having many aha moments throughout this book and you'll find yourself really thinking.This is a book for thinkers . . . as well as those who'd like to think better.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's *Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking* is a fascinating and quick read, saturated with studies and statistics and stories about how our (subconscious) mind works.Blink takes us into that paradoxical realm where quickness in judgment (\"in the blink of an eye\") can be amazingly accurate and we, at a conscious level, don't even know why. The opening story about the Getty museum ancient artifact hijacks your attention. You're caught in Gladwell's grip for the rest of the book.I like books of this kind because they stretch our thinking and even reverse the settled results of popular conclusions and myths. You meet some unusual characters in the book like Paul Van Riper and John Gottman, Abbie Conant and Paul Ekman. (Each of these are tied to some amazing stories about our thinking processes.)The chapter titled \"Seven seconds in the Bronx\" is worth the price of the book (or read it at your public library for free). It's this chapter which launched my imagination into the Bible's references to \"the face,\" whether human or God's. The Bronx story is about tragedy in space of 7 seconds. Yet, the last story of the chapter, about a human encounter in the space of perhaps 1.5 seconds, relieves the tension you feel. 'Nuff said.Gladwell is also the author of *The Tipping Point.*",

            "Malcolm Gladwell has made an art form out of bringing together random information and packaging it within a single context. Sometimes this works well, other times not so much. I agree with many of the other reviewers, that the examples in this book would probably have held together better as a series of articles, and yes, the first half of the book is a more cohesive read than the second. I found the best way to read the book was as a pick up and put down book. If you read a few pages here and there the examples are interesting and make you think, challenging the way you perceive the world and the way you make judgements about it. In this way, the overall premise becomes less of an issue.The more I think about this book the more I wonder whether this was the book he really wanted to write. There are so many examples of racial stereotyping, I wonder whether that was the issue he wanted to tackle, but didn't quite have the courage to write a whole book on such a topic. It's a shame he doesn't because it would make for an interesting read and with his profile it would get a broader audience.",
            "Blink is a Great book about thinking in a different way, this for sure takes your thinking in a different direction its not your every day reading book and that is whats great about it. With the separate stories in a story this approach keeps the reader on their toes and always keeps an interesting story going while still incorporating an all over flow throughout the book.This book has been an information super highway, anyone who is looking for split second decision making tips this is the book to read. Malcolm is a skilled craftsman when it comes to writing and the things he can do anyone can appreciate. The overall tone of the book is strong and informative Malcolm knows what he wants to get across and he does a good job in doing so. This book is a good buy and can be passed around to anyone to read it is a quick read and never gets too complicated.If you like to read or even if you don't like to read this is still the book for you its a great read and you will be satisfied when you are finished.

You'll learn when it is appropriate to trust your gut and instincts and when it is appropriate to use other tools help raise your situational awareness.This book also goes in depth as to why experience plays such an important role in decision making at the last minute. Gladwell uses some pretty compelling case studies like Chicago's Cook County Hospital and how Orchestra choose brass players.

            "Malcolm Gladwell knows how to tell a story. He captures the little details about people and events that give them meaning and make them interesting, something he used to good advantage in 'The Tipping Point,' and almost as well in this book, 'Blink.''Blink' is a book about snap judgments, first impressions, and thin-slicing experiences. It challenges the conventional wisdom of distrusting our first impressions, and brings up several examples where first impressions are actually the right ones. It shows real-world situations in which having all the information at one's fingertips was actually less useful than working from limited information.From examples of military trials to art forgeries, from police procedures to music performance, Gladwell brings example after example about how our reaction in the first two seconds of encountering something new can tell us as much as our reaction after knowing everything there is to know...and sometimes more.There are times in 'Blink' when the point is overstated and the generalization doesn't work - but Gladwell tells his stories so well that it doesn't matter. And what matters in 'Blink' isn't really the conclusions Gladwell makes...what matter is the stories of the people he talked to and the things they experienced. In Gladwell's hands these experiences feel real and tangible, and for the most part they work.Exaggerated claims or not, the stories in 'Blink' made me think about experiences in my own life. Among other things, I remembered a time when I was a teenager, spending time on my uncle's farm, and I ran out of books to read. We went to the bookstore and I didn't see anything new from my favorite standbys - but there was this book I'd never seen before, by an author I'd never heard of. I had no idea what story was in store between its pages, but I loved the cover. LOVED it. I bought it and discovered a new favorite author, one who I still read today, after more than twenty years and through a dozen books.We're told that judging a book by its cover is a bad idea. But if that's the case, would I ever have discovered one of my favorite writers? If that's the case, how are we meant to judge a book we've never read at all?'Blink' reinforces for us something we already knew - sometimes it's OK to judge a book by its cover.",
            "Entertaining read. Main gist of the book is to follow your gut, and follows good reasons as to why. I really liked it. Great conversational book too, or to read on plane rides.",
            "What a fascinating book! Each chapter was more interesting than the last. It was great to learn that some organizations at least do learn from experience, such as some police departments starting to ban high speed chases because not only are they of course dangerous, but the excitement level of the cops when they catch the driver is so elevated that they are not able to accurately read the cues of the situation and assess the needed actions properly.I also loved the section about the Facial Action Coding System and how among many other wonderful uses, \"...it has even been put to use by computer animators at Pixar(Toy Story) and Dream Works(Shrek).\"",

I'm curious about the topics, but what happens is it ends up being a liberal treatise of social crap not worthy of my time (note: the opposite is true- liberals don't want to read a conservative treatise also). I find Gladwell's work entertaining and informative. Worthy of the read and gives me something to think about.",

The different elements of the book didn't seem to fit together as well.However, I do still recommend it...just keep your expectations at a normal level to begin with and you'll be happy at the end.",
            "The book is interesting to read but it doesn't offer much (or anything) in the way of \"lessons to be learned\". It discusses how some people have developed a good intuition and why that intuition is sometimes wrong - but offers nothing in the way of improving your intuition / decision making ability.",
            "This is the type of book that you will want to re-read over and over again because it is well-written, entertaining, and insightful. The premise of the book is that we can know something without really knowing it. Gladwell uses a number of unique examples (such as the Getty's near $10 million dollar blunder on an artificial Classic statue, and how improvisational comedy works) to show how we can surmise certain things in a blink of an eye.Gladwell's proof is anecdotal for the most part (which makesOn IntelligenceandStumbling on Happinessgreat companions to this work), but the author gives us a great look into an almost sixth-sense we humans have though we may not be completely aware of it. He goes on to describe intense scenes where blink-thinking (meta-cognition) wasn't used properly (crime scene botching and in the Cola Wars) and a number of other entertaining stories.This work and another of his (The Tipping Point) have been very influential in recent popular books includingMade to Stickand my own personal finance book.",

The content of the book is mostly a series of fascinating and compelling examples (such as the story of an art fake scam, an accidental police killing, human face reading, etc.) In spite of the detail it never gets dry, dull or \"academic\".While I like a good page turner--and this book definitely is one--what I appreciated most about this book is it made me think about my own snap judgements. I highly recommend this title.",
            "I'm a huge fan of Gladwell's and this book is another testament to his brilliant intellect. If everyone followed the train of thought he lays forth in this book, we'd all be communicating on such a higher level. My only criticism is that in parts of the book, I found myself wanting to skip ahead, but overall, the thoughts he provoked were worth the read.",
            "Gladwell scores again! Well-written book that advances its basic concepts with well described examples that illuminate the ideas and prompt the reader (at least this one) to consider specific applications in my own personal and professional lives.Reading this book emphasizes the value of my \"trusting my gut\" even when I cannot immediately put my finger on the exact logic for doing so.",

            "After reading this book, I learned so much how people make judgements. Gladwell calls the snap judgements we make, usually without much information is known as \"Thin-Slicing\" and is something we all do every day.After reading the book, I have realized many situations where I am \"thin-slicing\" and making quick snap judgements. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn how they make the judgements they do. An excellent read!",
            "I resisted reading this book because my preliminary 'thin-slice' of it was that it would be trendy, glib, and shallow. Hey, maybe there is something to Gladwell's idea after all, because I did find Blink to be trendy, glib, shallow and, also, obnoxiously condescending. Check out this quote from chapter one:\"My guess is that many of you have the same impression of Tom Hanks. If I asked you what he was like, you would say that he is decent and trustworthy and down-to-earth and funny. But you don't know him. You're not friends with him. You've only seen him in the movies, playing a wide range of different characters. Nonetheless, you've managed to extract something very meaningful about him from those thin slices of experience, and that impression has a powerful effect on how you experience Tom Hanks's movies. 'Everybody said they couldn't see Tom Hanks as an astronaut,' Grazer says of his decision to cast Hanks in the hit movie Apollo 13. 'Well, I didn't know whether Tom Hanks was an astronaut. But I saw this as a movie about a spacecraft in jeopardy. And who does the world want to get back the most? Who does America want to save? Tom Hanks. We don't want to see him die. We like him too much.'\"Yuck! I hate Tom Hanks. Not personally, of course. He's probably a nice man. But as an actor I hate his guts. I hate his face. I would love to see him die horribly in the movies in a variety of ways. Where do these 'lifestyle' writers like Gladwell get the authority to speak for everyone. Instead of saying 'I' or 'me', they always say 'you' or 'we'. There are some good things in this book, but they are badly undermined by Gladwell's hucksterish, Madison Avenue style of arguing and writing. He is prone to asking leading 'straw dog' questions like 'Were these people lying?' and 'But what would happen if I were to...?' And then answering condescendingly with 'Not at all' or 'The answer is.' He also uses hack phrases like 'Sure enough', 'but the truth is', and, nauseatingly frequently, 'Believe it or not.' He even actually uses the formerly uber-trendy adjective 'tony'. Uggh! The idea of 'thin-slicing' (oh, how I quickly came to hate that phrase) is never given a consistent, coherent defence. Gladwell starts out with a provocative description of what might happen 'unconsciously' during the first two seconds of decision making and then doodles off for the rest of the book on a flatulent walkabout in the fields of psychology, the arts, and business. This is a book written by a lazy amateur, a dilettante.Save your money. I wish I did. This book boils down to (Gladwell loves that phrase, 'it boils down to') 'follow your hunches'. Was that worth $18? My brother owes me $18. I only bought Blink and read it because of his threat not to read anymore of my recommendations if I didn't read one of his. (His last recommendation that I tried to read was Atlas Shrugged. No more need be said about that.) Gladwell comes to this startling conclusion ('follow your hunches') by talking to a few psychologists and Hollywood moguls and collecting a few anecdotes. Don't try looking for a bibliography in this book, because there isn't one. Instead 'we' have a sparse 'Notes' section which mostly consists of more anecdotes instead of references. If you are interested in reading about human behaviour and how we think and make decisions, check out Thomas Gilovich's How We Know What Isn't So, and Robert Cialdini's Persuasion (Science and Practice). These people are psychologists. They do experiments. They publish their results in peer reviewed journals, and they talk to fellow psychologists, scientists, and other smart people. They put extensive bibliographies at the backs of their books because they have read a lot about their subjects and they know that it is important to back up your conclusions and show how you came to them. If Gladwell had spent more time in the library and less time in the hair dressers, his book might have been better. But hey, Malcolm G.'s 'thin-sliced' the book biz. He knows that if you are a young, trendy writer working for 'the Best Magazine in the World' you can get just about anything published, even bilge like this, and hit the best sellers' lists.",
            "Let me save the trouble and fill you in on what this book is actually about. To sum up, it's basically 254 pages telling you that within the first few seconds of observing something like art, a marriage, a product idea, etc., you can have as accurate of a view or assumption of it as you would in a year of observation. What makes this even more hilarious is that his examples of \"instinctive decisions\" are from experts in certain fields: a psychologist, a coach, antiquities experts, doctors, etc. Wouldn't you think that an expert in a field, let's say a doctor, would instinctively be able to give a more accurate interpretation within seconds of a sick person then say a mechanic? Uh...yeah. So let me save you the time, trouble and $25...trust your instincts and you'll be fine. I just can't believe someone drew out such a dull and pointless topic into 254 pages. So my final thoughts...in 2 seconds, I could tell this book was a waste of time so I stopped reading it. Well done Gladwell!",
            "The title of this book, \"Blink\", and the back cover caught my eye. I read most of this book but I got the feeling that there were too many examples of the same point. The feeling I got was that the author was trying to make the book thicker with repetious examples. Maybe Im wrong. Maybe I just couldn't grasp the importance of the examples. Any way, I wasn't able to finish. The point I got was that a snap decision could be a good decision or it could be a wrong decison.",
            "It really does dawn on you somewhere in the middle of the book that Gladwell's intelligence is somehow borrowed, his examples redundant...He IS pushing his brand, his intellectuality, never quite making a solid point. The book is full of \"deep\" hmmm moments that never really amount to anything substantial. I'm glad I had the library copy (it would be a sorry waste of money).The moment I read about the involuntary subconscious association with the DOMINANT race, I knew Gladwell can't be taken seriously.",
            "This book was mostly full of stories that illuminate the fairly obvious. Basically, the theme is that over-analyzing can often be worse than simply making a snap judgment. There is such a thing as too much information (especially when not interpreted correctly), and likewise, snap judgments are often wrong. How to find a balance? No answer in this book.I did find some of the stories and information entertaining, insightful, and perhaps slightly useful; but overall, I was glad it was a short book--I would not have finished it had it been any longer.",
            "It seems that this book is more about the DANGERS of \"thinking without thinking\" then the advantages. Maybe the first 50 pages are interesting stories of people acting on instant insight successully, but the rest of the book describes disasters from doing so. I was looking for insight on expanding this ability, not reasons not to.A short, easy, read, but confounding... Not what I was expecting.",
            "While Malcolm Gladwell's first book-length offering \"The Tipping Point,\" offered a few redeeming qualities from it's spectacularly non-groundbreaking ideas, \"Blink\" has nothing to offer people who have at least taken a high school psychology class.In one respect, Mr. Gladwell has performed a great public service: he has exposed the media as being full of dupes, willing to glorify anything in the field of non-fiction that presents a psychological theory, even an amazingly unoriginal one. As in Gladwell's first tome, \"Blink\" is a promoter of Freudian concepts -- an unconscious mind that has a greater influence over us than we're aware of, etc. \"Blink\" is a 280 page voyage through anecdotes that do absolutely nothing to bolster his claim.Let's take a public example. On Wikipedia, there is a summary of a story from Blink posted: \"A researcher tells the story of a firefighter in Cleveland who answered a routine call with his men. It was in the back of a one-and-a-half story house in a residential neighborhood in the kitchen. The firefighters broke down the door, laid down their hose, and began dousing the fire with water. It should have abated, but it didn't. As the fire lieutenant recalls, he suddenly thought to himself, 'There's something wrong here,' and he immediately ordered his men out. Moments after they fled, the floor they had been standing on collapsed. The fire had been in the basement, not the kitchen as it appeared. When asked how he knew to get out, the fireman thought it was ESP, which of course it wasn't. What is interesting to Gladwell is that the fireman could not immediately explain how he knew to get out. From what Gladwell calls 'the locked box' in our brains, our fireman just 'blinked' and made the right decision. In fact, if the fireman had deliberated on the facts he was seeing, he would have likely lost his life and the lives of his men.\"Perhaps the fireman knew that there was something wrong because normally the fire should have abated? Perhaps the fireman was so frazzled by the incident that he couldn't put all of his thoughts together at once? And maybe his gut reaction could have been wrong, too -- but it wasn't, so that's a non-story, and Gladwell wouldn't have material for this book that way. Day after day, gut reactions and first impressions are wrong, which could also fill up a book, but that doesn't make for an interesting read. I don't feel as if I can make this point as strongly as it deserves -- the floor might not have fallen through. His first impression might have been wrong. First impressions are wrong all the time. That, however, is a boring concept, and wouldn't make a best-seller. It would also require Gladwell to do some real research.Another anecdote that sticks out in my mind: Gladwell claims that if I were sitting in his office, and he read words such as Florida, denchers, Bingo, etc., to me, I would have walked out of his office slower than I came in because my \"unconscious mind\" equated those words with being elderly, so I would have assumed the role of an elderly person, whether I was aware of it or not. Oh, would I have? \"Malcolm said so. That's enough evidence for me,\" said the gulliable Gladwell fan. Even assuming I were to walk out slower, there are more factors than a few words that he said to me throughout the course of our conversation, which would have to carefully controlled, by his theory, to make sure he didn't say things such as \"high school\" \"teenager\" or \"rock music\" because then I would have assumed the role of a teenager, walking out of the room faster, whether I knew it or not, neutralizing the elderly feeling.This is so ridiculous that I feel stupid even trying to debunk Gladwell's claims. This should be obvious even to the most uneducated reader -- there is more than one factor involved in everything. (I'm trying not to impart my own cognitive psychological bias into this -- I'm willing to read serious works about psychoanalysis. Gladwell's book is not serious! No one who ignores factors that may diminish their argument should be taken seriously.)Theory is fact to Gladwell, the King of Pop Psychology, two books in a row. Maybe he \"unconsciously\" knows that it's wrong.",
            "A big waste of time... he could have told the story in about 5 pages...",
            "Gladwell deftly squeezes about 100 pages of content into almost 300 pages of book. It goes from pretty good to tedious to boring. He draws conclusions which are not based on any \"facts\" in the book, but he states his ideas as if they were absolute truths. I gave him 2 stars because the first part of the book was OK.Don't waste your time and your money.",
            "This is a page turner. The book consists of several exciting stories on very interesting material (fake art, police brutality, marriage counseling, etc). The author shows a bunch of scientific trickery and experiements designed to demonstrate the power of _blink_ - split-second.However, there is hardly a moral to the story, or a coherent message in the book. The book isn't about \"thinking\" of any kind, and it certainly does not teach the reader how to think.",
            "This book reinforces what I knew intuitively already; some decisions are best made based on hunches. I enjoyed it a lot.",
            "Blink follows in the footsteps of The Tipping Point. Once again, Malcolm Gladwell gathers up a collection of fascinating tales, linking them together to help illustrate an idea. In Blink, that idea is that our subconscious, in only a few seconds, can make extremely accurate decisions. It's not intuition - Malcolm deliberately does not use the word intuition and explains this at the end of the book. Intuition is about gut, emotional reactions. Instead, Malcolm explains that the blink factor is when our extremely well trained subconscious zips through a decision for us.He gives many examples of how this works. Trained experts looking at a statue can tell immediately it's a forgery. Food experts can nibble an Oreo and tell which factory it was made in. Marriage experts can listen to a couple talk for only a few minutes and predict - with extremely high accuracy - if the pair will survive long term. It's not an emotional response. It's a lightning-fact summary of the training that the individuals have undergone.What then follows is to look at situations which don't involve specific training - i.e. human relationships. Every human, from the time they are born, are immersed in a 24-hour-a-day learning lab of how to get along with others. They learn facial movements, tone of voice, and much more to figure out how to relate to others. Malcolm specifically mentions autism and how individuals with this syndrome lack that skill - and how it affects their daily functioning. So each of us is educated from birth on how to act and react to others - and that becomes a subconscious talent.But is it a good thing? Because we learn and encapsulate all of this without any real conscious thought, we also bring into our brain all the prejudices and slants that are around us. Early in the 1900s, many people were POSITIVE that women could not play instruments as well as men could. Most orchestras were primarily male (with perhaps a female harpist). Even when women auditioned, they were judged to be not as good. Then, for a fluke reason, a set of candidates were auditioned behind a screen, and a female won. Simply by bringing in screens to shield the player's identity during the testing period, many orchestras are now 50% female. No quotas to fill, no arguing with maestros over \"be more fair\". They set up the testing so only the music could be evaluated - and suddenly it was.This was a very encouraging message for me. It has to be taken along with the many other depressing messages here. Studies where they sent men and women, black and white, into car dealerships - with the individuals dressed almost identically and presenting the exact same educational background and home street - had the car salesmen treating the white men MUCH better than the black men in terms of price quoted. Even when the sales reps felt they were being fair. It was innate in the rep's \"sizing up\" of the person before them, how gullible they were. Other studies with words and photos show that even people who feel they are extremely fair in racial situations still have a built in bias. The studies are in the book, so you can take the tests yourself and see how you do.Still, the first step in overcoming an issue is to know it is out there. If your subconscious is having you make a snap decision about someone you meet, it's good to be aware that is going on and to take steps to fix it. I really wish the book had gone more into that phase. It's fine to list example after example of snap judgements and how they can be bad and good. But if you lay them out and say \"these exist and it's important to understand and guide them\" - the logical next step would be to talk about HOW to do those things. The book leaves you hanging.Maybe Malcolm has plans for a third book, and figures everyone who read book 2 would then be required to get book 3 ...",

            "There are many lessons to be taken from \"Blink.\" Among them:1. Our first impressions, taken in a split second, are often more accurate than lengthy analysis.2.

There's also the \"Warren Harding Syndrome,\" where these impressions can be totally wrong and overwhelm factual proofs much to the contrary.So, what gives?

            "Malcolm Gladwell started his career as a science writer, and went from lab to lab hearing countless amazing ideas. Eventually, he got rich writing about them.People hailed his first book \"The Tipping Point\" as a genius new way of looking at marketing...but it wasn't really, it was just a collection of interesting stories of products that suddenly took off, unified by a single catch-phrase.Blink is much like that book. It covers research about how people make snap decisions, informed and uninformed. But if you read it, don't expect a unifying theory from Gladwell. Instead, marvel at how--Observers of a single one-minute tape of a college professor can guess with startling accuracy what his student approval rating will be on end-of-semester surveys-Researchers can view a 7 1/2 minute videotape of a couple talking to each other about any subject at all, break their facial expressions and miniscule reactions to one another into an algorhythm, and predict how long they'll stay together with over 90% accuracy-A man gifted at reading facial expressions made a fortune at horse races just by getting a good look horses' faces before races.Gladwell might not have all the answers for why these things happen, but for me, the book served as a wonderful \"Science Digest\", and I've since bought and read other books that follow up the more interesting chapters in more detail.

Gladwell's likes to tell anecdotes, most of the pages are small stories that can be linked to some scientific study. Gladwell knows how to choose interesting stories and how to tell them in a kind of feel-good colorful way. If that is your cup of tea, you will not be disappointed. Just remember, the guy is a journalist, he does best what journalists usually are best at, expect to be entertained or to find some thoughts worth further investigation.",

I really like the way this guy's brain works. I have the same curiousity about things and I appreciate that Gladwell can articulate these interesting facts so well.",

            "Start with the introductory chapter, The Statue That Didn't Look Right. If the first section doesn't intrigue or remind you of some related experience in your own life, then this book probably won't make sense. It's comprised of case studies that are mercifully light on scientific jargon and relate well to experiences we all know.I've interacted with and worked under people who consistently misunderstood the power of intuitive decision making. It's easy and intellectually lazy to point to a chart, a graph, a spreadsheet, or an equation and say, \"This is why we should go this way.\" It takes guts and willpower to rely equally on your own life experience too. You won't always be right, but I believe, as this book does, that you'll be right much more often than you think.",
            "This was a good, short, read with a lot of interesting facts and insightful thoughts.",
            "I enjoyed M. Gladwell's insights, but I thought he didn't pull them together very well. My takeaway was useful and interesting insight into the way the mind works. Never a bad result, but I would've enjoyed more. Perhaps in the future he or others will put this insight to good use.",

            "The subject is good, not new. Many times experts can thin slice the available information can decide in a blink of a second . What qualities make them so good? or the other way around-what they missed?I think the experience that counts when thin slicing, making decisions in split seconds. But what about when the timing of the decision is not crucial? Law enforcement officers on patrol vs. Getty's KourosDoes the first impressions e.g. first decision, has impact when reconsidering the case again? How much bias do we have? Can the 'gut feeling' be changed?",
            "Blink by Malcolm Gladwell is a fresh and innovative way at looking at how people across a number of disciplines make decisions intuitively. Decisions that are made quickly are often looked at negatively because they lack the depth and research necessary to make what is perceived to be a well-informed decision. Gladwell makes the case that human intuition is a real and valuable tool that may be used along with other information gathering processes when finalizing decisions. Gladwell coins the term `thin slicing' and works to convince the reader that snap decisions are an effective decision making tool, that rapid cognition is at times faulty, and outlines how rapid cognition can be used effectively. The secret to `thin slicing' is in developing the ability to separate what information to pay attention to and what information to discard. The author points out that we are inundated with information and learning to filter that information is key to `thin slicing' successfully.Blink is an entertaining and easy to read book that is worth the short amount of time it will take to read. A little bit of knowledge may go a long way.",
            "The idea behind the book was very interesting up front and I was very much engaged for about the first 100-150 pages. What I started to realize as the book went on though is that the stories started to irritate the heck out of me. Gladwell probably spent 5-10% of the book providing useless background on what the people he interviewed looked like. This doesn't pertain to the key takeaways of the book and I found it to be a waste of my time to 'sort of' know what some guy he interviewed looked like. As I've seen noted in other reviews, this book is supposed to be a 'fun' and 'interesting' read more so than it is just to tell you the results of some analysis. This is likely why there's a lot of additional unnecessary background provided. This is also the reason I gave the book a solid 3 stars as opposed to only 2.All in all the ideas explored are interesting, but the stories just start to run together. It probably could have been boiled down into 50-100 pages instead of a couple hundred that it was.",

            "An exploration of what our brain does without us knowing we are doing it. Those fast decisions that help us cross the road when a car is coming up faster than you expected, and you dash out of the way before you know you are doing it. How do we make these decisions and can we control or do we want to control these fast judgements we make. Also looks at micro expressions that we perceive but don't know we see because of the speed at which they happen.I enjoyed listening to this book, it was read by the author which was enjoyable. The author is very sure of himself and all of the concepts he presents which can at times get a bit old. Some of the book wasn't as engaging as other parts but I liked the opening where snap judgments and science were compared. I'm sure there are also examples that can go the other way where science was better than intuition. I think what I liked most was the part of the book that talked about micro expressions and the expressions we make and how they communicate more to us than what is said. We learn these expressions before we learn to talk they are vital to our communication with others as well as the way we feel about others after we meet them. This is a book I would recommend but not to everyone. There are some people that will really dislike this book because of the discussion about thinking without knowing we are doing it. Those that need to be in charge every moment will not enjoy this book as it is letting the subconscious take over for a while. However, we may be able to use snap decisions and judgments to our advantage with some amount of practice at which point we may be in control of them more than we would know.",

You can go read them. This added so much value to the book for me, I have hours and hours of reading to do in followup to this wonderful gem.Without this book I don't know when I would've heard the fascinating story of the Millennium WarGames and General Van Riper. Or the study where gamblers' palms began to sweat when faced with a stacked deck - before they knew what was actually going on.I recommend this to anyone with an empty spot in their queue.",

Where Tipping point focused on the group dynamics of how things change, this book looks more at the personal realm. How people make \"unconscious\" decisions and judgments - very interesting stuff.Gladwell clearly has a wonderful intuition about how people operate, either in a group or individually. This book doesn't seem as much his passion as TP did, but it's still interesting.This would be a great airplane read.",
            "At the time of a blink, I know this book has a very misleading title but it fits today's Americans' need. It suggests that you don't need to think but you can make right decisions. However, intuition or hunch actually comes from years of experiences. But today's society, we need to get rich fast and enjoy life and we need a reason to make a judgement without real thinking. The result will be disasterous. Blink should not be a substitute of years of experiences and hard work.",
            "Jameson Luke Thottam: Discussion of BlinkMalcolm Gladwell had a runaway success with The Tipping Point a few years back - telling the story of how small changes in perception, marketing and even speech could make a significant impact upon outcomes. Kind of like a series of small causes cascading into a big effect. I really enjoyed his first book, so when Blink! was released and I was given it for free as part of a leadership training course I eagerly blazed through it the very next day on the way home. Big disappointment, rather like going to watch the Orchestra and all the musicians do is warm up and never play anything.Premise of Book...Jameson L. ThottamThe premise of the book is that we observe the world, or rather the events and people/things it contains, using a concept called thin-slicing. Meaning the process of snap, or gut-feel, decisions based upon very thin slices of data which we piece together into a whole by heuristically filling in the gaps. What you get out of this book is a better understanding of why your brain (and gut) process data in this manner when you are data or information deprived.Entertainment Value...Jameson ThottamThe book itself is mildly entertaining, and focuses around a dozen anecdotes - several of which are repeated ad nauseam throughout the book as self-proving facts. There is very little hard evidence or scientific fact to support Gladwell's conclusions - to the point where I felt some simple research could come up with a dozen counter-stories about bad decisions made due to \"thin-slicing\". However, that said, you cannot disprove or write-off his conclusions either - so keeping an open mind about the whole issue (or waiting for fatter slices of research?) is probably the best mindset to have after finishing the book.Most Interesting: Jameson L. ThottamThe most interesting snippet for me, not even a story, revolves around how in 1977 Dick Morris met the 31 year-old governor of Arkansas - a young fella named Bill Clinton. Morris explained how you could use peoples instantaneous gut reactions towards media to manipulate polls and change positions. And we all know where that got us.Final Summary: Jameson Luke ThottamThe interesting philosophical question is how often we unwittingly allow our gut reactions, thin-sliced or not, to influence how we react to people and events. Primal caveman had to decide pretty quickly whether it was fight or flight. In my job I can tell within 30 seconds whether one of our product demonstrations is going to hit the mark. At home I size up my teenage daughters boyfriend in less than 15 seconds. As a soccer coach I can watch a player from 80 yards and predict whether he/she will make or miss a penalty kick just by how they approach the ball.Blink will make you more conscious of when you are doing this, but not necessarily why.Jameson Thottam",

            "Blink is a book that simply proves that with years of practice and carefull analysis one can become so proficient in a particular field (or task) that after a while one becomes habituated to the point that it becomes intuative. The tennis pro, the general, the food tasters, the face psychologist, the marriage specialist, and the art historian know their field so well that it becomes second nature. They each have decades of practice and experience under their belt! So yes if you specialize by all means thin-slice but only in what you know!Big deal! Everyone knows this feeling in say learning to type, playing the piano, or mastering a tennis serve. There is a point that one stops thinking and peaking at the keyboard and it just becomes instinctual. The coke test, the blind music audition and the racial profiling incident prove that humans are distracted by bias and cannot be trusted with instinct. After all it is universal phenomenon that attactive people are given the benefit of the doubt since their attaction often disarms all reason.",
            "Just a long list of antedotes. Interesting for the first two seconds at best. Not useful reading.",
            "Blink is a look at all the various things scientists have discovered about how we think without knowing we're thinking. It particularly takes a long, hard look at why it is that people's first impressions so often conflict with either what careful analysis says or what people think they believe.Gladwell looks at a broad range of applications of these ideas. He looks at why, even though Pepsi wins the blind \"Pepsi Challenge,\" Coke continues to be the market leader. He investigates the psychology and split-second thinking that caused the death of an unarmed, fleeing immigrant from over 40 gunshots fired by NYPD officers. He looks at various factors that affect everything from standardized test scores to electing a President.Some have suggested that all Gladwell really tells us is that our first impressions are sometimes right and sometimes wrong. If after reading this book that's all you come away with, you have completely missed the point. The point is that whether those impressions are right or wrong is governed by a complex set of physiologic and experiential rules, and that we can do something about them. Cops can do things to make sure those first impressions don't result in an innocent death. And yes, you can learn to tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi when you drink a whole can, not just a sip.Gladwell is a writer for the New Yorker, and his writing style is very much like a bunch of magazine articles. But they are very GOOD magazine articles, and you want to read them all.",

            "I am disappointed in this book and feel it has been a waist of my time and money. Unfortunately the book is poorly (if any at all) researched and relies heavily on a number of public stories that are already known and extensively debated in public media, most importantly, without drawing any useful nor new conclusion. Most of the conclusions made in the book are either common sense and already well known so it really adds no value nor offers any useful thought.The book argues that the snap judgments (called thin slicing by him) made by experts are often closer to truth than snap judgment made by amateurs but then gives contradicting stories. It then talks about the fact that humans behave unexpectedly, often irrationally , often hastily in emergency situations (e.g. police arrests, assassinations). Both of these points are common sense that are familiar to all of us. We all have experienced these situations and know that they could be true. However, what we don't know much about is whether we can learn anything to perform or prepare better for these situations. The book offers absolutely no insight nor useful thought unfortunately.The stories are all over the map, he touches, race, police brutality, fake art, coke tasting etc etc with no clear direction nor conclusion and fails to encourage any useful thought at the least.",
            "This book gave me a keener awareness of how much information is communicated through facial expressions and first impressions, and the pragmatism of learning to read and interpret them better--but little on how to do that.The book would have been enormously better if written in less than a quarter of its length. The author drones on and on with example after example, often needlessly coming back to earlier ones. This lack of conciseness contributes to a general feeling of wondering what he's trying to say--and wondering if it's really clear in his own mind. On the one hand, we should be able to size people up in an instant, and on the other, that's how we perpetuate stereotypes. It's really not until the Afterword that the author acknowledges, more straightforwardly, that a balance is not easy to learn or achieve. Only experience over time can help us get a feel for it. In the end, we're left with no really practical advice to implement in our daily lives, beyond greater awareness.At one point, I got excited, thinking some practical advice was just around the bend. We are told there exists a training tape for learning facial micro-expressions. In 35 minutes of training, one can go from seeing none of such expressions to seeing them all! \"This is an accessible skill,\" we're told. And then, end of discussion. No mention of how WE can learn from this tape (rent it, buy it, go to a seminar, employ a consultant, read a synopsis?). This is the one thing the author has built us up to want to know, and we're left with a sort of \"Gotcha!\"I found the entire Afterword to be a lazy avoidance of revising the book before reprinting. All the points made there, including too much rehashing, should be incorporated into the book itself. Both here and in the body of the book, I always had the feeling the author was still thinking--not really sure exactly where he wanted to take this book. I especially did not appreciate the tediously elaborated military examples; talk about too much information! We did not need to know every little facet that the author mused while digesting his research and mountain of anecdotes.I don't feel the little I learned was worth the time spent hanging onto the book in the hope of finding its redemption.",
            "A few years ago, Malcolm Gladwell wrote a very entertaining book,The Tipping Point. He had a central thesis, and while it was plausible, I wasn't particularly convinced. BUT Gladwell is one of the best writers around at making psychology experiments and other social science studies fascinating and accessible, so the book was interesting and fun to read.That brings us to Blink, in which Gladwell seeks to demonstrate that our split-second first impressions can be incredibly insightful but that sometimes they are not, and how we can train ourselves to move toward the insightful side. The book is not particularly convincing (even less than Tipping) on the final aspect of the thesis that we can train ourselves to do better. But along the way, he presents fascinating cases of how these snap judgments can be right on (and why they're wrong when they are). The research isn't quite as interesting as in The Tipping Point, but I was still engrossed, entertained, and instructed.For an example of a psychology writer who also makes research fascinating and accessible (and funny) but is much more convincing on his hypothesis, read the excellentStumbling on Happiness, by Harvard psychology professor Dan Gilbert. He also reads the audiobook himself and does a fantastic job.Despite my critiques, this was still good enough that I'll read whatever Gladwell gives us next.",

I am able to pick up the little warning flags that are everywhere when you look. You have to have an open mind when you read this book, or you will not get anything out of it.",
            "Gladwell supplies you with extensive research and reliable sources to convince you of something you may have experienced already.It's called a hunch, a gut feeling maybe even intuition and what's more it can be learned! At least that's what the research Gladwell points us to suggests. Like The Tipping Point he brings experts together to compile the data - his fly-on-wall approach is convincing because he doesn't offer his own opinion so much as offering evidence found by others - it makes him a credible witness. You feel as if you're along for the ride as much as he is.The premise is convincing because anyone can relate to it, but he takes it step further and suggests one can learn how to have hunches and accurate ones too. It also suggests that our intuition may be buried and just needs some coaxing out.One is left fascinated by the human mind and wondering what junk or treasure has found its way in there and if you have used your mind to its full potential. The examples and case studies are interesting and relevant keeping you hooked and wanting to know more. You feel educated and equipped, perhaps even a little academic if you're learning this stuff for the first time.Most of it is explanation rather than discovery, but it is an entertaining explanation. Once again Gladwell found a unique thread to pull on - and the unraveling is worth the read.",
            "I can't say I was mesmerized by this book; however, it was an interesting read. What I found most interesting was the virtual wars between the Day Traders and the General Officers. In retrospect, had the Generals approached the virtual war games with open minds, instead of impenetrable egos, they may have been better equipped for the current war effort. Honestly, I think Blink allows most people an opportunity to flirt with the idea of intuition. In the end though, I think we're all simply a collection of personal experiences. And while some of those experiences prepare us for the unknown, some of them do not! And without those experiences, you may need more than simple intuition to reach a proper conclusion. While common sense goes a long way, and blinking may be fun, in the real world, I think it remains prudent to blink, but verify.",

These items are served to you in a series of diverse and instructive stories that could be useful to you in your everyday life.Most of the instruction is about positive things like how to better manage potential heart attack cases and fight wars more effectively. With regard to heart attacks, however, there was a negative story. It was about how sensation transference was used to market margarine.

            "This book is very engrossing, and although it is a relatively small book, it leaves a very broad impact.Essentially Gladwel talks about how first impressions are both spectacularly dead-on for experts practising their expertise, and spectacularly prejudiced for just about any layperson. Depressing as that sounds, it is a real oy to observe Gladwell's examples. They don't seem too interesitng, but boy are they ever.I'm very non-linear in thinking, so I enjoyed the affirmations from Gladwell's very interesting argument. He must have been driven nearly mad with passion for this topic, as the writing leaps off the page in the most glowing way!I heartily recommend this book.",

For me his unique style soars with his Five Point Inventory and longest Chapter: \"Paul Van Riper's Big Victory!\"This is especially true in \"Perils of Introspection\" followed by two Insight Puzzles. Becoming the assumed professor in, \"Primed For Action\" he describes a simple test to affect one's behavior! As Prison Chaplain, we sought ways to discover how we may affect Inmates' behavior while in prison. Later the author draws upon the Power of Imagination to picture the faces of Marilyn Monroe and Albert Einstein! Closely related is an appropriate story of Silvan Tompkins and Paul Ekman who became effective in reading the faces of Bill Clinton. They perceived him as Peck's Bad Boy, who wanted to be caught with his hand in the cookie-jar.Ironically they were right! This is one \"layered story\" as Fred Craddock, tops in his field of Preaching, teaches his Theology students about Parables. Chapter 5 \"Kenna's Dilemma\" gets unique stories on taking \"A Second Look at First Impressions.\" Added to President Clinton, we see the inside of Coca-Cola's contest with Pepsi, the testing of new products from Christian Brothers in, \"The Chair of Death,\" in foods, Automobiles as Ford's Edsel and Columia records signing of Kenna to produce his recording of the \"New Sacred Cow.\"Finally I came to his Conclusion: \"Listening with your Eyes\" and his involved story of the professional Trombonist, named Abbie Conant, I was really Hooked. Having scored with Bill Clinton and Dick Morris as the ideal political pollster, I looked at all of Gladwell's stories of reading person's faces and emotions in their responses-- Now I am convinced!A \"first impressionist\" has enough going for my five stars and more.

The Author uses some technical jargon but i did not have difficulty following him; however, i am in the medical field and am also very interested in medical, social, and psychological research.",
            "This book is even better than Tipping Point, Gladwell's prior book. It's got lots of factual stories, research and anecdotes that make it interesting. It'll surely make you think -- and think about how you're thinking. You'll have plenty of tidbits for dinner party conversations after you read this one.",
            "Everyday, we make a seemingly infinite amount of choices, conscious or unconscious, which have direct implications on our present and future well-being. The ability to make effective snap judgments, however, is not a gift that is bestowed upon all in equal shares.In \"blink,\" Malcolm Gladwell illustrates the decision-making process behind this phenomenon, explaining how human beings make those instant assessments and actions that can sometimes have all too serious consequences. Providing catchy case studies involving experts in everything from marketing to military strategy, Gladwell guides us along a journey of discovery as we come to better comprehend the importance (and mechanics) of the brain's role in processing information that it is abruptly presented with before formulating an immediate response ---all in the time span of milliseconds---.While there are fascinating points brought up in every chapter of \"blink,\" Gladwell ultimately emphasizes that an effective, brief assessment may be more valuable than long periods of analysis spent filling our minds with unnecessary bits of information that can do more harm than good. Often times, there isn't even the opportunity to analyze as we must react off of pure instinct and hope that we made the right decision afterwards.Read \"blink.\" It will change the way you think about thinking.",
            "When things go wrong in our lives including situations or events that we wish had not happened, whether it is at work or in our personal lives, the first instinct is to place the blame on someone else rather than focus on the possible solutions that may lie within us. This urge to judge the actions of others (sometimes for a split second and sometimes for much longer) often succumbs to the instinct of putting the blame on the visible differences including race or ethnicity or religious beliefs. For the majority of times we as mortal human beings don't even realize that we have hurt someone emotionally unless our cruel behavior is pointed out to us. And it is less often that our conscience turns inwards and holds itself accountable without being provoked. This initial emotion set forth at the blink of an eye is nothing short of ignorance which then leads to doubt and sometimes to fear and aggression. It is wise to have such an outlook: if things go bad in our lives we should first look inwards rather than being a slave to the \"blink\" instinct and if things are turning out for better then we should look outwards first. This way we can all keep our egos in check, prevent becoming a victim to the disease of conceit and also be able to provide our spiritual self with the right conditions for inculcating the values of compassion and love and forgiveness and do our part in making this world a better place to live in. At the same time if we make mistakes that have hurt others we should also take the opportunity to apologize for our callousness and sincerely hope that the apology will be accepted, just as is the intention right now. This brings closure for all people concerned and is the only way towards lasing peace and friendship. In contrast to common belief that for worldly success both in our careers and in personal lives we have to be cunning and ever suspicious of the intentions of others, one could argue just the opposite - things will happen the way they are intended to happen and carrying the burden of negative feelings towards others just makes it less likely that we will be in the best position to play the cards that we are dealt with in our lives such that we do what is right not only for ourselves but also for others.",

            "If you're an expert in the field(s) (or fancy yourself one - God knows there are a lot of you nowadays) discussed in this book, then, yes, I agree, you should stay away from it. I highly doubt that Blink says anything you aren't already an expert on (or fancy yourself an expert on) - there is a difference, btw.However, if you've never really considered, in any thoughtful or considered way, about the power of the gut feel, then I highly recommend this book.Don't get me wrong, this book is by no means the be all or end all on the topic. That having been said, it's a great (and easily readable) starting point from which to begin a systematic exploration of the topic, and for a title such as this (i.e. one that aims for a broader audience) that's all you can reasonably (or have a right to) expect.You want dense science and pages and pages of discussion concerning hypothesis, methodology and findings, read Scientific American or Nature. Leave us ordinary folks who're just looking for a basic appreciation of the topic alone and get off your scientific high horse danm it!",
            "Gladwell's capacity to find the story buried in arcane science journals and to then make it accessible, eminently useful and compelling to the general reader scores again. His wonderful first book \"The Tipping Point\" changed the language of marketing. \"Blink\" will change the world.",
            "Blink discusses and describes the value of intuitive thinking, but it explains that intuition is not ESP but the result of a vast amount of knowledge and experience properly ordered to facilitate an immediate \"still small voice\" (my quotes, not Gladwell's) of certainty that we should heed. Gladwell goes on to explain what happens when intuition seems to fail, and why, and how to avoid that. He uses as an example of failed intuition the tragic shooting by police of Amadou Diallou and the analysis is superb. His chapter of facial recognition and discerning exactly what someone is feeling or thinking from the briefest flickers of expression is worth the price of the book, which is a fascinating read superbly written. Never dull, informative, highly useful.",
            "I'll make this short. Blink is an interesting book that makes for a great read while waiting at the airport or the like. My finace has a phd in neurological psych. and has revealed to me how Gladwell misuses some contemporary psychological theory to prove his \"real-life\" illustrations. Given that his notions are not qualified, it takes a turn from being entertaining to a viable option to watching NASCAR. Hard to believe this one is so highly rated honestly.",
            "Gladwell writes well and the book is interesting. I read about half the book before I knew it! But I was jolted when Gladwell suddenly changed the focus of the book. In the first half of the book snap-judgments are good, then theyre suddenly bad. \"What's up with that?\" I asked myself.Well, what's up is people are programmed or brain-washed, if you will, to react however they react to specific stimuli. And how they react depends on their fund of experience with specific stimuli, or the messages society drums into their skulls. Phobias and aversion reactions and addictions are the extreme forms of such mental activity. Like peeing on an electric fence. One experience is enough. No need for college or a seminar or a cost-benefit analysis. And no need to suffer guilt for your prejudice against all electric fences. So you save money on counseling, too.Gladwell can improve the organization of the book by keeping the first half, which explains the benefits of snap-judgments, then address the issue of how to correct faulty snap-judgment decision making. That is, provide some helpful hints about how to reset the triggers to include new and better information.I was gonna buy the book and am mighty happy I didnt.",
            "After having thoroughly enjoyed Gladwell's 'The Tipping Point', I eagerly awaited for this one to come out. I must say that I was quite disappointed. Whereas his first book captivated the reader with engaging ideas of many social phenomenons, this book seemed to lack an identity and purpose.An extreme viewpoint would be to say that this book was written primarily to ride the wave of the success of the first one. 'Blink' lacks the ingenuity and wit that Gladwell displayed in his first book.",
            "This book is a typical case of an author who finds a good idea but doesn't figure out how to deliver it. I have been working in Strategic Marketing for over 15 years and was very excited to receive and read Blink. I thought his last book was brilliant but don't waste your money on this one. Go buy yourself a drink instead. In a blink, without thinking. What a dissapointment this read is. Mr. Gladwell chooses all kinds of well known incidents, examples and dissasters to prove his ''Blink concept''. From the New Coke flop(come on Malcolm)to a Pentagon war games excercice. The general idea of the book is: Keep a balance between the emotional and rational parts of your brain when you make a decision. But that doesn't warrant a 276 page book and absolutely not being in the top 10 on the Amazon best seller list. I want to have breakfast now....Blink...Blink... Should I or should I not? My stomach says yes. C'ya.",
            "I heard this was the great book of our time, so I had to rush out to buy it. Sucker. The only good thing I can say is the cover is catchy. The contents scare me. The author's claims are pseudoscience at its worst. Do none of us remember the laws of \"cause and effect?\" They are totally twisted here. Then twisted back. Then twisted back again. My biggest complaint is that the author needs to look up the Websters definition of \"subconscious\", a word he throws out on virtually every page. He seems to repeatedly confuse the concept of \"subconscious\" with \"experience.\" Just because someone experienced in a given field can process information faster than they can verbally articulate it, doesn't mean the information is \"subconscious.\" Conversely, just because someone lacks the education to articulate which ingredients make them prefer one strawberry jam versus another, doesn't mean the preference is subconscious. It means it's sensory. That's like saying that you can't know the sky is blue if you don't know why it's blue. Or worse, like saying if you were never taught the word \"blue\", that your eyes see it unconsciously. There are many books and magazines that, using layman's terms, give much more rigorous and justifiable theories about some of the new findings correlating brain activity and psychological studies. I've even seen many of the studies this author cites in other books. I will say the studies themselves are fun to read about and ponder independently of the author's own interpretation. It's curious that in the Afterword section added to my 2007 edition, the author seems to revise the premise of the entire book. It should be the foreword. More importantly, why do so many think this book is good? It's strongest value is in showing how sorely lacking too many are in the basic priciples of logical thinking and scientific analysis.",
            "For someone who is writing a book about the ability to suscinctly understand things without any elaboration, this author drags on his points like none I've ever seen. He puts 5 word concepts into 20 word runon sentences, just like this one, that contain extra phrases and words that really dont quite necessarily need to exist in the particular sentences when you could, if you wanted to, make them significantly smaller and much less burdensome in length. If you enjoyed reading that last sentence, you will love this book. I got about halfway through and it was a struggle to continue. I actually signed on to Amazon.com tonight purely to see if anyone else was as miserable as myself, reading this book, and I was glad to see so many were. Blink is brilliant in one sense: He put a lot of psychology into getting his book sold. He puts it in airports, he made a ghostly looking coolly designed cover, and he put enthralling teaser material on the inside of the cover. That's pretty much the only thing I was impressed by with this book. Im sure he's a nice guy but .. zzzz.",
            "The book begins with an enticing account of the power of intuition, i.e., of the \"adaptive unconscious\" to make decisions more reliably than linear, left-brain evaluation of data. The reader expects a guide to accessing this subliminal power. Instead, the author gives a series of overlong, padded accounts of cases where instant perception trumped careful data gathering, balanced by accounts of cases in which careful data gathering trumped instant perception.The reader tries in vain to see a solid connection between the episodes recounted - from \"thin-slicing\" of videotaped encounters between married couples to the benefits of a trained sensory apparatus in evaluating food and wine to the dangers to innocent bystanders when police officers jump to stereotyped conclusions about people and places. In the end, the reader is no wiser about the means of mining the \"adaptive unconscious\" than before picking up the book. The book can be summarized in two sentences: \"Sometimes the right brain is more reliable than the left brain. Sometimes the left brain is more reliable than the right brain.\"The author has provided some endnotes with useful references for the reader wanting to learn something substantive about the subjects hinted at in \"Blink.\"",
            "The reason it doesn't always work is because it isn't about guessing, it's about listening. Often when it's our first impression in a situation, we don't realize that we didn't conjure up the answer. It simply came with no mental prodding. That is, it didn't come from the mind, but through it. No doubt, that's a hard one to swallow for someone who's rigidly geared to left-brain thinking. But this is what I have come to know is the truth, and that enlightenment did not come from a science book...or \"logic.\" :)When we scramble for the answer, we are conjuring up one out of fear. Things we create from fear are generally inaccurate...and it also creates really lousy supposed \"art,\" but that's another point... When we put less thought and more \"feel\" into it, we're more likely to be accurate. When all you have is a split second, \"feel\" is all you've got. Hence, in those situations, we don't have time to muddy up the answer with our fearful thoughts, the answer will come and there's no time to analyze it and change it to a more \"logical\" answer.But if we have a few seconds or moments to think, infuse our fear and supposed logic into it, then it may seem that it was our first impression, but it wasn't. We didn't \"hear\" the first impression, because we had just enough time to jump in and be all logical, hee, hee...We've been given the keys in biblical text, \"be still and know.\" When the mind is racing with fear, it isn't still, we aren't calm. That true first impression comes before we have time to introduce that element that generally gums up the works (fear).When you do have time, get still (mind and body) and listen, don't conjure or guess, just listen. When you don't have time (split-second situations), no time to question or analyze, not even an instant for fearful guessing...when there's no question that it came without thought. Feel it, trust it, go! :) I'd trust that in a heartbeat over long, laborious, fearful thinking.Ultimately, lighten your grip on them there science books and know that there's a lot more power in your \"heart\" than you seem to realize. Your right brain/heart will serve you well. Balance it with what you seem to believe is the totality of your power (left brain), and you'll see...",

            "I get this underlining impression that \"Blink\" is designed to help decrease discrimination against black people in America. It seems to be the author's focal point. Since Obama, this ideal is very popular, and Malcolm is coming in at right time. Sure, it get's into \"thin slicing theory\" but it is heavily armed for negative notions against African Americans from White (Caucasian) people.But then again, the author Malcolm Gladwell is half Black and half White, so this makes sense.It's an easy read, not a trivial subject, and racism is a great starting point to get his ideas across!Peace",
            "I enjoyed the book and found the ideas about rapid cognition fascinating and mostly convincing. However, Gladwell makes a serious misstatement of fact in the \"First Back Bay trade paperback edition, April 2007\", on pages 274 and 275 of the Afterword. Here Gladwell writes about the greater rate at which blacks in the US are arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for crimes than whites. He says \"I'm not talking here about racial differences in overall crime rates. What I am talking about is this: if, for example, a white man and a black man are charged with the identical drug related crime, the black man is far more likely than the white man to go to jail.\" But he then goes on to quote statistics that he says come from an unnamed report from Human Rights Watch: \"In ten states black men are sent to state prison on drug charges at rates that are 26 to 57 times greater than those of white men in the same state.\" (no reference was provided). Appalled by this huge disparity I went on line to Human Rights Watch and found a report dating from 2008 that contains much of the same data, and seems to be a later version of the document Gladwell quotes (Targeting Blacks, Drug Law Enforcement and Race in the US, 2008 Human Rights Watch). The report only claims that the rate of imprisonment for blacks, as compared for whites, when charged with the same crime is about 3 times higher. HRW reports that the \"26 to 57 times\" figures that Gladwell gives actually is mostly a result of \"racial differences in overall crime rates\". The higher rates of imprisonment and are so much because blacks are arrested and charged at much higher rates than whites. For these statistics, see FBI crime statistics [...]. These statistics show that a similar number of crimes are committed by black and white Americans. But since the number of white Americans is around 4 times that of black Americans, this means that the crime rate for blacks must be higher, to yield the same number of crimes. Since there appear to be more whites than blacks that use drugs, The Human Rights Watch document speculates that the higher arrest rate for blacks is due to several factors: that law enforcement is more focused in cities, where blacks are concentrated (due HRW says, to racial bias), and more blacks who sell drugs do so in open air markets where they are more likely to get arrested than whites (who may sell among themselves, but in more private settings). Although the Human Rights Watch provides ample evidence of racial bias, it is not anywhere near the \"26 to 57 times\" rate of bias that Gladwell misuses. He should fix this error.Let me add here that I think the Human Rights Watch is mostly right in its assertion that the focus on imprisoning people for drug law violations has a hugely racially disparate effect and is unjustly and wastefully consigning large proportions of African Americans to ruined lives since they have to waste time in prison, then go through life with the stigma of having a prison record. Of all the arrests of black Americans, only about 16 % are for drug law violations however, so fixing the drug war problem will not fix the incarceration problem I think the war on drugs is more of a war on the poor, and especially a war on poor blacks. But Gladwell should still get his facts straight.",
            "Most of the times I sit down to read books that are supposed to be holding a breakthrough idea or concept, I come away extremely disappointed and frustrated. Again, Blink was one of those books. It started with an interesting few pages and a plausible sequence of events that might equate to something new and original, but the book quickly fell into the trap of most of these types of concepts. It expanded into areas that didn't meet the criterion of the initial premise and then attempted to stretch the concept to include these additional storylines.Blink is an attempt to show that humans have conscious and unconscious trains of thought. And that some people have such a strong ability to make correct decisions without really thinking about it, that this unconscious decision making is a completely separate line of reasoning done by the brain in lightning fashion. Gladwell starts with a statue that the Getty museum purchased. Only a handful of people had misgivings about the authenticity of the statue. And these people made the decision based on a \"hunch\". Now that is interesting. However, what we never find out is whether these people always are negative on a purchase like this knowing that it is unlikely to be authentic. Or, that these people made this type of quick decision 10 times and were wrong 9 other times. Instead, they are placed on a pedestal and a new concept is arranged around this theory.He then uses an example of a tennis coach that can quickly point out when a player is going to hit into a double fault. Whoa!! Could it be as simple as this: a tennis coach that seen a double fault eighteen gazillion times and by watching someone perform in a certain way, it triggers his normal memory decisioning tree? But since he has it basically imprinted on this brain, he can do the inner calculations in nanoseconds? Now the big disclaimer by Gladwell is that this coach can't really describe why he knows. Is that really important?But then Gladwell moves to showing how using this \"Blink-like\" decisioning process can lead to bad decisions; especially when it comes to prejudices that we might have picked up over the years. Gladwell never shows how to distinguish good from bad \"blink\" reasoning, so this reader is confused as to what this part of the book had to do with the first chapter.And then there is a chapter that includes a singer that should have made it based on the early thoughts of experts, but the singer didn't make it. What is that supposed to prove? That the recording house didn't do their job?And where does Pepsi's \"taste test\" come into the equation? This is a ridiculous example of cognitive or even subconscious decisioning - this is purely a reflex response based on tongue taste receptors.Again, we have an author that wrote one best seller and is now trying to pawn off an additional \"new\" concept on the public without any evidence at all. Any author attempting to show something new would use real scientific method and would attempt to level the other parameters and hold them constant. This author does none of that. He just attempts to fit the round plug into the square hole and hope that no one is really watching too closely. Don't waste your money.",
            "I am not sure why this is a book. Anecdotes, anecdots, anecdotes.... Is there anything here that is actually researched and studied? A hundred stories does not a coherent theory make. This is typical Gladwell, big statements, good stories, poorly thought through thesis, bold assertions with no proof, keep cheerily going on, one book to the next. Good for killing time on a beach, but why would I pay for this advice?",
            "As the 976th reviewer of this book, there is not much new to add here. I will say it was an enjoyable read. My perception was that I really didn't know what Gladwell was attempting to say. Is \"thinking without thinking\" good or bad? More to the point, he presents information that supports both sides of the argument but no conclusions. Use it, don't use it, useful characteristic not useful? Answer: sometimes, but when is not evident. Additionally, Gladwell throws a lot of white noise into the mix. Things that don't seem to have relevance to what he is presenting. For example, how too much information can sometimes interfere with decision making or how stressful situations make you \"mind blind\". Though the anecdotes were interesting, neither is about \"thinking without thinking\". Gladwell implies that \"thinking without thinking\" has characteristics of being instinctual, then says instincts can be cultivated through experiences, then provides information that instincts are frequently wrong, then provides examples of how critical thinking can be wrong; so I am left with the same question? What was the intent of the book? I don't necessarily need a roadmap, but it would have been nice to know the destination.",
            "From what I have read of negative reviews here- most people who don't like the book don't like it because they disagree with it. The idea itself is quite controversial, and I'm not sure I fully agree with Gladwell, but the manner in which he presents it is entertaining and enjoyable to read. His anecdotes do show some examples where \"thin slicing\" can come quite in handy, but he doesn't say this should overrule thought out processes- his point is that sometimes we can \"thin slice\" and be right, when overanalyzing leads to the wrong conclusion.The book is very well written and great for anyone who likes to have something to talk about. I also recommend this book to anyone who likes the book \"Freakonomics\" because Gladwell uses a similar anecdotal writing stye to Levitt and Dubner.You shouldn't let your doubts keep you from reading this book- you don't have to agree with Gladwell just because you read it. It's fun read even if you disagree.",
            "Gladwell has a nice writing style and has created a simple analysis. Many of the examples and theories resonate with me -- you usually make an initial/gut decision that is correct but you overanalyze it with the desire for more information. I can apply his theory to my life. I've started to make quick decisions and not dug into deeper analysis tools. It has also been beneficial in creating peacefulness when making decisions, taking tests or being involved in stressful situations. My results have improved and I've created a sense of peace with my decisions.The book is simple and short. I read it over a few days but would not consider this a \"keeper\" to put on my bookshelf. I borrowed it from the library and promptly returned it after completion. It would be a good $10 softback purchase but not worth the hardback price.",
            "\"Man's most tragic folly is his need to find himself starting from a rational basis\"\"You can only organize the masses of people around that which can be made obvious to alot of people\"Blink is a thoroughly enjoyable and informative read which reveals astounding insights about the human perceptive process.The two above quotes, however, embody1) Why it is an extremely important book and2) Why it will likely go unappreciated or underappreciated by many who come across it.Contrary to our first impressions and some of Malcolm Gladwell's own claims, \"Blink\" is mainly about what we DON\"T know.The book deals with very complex and very easily misunderstood subject matter. In dissecting rapid cognition (he prefers this term to intuition), and perception, Gladwell uses his typically engaging and eclectic style. He employs seemingly disparate studies, anectodes, and reasoning in the service of deconstructing common ways of thinking about first impressions. For those who disapprove of the eclectic tendency of this book, I challenge you to read and think more carefully about HOW the various characters and stories in the book are connected. There is much to be gleaned from this approach.While Blink does arrive at some general and soft conclusions, Gladwell resists coming to simplistic conclusions just to satisfy academia, corporate america, or lazy readers. (The former two of whom celebrated the tipping point). I find the book most helpful as a paradigm shifter that introduces the reader to ideas about perception and rapid cognition and identifies related areas of study. As I mentioned before, corporate America will not find applications for this book as easily as with The Tipping Point. Academia will not find succinct declarations of new truths to show off with. While these are not problems for me, I'm sure there will be consequences to face from both of these.In the interest of balance, I did have some problems with Gladwell's usage of the term \"thin slicing\" He describes this highly complex mathematical process early in the book and then uses it so liberally throughout that it leads the reader to over generalize and consequently misunderstand the term. I also had mixed feelings about his treatment of the Diallo murder. The chapter entitled \"Seven Seconds in the Bronx\" was powerful, but I felt like there was some forced closure as he attempted to apply his theories here.Neither of these issues hampered my enjoyment of this book, however, and I highly recommend it. I'm also interested in discussion of it with critics and fans alike.- Chenjerai Kumanyika",
            "When I am falling asleep, my eyes start to blink rapidly... then I am out! While I admit, that that book does have some interesting information, all of the tangeable thoughts could have been written into a magazine article. There are too many repititions of the same story - seemingly just to fill the 288 pages with very little new information added. I remember writing similar essays in school; you kow, repeat information just to fill up the 10 page requirement.I am amazed that the editor and publisher of this book though it was well written enough to print.",
            "The first one-third of this book had me recommending it to others because it confirmed my own belief in the importance of acting upon our first impressions and relying on our subconsicous to help us make good decisions. The second third started to lose me, however, as the author got bogged down in examples of how those snap or \"blink\" decisions may be incorrect due to prejudices and biased information stored in our subconsicous minds, or because we lack sufficient knowledge and experience to make reliable snap decisions. The final third of the book left me wondering what was the author's fundamental premise for writing the book since he seemed to contradict much of what came before. He gave examples of \"thin slicing\" decisions but failed to mention how this may relate to the 80/20 Principle or Rule. In fact, much of the book seems to be about pushing the 80/20 rule to an extreme, yet there is no reference to the rule at all. Nevertheless, I found many of the numerous examples that were presented to be entertaining,interesting and worth remembering. There are several examples and statistics that I will probably refer to in some of the courses that I teach. And the bottom line is that although the author lost me in the details, the book encouraged me to trust my instincts and to apply thin slicing decision making even more than I already do. For a more coherent presentation of the concept and power of thin slicing decisions I recommend \"The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Success by Achieving More with Less\" by Richard Koch.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell is now a household name, thanks to \"The Tipping Point,\" his smash bestseller about how ideas spread. His new book, \"Blink,\" already a bestseller, is about \"the power of thinking without thinking.\" Are you the type of person who analyzes situations every which way before coming to a decision? Or do you tend to make up your mind based on your intuition and instincts? Gladwell addresses both of these tendencies and explains why careful analysis sometimes helps us succeed but, in other circumstances, may cause us to fall flat on our faces.As he did in \"The Tipping Point,\" Gladwell brings a host of real life examples to illustrate his ideas. He discusses a variety of subjects, such as speed dating, the art of military strategy, cola tasting, and police behavior. The author's strength lies in his ability to tell engrossing anecdotes and relate them to the themes that he wants to impart to the reader. If you observe a married couple bickering, can you make an accurate prediction about whether or not they will eventually divorce? Can a doctor's bedside manner affect the number of malpractice suits brought against him? Gladwell addresses these and other questions using clear and compelling prose, humor, and thought-provoking psychological insight.How can this book help the average person navigate his life more effectively? \"Blink\" may help us prevent our subconscious biases from adversely affecting our judgment. In addition, it may educate us about the advantages and the pitfalls of making decisions based on first impressions. This is an entertaining study of problem solving, and that's an area in which everyone can learn something valuable.",
            "After his bestseller [...]The Tipping Point what has [...]Malcolm Gladwell done for an encore? Written another blend of captivating stories and easy doses of social psychology, that - like its predecessor - will no doubt become a favourite topic at middle class dinner parties over coming months.His new book is called [...]Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, and it's the subtitle that explains his latest thesis. It is about \"the power of knowing ...in the first two seconds...\" In short, first impressions count. But often they can also mislead.Gladwell dubs the ability in \"those fleeting moments\" to make rapid judgements based on limited information `thin slicing', and some people are remarkably good at it. He maintains it should be taken seriously; it is not a magical gift but \"an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves\". Of course this is not really `thinking without thinking'. It's the kind of thinking that observant people can form after years, sometimes decades, of experience and study in a specific field (greek antiquities, say, or food tasting). A more accurate subtitle would have been `the power of observation and accumulated experience', but I guess that didn't test well in the focus groups.Gladwell is always a good read, so I doubt too many readers will mind when they realise his latest book lacks a strong, original thesis like [...]The Tipping Point. The weaker central argument does, however, expose a mechanistic style that can grate. For example chapter four opens with the following sentence: \"Paul Van Riper is tall and lean with a gleaming dome and wire-rimmed glasses.\" We soon learn he served as a marine in Vietnam, was nicknamed `Rip' by his troops, had \"a crisp voice, low to middle tones\", was confident, strict, fair, a student of war, was \"always very aggressive\" - but in a nice way - and he lead \"from the front\". I guess the author never read [...]Strunk & White and its famous dictum.Most readers will forgive the occasional overripe paragraph because the stories are apt and well told. Like his first book, this one provides readers with fascinating office or dinner party titbits. And for those in the United States, you may still have time to catch up on the tail end of his [...]book tour.",
            "If you are looking for a self-help book to give you an \"edge\", don't buy Blink.If you are looking for a Grand Unified Theory of \"thin-slicing\", don't buy \"Blink\"If you are expecting some sort of simple, linear, single-facted description of subconscious human cognition, don't buy \"Blink\"However, if you are interested in a readable (or listenable, I own the audiobook version) introduction to the concepts surrounding rapid cognition (i.e. sometimes less data and quicker decision-making is better than more data and exhaustive analysis), then I believe you'll enjoy this book and learn much from it.Just for fun, I decided to look over the reviews starting with the lowest ratings. The complaints about this book seem to fall into a few main categories:1) It doesn't provide an overarching theory to tie together all of the examples......This is a true statement. However, the field that Gladwell is trying to cover ranges from face-reading to margarine marketing to military strategy to inner-city hospital triage to picking out good strawberry jam. While they all share commonalities, it's probably fair to say that there currently is NO grand theory that ties it all together.2) Gladwell contradicts himself.....Yes, because rapid cognition doesn't always yield superior results. He goes into some of the reasons why this is so. Again, the topic is too multi-faceted to come up with a statement like \"Use rapid cognition except in circumstance X\". It just isn't that cut-and-dried.3) Gladwell doesn't explain how to get better at rapid cognition....No he doesn't, because the solutions for improving rapid cognition are highly dependent upon the individual situation. It can be as complex as spending years watching videotape or tasting food. Or, it can be as simple as basing a heart attack diagnosis on only 4 symptoms. Or closing your eyes when listening to a leader trying to persuade you, so that you don't fall victim to \"Tall Person Bias\".4) This stuff is common sense.....NO IT ISN'T. If this stuff was common sense, we would all use rapid cognition appropriately and not fall victim to its shortcomings. Then, fake Kouri would not fool museum curators, the average height of Fortune 500 CEOs would match the population average, and people would buy competing brandies based on taste, not on packaging. There are numerous examples in the book of our \"common sense\" being at odds with reality. One could say that fact is one of the main themes of the book.5) Gladwell's work is not academically rigorous.....No, it isn't. The book is not aimed at people with PhDs in neuroscience. It's aimed at a general audience and I believe Gladwell's intent is to spur interest in the topic so that readers will investigate further on their own.6) Gladwell's examples/anecdotes are repetitive....I have to concede that critics have a point. I think Gladwell repeats too much because he's trying to illustrate commonalities between different situations, even if he doesn't have a unifying explanation for those commonalities.7) Gladwell cover's too much ground/doesn't give enough detail for each example....Again, the critics have a point. Perhaps Gladwell should have focused on fewer examples. In his defense, I think part of his enthusiasm for the topic is that rapid cognition appears in so many areas of decision -making. In his attempt to demonstrate its breadth, he fails to get enough depth. Given that Gladwell was writing for a general audience, he probably couldn't do both.In summary, the content of the book is worthy of 5 stars. Take off a half-star each for Gladwell's repetitiveness and questionable choice on the breadth/depth balance.",
            "the power of thinking without thinking... we always regret when our snap decisions went wrong. so basically i'm buying this book in hope to improve my ability to make right decisions within a very short period of time therefore reduce errors. the book tells you how your snap decisions are made, a lot of fun stories related to blink. but disappointly, after you finish all of those interesting-at-first-annoying-after-a-while stories, the book is over, done, no more... so if you are looking for a fun read, buy this book; if you wanna improve your snap decison making skills like i did, reading this book is just waste of time.",
            "As some other reviewers mentioned before, this book doesn't really explain how to \"train\" your brain for intuition-based \"thinking without thinking\". In my opinion the reason for this is that the author is so entrench in his believe that intuition always tramps statistical analysis that he does not realize that the only way your brain can use intuition productively is by collecting enormous amount of statistical data. You will never develop right \"hunches\" by looking at the chess board for 5 seconds like grand masters do UNLESS you play as many games as an average grand master. And then you would have trained your brain for hunches in chess, but it will not help you to have intuition about authenticity of greek statues. I belive book's premise that somehow you can \"train\" your brain to be intuitive in general and not in a specific field is false.Also the book fails to mention that while some types of problems lend themselves to hunch-based solutions (simple and static like chess or whether to cross a busy street) others do not (stock market or insurance).Much more comprehensive (AND consize) analysis of this subject can be found in Michael Mauboussin's \"Mauboussin on strategy\" letters that he publishes for free on the web on the regular basis.",
            "If are hoping to gain insight about \"rapid cognition,\" how we arrive at snap judgements or gut feelings you'll be disappointed. The book is almost entirely devoted to describing instances of snap judgements that either assisted or led people astray in their decision making. No great theories on how the mind does this or why.The startling conclusions in the book are that we make snap judgements and that sometimes they help us and other times they hurt us. I was expecting something more like Steven Pinker's work in \"How the Mind Works\" or his other books. This is nothing like those.Don't waste your time and money. Don't even bother checking it out at the library.",
            "Blink is about making an inital judgement and going with it. The author uses many different historical examples to illustrate his theory. I found a lot of the material to be very intuitive, but it was interesting to read a good sound philosphy and basis behind what most of us do as habit.Basically this book looks at the reason why we make our decisions, and I enjoyed it. I would have liked for him to have delved into the subject a little more and gotten into the deeper psychology of the matter.Overall, a good read.",
            "Blink's main idea is that with limited information people are able to make good decisions. That being said I found it both ironic and irritating that the author was so long winded in convincing the reader of this insight. In fact this insight isn't original psychologists have known for awhile that intuition is nothing more than really fast thinking. The more expertise one has in an area the quicker they are to make a good decision. Consider the x-ray technician takes one look at an x-ray and knows exactly what is broken and how bad. The patient has been staring at the x-ray and doesn't understand what to look for. The x-ray technican has looked at thousands and knows exactly what to look for.This book isn't worth the time it takes to read it. An article is about all it takes to present the information contained. It promises to be groundbreaking but instead the book should be buried.",
            "This book was, by far, the most redundant thing I have ever read. It would have made for an interesting article in a newspaper or magazine; however, the book itself is way too long and repetitious for its topic. I am very disappointed that I spent money on this item. Too bad my \"thin slicing\" is apparently terrible and could not help me on this purchase.",
            "Blink is a very long look at rapid cognition, the science of intuition. The problem with this book is it's about 200 pages too long and I felt like I was reading a magazine article that wouldn't stop - every chapter was a reiteration of the preceding chapter. This book in a nutshell is as follows:1. We each have an innate, rapid, largely unconscious sense of reasoning; i.e., intuition.2. We could greatly benefit by listening to this intuition.3. This intuition can also hold our unconscious prejudices.4. Our rapid cognition can often be wrong and get us in trouble.Personally I found this all very interesting - just not 320 pages worth of interesting.",
            "I'd like to echo the thoughts of other reviewers who've said Blink is merely a collection of anecdotes on how snap judgments can help us or harm us. Though interesting reads, these stories don't teach us anything we don't know already about intuition - Sometimes your instincts hit the bullseye and sometimes they fall completely off target. How do we know which instincts to trust? I was hoping Gladwell would provide an answer to this question, but found he really didn't.",
            "Challenges many of the accepted mantras of the professional world (\"More data leads to better decisions\"). An edgy and entertaining book.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell investigates the art and science of intuititive thinking. He does enough to give the reader an insight into all the facets of life that \"blink\" influences: society, organization, business; and how those influences can impact the world positively or negatively relative to the desired consequences. However, he fails to explore the questions of how thin-slicing works, how it can be developed, how it can be proliferated, and how it can inter-work with analytical thinking.The author gives in to the temptation of following the formula for making non-fiction books successful in the mainstream: catchy title + idiot-proof tagline + simplicity of message (no more than one concept) + repetitive use of phrases to make the message stick + ... And in the process, the book becomes more of a collection of essays and news reports compiled into a unifying theme of the powerful concept of \"blink\". Gladwell's first bookThe Tipping Pointsuffered the same symptom and now Blink. the book has lost its value due to the bastardization and this good book could have been great, had it not. Forgive me for agonizing about what could have been.I was skeptical when picking this book but I should say that the book exceeded my expectations. To Gladwell's credit, this book does not seem to be an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Tipping Point. The author's arguments and opinions are passionate. It's a good read and convinces the reader about the integral role of \"blink\" in human decision making, social behavior, opinions & biases, and psychology. A good way to spend your 4 hours.",
            "Blink is a very well-written collection of studies, stories and observations that helps readers begin to understand the power of our unconscious minds.Every day we make thousands of unconscious judgments and decisions that shape our present and future lives, and affect our relationships -- both personal and professional. The more insight we gain into our deeply-ingrained beliefs and impressions, and the more we learn to gauge and respond to our physiological cues (to which we are largely estranged as a culture), the better-equipped we will be to steer our lives in a direction that brings us true individual success, happiness and spiritual fufillment.Some of the later chapters in the book lost me a bit (possibly just because it was about military matters that are a bit over my head), but overall, reading this book was well worth my time.I highly recommend Blink to anyone who desires to better understand human nature and the power of the multi-faceted human brain. This book reminds me why I was a Psychology major and, more importantly, reminds me how much there is to know and see and do in this life. Immerse yourself and enjoy it.",
            "The book is part of a new genre - the short \"sum of articles\" around a concept. (Think Freakonomics for the most successful of the genre) In these essays, Malcom Gladwell covers why we make decisions so quickly, why they're frequently right, and how to work around the poor decisions we can find ourselves in.It's definitely not high science or a textbook, but it's good pop science. It'll only take a night or two to learn about our mind's ability to short-circuit our supposedly rational decisions.",
            "For a book essentially about good intuition and snap decisions, \"Blink\" is a little full of itself. The self-importance starts right on the cover: \"Blink\" bills itself as an illustration of the \"power of thinking without thinking.\" Although it provides some insights for understanding how, in only a glance, certain professionals (art curators, military strategists, gourmet food tasters, etc.) develop a \"gut feeling\" before weighing every conceivable strand of evidence, \"Blink\" offers nothing to improve your own intuition and decision making skills.One of the concepts Gladwell explores is \"thin-slicing,\" the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behavior based on very narrow slices of experience. You might not conceive that a 15-minute videotape of a mundane conversation with your spouse has anything particularly relevant to say about your love life. According to Gladwell and his narration about psychologist John Gottman, however, you'd be wrong. Gottman videotaped hundreds of volunteer couples discussing a point of contention in their marriage: money, sex, pets, etc. Then he broke down behavioral responses to these discussions into groups and represented them in a mathematical form, leading to...boom!...a prediction as to whether that marriage would last.Sounds like a stretch? Gottman followed up to see whether his calculations had made the right prediction. They sure had--with an astonishing 90 percent success rate. As a result of his experiments, Gottman reputedly could predict the future of a couple only by overhearing snippets of their conversation at a restaurant. The take-away lesson from this story may sound pedestrian, but practice makes perfect. The author is to be credited for at least drumming up some off-the-beaten-track examples to buttress his message.Additionally, Gottman's story highlights another idea in \"Blink\": that less is more and overloading decision-makers with information may often hamper their reasoning. If the scientist had asked his subjects about the state of their marriage, they might lie or feel awkward or--more importantly--they may be unaware of the truth. Instead, the author claims that by thin-slicing, Gottman found a much quicker path to the truth.Similarly, the example of Chicago's Cook County ER reinforces this idea in another context: the importance of a snap diagnosis of heart attacks to save lives. There, a doctor identified three major risk factors based on which a recommended treatment was to be followed. His algorithm, although more simplified than experts in the medical community felt comfortable with, guessed right more than 95 percent of the time compared to 75-89 percent when more laborious testing was conducted. This time out, Gladwell concludes that truly successful decision making lies in the balance between deliberate and instinctive thinking: while deliberate thinking and extensive experiments work well when we have the luxury of time, rapid cognition and the ability to thin-slice are called for when frugality matters.Next, there is the story of a man gifted at reading facial expressions who made a fortune at horse races just by getting a good look at horses' faces before races. The ability to absorb and detect minute changes in facial expressions, Gladwell suggests, allows us to essentially \"read minds.\" There are several chapters on how reliable we can be in predicting behavior with very little information.Then there is the tale of Amado Diallo, an immigrant, who was shot 41 times by policemen wrongfully suspecting him of criminal behavior on the doorsteps of his own house in the Bronx. Given that the police failed to read Diallo's facial expressions and body language, the case study appears to confirm the theory that people are guided by stereotypes and prejudices when making split-second decisions. Moreover, Gladwell goes further to suggest that stressful situations lead to a temporary condition of autism that hinders our ability to interpret others' actions and intentions.Such tales are entertaining--and certainly make for a fast read--but they come across as mere anecdotes, cherry-picked to bring a little liveliness to what might otherwise be humdrum common sense. The book teems with references to scientific studies, as if we need science to understand the importance of reading faces to understand people's true motivations and feelings.The numerous--and seemingly incoherent--illustrations discussed by Gladwell all relate to snap decision-making skills - the kind that help managers react swiftly in high-pressure situations and anticipate people's actions by carefully observing their faces. At the end of the book, the author devotes a chapter to the problem of stereotypes, which, he implies, may deprive us from controlling what surfaces from our unconscious. But do they? Gladwell maintains that we do have control over the environment in which rapid cognition takes place and thus we can steer our decisions away from preconceived notions. Thus, the power of thin-slicing works only in combination with a cognitive realization of all the stereotypes we have grown up with - which contradicts his thesis in the very subtitle of \"Blink\".",
            "I am a physician and I have had the privilege of being trained by Dr Reilly at the Cook County Hospital (the chest pain evaluation part of the book).I just want to impress upon the point that Dr Reilly did not teach us that too much information is misleading. What he taught us is to assess the quality of the information and then to use only that information which is of good quality.In simple terms, there are some parts of the history, the physical exam, EKG and labs which strongly rule things in or rule things out. It is that kind of information which is useful. Other pieces of information which do not lead you strongly one way or the other are merely distractions.",
            "This is probably the best book (rather I listened to the unabridged audio version) on RC I have come across.I am regularly talking to clients about rapid cognition or rather gut feelings because they are so important and so many people reject their own and live to regret it. Malcolm Gladwell takes a laymans approach to a technical subject and hits bulls eye after bulls eye.If you want to know why you sometimes make brilliant snap decisions and how valuable that ability can be, read this book.",
            "One of the main reasons, I think, that Gladwell is such a popular author in a field like business psychology is that he's a terrific storyteller. This study of the way our minds create first impressions, the way we \"thin-slice\" in just a few seconds, or even fractions of a second, to draw conclusions about people and situations, especially in times of stress, is thoroughly fascinating, largely because of the case studies he describes in making his point. For instance, a thoroughly trained, deeply experienced art historian can look at a painting or statue and know almost instantly whether it's a fake or not -- even if he can't describe *how* he knows. It's this ability that has enabled the species to survive. But it also sometimes gets in the way of rational, preferred behavior. An autistic, for another example, lacks this ability to \"read minds\" from instant, authomatic analysis of facial expressions, a skill learned in infancy, and is dependent on explanations by others. Gladwell also gives us the real history behind the Pepsi Challenge and how the Coca Cola Company managed to fail so badly with New Coke. (It was confusion between the \"sip test\" vs. the \"drink the whole can test.\") And he examines the reasons for the killing of Amadou Diallo by a car full of New York City cops. (Not innate racism so much as complete failure of the cops' training.) And, finally, he describes in considerable detail \"Millenium Challenge,\" the vastly expensive war game conducted in 2002, how and why the Blue Team (representing the U.S.) was savaged by a retired Marine Corps general heading the Red Team -- and how the results were were then refused and perverted by the Bush Pentagon for its own ends in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq. This is the author's second book and he continues to both fascinate and educate.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's \"Blink\" is an enjoyable read - I breezed right through it and found it to be a book that I would look forward to opening up. Gladwell does a masterful job of weaving together 3 or more points at the same time without losing the reader and frequently leaving me amazed at his organizational skills.That being said, does Blink get the job done? Does he prove his thesis about \"The power of thinking without thinking\"? Yes and no. He starts out with a great example of a supposed piece of Greek art that may or may not be a real piece of ancient art. His thesis plays out well there, with his comments on why certain musicians make it and others don't and his comments on police and the need to think quickly are all strong.His arguments about Paul Van Riper and the war game he won, however, were more about the power of de-centralized decision-making versus centralized planning, in my opinion. Nonetheless, it's a good read and well worth your time.",
            "I think this is a must read, especially for those that enjoy psychology and understanding human behavior, human interaction and the reason we do many of the things the way we do. I think it is also a great self improvement tool.This book really makes you think. I loved the different examples that are provided from situations in the lives of people, from various walks of life, ranging from an Army commander to a food taster!The author does a great job of evaluating all sides of the topic and provides frequent reference to earlier instances.Overall, a very nice read, that I hope to keep doing time and again",
            "Blink has changed the way I think about decision-making. From an early age we are discouraged from making \"snap\" decisions, we are not taught to develop our natural instincts. While some snap decisions can be mistakes, if we tune up our \"gut\" feelings, it may be possible to make excellent decisions based on limited information and time constraints. Gladwell calls this \"thin-slicing\" and make no mistake about it - it is a SKILL that must be cultivated.In a nutshell, thin-slicing is defined as \"the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behaviors based on very narrow slices of experience.\" The most fascinating part to me is just that - as a human being, we do have this capability. If you're like me, you do a significant amount of second-guessing, and that is where the trouble starts. We have the instincts inside of us, our brains are powerful tools - more powerful than the most sophisticated computer, they tell us, right? So why do we not trust ourselves?To be honest, the book started out great with some fascinating examples of thin-slicing and adaptive unconscious (the part of the brain that leaps to conclusions and is capable of making very quick decisions based on very little information). Towards the end I felt like it was just the same information over and over again. I got the gist of it all in the first couple of chapters. Many reviewers here indicated that it could have been an article instead of a book, but I understand why it is a book: Books are taken seriously, are reviewed, are cited, and are easy to find after publication.Blink is worth the read, even if you only skim a few parts, if only to get you thinking differently about the way we make decisions.",
            "Gladwell is a writer for the New Yorker so it's not surprising that this entire book could have been summed up in an article. Gladwell basically says we should follow our instinct and concludes at the end that we shouldn't be judgemental at the same time. Wow, what insight! He gives some interesting examples which are what I enjoyed. It's a quick read though so you won't waste too much time even though the book is a little drawn out.",
            "Gladwell's \"Blink\", a fantastic follow up to \"the Tipping Point\", reveals what most of us have known since the dawn of Creation, but ignore none the less. Trust your gut. We can all know, in the blink of an eye, what's \"really going on\" in a situation or circumstance - if we'll take the time to be receptive to what's happening around us. This isn't New Age drivel, this is using your brain. He would have gotten 5 stars out of me, but the one missing component was the \"how to blink for dummies\" manual at the end of the book. Malcolm defines the problem with conviction and shares the solution with wit, but never really puts a finger on exactly how you can put it to work in your life. Then again, that's the beauty of it - it's there for you to find, you just need to use your brain a little more to get it. Great for business and for life, Blink is worth the read.",
            "Gladwell does great in 1st and 2nd gears, however his premise never really gets rolling. He fails to bring the whole idea together of any formula for the idea of thin slicing. He merely says it exists, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. In another place, he says with rare profundity that it tends to work more with monumental decisions and less with incidental decisions, but even then he's rather vague about it.The whole concept is highly fascinating, though all we get from this book are bits and pieces. A book needs a measure of coagulation.One example of fuzzy reasoning in the book was the part about how a man's height makes people treat them differently to a significant degree. Gladwell cites a survey of CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, indicating that 58% of them are six feet or taller, while among the general U.S. population, only 14% are six feet or taller. He concludes that boards of directors are biased toward the tall. One problem here that Gladwell overlooks is that a more likely explanation for the phenomenon is that tall people feel more confident about themselves and assert themselves more, as well as other genetic considerations. But Gladwell's answer to everything is discrimination, which is a short-sighted approach.I did gain valuable insight from the incidents and studies mentioned. It's just that there's a critical chapter missing, namely a conclusive conclusion. So now how do we apply these ideas, Mr. Gladwell? I sincerely hope this is not a cliffhanger for the next book.In a study this promising, I want a discussion that gets past 2nd gear. This reminds me of a classroom lecture where the instructor leaves out significant parts and gives the class an assignment to figure out the answers for themselves. Not having the luxury of raising our hands and having things clarified, it's incumbent upon Mr. Gladwell to give a more specified and in-depth outline for us to follow. I came away feeling very incomplete.",
            "Some interesting observations: but Gladwell could have been clearer about highlighting the fact that what he is talking about is really trained intuition. That is, experts trained by years of study - or even scientifically determined heuristics - can make snap decisions, not just anyone.",
            "The main reason I bought this book was because of the promise of teaching you how to improve upon utilizing your gut instinct. As I progressed through the book, my gut instict was telling me that wasn't going to happen, and it was right. It was just a series of studies and examples of where instinct has worked and where it hasn't. I didn't read one paragraph where the author instructs on how to improve upon or develop your unconscious decision-making. The stories are interesting but the book was a big disappointment to me.",
            "It breaks my heart to write a negative review of a Malcolm Gladwell work. Tipping Point was incredibly easy to read and provided useful discussion and thinking points, however the lessons of Blink (if there are any) are difficult to apply and certainly impossible to substantiate, even after you plough through this work (which becomes tedious toward the end). Blink will not have anywhere near the impact that Tipping Point did (and, from here on in, comparisons to Tipping Point will for Gladwell be inevitable). The book is well-written and focused. I still ponder some of the examples give n in the book weeks later -- but a few of the stronger examples are painfully short on detail and their bond to the central theme (which, unfortunately, is obvious to anyone capable of having purchased the book) is fairly loose.Sadly, Blink reads as though Gladwell had less time, and less inspiration, in its composition. I have no doubt he'll make up for this on his next work.",
            "It's an interesting topic to ponder: how do we know things in an instant? In fact this topic has been pondered for millennia and studied extensively for the last fifty years. There are wonderful philosophical, religious, and scientific works on this topic. The knowledge and insights available are both broad and deep. This particular book, Blink, The Power of Thinking without Thinking, does not add anything new or insightful.While reading this book I felt as if I were at a business reception and found myself engaged in a one sided conversation with a nice fellow who went on way too long about how the mind works. My mind works. And what my mind told me was find a waiter, get another drink, and excuse myself. Never ending anecdotes, no matter how well intended, embellish a point, but do not prove it or provide a deeper understanding. That's the way Blink is. I cannot recommend it because it sheds no new light on an old subject and there are better works on the mind and cognition.",
            "Blink is worth the read, but only for the paper back price. It's very easy to follow and a quick page-turner. However, it's a bit shallow.Blink's basic premises is: intuition is real, it's been scientifically proven, and you too can learn to use it. Most people feel there is something more to the \"gut feel\" or the \"intuition\" a person has. This show's that's true. The proof's Gladwell outlines are fascinating but the point is made too many times. However, I was disappointed to finish the book and not learn anything about honing one's own Thin Slicing capabilities.Read Blink, but borrow it from a friend or buy the paperback used.",
            "I had occasion to drive to Austin from East Texas (4 hours, one way) and thought an audio book on CD might be a good way to break up what is a fairly monotonous drive. I thought I might like a science book, but after reading some reviews of the \"professor\" series and hearing that they were sleep inducing, I decided that may not be a good idea for a boring drive. I found \"Blink\" in audio at the bookstore and became intrigued. Like most scientists, I am a bit skeptical of pyschology in general, but I am also open minded. Gladwell's book proved to be perfect for the drive, almost like having an articulate and educated companion along for the ride--albeit the conversation is one-sided.I thoroughly enjoyed the book in this venue. I would not have had the same opinion of the written version. The only reason that I don't give him more stars is that the cover is slightly misleading--the power of thinking without thinking--made me hope that he was going to offer a way to empower the subconscious. Anyone who has ever taken a test thinks about that \"initial choice\". So why doesn't that always work? In other words, shouldn't you be able to walk in to an exam, read the question, let your subconscious work for a second or two, write the answer down and move to the next question? Gladwell doesn't offer us anything here and he can't, he is a science writer, not a scientist. He can only report what he has researched. Excellent reporting, but no meat other than that. Get the audio book and listen on a long trip--but don't bother buying the paper.",
            "Virtually every supposedly analytical utterance is just an assertion with little logical basis. One could easily have interpreted the presented facts in any of a dozen other ways, drawing some other type of lesson. Basically, the author lays out dozens of anecdotes and then makes highly dubious remarks about decisions that were made. But it simply doesn't hang together in any coherent way. This is way, way over-hyped.",
            "I read this book as an extra credit assignment for my Social Psychology class. As I was reading it, I did indeed find it to be well-written; the anecdotes were fascinating, and the basic overall idea about the value of intuition and \"gut-feeling\" sounded pretty interesting on paper. But, after I finished, and I had time for the ideas to sink in a bit more, I began to question the value of what was presented. I presented these concerns at the subsequent class discussion, and I'll present them again here.To start the criticisms off on a light note, I can't help but point out a certain amusing irony I noticed all throughout my reading of Gladwell's books. One of the fundamental ideas that Gladwell ends up presenting is that a lot of our information-deducing today is based off of information overload that gives too much attention to all sorts of potentially irrelevant details, at the expense of concentrating on a select few key factors. Sounds fair enough, right? Well, ironically enough, these ideas are often accompanied by very long-winded, hit-you-over-the-head-with-detail descriptions of the places he goes to and the people he meets in his examples/anecdotes (ex: \"the JFCOM building is situated in such and such place, and appears to be a regular nondescript building, but inside houses...\" or \"he had a runner's build and a peculiar accent...\"). As I was reading these, I found myself chuckling to myself and saying \"Okay, yeah, that's interesting and well-written. But didn't you just say that we shouldn't be drowning ourselves in details?\" Gladwell's a journalist by trade, so I guess it's to be expected that he writes so much, but it's still a little ironic, given the subject matter.Moving on, there are greater concerns to be addressed, one of the paramount ones being how and when, exactly, the seemingly ground-breaking ideas Gladwell presents can be practically applied. For example, the first couple of chapters discuss anecdotes where experts are able to use their \"gut feelings\" to their advantage (ex: expert art historians identify a statue as a fake as soon as they first see it), and essentially uses these anecdotes as an attempt to show just how cool and unique these new ideas of \"thin-slicing\" information are. However, he also goes on to show how snap judgments can be bad, such as in cases of racial prejudice. So snap judgments can be good, but they can also be bad. Okay, that's true enough. But that begs the question: HOW can you tell when they're good or bad? When the cops who shot Amadou Diallo ended up shooting an unarmed man who, at first glance and according to a select few details (someone standing around outside in the middle of the night in a rough NYC neighborhood), appeared to be a threat, how, exactly, was their snap judgment different or flawed? How can you differentiate between good and bad snap judgments? Unfortunately, Gladwell doesn't really elaborate on this, except to say in the prejudice chapter \"don't let prejudices get to you\" or \"associate minorities with something positive in your mind,\" which really isn't that big of a help. A bit more elaboration would have been very useful.The other main complaint has to do with Gladwell's reliance on experts and the successful judgments they make as examples of how intuition can be so helpful. I once read Richard Posner's negative review of \"Blink,\" and one of the things he came up with that I found to be a good point was: \"the contrast between intuitive and articulate thinking is overdrawn: it ignores the fact that deliberative procedures can become unconscious simply by becoming habitual, without thereby being intuitive in the sense of pre-verbal or emotional.\" In other words, experts are able to make such quick judgments because they have spent so many years making the same logical deductions over the years, that they eventually become second nature to them.Gladwell does go on, in one part, to laud the value of expertise and experience in improving an individual's ability to make good judgments. But that's just it: so many of the examples he gives deal with experts, people who have so much practical knowledge of their fields that they know how to do their jobs by heart. Which begs another question: how does the layperson know what to do? Most people aren't like the veteran police officer who knew not to shoot the teenage gang member, or like the food tasters who can specifically identify different aspects of taste. How, then, is the average person supposed to take advantage of all of these ideas of intuition and quick judments, when (by Gladwell's own admission, no less!) experience, gained gradually over time, counts for so much in making them successful?And finally, the key aspect that I found. So much has been said about the \"intuition vs. deliberate logic\" debate that this book supposedly inspires. And yet, when you think about it, do the examples Gladwell present really do much to promote \"intuition\" and fly in the face of cold hard logic? I think not. Consider, for example, the anecdote in the book about Lee Goldman's algorithm for detecting heart attacks, using only three or for symptoms. Is this really an example of intuition? Hardly. Goldman found these factors through a long process of research and observation. And applying these factors nevertheless still employs logical observation to detect these physical symptoms; the difference is, it's a more efficient form of observation that doesn't get bogged down in details. It's the same thing with the Millenium Challenge and Marine Corps general/military strategist Paul Van Riper. Did Van Riper defeat the behemoth opposing team in the war game using intuition? No. He employed commonsense, yet fundamentally logical, solutions. When the opposing team had satellites to intercept military messages, Van Riper used bike couriers to deliver messages that weren't detected by the technology. He used surprise attacks and blind-sides to work around the opposing team's bloated intelligence systems, and therefore scored a decisive victory.And yet it seems like Gladwell is trying to pass these examples off as examples of the triumph of gut feelings. In reality, I think that anecdotes like these do better to form a different conclusion: it is not logic that's the problem. It's the KIND of logic that is often employed; that which gets bloated by irrelevant details. Instead, Goldman and Van Riper's experiences seem to imply that what is needed is a more efficient form of logic, which uses common sense and remains focused on the key issues at hand, but which are nevertheless conscious and deliberate forms of reason. I think that's what the case is largely made for via these examples. For all I know, this could have been Gladwell's intention, but so much of the book is spent trying to sell the idea of \"intuition\" and \"quick judgments\" that this really isn't clear.And that, fundamentally, is the book's major problem. I think it's trying more to \"sell\" a seemingly ground-breaking idea of new ways to think smarter, not harder, rather than making sure that these arguments hold up under scrutiny. Personally, a few simple, critical questions (\"How can you tell when your instincts are right or wrong?\" \"How can the layperson do this?\" \"Is that really intuition, or is it still logic?\") were enough for me to think, \"huh. It's interesting on paper, but I don't know if it's really right.\" Like I said in my title, it's kind of lacking in overall substance. In the end, I suppose I would recommend that people borrow the book and see what they think from there, but I would at the same time advise them to approach it with a relatively quizzical eye, and not to accept everything at face value.",
            "I was very impressed with this book. I think the basic concept that comes through is that we as people have an innate ability to discern that goes beyond normal logic and analysis. The author presents some interesting studies that show how different people have honed that ability in specific areas to be able to make decisions in what may be called the Blink of an eye. It's that quick. The author often refers to this ability as thin-slicing.I think what many reviewers here may have missed because of there own expectations or what may even be an example that fits in with some of the studies discussed in the book is a psychological background that includes the understanding of the buffers and filters that are instilled in every individual as they grow up and are exposed to the stresses of life.The topic of the book isn't just about going with your gut feeling as I read one of the reviews here mention. Nor is it as simple as trusting your instincts. We all have polluted reading instruments that distort our perceptions. As the author explains in one study, gut reaction can lead to someone's death when we are psychologically distorted ourselves.The trick seems to be in cleansing our reading apparatus in such contexts where we may need this ability to operate on our behalf. Some of the studies where this ability was shown to manifest required people to train themselves by identifying what the actual pertinent data was in the given situation and after repeated exposure to the situations, discerning correctly became second nature. In other studies Gladwell shows that strangers can correctly discern many things about people they do not know by simply looking at the environment in which they live.It is discouraging to me to realize how messed up we are psychologically, how all the buffers, filters, programs we have built in ourselves psychologically stifles this ability to thin slice.It am encouraged to read about all the examples and studies that show we have this ability within us and the possibility that perhaps it can be regained and that we can once again listen to what we already know in some sense.",
            "I picked up this book after picking one of his articles \"The Naked Face\" from _The New Yorker_ for my Freshman Comp students to read, which he more or less cannibalized in one of the chapters in this book. Yup, he plagiarized himself. You bet I'm going to raise that issue with my students.Secondly, I didn't have a problem with his 'easy peasy' science as with the semi-socialist and contradictory conclusions about the whole 'thin slice' phenomenon. In the penultimate chapter, he discusses the case of one Abbie Conant, who had to fight a horrendous legal battle to keep her position in an orchestra, all because the evil musicians made 'snap judgments' about her ability to play based on her gender--associating musicality with masculinity. She got the job by auditioning from behind a screen. Wonderful. Yet, in the final chapter, where Gladwell is supposed to bring all of these disparate threads together, he suggests, I'm NOT kidding, that we have criminal defendants stand behind a screen as well, or be entirely removed from the courtroom, so that the judge can sentence them 'blind'. This is comparing apples to fish. When hiring a musician, one looks for musical ability. When sentencing, I submit it's not beyond the purview of the bench to take into account such matters as 'does the defendant appear remorseful?' 'does he or she have future prospects of improvement?' 'does he or she have a history of recidivist behavior?' and other factors (beyond skin color) that weigh into a judge's decision. Those factors *can* be assessed, as Gladwell himself argues, by 'thin slicing'. Why is observing how a defendant behaves in the courtroom during the trial NOT acceptable thin slicing, when you ARE judging his character and ability to socially interact? What he suggests is sentencing that a computer could do via a pretty simple algorithm. We've TRIED mandatory sentencing and 'three strikes' policies, which attempt to remove race or class bias from the hands of judges (whom we apparently don't trust), and they didn't work. Gladwell doesn't in the least suggest how his idea is really any different, or how it would be any more successful: perhaps, if race is the issue, the issue is NOT with the judges but with the cops or district attorneys who decide to arrest or prosecute in the first case? So, what? Everyone's supposed to walk around with a bag over their heads so the (racist) cops can't see what color they are? Crikey!Meanwhile, he doesn't address at all one of the more pressing, though smaller, perhaps, in scale, interests of the average reader: how can *I* use this in my life? Not just 'buy cars on impulse, but debate about breakfast cereals', but in interpersonal interactions? That's where most of his anecdotes focussed, but most of his prescriptions were not. That sort of disconnect between ambitious social reform and interpersonal evidence is always suspect, because it leaves out the intermediate step: the small group.That being said, it's an easy read, and Gladwell is an entertaining stylist. This is a book I'd recommend for plane trips or beach reading: enough to keep you interested, and intrigued, yet nothing that is going to significantly alter your paradigm.",
            "I like Malcolm Gladwell's prose style. It is elegant and smooth. It is a perfect balance to the seemingly ordinary cases he cites to pursue his thesis about how \"thinking\" is a lot more complicated than we believe, and how we can sharpen and control our powers of observation.Good examples in the book are the instant awareness of \"something wrong\" with an allegedly genuine Greek sculpture later revealed to be a fake. The ability to instantly sense deviation from norms through experience and training is critical. Another example, among several others, is the study of facial expression as the key to understanding the feelings within, and how the face, if studied carefully, reveals what the person may be trying to conceal. Again, it is based on empirical study, and very focused attention, rather than intuition in the classical sense.It is a mistake to hastily conclude that Gladwell is talking about \"intuition\" in the sense of arriving at conclusions based on inexplicable factors that are beyond the empirical, sensory way of gathering information. Some critics of Gladwell seem to miss this point and confuse one for the other. One who reads Blink will see he is talking about how the mind can instantaneously \"know\" the truth of a specific inquiry long before the rational processes of formal scientific method have a chance to confirm the rapid conclusion.Over the period of gathering a lot of experience through focused attention, one can develop the ability to very quickly, based on a \"thin slice\" of new information, arrive at a sound judgment about meanings, behavior patterns, and other insights. He gives examples of how the trained observer can almost instantly \"know\" the wider truths that many others could not discern through far more study of the same \"subject.\"Perhaps what Gladwell is talking about could be called \"holographic\" knowledge, in that it is based on the theory that, like a hologram, one can see the whole of it through examining only a small portion that is emblematic of the whole. It is an accelerated form of pattern recognition, available to all who are willing to learn the patterns in a focused manner.It is also not easy to explain how one knows what one knows in a \"blink\" of time. To rationally explain it can be confouding in itself. Still, it is part of who we are, how the human mind works.Gladwell also shows how we can have our awareness and ability to accurately perceive things as they are, distorted by attention to other factors that obscure, confirm prejudices, and lead to erroneous conclusions. His example at the end of the book of the female trombone player being chosen by a German \"traditional\" orchestra through a screened audition is very telling. It captures the essence of the book.I doubt that Gladwell was concerned with giving readers a comprehensive, academic study of the phenomena of learning, focused attention, and \"adaptive subconscious\" development. His endnotes are good for further study. By giving us this short, easy to read book, he introduces a new way of knowing to the general reader. In doing so, Gladwell has made a valuable contribution.",
            "Gladwell is an entertaining writer, I'll give him that. I did enjoy reading this book. However, it's not about the substance for him. He is basically reaching for something we all sorta kinda know about, but is not at all scientific or expository. The best book on doing without doing, thinking without thinking, intuition, the sense of self, self-knowledge, and the mecahnics behind all of this, is, by far, God Without Religion by Sankara Saranam. Not only does it deliver what readers likely expect from a book like Gladwell's, but it does in the context of world-shaking issues. If you want to know what thought is, not to mention supermental knowledge, look elsewhere.",
            "\"Blink : The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\" by Malcolm Gladwell is an interesting book that explores the mechanics of thinking without thinking. The author calls it thin-slicing, to refer to the small size of the sample data when compared to the population from which it is drawn, especially in terms of the extremely small time window for decision making.The book is a good introduction to Psychology since Malcolm explores the science behind the process of thinking and intuition. He brings out, with the help of several examples, the positive and negative aspects of this thin-slicing. The positive aspects are of course very important when one needs to decide quickly and correctly. The negative aspects bring out the situations when prejudices and biases, prior conditioning etc., play an important role. As brought out by the author, negative first impressions can be and should be countered and tempered by prior practice to reduce the chance of error.I picked up the book to browse through as is my habit. I found it so interesting that I had to read it through in the course of a few days (because I am employed full time and so can read only in the evenings and nights). I was very much impressed by the indepth analysis of the dynamics of our thinking process. I liked most of the examples that the author picked up to put his point across. The examples are many and are interesting. Except for the highly technical words used in describing the anatomy of facial expressions, the writing is easy to read and to follow. The concepts come through very clearly and the author makes a convincing case for his hypothesis.Whether you need to make the sort of snap judgements that Malcolm describes or not, reading the book will certainly increase the clarity of the dynamics of thinking.I would certainly recommend this book if you are interested in the mecahnics of thinking.The book is printed well and the editing is quite good. The errors are very few. A good value for the money.",
            "Gladwell's latest is a breezy, enjoyable read that unfortunately left me wondering about the whole point of the book.The discussions of the way we intuit, or thin-slice things, can be fascinating. However, he makes it clear at other times that this can be a poor approach. I've got no problem with contradiction, but a little further explanation would have been nice.This felt like a book that could have been much longer, and one that could have gone deeper, instead of providing plenty of light, anecdotal incidents to prove a point. While it's one that you'll probably enjoy, it just doesn't leave you with much in the end.",
            "The reviews are mixed regarding this book. I liked it. I found it similar to MIND WIDE OPEN and THE TIPPING POINT. It is a book about first impressions and how much accurate or inaccurate information can be relayed in the blink of an eye. Unfortunately, I don't know how much we really understand first impressions and that \"blink\" moment. Therefore, the author is left discussing research and impressions on what first impressions are all about. There is little concrete information on the process itself. In other words, I felt like I had a series of descriptions of what it was like but no complete image (much like the blind men describing the elephant).",
            "I am slightly disappointed with this book. As a reader who really enjoyed Gladwell's previous book 'The Tipping Point' I had looked forward to his new book. In some respects the book is like I hoped it would be: the topic choice is very interesting, the writing style is smooth and entertaining, the many anecdotes are very enjoyable and there are some interesting descriptions of experiments. Anyone should be able to pick up some interesting stories, points, facts and views from this book.What disappoints me though is that the book does not really deliver what it promises. In the introduction chapter the author promises to answer three questions: 1) Can Blink-descisions be as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately? 2) When should we trust our instincts and when should we be wary of them? 3) (how) can our snap judgments and first impressions be educated and controlled? Although the many stories in the book certainly imply clues to answers to these questions, explicit answers to these three questions are not clearly given. In fact, when I finished reading I felt like the author had forgotten to include a concluding and integrating chapter in which he would explicitly answer these questions and summarize and conclude. But that chapter is really missing. Due to that the book really lacks clarity.Although this book is disappointing I won't stop following Gladwell's writings. His previous book was better than this one and I'll bet his next one will be better too.",
            "In Blink, Gladwell reveals how we can become superior decision makers, in our homes, our workplaces, and in daily life. Delving into revolutionary discoveries in neurology and psychology, he reveals how we craft decisions, and why some individuals are so profoundly better at it than most of us. His thesis, which he fully supports with facts, not speculation, is that distinction between good decision-making and bad has little to do with how much information we can process rapidly, but on the particular minutiae on which we focus. The \"blink\" in the title is comes from Gladwell's surprising conclusion that what we think of as decisions made in the blink of an eye are much more intricate than we usually presuppose. After reading this, you will never again \"think about thinking\" in the same old way.",
            "Gladwell is an outstanding writer and storyteller and his new book offers interesting stories and food for thought. However, it falls far short of his blockbuster The Tipping Point.Blink is about the intuitive response, the pattern recognition that happens almost instantaneously, and allows us to recognize faces and complex, non-verbal communication. Gladwell seldom uses the term intuition, referring to this phenomenon as the adaptive unconscious. He offers a series of fascinating stories focusing on the process he calls \"thin-slicing,\" the process of recognizing and making a decision based on incredibly small amounts of data. One example shows people accurately predicting which married couples will stay together based on only two seconds of videotape.He offers the premise that decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately. However, he acknowledges that this same process can often result in bad decisions and offers little guidance on how to make the process more reliable.",
            "This book has become widely popular, even to the point where stores were selling out of copies before the holidays. People have been flocking to this title with anxious anticipation. My pre-read mentality was slightly different because of what I thought about Gladwell's other book, The Tipping Point, but I will go into more depth on that later.I cannot explain why my expectations were what they were, but whatever the reason(s) behind them, they were not met. I happened to believe that this book, as different from the author's other, might actually be about skills and techniques to practice in an effort to better one's self in the art of making snap decisions. That is the premise of the book; ideas around making educated decisions quickly rather than after exhaustive research efforts.As I began the book I became increasingly afraid it would simply be a collection of anecdotes about people who are able to make smart decisions in the blink of an eye. You have to figure that no one would buy a book that was just stories about people who are better at what they do than you are at what you do, right? ...Right? Or maybe such a book would fly off the shelves. Weird.Where I looked to find examples of what other people have done in their lives to better prepare themselves to make decisions I found story after story about experts in respective fields. These people have not trained in some strange Zen custom to be able to focus their mind on the correct decision; they have simply spent countless hours at their craft. The only reason these people can make snap decisions and eliminate the time otherwise spent on researching the situation is because they devoted the earlier portion of their lives to that research.The idea of the book, from how I interpreted it may be summed up as this: If you want to be able to decrease the amount of time it takes you to make a decision, whether it be in your business life, your personal life, or your spiritual life, all you need to do is know your product. Take time with each and every aspect. With time you will by default become so experienced with most situations that making decisions will be relatively routine.The subjects of Gladwell's examples are the tops in their industries because they have become experts in what they do...over time. And there is the key point. You, too, can make snap decisions if you become knowledgeable on the topic. But that takes time.The issue from The Tipping Point that I found had reincarnated itself in Blink was depth. Malcolm Gladwell writes, in both books, about what I consider to be good ideas. He has my attention. I desire to read what he has to say on the subjects. The level of his research is never questioned. I can tell that he is very thorough as he gathers the information for his books. He falls short, however, in analysis. The ideas are great, and the information is there, but at the end of both books I felt wanting for more expansion. Maybe it was a flaw in my reading that I felt some topics could have used more elaboration, but then again maybe you will agree.I sound as if I am down on the book, and for how it contrasted with my expectations of it, I am. I am not, however, completely dissatisfied with it in its entirety. I found the details of how people have carved out their particular niche very fascinating. The research done by the author was impressive. The variety of examples he brought together under the umbrella of decision making was what interested me most. If only knowing the many different categories that food experts use to rate mayonnaise could help me in my life's pursuit...As a short book that can be read rather quickly, even by slow readers such as myself, I still think Blink is worth reading if only from the perspective of the curious. I believe the book has more to offer than that, but it is a good starting point in your motivation to read.",
            "While reading this book, I was explaining some of Gladwell's ideas to a friend, and he made a joke. He said, \"If first impressions are so important, why not just read the first page?\" The joke more or less ruined the rest of the book for me, because, in essence, that's really what Gladwell is suggesting; that there is little importance in giving things a thorough examination.We live in a country where we just had a national election in which not one critical issue was discussed, where reality tv shows sweep the ratings, where book sales plummet yearly and technology makes immediacy ever more marketable, even while our children's learning is outpaced by the educational systems in third world nations, and I can't help the feeling that a book that encourages more shallowness is exactly what we don't need.Most of the support for his argument about the value of snap decisions is pretty obvious. Who doesn't put a lot of faith in their own intuition? On the other hand, Gladwell's descriptions of where snap decisions went wrong, specifically his study of Warren Harding, makes for great reading. But the fact that Gladwell included it more or less disproved his own thesis. I wish that had been the subject of the book, but I'm sure that wouldn't have been as marketable.All in all, a well-written and polished work that was too vague to make a powerful impression.",
            "Having spent a reasonable portion of my career trying to teach people to take a more objective view of things, I was a bit concerned this very-popular book was going to clash with -- and undermine -- all that work. In reality, Blink seems to make a much stronger case for MORE deliberation (except in cases where instant reaction is required) than less.The story of the inability of doctors to accurately \"triage\" potential heart attack victims is perhaps the best case. In an example of anti-thin-slicing, the primary warning factors were identified only through exhaustive research and correlation analysis. So much for \"gut feel\"!The opening case of the statue scam just shows that people need to learn to better \"understand\" their own instant analyses--why these supposedly insightful art people (who recognized the scam) could not more definitively explain that the object was \"too perfect\" just shows they need to be less enamoured with their intuitive judgment and more connected with facts. (Sorry if this gives some of the book away).Anyway, I can see why people enjoy Blink. There are some interesting stories. But I cynically wonder if Mr. Gladwell is hoping people blink as they read the book, because if they look too carefully they'll see it never really makes a point.",
            "I took away a lot from this book through its anecdotes. The content of this book is stimulating and fresh. I was getting excited and sucked in with the potential of where this was going.Then some of the anecdotes went on a bit long but I could live with that.However the book suddenly ground to a halt without drawing it all together and looking at the implications for readers wanting to hone their own ability to use 'blink' intuition/gut-feel in their own lives.Right at the end he also added an anecdote that pretty much contradicted one presented earlier. He'd earlier spoken of a musician who was best evaluated when you could see his total presence. At the end he talks of better evaluating a musican performing behind a screen. While both were discussed in different contexts, it would have been good to integrate these disparate findings and fine-tuning the learning these offer as the outcomes had different implications.I must say that since I finished the book my mind has been buzzing around making connections from the content he presented and I've been much enriched by this. It would be nice to think this was the effect of an approach to writing he deliberately set up so that we'd have to make what we could of the book through our own Blink/intuition. Then again perhaps it needed more writing and careful editing!So the paradoxical - it disappointed yet I'm richer for it and glad I read it - and may lend it to friends!",
            "It amazes me what makes a bestseller. With enough marketing dollars and big name, this book was predetermined a bestseller even before it hit the bookshelves. Notice how the covers on bestselling books like this one is already printed with - millions sold- on the first day. A bestseller even before the cover was printed and a book sold? Without the hype, this would not even catch the eye of the public. Poorly written, nothing original on business. Skip this thin book and get a better business book.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell has a genius for synthesis; in \"Blink,\" he weds the research of experimental psychologists to big, pressing \"real world\" problems, such as preventing police brutality, or making employment standards sensitive to an applicant's true merit rather than to, say, gender or race. For example, he reviews Claude Steele's research on self-stereotyping to explain how individuals sensitive about gender, race, or even height may have difficulty behaving in a way inconsistent with those stereotypes. Or, he describes how how psychologist John Gottman has been able to predict with 95% accuracy whether a couple will remain married for another 15 years based only on their facial expressions observed over the course of an hour's argument.Here's a great example of what I mean by synthesis: he describes research on how decisions made in a very short time (split seconds) cause people to rely on hard-wired or stereotyped associations (say, between the race of a victim such as Amadou Diallou and the likelihood of the thing in his pocket being a gun). The effect is exacerbated when people make decisions in groups. Then, he carefully breaks down the events of the Diallou shooting - multiple decisions about Diallou's intent, threat, etc, followed by his shooting in a hail of 41 bullets-all of which took only 7 seconds total. He makes a compelling case that Diallou's death was in part due to the close quarters in which the decision was taken (leaving only a few yards and a second or two between cop and victim), as well as to the number of cops having to make the call. He even provides a tentative solution - police officers who patrol alone are less likely to get into this sort of trouble, because they are more cautious and give themselves more time to \"override\" these mistaken and stereotyped associations.For the \"layperson,\" Gladwell makes lively and relevant experiments that would, if we read them ourselves, might appear obscure and clinical. For the psychologist (among whom I include myself), it's a bit of a thrill to see that hours of toil in a lab can have some real impact on how important real-world decisions are made.I do have one very small beef with the book (it could hardly be smaller): I think the subtitle (\"The Power of Thinking without Thinking\") is misleading and undersells the book. It makes it sound like lightweight self-help that is universally positive about the power of instantaneous thought. In fact, the book is quite balanced on the subject of when and whether \"thin-sliced\" thought results in better or worse decisions.More than anything, though, I admire Gladwell's taste: he has a knack of identifying great illustrations, the great psychology that supports them, and making a crystal-clear connection between the two. Again and again I found myself thinking \"you know, a good experiment for him to illustrate this concept would be so-and-so's,\" only to find that specific example on the next page.I know of no journalist who commands the respect of social scientists to the extent Malcolm Gladwell does, and I expect this will be the average reader of \"Blink\" will feel the same respect for this fascinating book.",
            "This lighweight book is a surprise. You do expect some analysis and content when reading a book on the current state of thinking about brain activity. There is no substance here.There are lots of anecdotes about supposedly instant analysis of tennis swings, statues, and the like. The thing that is not credited is the time, effort, study and intellectual training it takes to erect the pattern recognition process that is behind these \"instant\" decisions. (As if an untrained individuals' instant conclusion about anything would be of any value whatsoever.) There are trained people in many professions who can arrive at a conclusion quickly -- especially on how to categorize a situation or an object which relates to their field. They have internalized the schema of that field, and it is this unconscious competance that makes them an expert. So --- what else is new here?Not a piece I would compare with Penrose, Dennett or any of the scholars of brain activity. Sadly, in my opinion, I wasted my time.",
            "\"Blink\" starts explosively, presenting a hypothesis which would probably come as a shock and a revelation to most people. Gladwell quickly makes a strong case for the equality of instantaneous decisions with detailed, analyzed decision-making, through a series of disparate but consistently powerful case studies.The book then moves onto explaining why the quick-fix decision making process works so often, the core of the explanation lying in the ability of the brain to \"thin slice\" i.e. recognize the few key pieces of information in any situation required to make sense of it, made possible by the human brain's ability to process efficiently and rapidly copious quantities of information stored in the human unconscious.It is here that the book begins to falter, for instead of delving deeper into the theory, Gladwell starts presenting related concepts and a never-ending string of case studies. While the case studies individually make for interesting reading, collectively, they become burdensome. The book's weakest part comes into light only after substantial passage, when one realizes that Gladwell is really not going to provide much insight into how one can begin to harness the power of \"blink\" decision-making and make it more effective for ourselves.To Gladwell's credit, however, the book is written in a lucid and interesting style, making complex concepts highly accessible for the layman. Finally, the book is genuinely thought-provoking, which in itself is a sufficient reason for adding this book to one's collection.",
            "I really liked this book. Much of it is plain old common sense. Trust your intuition. Your first instinct is often correct. But there are times that we can't trust our initial impressions because of inherent biases and Gladwell discusses these instances. Sometimes it's hard to get past the barrier of physical looks, race, age, etc. for us to make a sound decision.I do take issue with the idea that speed dating is just as effective as any other kind of dating. If that's the case, we certainly are falling in love based on some very superficial reactions! Speed dating seems crazy to me unless we want to find out whether or not we have an attraction or chemistry with another person. But how could we have any idea of what a person is really like or how we will click with them after talking to them for four minutes in a stressful situation?The book was interesting, illuminating and well-written; however, it was redundant. Gladwell continued to make the same point throughout the book and to hammer it home with various examples. Also, at the end, I was confused about whether or not I really could trust my intuition because of all of the different variables that come into play in certain situations. So, in many ways, I felt as though I was back to square one when I had finished reading it!Sigrid MacdonaldAuthor of D'Amour Road[...]",
            "A quick read, concise and clear, \"Blink\" gives us much-needed insight into the preconditioning and hidden clues our minds use to make decisions. Malcolm Gladwell obviously has the gift of rapport, which enables him to distill the essense from the life work of many psychologists and share these nuggets of knowledge with us. For instance, when Gladwell watches John Gottman observe married couples in his laboratory, videotaped interviews can reveal small signs of negative interactions between the spouses, such as fleeting indications of contempt. These signs can predict with great accuracy whether or not a marriage will survive, even though the couple is unaware of the problems they may be facing. Learning to read the hidden emotions that Paul Eckman has learned to identify by observing fleeting facial expressions provides the key to the real thoughts of someone with whom you're interacting. This is particularly important in law enforcement, and Gladwell emphasizes that this skill must be trained into police officers under stressful conditions to prevent such tragedies as the police shooting of the unarmed Amadou Diallo in the Bronx or the beating of Rodney King. \"Blink\" summarizes many areas of important research that bring us all a little closer to our basic interconnectedness.",
            "The premise presented in Blink is interesting, and Gladwell certainly spins the research to support his position that the \"gut\" decisions we make are often the most important. However, Gladwell does little to make his point through the examples he uses, as he uses illustrations of individuals making decisions in their respective fields who have years and years of experience. OF COURSE these people will tend to make better/on-the-fly decisions than someone with little or no experience.This book read like a lengthy case study, supported by chapters of research and examples; not to mention, repetition - to drive his point home. The concept of Blink may have been better presented a'la three-part article series in Time Magazine or another consumer-facing publication. As a book, it seems to drag on unnecessarily.",
            "I was interested in the premise of this book, that we can \"know without knowing why we know\" and can utilize this hunch in making decisions. Gladwell provides many interesting anecdotes (at times you feel like you're reading the good parts of an intro to psychology text), but that's really all he does. He doesn't leap to anything in the way of conclusions or exercises to further experience this phenomenon. Of course, once we become aware of our \"adaptive subconscious,\" we begin to tread on tenuous territory, muddling precisely on what we focus. So, you really can't fault him for that; he's doing all he can by providing what he does.Overall, I enjoyed \"Blink\" and would recommend it as a light read. It does make for good discussions and personal revelations. I myself wish I would have several times listened to that \"blink\" subconscious, intead of opening up the Pandora's box of other options. My only criticism is that Gladwell becomes a little repetitive at times and the book itself begins to drag. But not that big of a deal.",
            "At the outset, I feel obliged to point out that I am unqualified to comment on neurological material which Gladwell includes and discusses in this volume. For example, what Patrick Murray refers to in his own review: \"The fusiform gyrus is not a piece of brain software (page 219), the midbrain doesn't hijack the forebrain much less reach up to hijack it (page 225), and it is doubtful that rapid heart beats shut down the motor systems or any other brain component (pages 220-225).\" The comments which follow limit their attention to what I understand to be Gladwell's core concepts and key assertions with regard to the decision-making process. These are the ones which are of greatest interest to me:1. What Gladwell refers to as \"the adaptive unconscious\" has a much greater influence on our judgments as well as on our pre-judgments (or prejudices) than most of us realize. This explains why we often react with \"intuitive\" repulsion or attraction to another person...or to a given option, peril, suggestion, opportunity, request, etc.2. \"Paralysis by analysis\" can result in what Gladwell refers to as \"momentary autism\" (i.e. a non-decision) which may or may not prove beneficial.3. In certain crises (e.g. an ambush, a train wreck, a medical emergency), snap decisions must often be made without benefit of sufficient information. \"The power of knowing, in that first two seconds, is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few. It is an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves.\"For me this last is Gladwell's most important point, one which he really could have developed in much greater depth: It is not only possible but highly desirable to become so knowledgeable about a given subject that one can almost immediately complete an accurate diagnosis and then take or recommend appropriate action. I have personally observed this skill on numerous occasions in emergency rooms, automotive shops, and during appliance service calls. The physician, mechanic, or electrician quickly checks out the most revealing symptoms and then knows (if not \"in that first two seconds\") precisely what must be done. Theirs are really not \"snap\" decisions; rather, they are based on years of experience which have revealed the criteria by which to make the most appropriate judgments in a timely manner.I am intrigued by the possibility that when one develops the skill by which to make such judgments, each such judgment then becomes what Gladwell characterizes as a \"tipping point,\" after which there is an acceleration of subsequent events, results, consequences, etc. Perhaps in his next book, Gladwell will explore that possibility.",
            "As he did in The Tipping Point, Gladwell masterfully condenses social science research into prose that is readable and even dramatic. It's almost as if he confides in the reader and chats with him or her across the dining room table.The problem with the book is that while Gladwell does well to emphasize the power of intuitive, unguided, unplanned thinking in human endeavor, he never really reconciles the contradictions that he finds. On the one hand, intuitive reasoning is a remarkable tool for distinguishing real art from a forgery or for negotiating the \"fog of war.\" On the other hand, it involves snap judgments about people that are nothing short of racial or gender prejudice. Although Gladwell acknowledges the contradictions, his solution -- to \"train\" the subconscious mind -- is not very convincing.",
            "`Blink' is about the mysterious two seconds it takes to develop a first impression and how surprising the impression often is, given our known preferences and tendencies. Malcolm Gladwell got the idea for this book after he had let his hair grow long on a whim, and found he was getting speeding tickets for the first time in his life. He wondered why the cops all of a sudden had an impression of him that wasn't there before. He became curious: where do first impressions come from anyway?Gladwell does some interesting investigative work to try to get some answers to that intriguing question. He suggests that `rapid cognition' is behind a `closed door' in our minds and follows certain unwritten rules. It is a logical process that he feels is not instinctual, but, surprisingly, can be more accurate than deliberate, rational thought, and follows certain rules that we are not even aware of. (Even improvisational comedians follow certain rules, though what they do often seems so random.) One must be careful though, since stereotyping and the immediate environment at the moment can influence the impression. All of this mental background action is going on without our even knowing it! The `closed door', it turns out, can only be peaked into.There are lots of very good examples of `blink'. There is the case of the statue that didn't look right to experts at first glance. Fourteen months later, after much testing, it was discovered by other experts that the statue was a forgery. Then there was the case of the supervisory fireman who yelled to his men to leave the building immediately minutes before it collapsed; he sensed something was wrong when it was not at all obvious what it was. Another example has to do with internationally known and respected tennis instructor who can almost invariably tell when a pro will double-fault just before the serve is hit, and he doesn't know how he does it! Speed dating often shows people being attracted others that do not fit their criteria of what they are looking for, for reasons they are fuzzy about. All of this is very mysterious, to say the least.Information and understanding are not the same things and sometimes less information is better. He gives very good examples of this in the medical and military fields. He talks about the `power of the glance', the ability of a great general to look at a battle field, weed through all the information, and make a rapid decision; he gives a great example of this in Lee's improbable victory at Chancellorsville. \"Sometimes, we have to edit\" our information down to something manageable, and make a decision on that. This was very counter-intuitive to me, and I'm sure, something to approach with caution. But I can't argue against results and he gives good evidence that it works.Be aware that first impressions can be misleading. Spontaneous decision making is shown to be not infallible, and can even be dangerous at times; stereotyping can supplant logical decision-making in a time-crunch. He goes into some detail about this with an instructive example of a police action in the Bronx that went awry. Gladwell said in the interview at the end of the book that he tried very hard to make this point. Rapid cognition can be your enemy as well as your friend. Use it with caution.It is tricky knowing how to measure the value of a product or a performer. Packaging can count too much, a great example of which is what he calls the `Warren Harding Error', a fascinating section of the book. Also, when surveying the response to a product, an opinion can't always be comfortably expressed in words (except by the experts), and as a result, some people will tend to look for a plausible reason, and give an incorrect opinion. The mystery of why someone likes something can't always be codified.This was a fascinating book that does not pretend to give all the answers but does raise some really good questions about a mysterious and important subject. The so-called `locked door' is finally getting its due.",
            "This is a book about the split decisions we make--our first impression, our gut reaction, our instinct--within the first two seconds of encountering a problem. Gladwell sets up in his introduction that we too often disregard that gut feeling and eventually over-think, over-analyze, and over-rationalize our decisions. Like in THE TIPPING POINT, Gladwell makes his point through varied and interesting case studies in unexpected fields of study. And although I found some of the case studies fascinating, I was under-whelmed by Gladwell's point overall. Maybe I expected the evidence for making snap judgments to be more compelling. From the title of the book, I expected Gladwell's point to be more about the advantages of snap decisions, but he also provides plenty of examples of when snap judgments can be disastrous. While this is all interesting, I was left feeling like Gladwell's point was a bit muddied. As opposed to a book FOR the advantages of that snap decisions, it seems like a book just about snap decisions, with the theme being that sometimes they are good and sometimes they are bad. Which, for all the interest of the case studies, is a fairly pedestrian thesis.",
            "The author makes a very good case on the ecology of the mind. The various situations in which a selective set of data is applied as alternate strategy to enable adequate response for survival are analyzed. However, the style is sometimes too personal and lacking in empirical data. Overall, it confirms a lay person's observations, but offers no framework on which to pursue further study.",
            "On the surface Malcolm Gladwell's Blink is not explicitly about leadership-educational or otherwise-but upon further examination, the application of Gladwell's work can be invaluable to anyone in need of making an important decision.The bulk of Blink is an exploration of how the mind works during the decision making process. Gladwell posits that one of the greatest mistakes that humans make when making decisions is that they fail recognize the significance of their unconscious mind. It is a commonly held belief that a \"good\" decision is one that comes out of a long and thorough decision making process made by the conscious mind. Gladwell openly challenges this conventional wisdom with the three major principles he sets out to prove in Blink.The first is to convince the reader that \"decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.\" This principle is explored at length through the discussion rapid cognition which is also known as the theory of \"thin slicing.\" Thin slicing is \"the ability of our unconscious mind to find patterns in situations and behavior based on very narrow slices of experience.\" The second principle is that while in many cases it is recommended to trust one's instincts, these same instincts have the ability to betray us. In other words, when making rapid decisions, human beings cannot ignore the fact that certain aspects of physical appearance-a person's size, color, or sex-can trigger some very powerful associations which have the potential to lead to prejudice and discrimination. The third and perhaps most interesting concept explored in the book is the idea that decisions and reactions made by the unconscious mind can be influenced and controlled by our conscious mind. In other words, the conscious mind can be \"primed\" though suggestive words and images to affect the unconscious decision. This concept is one that is continually relied upon by advertisers and spin doctors to sway the public to subscribe to whatever \"product\" is being peddled.Gladwell explores these intriguing concepts using scientific research and anecdotal evidence from a wide and diverse series culturally relevant subjects including: speed dating in Manhattan, the presidential campaign of Warren G. Harding, the potentially embarrassing war games that preceded the current war in Iraq, the musical career of the up and coming artist Kenna, the famous early 1980's \"Pepsi Challenge,\" diagnosing heart attacks at Cook County hospital, and the tragic shooting of Amadou Diallo by four New York police officers in 1999. Gladwell's previous experience as a writer for The New Yorker serves him well here because whether he is discussing the various muscles that are used to make a specific facial expression or the rules of comedic improvisation, he writes at a level and tone that is inherently readable. A lesser writer would not be able to bring all of these disparate examples together without sounding merely coincidental. Gladwell succeeds because at the outset of the chapter he establishes the fundamental concept that he wants to prove and then goes about the business of convincing the reader through an series of interrelated anecdotes that circle back repeatedly to the brain function or decision making trait that is being examined. Gladwell manages to simultaneously entertain and instruct which makes this a book that I would highly recommend.",
            "Blink is an extremely interesting read, no more and no less. It is not a textbook, nor is it a self-help book. Do not expect any solutions or unified theory here. The basic premise is that the unconscious mind can and often does make critical decisions that are difficult to rationally parse on first analysis and that can often be superior to logical and reasoned decisions based on a plethora of information. Gladwell starts off with gusto, making the reader think he is going to tie-in all the various threads into a coherent theory and prescription shortly. Somewhere along the way however, he seems to realise just how insurmountable an objective this is and from then on, the book just coasts along. As a review of human behavior however, Blink is excellent. Gladwell is particularly good at describing in clear and engaging terms a situation or experiment, telling us the story in an interest-arousing manner, and then identifying the lessons to be learned. A reader can gain some very good insights into human behavior, yet be left somewhat unsure exactly how to apply these insights. Sure, some of the stuff appears in hindsight to be plain common sense; except that most people miss the common sense on first read. The statistics he quotes (e.g. height as a factor in CEOs, cardiac triage) are excellent food for thought. And the various anecdotes Gladwell cites are both entertaining as well as instructive. I have to admire Gladwell's ability to transform dry research into terms of human interest. A short, entertaining and informative read, which earns it 3 stars.",
            "Gladwell has the rare ability to articulate complicated concepts into easily understand catch phrases. No wonder The Tipping Point was so good. That book took a theory and provided many substantial examples to underscore his point.His latest release is no different! Slightly different in format, in that it culls material from previously published items, Gladwell takes us on a tour of the power of instant impressions.More than just another take on 'making a good first impression,' Gladwell examines how much we take in and process instantly. Probably more now than ever in this fast-paced world we live in.A terrific read for the single man out there, trying to round out some of the rough edges he may be unaware of, to those of us seeking some deeper levels of understanding.- GiddyupGuy",
            "I blinked and did not see any empirical evidence that Gladwell's assertions hold ground. I was somewhat confused by the various ambiguities and the author's \"thin slicing\" theory and his leap of faith conclusions. In all fairness, this book is entertaining and is filled with fascinating anecdotes.",
            "This is a strange book. There are some flashes of brilliance, of \"Wow! I had not thought about it\", but there are also many moments in which it becomes really hard to understand what Gladwell wants to communicate.The author's main point seems to be that we have the ability to make quick judgements and analyses of people/ artifacts/ situations. This is an argument \"against\" the typical idea of a complete, thorough, time-consuming analyses. It's an interesting proposal and its based on psychological studies of people's behavior.But, beware!, he asserts that we should notice that this quick judgements and analyses must be somehow based on \"looking at the right items\" (a sort of Pareto -80/20- rule) in each situation. Being quick does not mean being right.So, his point is that, carefully trained (thus with the ability to distinguish what is truly relevant), people can make snap assessements with a good level of accuracy.On the positive side, I will say that:- The author's main point is worthy of a book- As in \"The Tipping Point\", he provides many interesting examples and anecdotes, from many sources (by example: military exercises, autist experiments, art, food tasting, etc.).- In general, his writing is \"smart\" and in some moments in makes you reflect upon your own life and situations you face in it where you could apply his theoryOn the negative side:- The structure of this book is terrible. I think I got the point of the book now, when I'm writing this note. But it moves you back and forth between different \"dilemmas\" and you never are really sure what we wants to say. Not even at the end. Terrible structure.- Well, his argument is not rocket science. If you're looking for ground-breaking thougths, this will not amuse you.In short, this is a nice book with some interesting thoughts, backed with many anecdotes and results from psychological tests. Read it if you have time, if you just want to enjoy the stories behind the argument, and if you do not mind the confusion in its structure. Otherwise, skipt it. Time is short. There are other better sources of information and entertainment.P.S.:1 - I have the sense this book could be the source for a nice documentary. Many of the experiments and situations (for example, face reading) are very well suited for the screen.2 - Due to the hype surrounding Gladwell's work and to the fact that the Tipping Point was really a cool and ground-breaking book, I have rated this book a 3. Had it been his first book, it could have been a 4.",
            "Having grown with this feeling that my 'first impression' is most of the times the one that counts, I've pushed the '1 click order' button before I could blink an eye (maybe it was the wonderful cover... yes, I know, don't judge a book...). I didn't take any nap while reading it, but I must confess reading sometimes slows down a bit, almost across an umberable point. If I was the editor, I'd do two things: make it 100 page long at the most (98 is a nice number) and I'd reshuffle the text in order to improve the reading speed.",
            "In \"Blink,\" author Malcolm Gladwell explores \"post-modern\" decision-making. In modernism, we decided based upon logic: the analysis of factual data, as much of it as we could gather. In post-modernism, we decide based upon the synthesis of sensed experience, as small a slice as we can focus upon.Fortunately, Gladwell does not lean exclusively toward an either/or approach. That is, he recognizes the necessity of facts, while emphasizing the way the brain works to process information.What Gladwell writes in pithy narrative, psychologists have discussed for decades in what is known as HIPT: Human Information Processing Theory. Their model overlaps with Gladwell's main focus: to make wise decision we need the ability to think holistically-to envision seemingly disconnected puzzle pieces as a beautiful mosaic.I've applied his thinking to areas as diverse as a fantasy baseball auction draft, to a counseling session. In fantasy baseball, I've always been the most informed participant in our group of 14 grown-men who spend a day in April acting like boys. However, Gladwell helped me to detect my \"information overload.\" I had all the facts, ALL the facts, but not enough of the feel. Not enough of the intuitive sense that gathered the data, related it to our group, and adjusted quickly to changing scenarios.As a professional counselor and counselor educator, I've always practiced and taught that we must add relational competence to our theoretical understanding. We must skillfully intuit what is happening in me, in my counselee, and in our relationship. In essence, this is counseling by \"blink.\"For those who desire more (and in some cases more accurate) information on how the brain functions and how we can discipline our minds and emotions so that we relate well and think with discernment, I would recommend Daniel Goleman's now classic work, \"Emotional Intelligence.\" Use it hand-in-hand with \"Blink\" and you just might win your fantasy baseball league!Reviewer: Dr. Bob Kellemen, author of \"Soul Physicians: A Theology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction\" and \"Spiritual Friends: A Methodology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction.\"",
            "There are some interesting narratives in the book- strung together with useless chatter and fill. (Too much about Kenna and Coke, for example.) I think Gladwell had enough real content to make an excellent magazine article and spent some time creating enough filler to turn it into a book.",
            "The author spends an inordinate amount of time putting together anecdotes about situations in which people with extraordinary training in a given subject (for example, art) can determine when an item (e.g. a sculpture) is real or fake. So what. A well trained eye can determine a fake Rolex in the blink of an eye. If they are trained in what to look for and are intimately familiar with the details, then it should come as no surprise.What is MISSING is any advice, hints or other information to help the average \"Joe\" learn to put those abilities to work in the real world.Don't waste your time.

            "It basically took two simple ideas (your first reaction is often the decision you'll ultimately reach anyway which is fine until your subconscious and gut reaction leads to a serious consequence)that contradict each other , devotes 100 pages towards trying to justify each of the thoughts, and never ties the points together. A real disappointment.",
            "Perhaps it is simply ironic that so many pages are devoted to explaining something that happens instantaneously, yet still manages to miss the target. A disappointing book on a subject that should have been fasinating to write about and read. It is telling that that word \"instinct\" is nowhere to be found in the index of the book.",
            "This book was a great read into understanding human perceptions and judgements. The key points for me were:*The mind uses 2 strategies to make sense of a situation: 1. conscious strategy, thinking about what we learn, it's the logical strategy. 2. Knowing something without knowing, before it hits our consciousness.*We have an adaptive unconscious, an efficient action initiator, causing humans to take action immediately.*Quick decisions are as good as cautious decisions - our unconscious mind is powerful.*Snap judgements and first impressions can be educated and controlled.*We can learn to make better snap judgements.*We have a rapid cognition ability called \"thin-slicing\" - where the unconscious mind engages in automatic tasks.*Wen we see 2 people perhaps having an argument, we can recognize a pattern that arises: A distinctive signature rises naturally and automatically.*People are in 2 states in a relationship: 1. Positive sentiment over-ride: positive emotions over-ride irritability. 2. Negative sentiment over-ride: neural things are perceived negative.*Defensiveness, stone-walling, criticism and contempt, are signs of marriage or relationship fail.*Thin-slicing is better than deliberate and exhausting thinking.*You can learn as much or more from one glance at a bedroom than hours of exposure to public face.*If you talk to a doctor who is not listening, talking you down - try to listen to that feeling.*Snap judgements are quick and unconscious. We need to accept snap judgements.*The priming technique: Example; If you prime \"cooperation\" into people, people will cooperate. However, prime \"old\", and people will feel old.*How we think and act, and how well we think and act, is susceptible to outside influence.*We are often too quick to come up with explanations for things we don't have an explanation for.*We can know more about someone or something in the blink of an eye than months of study.*If you're selling something - never judge people on appearance. Treat everyone equal.*People make sophisticated decisions without a script or plot.*Successful decision making relies on balance between deliberate and instinctively thinking.*Fragility matters: snap judgements and rapid cognition.*We can learn alot about how people think just by observing: body language, facial expressions, even looking at their book shelves.*The face is a rich source of information about emotions.*The information on our faces demonstrates what is going in inside our heads.*Our facial expressions have an effect on our nervous system.And closing up to finish the book... the lessons of blink are:First lesson: Recognize the characteristic signs of judgement's fragility.Second lesson: Understand instinctive decision making.Third lesson: Said to be the most important lesson; Knowing less about things/people. The key to good decision is not knowledge, it's understanding.A question is asked on when should one use the \"blink\", thing-slicing methods and what not. The author says there are no answers, we all have different situations and circumstances. However we need to combine rational analysis (conscious thinking) with instinctive judgement (unconscious thinking).",
            "Thin slicing works, except when it doesn't.The premise is interesting, but Gladwell fails to actually draw any meaningful conclusion from his anecdotes. In fact, you could draw completely opposite conclusions from the same \"data\". This is popular science writing at its worst. Just plain dumb.",
            "Blink is a well written thesis on the merits and pitfalls of both snap judgments and lengthy decision making process.As always Malcom Gladwell not only presents advanced social cognition concepts in easy to understand plain-speak, the author also provides interesting examples to augment their argument.Of particular interest in Gladwell's description of Prof. Ekman, the academic that the popular TV series Lie to Me is based upon. Also illuminating but mildly frightening is the section on police pursuits and the effect of high adrenaline situations on police judgment.Gladwell shows a remarkable ability not only to translate complicated concepts into fascinating easy-to-read prose. He also has a strange ability to address and calm controversy, a skill that seems absent from many non-fiction writiers.While Gladwell does ramble occasionally, its still a worthwhile read particularly for anyone interested in psychology.",
            "Blink was my first experience with popular author Malcolm Gladwell. As I initially began reading this book, I felt for sure that I was going to love it. In the Introduction, Gladwell explains how various experts turned out to be wrong after spending months of research attempting to verify the authenticity of a marble statue, whereas several other experts called out the statue as fake after a mere cursory glance. Therefore, in Blink, Gladwell focuses on the many rapid, often unconscious--but usually correct--decisions, that we make, almost always without knowing exactly why we are doing so.Thus, this book seemed like a perfect fit for me. As a psychologist, I've always called my own use of rapid cognition \"intuition,\" but the term Gladwell uses is \"thin-slicing,\" referring to the way in which we utilize just a small piece of the available information. To make his points, Gladwell presents many different fascinating examples and anecdotes, from psychologist John Gottman's studies of marital relationships to our inherent appearance/racial biases to the tragic police shooting of Amadou Diallo in 1999. Although I enjoyed reading all of these illustrations, I generally felt that Gladwell drew them out too long--i.e., he seemed to overplay his hand, to the extent that I often wanted to say \"enough already; get to the point!\"Overall, however, I found Blink to be a worthwhile read. I particularly liked the Afterward, where Gladwell suggested some ideas for determining when we should rely on our instincts and when we should take time for more substantial analysis; I actually wished this section had been lengthier. I would not hesitate to recommend this book, and I certainly may go on to read more of Gladwell's work.",
            "I've never been quite as disappointed with such a page-turner. I give this book 4 stars on pacing, style, and level of interest, but 1.5 stars on synthesis. The author has a remarkable ability to captivate the reader with a series of stories that are at times quite technical, but he fails on his promise in the introduction to show us when to trust our first impressions, and when they lead us astray. What was it about the kouros-statue experts that made their first impressions right, but made the NYPD officers who shot an innocent man 41 times wrong? The author never really tells us. In the end, the author seems to imply that our intuitions are to be trusted when they produce good results--a wholly unsatisfying conclusion that gives us no guidance going forward.",
            "Amazed at how highly (star) rated this book is, I felt I had to bring it down a notch......The book has been well appraised by most of the negative reviewers already so I'll just reiterate:1) Utterly confused, tenuous and contradictory hypothesis.2) Reminds me of English Lit. essays I'd write at high school, where I had no real point, but had to fill 1000 words.2) Tipping Point was a great book.

            "No wonder this is a best seller. The author explains in an easy to follow way, the power of snap decisions and how they work. It shows how powerful and accurate instantaneous decisions can be, that we often are at odds to explain how we arrived at. Gladwell explains how these decisions are arrived at by the meticulous gathering of information by our unconscious.However they are not always accurate and this is largely due to bias, such as stereotyping and prejudices. No doubt hormones play a role in that bias too, such as when people 'fall' in love and go on to marry that person. Gladwell here sites a number of studies by psychologist John Gottman, who discovered after studying thousands of interviews with married couples that he was able to tell with 95% accuracy whether a couple would remain together after 15 years from just observing an interview with a couple for 15 minutes.An interesting book that makes one think about the powerful working of the unconscious and how to use it in beneficial ways.",

            "This book was so captivating that I don't even feel like I even blinked once while reading it! I'm still digesting all the thought-altering information, but my \"thin slicing\" of the book would be that our amazing, innate, and instantaneous gift of \"knowing\" rewards us with lightning speed insights, whose explanations can leave us at a loss for words. This book does an excellent job at explaining not only the process behind this split-second thinking, but also how we can train ourselves to maximize the usefulness and minimize the dangers of our uncanny cerebral powers. I think my thinking will never be the same!",
            "Malcolm Gladwell, the introduction is great and it sets a huge expectation on snap judgement - an unknown territory atleast to me! Initial chapters talks about how thin slicing works and why it always yield results. But in the later chapters, Gladwell starts talking about how the snap judgment could be wrong and I felt the both the stories are not well connected and conclusion left me confused.",
            "The intention of this book was never to teach the reader a new way of thinking or to revolutionize the way decisions are made, but rather to teach us about something most of us do everyday without realizing it.The analysis he offers through the perspectives of research experts, recent current events, and even our perceptions on our most popular beverages/food is eye opening! There are simple decisions being made by our mind far in advance of the rest of our consciousness, yet it shapes how we think food tastes, whether we will like a person or not, or even our thoughts on racism.I reccomend this book to anyone willing to read a simplified analysis of a very complicated decision making machine (the mind). Even with no prior interest in psychology or social sciences I was intrigued the entire way through, and have been made an instant fan of Malcolm Gladwell!",
            "I will keep my review brief as others have covered my critiques fairly well. Malcolm Gladwell presents a series of interesting topics, but there isn't a strong theme tying them together. Inconsistencies of interpretation between the stories is one of the most frustrating aspects of this book. Gladwell will make a claim to support his conclusions on one topic, but assume its contradiction in support of his claim in another topic.The most frustrating aspect of this book is its lack of a thesis, though. Gladwell sets out a thesis consisting of three points in his introduction, but you would never come up with those theses simply by reading the book; I was left unconvinced he tried to make a case for them even though I actively looked for supporting evidence while reading.",

For example, how many of us have dislike someone we meet but after a while we become excellent friends?I think he is right in some things but his theory warns you against ovethinking, and that not always works.Like I said some of Gladwell's points are ambiguous. I also think this book lacks a satisfying conclusion.But I recommend it anyway, just so you get your own opinion about it. But if you can, just get it from the library, don't buy it please.",

            "\"Blink\" is a book about our cognitive abilities. Malcolm Gadwell considers the ability of the human mind to make split second decisions and judgments, which are usually accurate. He delves into the idea that our instincts are usually correct, even though there are no fundamental reasons why then goes onto convince readers that snap judgement and first impressions can be controlled and educated. He writes about the term \"thin slicing\" to describe the ability to find patterns in events based only on narrow windows of experience.Overall \"Blink\" provides a new sort of perception that first impressions and judgments are actually true. From childhood, we are all taught that first impressions are key. Malcolm Gadwell provides evidence of split second Decisions and judgement ranging from a retired tennis player, to Medical Doctors. Gadwell does however, explain that prejudices can impair our thoughts. Gadwell even describes how the outcome of a relationship (Divorce or Married) in 10 years, can be quantitatively measured.The overall theme is \"Thinking without Thinking,\" which describes that ones mind can subconsciously understand and analyze a situation before one's conscious takes place. The mind can conceive the details through a situation due to the associates made through society. Gadwell jumps between stories as a describes different topics such as priming, selective processing and expertise, but always relates back to the topic of thin slicing. His writing style leaves the reader curious as to why and how something happens, subconsciously urging them to read on till he abruptly explains the relationship.The overall book was a pleasure to read, yet I still remain skeptical about some of the ideas and presented. He present's ideas that have many different outcomes, such as how an artists who should have made it big didn't and how a commander beat his opponents in a war-game exercise. The book hits individuals with facts and then goes on to describe the relationships found within those statements and facts. I remain skeptical about some of the ideas because they simply seem implausible and rather controversial. Since the earliest days of our birth, we are taught never to make judgments or to judge a book by its cover. Blink teaches us something different, describing how it is alright to judge a book by its cover, and how those judgments actually save us a tremendous amount of time.Gadwell relies mainly on anecdotal evidence. Each section tells a story about someone who illustrates his theory of snap judgments. The first story presented was about a Greek statue the J. Paul Getty Museum had agreed to purchase. Just before the transaction was about to take place, two art experts immediately knew it was a fake. They had no idea why, or how they just \"knew.\" Eventually it was found out that the statue was a fake and when a scientist tested a sample of the stuate, Gadwell explains that \"In the first two seconds of looking--in a single glance--they [the critics] were able to understand more about the essence of the statue than the team at the Getty was able to understand after fourteen months.\" As the book progresses, much more of this intuitive knowledge is proven to be true.The main problem in the book is that some of the information is presented in a falsify way. The readers are not given completely background of all the other possibilities. In one example, Gadwell explains how artist by the name of Kenna, is loved by artists, managers, and talent scouts but fails to make it in the big run because radio stations dislike him because he didn't market himself properly to them. Individual people thin sliced Kenna and realized he was good, but radio stations waited some time to make a rational judgment which in turn led them denying him. Gadwell explains that Kenna could either have been promoted, or the radio stations are wrong, but never does he touch on the fact that Kenna might have been a bad artist.I would highly recommend this book to other readers, simply because of the way it makes you think about your judgments. I was able to finish this book within a day because of the intriguing logic Gadwell uses to prove his point. This book made me step back and think \"Wow. Can that be true.\" It truly made me think of the decisions I make on a daily basis, and how some of those decisions are already determined. While I do remain skeptical about some of the idea's presented in the book, the overall book was a pleasure to read; keeping me entertained and curious enough to finish the entire book. I enjoyed the book enough to go and purchase Malcolm Gadwell's other book \"The Tipping Point.\"Overall, read it and enjoy how much it makes you think. One should not however take everything said in the book to be the truth.",
            "When I was a young man there was late-night disc jockey in Chicago by the name of Sid McCoy who played a lot of Frank Sinatra recordings. He often referred to Sinatra as The Master Story Teller, because Frank's respect for the lyrics and his phrasing were so exquisite that he made you really feel the emotions the songwriter was attempting to convey.In my opinion, when it comes to non-fiction books, Malcolm Gladwell is The Master Story Teller. In \"Blink\" he uses his talent for conveying stories, studies, and arguments to help us understand a magical, mysterious thing called judgment. And he asserts that judgment is important because it is what separates winners from losers.Early in the book Gladwell explains that \"Blink\" is concerned with the very smallest components of our everyday lives - the content and origin of those instantaneous impressions and conclusions that spontaneously arise whenever we meet a new person or confront a complex situation or have to make a decision under conditions of stress.He uses a phrase in psychology, thin-slicing, to explain that human beings are often capable of making sense of situations based on the thinnest slice of experience.Gladwell's primary goal for \"Blink\" is to accomplish three tasks: 1] To convince us that decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as those made cautiously and deliberately. 2] Assist us in knowing when we should trust our instincts, and when we should be wary of them. 3] Convince us that our snap judgements and first impressions can be educated and controlled.The book is replete with fascinating stories and studies that help Gladwell accomplish these tasks. One that I found particularly enlightening, and should be read by every medical doctor, is a revelation about why some doctors are sued for malpractice and others aren't. The answer has nothing to do with the medical skill or training of the physician, but everything to do with the doctor/patient relationships.It seems that patients don't sue doctors whom they like. In fact, one patient cited chose to sue her internest, even after being informed that it was the radiologist who was potentially at fault. Why? Because she liked the radiologist, and didn't like the internist. I can relate to this because my wife could have sued a doctor for malpractice but chose not to because she liked him.Related to this is a study described in this book that utilized a mere 40 seconds of recorded conversations of surgeons talking with patients. In these recordings the exact words spoken were filtered out, leaving just the intonation, pitch, and rhythm of the doctors voice but not the content of the conversation. From this judges rated slices of the remaining garble for such qualities as warmth, hostility, dominance, and anxiousness. From that alone it could be determined which surgeons got sued and which ones didn't. Stunning.There is much more I'd like to share about \"Blink\" than space allows. If this review captured your interest, by all means read the book.One last item: Sid McCoy, who also gave the great singer Nancy Wilson the nickname, \"The Baby\" went on to become the executive producer of the hugely successful TV show, \"Soul Train.\"",
            "In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell outlines numerous stories to illustrate how our brain can reach conclusions without our conscious mind realizing how we came to that answer. Demonstrating instances of experts detecting forgeries, psychologists determining whose marriages will last, and how we can learn to read people's faces, Gladwell weaves these stories together to show why our first judgement may be our best, and how detrimental it can be to try figuring out why or how we \"just know\". It was interesting to learn the key to good improvisational comedy, what makes a good car salesman, and how people perceive to what degree they will like a food based on the packaging. If textbooks were this interesting and well written, kids would be chomping at the bit to do their homework!",
            "Unlike The Tipping Point, which gave us terms like Influencer and Mavens, and spawned a tiresome new set of buzzwords and \"influencer\" marketing companies, Blink may not have that handy instantly-applicable nugget that transforms your business or spiffs up your next presentation. And yet, like everything I've read from Gladwell, it is well worth reading. Why? Because it will make you think, and if you apply its lessons, become a better, more thoughtful and aware human being. (And ok, there are a few things that might help you do better in job interviews, for example--see p. 56, for example.)As usual, Gladwell's writing strikes that perfect balance between research and analysis, anecdotes and conclusions. The scholarly backbone of the book is strong, yet the academic studies and statistics are never trotted out for their own sakes, but to contribute to the larger argument of the chapter and the book. These arguments or lessons are often deceptively simple--so simple that we may have overlooked or forgotten them (as in the introduction, about trusting one's hunches if one is an expert in a given area, or that we subconsciously judge people by their appearance, in chapter three)--but the academic studies used to prove the point are the sort of thing regular folks would never bother looking up. Some of the other lessons, however, are quite unexpected: contempt as the most damaging emotion for spouses to use on one another; doctors' tone of voice with patients being a key determining factor in whether they got sued.All in all, a well-documented, smoothly-written, and tightly-constructed book, whose lessons--from my numerous pages of notes and quotations--I will attempt to apply. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that unlike with the best works of fiction, one thorough reading is probably sufficient.)",
            "Headed to the library's checkout counter, I intuitively grabbed, \"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,\" on display and added the hardcover book to the top of my pile.\" I'm glad that I relied on my gut instead of my intellect. Otherwise, I would have left the book behind, feeling that it would bore me with useless psychobabble. This was far from the case. I delved into the 250-plus pages chockfull of psychological studies and theories; the esoteric synthesis of information was just too good to put down. After all, who gets eight hours of sleep these days anyway?As the title suggests, the book examines the unconscious brain processes, particularly concerning how the brain can make a snap judgment--in the blink of an eye. Through exhaustive research, Malcolm Gladwell illustrates that people, to put it bluntly (but accurately), can be rather stupid some of the time. In essence, many of his case studies prove that, yes, too much knowledge is not necessarily a good thing. He shows that sometimes it is best to surrender the credentials and expertise, and operate under the rule of intuition. On the other hand, he also substantiates, intuition, and things like first impressions, may not steer you on the correct path either. So, go figure. I suppose, as humans, we must accept our imperfections.Overall, however, the author's case studies, though plentiful, fall in an illogical, random order. Obviously, Gladwell did not have a prior chronological skeleton before he filled the page marrow with prose. If the author had utilized an outline, he did not follow it.Nonetheless, the studies, whether portraying the petty, biased mind of a person or the plain no-nothingness of a person, are fascinating. Take, for instance, the notion of \"sensation transference\" which, Gladwell says, was coined by Louis Cheskin, a man born in Ukraine at the turn of the century and a U.S. immigrant child, who later became as Gladwell dubs \"one of the greatest figures in twentieth-century marketing.\" Gladwell cites Cheskin's promotional effort of margarine, which back in the late 1940s, was the unpopular contender on the American table. After Cheskin dyed margarine yellow, wrapped it in foil imprinted with a crown and the name, \"Imperial Margarine,\" consumers ended up raving. Why? Because a pretty package is just that. Who needs to go below the surface? Shallow, but true. Stupidity always is.Gladwell also draws a picture of autism and cites an example of one of the country's leading experts on autism, a teacher at Yale University's Child Life Center, Ami Klin. Klin tested the eye movement of an autistic adult while he watched the 1966 film version of Edward Albee's \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" When the scene involved two of the main characters kissing, the autistic man fixated on a light switch in the scene. Klin sums up the premise as follows: \"....It's like if you were a Matisse connoisseur, and you look at a lot of pictures, and then you'd go, ahhh, there is the Matisse. So he goes, there is the light switch. He's seeking meaning, organization. He doesn't like confusion. All of us gravitate toward things that mean something to us, and for most of us, that's people. But if people don't anchor meaning for you, then you seek something that does.\" Interesting stuff!Despite the book's lack of overall organization, \"Blink: The Power of Thinking without Thinking\" packs a powerful punch from beginning to end without losing a blink of an eye's worth of force.",
            "I was drawn to this book after becoming inspired to investigate more about how the mind works. In fact, I was reading this book at the same time as I was reading similar books on the topic, just to compare ideas.What I Enjoyed:I thoroughly enjoy Gladwell's writing style. He uses stories to illustrate points that kept me engaged. I found the book easily accessible and not packed with technical jargon that I found in more technical books on the subject matter. It was interesting to read his description of \"thin-slices\" and how experts are often able to come to quick, powerful decisions and conclusions based on limited information and clues.The But...:However, I do not think he emphasizes enough the fact that operating off of thin-slices is a very limited way of going about our lives. One of the reasons I was drawn to this book was because I was recently readingThe Power of Thinking Differently: An imaginative guide to creativity, change, and the discovery of new ideas.. In that book, I discovered that I operated most of my life through quick decisions that the author calls \"habitual pattern recognition.\" While this is a useful survival tool when time is at a premium, and is the mechanism that allows experts to make a quick diagnosis, it inherently limits the scope of our perception. As a result, we perceive ourselves as having less choices in life than we really do.I think the Gladwell book is a great read to feel empowered by our ability to make snap judgments, but I think the real power of our brain is its ability to go beyond snap judgments. By doing this we can provide ourselves with the space to explore different possible solutions, different possible perceptions, and different ideas.Summary:With all that said, I still think Blink is a worthwhile read. I would simply caution readers to think of it as a \"thin-slice\" of human cognitive capacities.",
            "This is the kind of deep, intelligent, witty discussion that must go on at dinner parties in New York. Or at least the kinds of parties that I think Dorothy Parker would have been in attendance. It is fascinating reading and I enjoyed every new insight that Gladwell describes.Blink is written in a style best described as, \"I am about to tell you something so amazing and so wonderful, that it will forever change the world!\" And truly there are a million things that need to be changed in this world; however, a thought lingers and troubles me. What, exactly, are we supposed to take from this? Is this the kind of thoughtful work that we enjoy with a glass of wine and congratulate ourselves for being so smart and enlightened or can we use Gladwell's ideas to make the world a better place? Not that there's anything wrong with a little wine and stimulating conversation, but I suspect Gladwell wants his work to taken more seriously than that. I feel the one weak element of the book is in the absence of details on how we can and when we should use our instinct or our intuition to help us make decisions and how can we take action with all this great theory he has given us.Gladwell describes a \"technique\" of \"thin slicing\" which can be understood to mean your \"gut reaction\" or your \"intuition\" about a person, thing, or situation. He provides overwhelming evidence through a multitude of examples to tell us that although we often mistrust our instinct because of things we've been taught, such as \"don't judge a book by it's cover,\" it is these instincts which we should use to make meaningful decisions. At this point in the book, I was sold on the theory and ready to start trusting my intuition to make better decisions when - Whoop! He pulled the proverbial rug out from under my newfound brilliance and his own theory by gaving examples of when thin slicing does not work, such when we vote in handsome, magnanimous, yet unqualified politicians like Warren Harding or when a city's police make a snap judgment about his afro and question him as a criminal suspect.I do not want to be a spoiler, so you know some spoiling is about to begin, but the book deserves, nay, yearns for a unifying theory and here it is: you, insightful one, have sought to stymie your gut feelings for too long, relying instead on your years of academia, and, seeking to over analyze every nugget of minutia before coming to a decision you are often deciding wrong. Rise forth, intelligent one and know that the super computer lying in your subconscious is ready to do great things. Or, \"Use the Force, Luke!\"This coin has two sides and the dark side of the theory is this: you, oh wicked one, you have sought to judge quickly and decisively, but you have failed miserably as you have let prejudice, greed, malice, fear, and inexperience direct your soul and as such you will make grave mistakes and errors and perhaps, be judged quite harshly by society. You may be strong and smart Darth, but when we peel back the layer of evil and remove your robotic head, we see you for the pathetic, sick person your are.Less sarcastically stated: use your instinct when you have the facts and reasoning to back it up; be cautious about your quick judgments when you are in a panic or uneducated about a person or topic.I did like Blink. Did, but I felt a tad let down. Gladwell has taken much research by psychologists and researchers and tried to bring it into a form those who are not professional psychologists can understand and be entertained by. He does not however, give us an action plan or any tools to use his ideas, so, enjoy Blink, dear reader, and devise your own theory about how to apply Gladwell's ideas. Perhaps, that is what Gladwell wants us to do with Blink - think - but then that would not be using your instinct...",
            "Blink is one of those books that just draw you in the first few pages. I never wanted to put the book down! His interpretation of the human psyche is unparalleled. I truly view person to person interaction in a whole new light. First impressions play a larger role than we might think and oftentimes dictate the final result. Mr. Malcolm Gladwell breaks down snap judgments and reveals how powerful a tool they can be in decision making. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially our representatives in government.",
            "We are at a point in time when the interaction period between two people is shortening and information passes between two people at an increasingly rapid rate. The global reach of individuals is now extensive and continues to grow with technology. Due to these advancement in interaction between people, first impressions are imperative.In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell, composes an astounding analysis and study of first impressions. Referred to as \"thin-slicing\", Gladwell cites dozens of examples of situations that, for better or worse, were greatly changed due to thin-slicing and first impressions.This book is a must-read. It flows very smoothly. Gladwell has the ability to extend profound knowledge while keeping a conversational vocabulary. This makes it interesting and educational to everyone, which is quite important because an underlying theme to this book is that thin-slicing is something everybody should consider. Gladwell also keeps the analysis flowing smoothly by using dozens of everyday examples to which everyone can relate.My understanding of the conclusion in Blink is that there are two types of quick decision-making that should be used in two different ways. First, there is instinctive decision making. This is often done subconsciously. Gladwell argues that this should be used in very large, quick-decision matters, such as choosing a mate, deciding on a job, or even life-and-death decisions. These also work best in areas where you have been trained and tested extensively. If you are a policeman and have been shot at many times, when you are shot at again, you are better off trusting your instincts rather than thinking through the situation.On the other hand, if you are not trained and tested to make an important decision (such as shooting back at someone shooting at you), you may be better off trying to think it through correctly. Thinking it through carefully is the second type of first-reaction decision making. Gladwells argument as I understand it is that if the decision is fairly simple and straightforward, then it can be of greater reward to think it through. A decision such as what attire to wear to a job interview is probably best done after a bit of thought or even testing (what does your roommate think of your outfit).While these two conclusions are important to understand, I do not give them the justice they deserve. His book is written to explain every part of these decisions. Most importantly, he dives into facial expression first impressions and social recognition, which is extremely interesting. He even explains how most of us hold a racial bias, whether we think we are racist or not. He studies the subconscious from a very broad, simple, research-proven stance.This book will improve your life. Although it may only be for breif periods of realized decision-making, it is worth understanding when those decisions are life-changing.",
            "This book started with a bang and got me hooked. It is a very interesting premise and the accounts that Gladwell started with were relevant and powerful in illustrating his thesis. Halfway through the book, the different stories Gladwell included become less and less pertinent to his central thesis. The point becomes really diffuse in the second half of the book and he almost lost my interest. One of the stars in my rating is from the fact that it is a decent effort and an interesting premise, but could be executed better to maintain readers' interest.",

            "Gladwell without doubt understands the workings of the subject he explores in this monograph. From the moment I read its introduction, which described the curious case of some art experts identifying a fake kouroi (type of ancient Greek statue) at first glance, I \"knew\" (or \"thin-sliced,\" as Gladwell puts it) the book would be fascinating.As is well publicized, the book is a collection of stories of how first impressions knowingly or not dictates our decision-making. Each chapter consists of a major case study, adorned with smaller cases that support the major one. In its insightfulness in pointing out details of everyday behaviors that easily go neglected the book resembles Atul Gawande's recent Complications (a reflection on everyday practices of surgeons). In its structure and in its roundabout way in implicating the human condition the book is reminiscent of Oliver Sacks' clinical tales.Such similarity notwithstanding there is a difference between Blink and Gawande's or Sacks' books that shouldn't be overlooked. The subjects for each chapter of the essays of latter two were more or less independent; for Blink, the entire book is about rapid cognition. As such readers are subject to ask for more than a compendium of interesting tales. Examples of questions one might ask are: What percentage of our everyday decisions is based on rapid cognition? Are there particular fields/professions in which decisions are more prone to be dictated by first impressions? If so, why? What is a good criterion that can be used in determining whether to make the most of our brain's thin-slicing capability or to be wary of it?It was indeed interesting to learn about our brain's capabilities and the advances in psychological science that studies this capability. But it was Gladwell's mastery in story telling that was the most impressive.",

            "I'm a fan of Malcolm Gladwell. What I like about his writing is entertaining style as well as his ability to break conventional wisdom. Blink, no less, does the same thing. Here, he clearly articulates the way that the subconscious works, and provides us with a framework for understanding it - in terms of the snap judgments that we have to make, the thin-slicing that we do to make those judgments, and the necessity of experience and training to make better snap judgments. A highly recommended read!",
            "thanks for your dealing i will deal again and again with you because it was nice to deal with you",
            "I enjoyed the first few chapters immensely, as well as the conclusion. The author uses descriptive stories to make his case, and honestly I was not sure why he was telling some of the stories. Until the end of the book. I would suggest hanging in until the end if you make this purchase. Just commit to read the whole book or do not waste your money to buy it. Mr Gladwell has some cool ideas in this book, it just takes some time to pull them together with a unified theme.",
            "This book follows many others describing the hidden realities of how we tick. But there's good self-discovery offered in the insight of &#34;the-how&#34; our mental functions actually appear to operate.It is evident that we are almost all naturally outfitted to be many times more mentally powerful and efficient in our existences, yet almost none of us recognizes this capacity. Forget the self help, self actuation, self motivation books and lecturers - use this book and others like it to truly begin to understand how we really work. So many things will begin to make sense from direct experience - instinct, seeming extra sensory recognitions, gut awareness, hunches - all that sensory input that each of us absorbs day to day gets analyzed, strained and assigned a level of recognition, long before we are consciously aware of why we do or think what we do.This book is an excellent addendum to the Human Animal Operating Manual.",

            "Blink is about the subconscious computer we all use to think intuitively. It explores the thought pattern that gives a leader a \"hunch\" about making the correct decision, or that vibe we get from first impressions.The book starts out with ideas on how our subconscious can be used as a powerful tool to discern a tremendous amount of information from just a few details. What I did not expect, was that the remainder of the book focuses on how this tool can just as easily become a handicap leading to incorrect interpretations and poor snap judgments. Blink is not about honing our subconscious computer to make better and quicker decisions, but taking a second look and avoiding the obvious mistake.I think marketing is the most practical application of the material. One chapter discusses how product packaging can affect the way a consumer interprets the actual product. For example, consumers drinking 7-UP out of a yellow can tasted more lime than drinking from a green can, despite both cans containing the same ingredients. The author also analyzes the Pepsi Challenge of the 80s and his opinion on why Coke was never in any danger of losing the marketing battle.Another subconscious phenomenon examined is how one can make disastrously poor decisions under momentary pressure. The author hypothesizes why racial police beatings like Rodney King occur. A lot of the examples provided are about what the author considers subconscious racial discrimination, which he thinks is caused by the conditioning of living in a dominantly white society.Overall I think Blink was entertaining, but I don't consider most of the material very practical. I think it would be most appealing to readers of the Freakonomics type books. If you are deciding whether this would be a good read... I say go with your gut instinct.",
            "Great read that explains in detail a phenomenon that most of us encounter on a daily basis - thin slicing - making split decisions based on limited or no analysis. The book has numerous practical applications and should be read by anyone in a decision making role - executives, marketers, traders, etc. Definitely liked Blink more than Tipping Point. Looking forward to Gladwell's next book.",
            "An engaging and easily read essay on the way we think, and how \"shooting from the hip\" isn't always such a bad thing...when it's backed up by experience. Gladwell's research into an area completely removed from his own arena of expertise is detailed and thorough. He approaches the subject with enough humility and honest curiosity that the reader feels he is more along for the ride than being lectured from the podium as are most tomes on psychology and sociology. Especially noteworthy are his many references to specific studies and the occasional invitation to participate in a few prove to be...illuminating to say the least (I swore I wasn't bigoted, until...).",
            "I didn't want to write a review prior to completing the book but I have to say that it is an interesting read into the thought processing and decision making by our subconscious. I work in the field of stock trading and I know that there are times when snap decisions need to be made. The book explains some of the success that I have had as a trader as you are bombarded each day with so much information. Sometimes, your decision to buy or sell a stock hinges on quick decision making...there is no such thing as deliberation when you're trading.",
            "Good book.Go with the gut. If you feel you should read it, read it.If you feel it isnt for you, you are probably right.That is pretty much the book's premise.

We spend our time \"deciding\", but really it is just following through and supporting the decision we have already made.I have talked to people about this book and shared some of the concepts.What I wish we could do is have the marital prediction folks he writes about available to everyone. If people headed their predictions, the countries divorce rate would be at like 10%. Imagine that!

            "There are some relevant points in this book. The main point that I gathered from this reading is that our unconscious does some of the thinking for us, and decisions relating to this thinking are some of the best. However, if people were to think why they made these decisions, then they might not understand why they made the decision they made. Some of these decisions are based on intuition and result in good choices.I believe this book to be the scraps left over from the Tipping Point. This book is written along the same lines, but some of this material seems to have less of a scientific appeal for me. I believe there are many relevant points in this book.This is an OK read. I liked the Tipping Point and will see how I feel about Outliers.",
            "Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell is a book that teachers people to rely on there instincts. It's that first few seconds that your mind can tell if a stranger is friend or foe. According to the book we have to train our minds to focus on the facts. That sometimes less information can be a good thing in some instances.One should rely on their \"gut\" feelings too.By the way,",
            "I'm not quite done with the book but it is so interesting! I really like it and will probably read Gladwell's newest book, Outliers, as well. If you are interesting in marketing or communication this is a really great book to read. Highly recommend!",
            "The book is based on an interesting premise and the writing style is very easy to read, it really sucks you in. I personally REALLY like Malcolm Gladwell's books/lectures/ideas -- he's defeinitely one of my favorites.Note that after reading this book I'm not convinced that I completely agree with the fundamental arguement it's trying to make. I also didn't like it as much as Gladwell's previous book, Tipping Point. But, I don't want to sound overly critical. What I consider high quality writing isn't based upon whether or not I agree with the arguement the author is trying to make. The ideas are unique and creative and that alone is basis enough for me to give this book four stars. One last note is that you might want to look at the rebuttal to this book titled Think!

Seriously: be glad Gladwell writes so well - intuiton is no simple subject matter to \"thin-slice.\"Pavel Somov, Ph.D., Author of \"Eating the Moment: 141 Mindful Practices to Overcome Overeating One Meal at a Time\" (New Harbinger, Nov. 2008)",
            "An excellent book, just as good as Gladwell's previous landmark, \"The Tipping Point,\" \"Blink\" is fascinating in the confirmation that \"thin slice\" first impressions are more than intuitive, they are the results of subconscious factual significant experience and realities, and in many cases subconscious bias. Interesting too, is the evidence that we can think \"too much\" and counter our \"intuitive\" knowledge judgments with obfuscating factual study - \"introspection destroyed people's ability to solve insight problems\" and, as is quoted, \"what happens is that we come up with a plausible-sounding reason for why we might like or dislike something, and then we adjust our true preference to be in line with that plausible-sounding reason.\" I especially like the section on focus groups, how results on \"first impressions\" can be very wrong, \"We like market research because it provides certainty...but the truth is that for the most important decisions, there can be no certainty\" says Gladwell. I particularly like the example of how the Aeron chair by Herman Miller failed every focus group rating it took on looks, and \"likely to purchase\" reviews, yet became the best selling chair in the company's history (and then focus groups reversed their scores), ditto audience reaction to the best selling situation comedies of their time, \"All in the Family\" and \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\" Applying the analysis to a polarizing product today in the automotive industry, as someone who is looking at the launch of the new reaction creating Ford Flex vehicle (September 23, 2008), I'm wondering whether or not what Gladwell said about the initial \"looks\" rating for the Aeron chair is true for the new Ford Crossover in the looks department - that is, as its very different looking, \"Maybe the word `ugly' was just a proxy for `different.\" And when people get familiar with the `difference' time will change perception (as it did with the Ford Taurus over two decades ago). It will be interesting to see how this \"real world\" example of Gladwell's observations rolls out.",
            "We all take decisions \"in the blink of an eye\", even if it is only a decision of trusting a person or not. This is just how our brain works. Maybe we should not call them decisions, since the word decision implies some sort of reasoning and a process of weighing pros and cons. I would also not call this process thinking without thinking, maybe we should call it judging or pre-judging (\"prejudices\").A lot of information is stored, retrieved, compared and judged in seconds in our unconscious, a process of which we are completely unaware of. So it makes perfect sense that the more experienced and educated our unconscious is, the better these pre-judgements will be. I do not believe that a lay person would detect a false work of art by pure instinct (by a feeling of \"something is wrong with this work of art\"), like experts did in one of the stories. Their unconscious perceived some \"anomalies\" quickly, by comparison with the huge amounts of previously recorded information of the period's artistic style. The experts could not explain why they felt that way, since consciously they had not noticed the anomalies yet. On the other hand, I think that a person with deep knowledge of people might have unconsciously detected that the art dealer selling the work of art was uneasy in some way, so he might have got a \"hunch\" that something was wrong.This book tells you that you should trust your gut-feelings, but that you should \"nurture\" them with observation and expertise to make them more precise. Since these pre-judgements are influenced by our cultural environment and far quicker than ourselves and our conscious rational minds, they are also the basis of unfair prejudices that can make you act upon them and which are difficult to override (the author even claims that in situations in which time is of the essence, they are impossible to overcome, since we react upon them before thinking). Test your \"sexism\" in a brief exercise in a chapter of the book, you might be surprised...The best we can do is probably let our unconscious pre-judge and then we can still decide via an analytical thinking process. Nature gave us both abilities, let's use them both.This book is an excellent compilation of captivating studies in very different fields, carefully selected by the author to make his point. How by artificially altering your facial expressions your mood can change (for example if you put up a sad face you get grieved), how a psychologist can tell if a marriage is going to last by studying how the couple reacts in a simulated argument, etc. are some of the most interesting studies presented in the book.",

The writing is easy but intelligent, and I loved the specific examples and stories, particularly one about the war games. Not only do they help support Gladwell's notion but they're enough to create enjoyable stories by themselves.The main idea I took away? First impressions aren't everything, but they're a lot more than you realize.",
            "BlinkIs there a certain standard that keeps a very interesting essay / article from turning into a book? You see, the number of bloated books that I have been reading has triggered this question. A book like Blink, which discusses an interesting concept, could have been a great article in the NYT Magazine. A well developed article with enough evidence to convince the sceptic of the author's argument. However, to go for, what it seems like 1,000 evidence of the same concept is a waste of time and gives the book a highly 'commercial' feel.Picking on \"Blink\" again, I would have paid the same $9 had it been a 50 page book. Take a cue from Ben Hogan's \"Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf \" an absolute classic for every golfer in less than 120 pages written some 50 years ago!There are many examples of these books that go on and on about one single subject and prove it with 1,000 examples. For me to do that would mean that I, also, suffer from verbal diarrhea!",

People are always asking me how do I make such snap decisions or \"how come you so smart\" but the answer is in this book. You see, as Mr. Malcolm describes, you think right AS you see and NOT after. As you learn to apply these \"rapid fire thought\" techniques to your everyday life, you will be suprised. I'm now the ass-man (assistant manager) in my office and now I'm looking at another raise.",
            "I think this book (and Freakonomics) are two of the great non-fiction reads of the last year. Blink IS episodic but I didn't find that to be a negative in any way. Real, scientific insight into what we often dub \"intuition\".",
            "Once in a while, a book comes along that changes the way you see the world. Blink is one of those books.Psychologist Malcolm Gladwell explores the decision-making process of the sub conscious mind. Almost as fast as the speed of light, the brain processes information, evaluates input, sorts and prioritizes data and responds with a judgment, all in the blink of an eye. As humans, we are constantly, unknowingly, making snap decisions every minute we are awake.If we could slow down time to its smallest elements and study ourselves in the process, we might understand more clearly how and why we make the decisions we do. In the knowing of how that works, might come a better understanding of how to make more informed, more thoughtful, right decisions.Gladwell looks at married couples, police officers in the line of fire, combat troops, autistic people, and many others to grasp the complexities and simplicities of the decision-making process. Learning how we \"think without thinking\" may teach us how to see more clearly and critically and to make better choices along the way.Blink is a fascinating work.",
            "I like reading Gladwell's material--his articles in the NewYorker are first class--because of his passion for finding the esoteric and distilling it into something that an everyday person can understand. In Blink, Gladwell is nonpareil in amalgamating seemingly unrelated subjects and weaves them into a compelling argument, which goes as follows: our conclusions are often made at a speed faster than the blink of an eye, and we must be aware of this tendency, and check it in situations when it is a disservice. Gladwell, for instance, cautions against this when life or death situations are involved.The irony is that whereas Blink is about first-conclusion-bias and how it can cause egregious consequences, Gladwell is himself a victim of first conclusion bias, and this has compromised what would have otherwise been a superb book. For instance, we are presented with an unusual study that concerns the heights of the Fortune 500 C.E.O. According to Gladwell, there is causa justificio to believe that since most C.E.Os are over 6'-tall the Warren Harding error is at play. (Gladwell goes at length to explain what the Warren Harding error is.) I fear that by just looking at patterns and forming conclusions based on those patterns, Gladwell has himself been a victim of \"thin-slicing.\"Nonetheless, the writing style is first rate; William Strunk is smiling in his grave.Gladwell covers the Amadou Diallo case extensively, but relies almost entirely on the testimony of the officers as his source. I wonder what Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would have thought about such a methodology.The helpful anecdotes in the book were the Getty Museum Kouros Scandal, the study on the car dealerships in IL, the Munchen Philharmonic and trombonist saga, the story on Paul Ekman, and the Love-Connector.If it weren't for Gladwell's propensity to draw conclusions based on apocryphal situations or data, I would have rated it 5 stars. Nonetheless, a fascinating insight into the arcane field of cognitive psychology.",
            "This book was thoroughly enjoyable. I must confess that until now I didn't realize how much thin-slicing I do in my life fortunately most of it in a positive way and the few negative misuses are not significant, whew!Mr Gladwell carefully and simply elucidates the essence of thin slicing and when and how to apply it judiciousily. It really does make you question your dearly held preconceptions.I frind most touching chapters six and seven dealing with Diallo to be highly enlightening as well as saddening, as these scenarios will undoubtledly continue to be played out in major cities.Once again thanks a great and fun read.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell is not a typical business writer. He doesn't package common sense bromides into check lists for success. Instead, he observes, ties together disparate anecdotes, and he comments. He expects the reader to think, not just passively accept wisdom from on high. Like a good coach or teacher, he doesn't provide answers, he offers insights and suggestions.Blink asks us to consider whether -- and if so, when -- intuitive analysis trumps data-driven analysis. I found the book refreshing and even encouraging. Again, it doesn't offer a checklist for success, but it might make a discerning readers wonder how often they hide behind spreadsheets and presentations instead of trusting their gut and taking action.Those expecting a sequel to the Tipping Point will be disappointed. This is a new work with new questions and observations. However, like the Tipping Point, Gladwell makes the inquiry interesting and very readable. Highly recommended for businesses large or small.",
            "A review by Dr. Joseph SugliaMalcolm Gladwell's BLINK (2005) is not a meticulously researched book. Nearly all of its 'research' was derived from studies in THE JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY. In the book's Notes (a mere seven pages in length), you will count fifteen references to that journal and a few references to other sources.It seems appropriate that Gladwell's research is so slipshod. After all, BLINK is like a war machine pitted against research in all forms. There simply isn't time to investigate and deliberate, after all. And the more you research, the less you will know.The more you think, the less you will know.BLINK celebrates and affirms pre-knowledge, the uncritical reflex, the snap judgment, the spur-of-the-moment decision.Our initial perception of things is always correct, according to Gladwell, unless our minds are led astray by some extraneous matter. And all of us would come to the same conclusions, as long as we refine our \"thin-slicing\" skills. \"To thin-slice,\" in this context, means to extract the salient meaning from an initial impression. All of us are afforded an immediate and direct insight into the atemporal essences of things.All of this is 'argued' anecdotally. As I mentioned in the opening of the review, nearly all of the anecdotes were stolen from a single source. And in many cases, misappropriated. Gladwell tells us that students can instantly judge a teacher's effectiveness as soon as s/he walks into the classroom. What Gladwell doesn't tell us is that the article from which he derived this `truth' concerns the impact of a teacher's perceived sex-appeal on course evaluations.How the 'glimpse' actually works is never explained; we are told, in several places, that instantaneous intuition \"bubbles up\" unbidden from the recesses of the \"adaptive unconscious.\" \"The\" adaptive unconscious, mind you, as if there could only be one. This is, of course, monism, and Gladwell believes in absolutes.Of course, one's initial impressions may yield profitable results. But to say that one's immediate intuition of the world is inherently superior to slow and careful thinking is madness. One should beware of any mysticism, and Gladwell's blank intuitionism could easily be put in the service of a fascistic Wille zur Macht.BLINK's target audience is composed of Hollywood producers, literary agents, advertisers, and military strategists. You will learn in this book that films that exhibit Tom Hanks are superior to those that do not, that margarine tastes better when packaged in foil, that music sounds better when marketed the right way to the right people, that military strikes should be carried out without discipline or forethought. The surface impression is everything. Submit to your impulses!BLINK is American pop-culture's defense of its own stupidity.Dr. Joseph Suglia",
            "This book is a series of trivial little stores with vast conclusions drawn to fit the authors needs. In short, we often make decisions( quick or not). Some correct and some incorrect.

This is not a self help or an improvement book, just stories how decisions affects our lives. The stories are interesting but drawn out so much that you can skip chapters and not miss anything.",

            "Years ago, Legendary NBA Coach (recently retired) Phil Jackson started handing out books to his players, to rectify any flaws or hone any mental aspects of the game in the offseason. If a player had a problem with his jumpshot or defense, that could be rectified in practice, but if a player had an overarching attitude problem, or consistency problem, maybe that would have to be rectified with reading, and contemplation. And so, as far back as the Chicago Bulls era, Phil was handing out what he thought were great books, each one suited for each unique player's game, personality and weaknesses.A few years ago, I remember hearing he gave \"Blink\" to Kobe Bryant. Kobe, more than anything, has been known for these insane last second buzzer beater shots. He's taken tons of them. And if you factor in all the shots he missed, frankly, his hit/miss ratio isn't even that good. As the leader and captain on the team, he keeps finding himself with the ball in his hands at the end of games, and usually, he can get a shot off. Phil knew that Kobe was under incredible pressure late in games, in moments where every millisecond counts, and that's why he gave Kobe this book. If Kobe could just stop thinking altogether, he'd know exactly what to do. What could you improve if you could switch off your mind in the clutch?This review is going to sound like a Coda to the Steve Jobs book from last week. It just turned out that way. Steve, time and time again, relied on his intuition, laying waste to months and months of work, design, coding, budgets etc. What is our Intuition, really, and why is it so damn smart (at some things), if our senses and hunches seem, at first, so vague?First, let's go back to early stages of Man's evolution. We know that at some point, we were moving around, we were mobile, and we probably travelled in packs and tribes. How did early Man communicate? I can only speculate that there were a lot of visual signals (pointing, imitating large animals, etc), sniffing, tasting, yelling, whimpering, and so on. In other words, even if you toss the spoken word completely, you're still left with 5 senses, and those can still be employed to communicate (as a modern analogue, pro sports works, as does Improv Theatre, as Gladwell highlights in the book). Just look at a baby: the baby doesn't know what's going on, but instinctually does certain things to get what she wants. She's communicating at primitive levels. And we humans, in the modern era, do a weird thing: We teach ourselves to talk, to read, to study. We even learn thousands of very specific words to describe the world around us. Many of us even learn multiple languages. But if you really think about it, from Shakespeare to Stephen King, writing, at its best, is attempting to describe indescribable things. Writing and speaking, are, by their very nature, bastardizations, muddled, rough, approximations of pure thought and feeling. Verbal and written communication is inherently unclear and abstracted. So where am I going with this? Body language and instinctive forms of communication are pure, and it's that `language' we have to relearn, if we want to read systems and situations holistically. There is holistic communication going on, whether we like or not, it's just a matter of understanding the signals.Kobe Bryant dribbling up the floor with 11 seconds on the clock, down by three, isn't thinking (we hope) logically, but watching the floor for the tiniest of gaps, perhaps even noticing which of the opposing players is breathing heavily, or limping slightly. Where is the weak point?Why do some electronics companies spend so much time trying to design beautiful packaging, that seems to cradle the device like a precious jewel? Ultimately the packaging is going to be thrown out, right? The answer is that more companies are realizing that the whole experience of using a product contributes to the `Customer Satisfaction Rating` and if you push up that rating high enough, you get a sense of what kind of high price you can charge. That's perceived value. Visual, auditory, olifactory (eg. New Car Smell); it's obvious that all senses contribute, but perhaps those senses about a product, about a person, about a situation, are the most important of all.Over and over again, we chastize ourselves for `judging' people who dress like hoodlums, or look a little rough around the edges, but ultimately, aren't we just battling our own inner intuition? When we sit down to lunch with our high school friends, and one of them is wearing a beautiful gold watch, we subconsciously attribute positive traits to him, suddenly our minds start turning: \"How did he afford that?\", \"What did he say he did for a living? Something financial?\" We intuitively know everything we need to know about this person in just a few seconds, as long as we ignore everything we think we know, and listen to what our senses are telling us. Yes it's tricky. It's tricky because people often lie to us to improve their outward image/appearance. Toss out the company line, read the body, and the truth is right there, staring you in the face.More Reviews like this on 21tiger",

In 'Blink', Malcolm Gladwell will help you understand what happens during that first six seconds. Whether you are socially struggling or a master networker, you should check this out. Absolutely in keeping with his #1 best seller, 'The Tipping Point', now becoming a classic in personal development,behavior and business cannons.",
            "And who says first impressions don't count? Don't ignore the \"gut\" feelings tha come to you in the blink of an eye. Great instances of how this works.",
            "It was college level reading, too much research information thru out the book. Overall, I enjoyed it and learn something from it.",
            "In the interest of full disclosure I am a huge Malcolm Gladwell fan and thoroughly enjoy the way he presents and supports his theses. In \"Blink\" Gladwell seeks to show us how our subconscious effects our snap judgments and gut instincts. I really enjoyed the book, and thought the manner in which the evidence was presented was fluid. The book is a very easy read and I found it affected the way that I went about my own decision making and personal interactions on a daily basis. For readers who enjoy books that make you think, Malcolm Gladwell's Blink is a must read!",
            "I talk about this book so much at work (I am in retail) that I had to buy a copy for others to read. Very interesting if you like thinking about how people think or make decisions.",
            "Throughout the book, the author offers numerous examples of how people make snap judgments, and how some of these are harmful while others are more accurate than decisions made after over-analysis. Unfortunately, though, the author doesn't say much about how to distinguish the two. I think we all know that people make snap decisions and that some work out and some don't. Gladwell tells us little more than that. For a book like this, it would've been much more helpful if Gladwell could offer insights as to how and when people should use snap judgments rather than just offering examples of them.",
            "Classic Malcolm Gladwell which is always fascinating. A look at judgment, and when we should trust our instincts over our more considered thinking and when we should not.",
            "Repetitive, but thought provoking. The author tends to make the sames points using other's research. Fairly basic premise with some opposing points of view as well. Worth a read if you're bored. Otherwise, just read the overview and save the time and money.",
            "Gladwell's other books 'The Tipping Point' and 'Outliers' both were great to read and had some really interesting, important insights. 'Blink' is likewise, a great read but not with quite the same validity in the insights. Cognitive science is a deep and little understood domain so it is perhaps a little beyond a journalist such as Gladwell to be making any groundbreaking claims.But what he does do well, without fail, is provide interesting examples and find insights that a mere mortal would never even consider. He is at the very least, thought-provoking, and what more could you ask of a book than to make you really THINK about things?",
            "Very interesting read. I would suggest reading this book if you enjoy psychology and studies in human behavior. I read it in 3 days and couldn't put it down. I read Freakonomics and Superfreakonomics and Amazon suggested I might like this book. Good job Amazon.",
            "All of Gladwell's books are amazing! I could not put this book down. It makes you think differently about things!",
            "Excellent, one of the very few books that I have reread. Reminds me of a recent statement that: &#34;our consious mind is like a stowaway on a super tanker that thinks he is in comand&#34;. The subconsious mind is shown in action in this book.",
            "This book arrived very quickly and was exactly as advertised. Doing business here was very easy and I experienced no problems.",
            "Easy to read and full of interesting ideas and stories.Well written and thought provoking - Couldn't put it down",
            "I took a speed reading class one summer, and the book we were practicing on was Blink. First, I recommend learning speed reading. If you stick with the techniques that you learn, you can read at speeds exponentially faster than what you're currently at. Second, with regards to this book, I'd say it's pretty good. The material is very interesting, it really gets you thinking a different way. Malcolm Gladwell sure knows how to write books. He is an excellent author, and I think that this book should be on your to-do list for the next year. There is a little too much fluff in the book surrounding the juicy details, but nothing's stopping you from skimming past that.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell does it again. The mind is an amazingly complex thing. This book is about the first 2 seconds you look at something and come to a conclusion. With attention-grabbing stories to get the concepts across, I found myself making notes b/c they were so many things I'd like to share with others.",
            "Very intriguing book. Examines not what we typically call first impressions, but the first moment or so of that first impression. Provides numerous examples of how people's opinions are unconsciously formed in those first few seconds and how we should be aware of, and occasionally control those formations. The only real downside is the book occasionally lacks a cohesiveness. It is a collection of studies and events that the author attempts to pull together, and is somewhat tenuous at times. But, overall, I really enjoyed the read. One of the few books I've been able to sit down and really get into for hours on end. I wouldn't surprised if there are others out there who finished the book in just a few sittings as I did.",
            "Based around the concept of thin-slicing, this book promotes the idea that your initial thoughts / gut feeling are often the right way to proceed (but not always). There are many case studies to hammer in the point and look at it from different perspectives. I feel the concept was a bit oversold, confused, and not pulled together nicely at the end.In terms of the fundamental concept that we can learn to make better and faster decisions when we filter out excess data, I agree. This particularly holds if you are experienced in the field (i.e. with experience comes intuition).As for the \"Compelling\", \"Astonishing\" and \"Brilliant\" words being used to describe this book, I think that maybe \"Thought Provoking with Interesting Stories\" might be a better way to describe it.",
            "Gladwell writes interestingly and clearly about some interesting research. But it doesn't stick together for me; seems more a compilation of essays than a cohesive book. Nor do I believe the main simplistic conclusion people tend to draw from it is justified or helpful.More specifically, Blink doesn't at all justify the general simplification so many seem to be taking that it's ALWAYS (or even nearly always) best to go with immediate intuition/gut feel rather than more deliberate decision-making. Rather, one of the key aspects of judgement and decision-making is knowing when to go with a quick intuitive assessment and when a systematic approach is needed. Blink doesn't help me much with that at all; rather it seems to obscure the issue in my view.Hence I see the first chapters of 'Nudge' as a better popular introduction to decision-making. The first author of Nudge (Thaler) has the depth of experience in decision-making research that Gladwell lacks.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell is an entertaining writer. His book The Tipping Point almost made my Top Ten list last year, not only for the thoroughly enjoyable read (which it was), but also for the intriguing analysis into human behavior and consumerism that Gladwell offers.Blink carries on The Tipping Point's tradition of great illustrations and fascinating data. This is a book about \"the power of thinking without thinking.\" In summary, Gladwell shows us how our snap judgments are often more accurate than our deliberate decisions that we take months to make. Gladwell peppers the book with examples that prove his thesis, providing church leaders with plenty of stories that beg to be used as sermon illustrations.Gladwell also writes about the \"dark side of blink,\" when our snap judgments are wrong. He writes of police mistakes, voter shallowness, and the fact that Coke still outsells Pepsi, even when Pepsi wins hands-down in a taste contest.This book is entertaining, educating, and provocative, and it challenges some of our presuppositions about how the mind works.",
            "First, let me say that this is a good book. It's well worth your time to read. I don't think that it's as good as the Tipping Point though. This one seems to go a little longer than what is necessary maybe. It seems to be like Mr. Gladwell is trying to stretch it out a bit. The good thing about all of it though, is that it is a very quick read, and you won't have a lot of time invested into it. So definitely pick this one up, you won't regret it!",
            "The Book on the Nightstand - July 08The book falling off the nightstand this month isBlink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking. The take-away from this text is why and how we make snap decisions, and to what degree these decisions should be trusted. I walked away with a solid understanding of the why and how, but less so on the trust and accuracy of snap decisions. Statistically you should go with your first \"gut decision\", except when you shouldn't. The text left me feeling vague in that area.The Art of Digital Brandingcontrasts the Margaret Thatcher quote \"I make my mind up about someone within the first ten seconds and I very seldom change it\" with the research of psychologist Alexander Todorov, that \"most people actually make a judgment about someone based on his facial appearance within one-tenth of a second\", (page 27).How is this used in design? A study by the Human-Oriented Technology Lab at Carleton University shows that \"people can make an instinctive decision as to whether a web site is good or bad in 1/20th of a second\", (page 34). An on-line consumer has made a decision to purchase within the first 40 seconds of entering a web site.The design and balance of the first or home page of a site is critical, one of the primary metrics of Google Analytics is the \"bounce rate\". Bounce Rate is the percentage of single-page visits (i.e. visits in which the person left your site from the entrance page). Bounce Rate is a measure of visit quality and a high Bounce Rate generally indicates that site entrance (landing) pages aren't relevant to your visitors. A high bounce rate from the main page reflects that people fled your site after a fraction of a second that your material was unsuitable for them. Like the Prime Minister, they probably won't be back.",
            "Like the reviewer who posted just before me, I also thought the book could have made an excellent article. You can certainly skip around in this book and get the point of it. I forced myself to read the whole book even though I lost interest maybe halfway or 2/3 of the way through because the author seemed to be just supporting his main idea with more and more examples. I thought I should force myself to read the whole book in case I missed some amazing new insights, but there was nothing new in it. I enjoyed the examples though, which is why I give this book 3 stars. All in all it was truly mediocre at best.",
            "For me, this book was a good collection of stories, that hold some useful idea in them. And that is really exciting. But, unfortunately, as it was said above, Gladwell fails to bring the general idea (at least until the few paragraphs at the end of the book) and usually whiffle between those short stories. What's good - he gives you some ideas of what you might want to explore more seriously later.",
            "Sometimes decisions need to be made quickly. All of our knowledge, education, experience, reasoning, intuition, common sense and confidence must come together rapidly.Malcolm Gladwell calls quick decision making thin slicing in his book: Blink. Thin slicing is the ability to focus on a small set of critical variables to make a quick decision rather than consciously considering every possible variable.Many decisions are time dependent. Weighing the amount of information needed before making a decision, against the time available is a challenge.Examples of when thin slicing is needed: combat, avoiding a car accident, or anything requiring an immediate decision. Another common name for thin slicing is thinking on your feet.Gladwell does an excellent job of explaining what happens in these situations. For example:\"...in interviews with police officers who have been involved with shootings, these same details appear again and again: extreme visual clarity, tunnel vision, diminished sound, and the sense that time is slowing down. This is how the human body reacts to extreme stress...\"Besides the excellent examples given in the book, here is a classic example of using thin slicing.Thin slicing was used on multiple occasions during the US space program. Gene Kranz (a flight controller on the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo space programs) writes about the need for quick accurate decisions in his book: Failure is not an Option.Endless intensive simulations were run with the controllers, flight crew and others before every launch. Everyone's skills had to be razor sharp during the actual missions. Decisions had to be accurate and made in real time. There was little, and sometimes no room for error. Lives were at stake. Risk was part of their business.Gene Kranz sums up how he gained his skills to be a top flight director when he said:\"The flight director's ultimate training comes at the console, working real problems, facing the risks, making irrevocable decisions.\"Although we may not be faced with life and death decisions, we will (on occasions) have to make quick decisions. The better our skills and Critical Thinking are, coupled with training and quickness, the more prepared we will be to make sound decisions in the blink of an eye!The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking",
            "\"Blink\" reads more like a review of studies of the consequences of making snap decisions. Guess what? Sometimes you're right and sometimes you're not. How enlightening.Nevertheless, the experiments that are discussed are fascinating, and will give you insight into when to trust your intuition.",
            "Having taken sociology as a minor in college, I personally found this book to be quite intriguing as Malcom Gladwell did an outstanding job in explaining and providing examples of how people react with one another or find themselves in certain situations from the perspective of utilizing the unconscious portion of one's mind. Simply put, the title of his book, says it all! His scientific approach to rapid cognition, along with other studies such as the race IAT, will leave you dumbfounded as you try to attempt to either shape, confirm, or deny your own opinion of how your perceive people of different races when you associate them with different words. I have always loved learning about people, social groups, and knowing why people behave or respond they way they do with other people and/or other cultures. This book just takes it a step further by explaining how people's rapid intuitiveness and instant judgment often provides a more accurate conclusion than what they would have otherwise spent large amounts of time thinking about only to surface with poor judgment aka the wrong answer/solution (in some cases....not all). If anything, this book will make you a bit more life smart/people smart/street smart in being more mindful and understanding of how people behave and make judgments...especially when judgments occur in the BLINK of an eye!",
            "In this well-written and easy-to-read book, Malcolm Gladwell explores the ways our first impressions and judgments are formed. It approaches this theme from both the positive and negative points of view, showing how oftentimes our first instinct can be the correct one even when the evidence seems to show something different, while at other times our snap judgments can be based on faulty physiological and socially-conditioned mechanisms. Gladwell includes examples from a variety of disiplines, from science and war to marketing and the arts. Some reviewers have criticized the author for not providing more of science to validify his theory. However, Gladwell is not a scientist, and he is not attempting to posit a new and wide-ranging theory for the world to accept. Gladwell's strength is in making the science of everyday concepts accessible and applicable for readers who may not otherwise read about such a topic. The book succeeds in making the reader question and think about the conclusions we reach - both in the heat in the moment and after conscious deliberation. He also offers potential guidelines for deciding when each is preferrable. Some of the issues he probes are of vital importance in how individuals and institutions make decisions in a variety of fields, which makes his book of great importance as well as of great interest.On a personal note, I found this book to intersect very nicely with some of my own research into the role of technique and structure in creativity, improvisation, and flow. The real-life examples Gladwell provides definitely make the topic engaging and alive, which I believe is very necessary in getting important messages across in a way that is accessible to people from a variety of backgrounds and education levels. So as a researcher and as a writer, I found Gladwell's book to be very valuable.",
            "The book was interesting and I enjoy learning about common things on a deeper level. But I thought the book was a little contradictary. In some stories he talked about those first 2 seconds, the results of \"thin slicing\", and the appropriate response from it and other times the inappropriate response occurred. It had me a little confused. After reading the book (well really I listened to it on CD) I had to go and read what the book was about again. Then I realized more that it's about the \"thin slicing\" the right information in those first few seconds. Interesting information but I thought by the end of the book I would have learned how better to think without thinking and I don't think I did. I WOULD be interested in doing some of the facial expression recognition training videos he talked about though!",
            "I am still on my Malcolm Gladwell kick. What I enjoy about his books is that he finds the most interesting and quirky research to educate me about. You will learn things from this book that you aren't likely to learn in any other way. that being said, there are whole paragraphs that are redundant and extraneous and you can just skip over. I was fascinated by the research on race and instant recognition. I was also interested by what he learned about the Millennium Challenge and about New Coke. Very interesting stories and the idea of thin slicing is definitely something to consider. This book is worth your time.",
            "For certain decisions, such as determining how likable Tom Hanks is and determining a person's personality by looking in their rooms, our intuition is quite accurate. For other decisions, such as predicting the success of a musician and falling for the good looks of a presidential candidate, our intuition often fails us. Also, our preferences and why we do what we do often can not be articulated well and/or are rationalized in ways that don't make any sense. For example, our verbally expressed preferences for a partner often don't jive with the actual partners we choose and our food product preferences are subject to marketing schemes but we are unaware of it.In essence, the book mentions that our decisions are subject to prejudices, past experiences, ignorance, psycho-biology, preferences, expertise, and a whole slew of other variables. In the beginning of the book, Gladwell states the premise that haste doesn't make waste and that sometimes quick decisions are better than decisions that have analyzed every angle. But later in the book, Gladwell mentions how prejudices can cloud our judgment and how stepping back and analyzing the situation allowing time to be our friend is a better approach to making decisions, for example when a cop is faced with a potential criminal. Also, he mentions how the body guards protecting former US president Reagan, didn't have enough time to react to the shooter who attempted to assassinate Reagan. So the efficacy of our decisions are either benefited or hurt by snap decisions and benefited or hurt by longer more deliberated decision; the quality of our decisions depend on the context of the situation.Essence of the essence: Decisions are based on a crapload of stuff.",

            "I haven't read the rest of Gladwell's library yet, however, if the rest of his books meet the quality of this one, I'll pick them up. I was fascinated by the case studies used to prove his point of snap judgments- it really went a long way to explain how we can 'know' something without any empirical evidence.",
            "If you read the first chapter of this book, you'll get the point he's trying to make. It's an interesting point, but it should be summed up in a 10 page article, not a 200 page book.(I've also read that the results of the studies he cites in his first chapter are exaggerated)",
            "When an insightful friend started to refer to me as \"Blink\", I decided to sit down and explore the reason behind my new nickname. \"Blink\" paints a picture for those of us who speak or act without careful consideration. I liken the word blink to \"gut feeling.\" It's the phrase we use as justification when whatever we have said or done is over. For instance, after I have taken an exhausting exam, I look back at answers I may have changed because I started to reason out why it might be a different answer. But Gladwell confirms that when we think about an unconscious decision we made, the conscious and the unconscious don't match up. Hence the reason why you should always go with your gut on an exam. However, Gladwell also points out that when we act on something driven by an unconscious mind, or if put on immense pressure or stress, if we aren't practiced in that area of expertise, we might find ourselves acting on false pretenses.Not only was I able to relate his findings to my own personal life, but I found his various pieces of research and historical events riveting. As a graduate student, I can better appreciate his theories due to the careful examination of data and real world occurrences. His suggestions regarding discrimination could provide new opportunities for those often burdened by aspects of our social system. If it doesn't provide opportunities, it at least allows readers to understand how we often associate negative thoughts to individuals different or historically discriminated against, without even meaning to! It seems when most of us make quick judgments, we aren't making them based on logical reasoning, but on appearances and superficial ques--Gladwell backs these statements by detailed and astounding examples. I also found his findings on relationships interesting; although, I would only trust the most highly acclaimed to predict one's marital success from listening to a short conversation and then thin slicing based on tone, facial expressions, and words used.Often our gut can get us into trouble, but \"Blink\" offers a case by case description of how being referred to as \"Blink\" may not be such a bad nickname after-all.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell, adored by the masses and mocked by the academy, has set out to explore human cognition and decision making in his book \"Blink,\" despite the fact that he is a historian by training and a journalist by trade. The premise of this book is that we humans have two speeds when it comes to decision making: \"really fast\" and \"regular.\" We are all familiar with regular- pause and think, employ logic, maybe even write stuff down on paper, and eventually come to a rational conclusion. Really fast, or as Gladwell calls it, blinking or 'thin-slicing', happens in much shorter times, ranging from milliseconds to know if a tennis serve will go awry, to mere minutes to know if a marriage will survive the next 20 years. The ability to accurately use the faster method is discussed by Gladwell, who provides several very entertaining and well-written stories detailing the split-second decisions that can be made, such as telling that a piece of art is a fake by just a quick glimpse, rather than expensive and lengthy laboratory tests. There is also a dark side to this method of decision-making, and in several very entertaining and well-written stories, Gladwell shows how white men turn into evil misogynistic racists when making split-second decisions. Take it or leave it, but Gladwell is an extremely talented and engaging storyteller. There is a lot of redundancy within and across chapters, and I estimate the book could be maybe 100 pages lighter.The individual stories lack scientific rigor, and the book lacks an overall conclusion (what is given is just another story). Yes yes, this book is classified as \"popular science,\" but that does not excuse the fact that no attempt is made to construct a cogent and complete argument, including acknowledging competing ideas. The burden of proof is on he who makes the claim- while Gladwell may think he is being \"deeply intellectual\" and forcing the message of his book upon the readers by not having a solid conclusion, thus forcing us to blink for ourselves, instead he left the roof off of the house he just built, and I'm clearly not alone in this opinion. Another thing noticeably lacking is advice on how to do the fast thinking for yourself- Gladwell never explicitly says it, but the key it seems, is to study your field for years and years- and by then, you will have built in your brain the equivalent of muscle memory for thought processes, and you will be able to trust your gut a lot more....go figure.I'm ambivalent about recommending this one. This is possibly the worst place to start if you want to learn in depth the science of human thought and decision making, but it is a wonderful place to start if you know nothing on the topic and would like to get a feel for what it is all about. Either way, if you read \"Blink\" for entertainment value, you won't be too disappointed (though as I said, the stories do drag on a bit).",
            "When this book came out in hard cover, I wanted to read it, but decided to wait for the paperback version. I don't know many people who haven't read it by now. I am finaly getting to it and it is a terrific book!",
            "A very interesting novel. A combination of first thoughts, wisdom, and experience brings us to the title \"Blink\". I have always enjoyed the reading on the whys and wherefores of actions of the human race. Always being surprised this book brought the fact to me that somewhere along the line I had learned quite a bit. I hightly recommend the book.",
            "Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking is a book you can't put down. A very inspiring and easy read. Malcolm Gladwell's writing style is smooth and delicious without being too complicated. This book is for anyone interested in those little things you \"know\" but can't explain....Also read the Tippimg Point by Gladwell...you'll feel like you've learned something!",
            "This book should be taught in economics courses side by side with Freakconomics. The indepth coverage of economic learning is amazing. The best part, its not the boring economic coverage that is seen in the class room (changes in the monetary supply, money multiplier, etc), its the real scarcity and results. I highly recommend this book.",
            "Not nearly as good as the tipping point and a little too 'technical' at some points. It took me almost twice as long to get through this book as it does most books that are of equal size. Nonetheless I still think it was an interesting read, it just would fall lower on my list of things to read over again.",

            "Mr. Gladwell did a fine job following up Tipping Point. I've already noticed the way I see things both when I step back and think about it and on my first impression. I have more appreciation for thin-slicing now. This book would be great on a 6+ hour flight.",
            "The observations and data in Blink are amazing. Blink is well worth the time which is why I have purchased copies for friends and co-workers.",
            "This simple book, provides more understanding and insight into why we think the way we do than most \"heavier\" books on such subjects. If you have ever wondered why you \"just know\" something but could never figure out how, then this book will help demystify such things for you.In business, we should do more to recognize and apply the principles of \"Blink\" and we should be less quick to judge those who appear to make snap judgements themselves. Assuming that they have read, researched or worked for long periods in a given field then it is quite likely not as much a snap judgement as you think.This is a great read, accessible and well written with many powerful stories to support the well constructed arguments.",
            "This book is a reflection on \"the blink\" a peculiar survival mechanism humans beings have honed generation by generation from the distant past to this present age. Blink (the book) validates what many of us already knew, and that is we often fare better by trusting our instincts (our proverbial gut feeling) than by trying to arrive at a decision after long deliberation. Of course there are times in life when you want to carefully reflect, but just as often, our instincts---our \"blink reaction\" this almost superconscious distillation of a lifetime's worth of past input, decisions, and outcomes---takes care of us even better. We've all experienced this, I suppose, and can relate to times we've let our reactions to a circumstance guide us, but to read about it here is mentally awakening. Citing real life examples of when fire fighters, pilots, soldiers, doctors, salespeople and others relied on their capacity to instantly sum-up a person or situation and then act on that summation to best advantage, author Malcolm Gladwell crafts a colorful argument that celebrates the existence of this tool. The 1999 Amadou Diallo case, wherein a man was gunned down by New York City Police in what turned out to be a tragic mistake, illustrates that the blink can also be dead wrong and have tragic consequences, and Gladwell cites the matter of the election of President Harding in 1920 as being a time when a huge portion of the nation \"blinked\" the wrong way, after letting outward impressions cloud more latent judgments on Harding's personal capability. The blink is a capacity, Gladwell says, that can be heightened, trained, and lost altogether. He also suggests that just as some people are more musically talented, well, so some people are hardwired to be more intuitive than others. Is this a carte-blanche to lay aside logic and flit through life relying on first impressions? I sure hope readers don't come off seeing it that way, but as an exercise in advocating a hypothesis, Blink is one of the more original reads to come off the presses in quite some time.(Thanks, Diana, for lending me your copy.)",
            "As hard as it has been to think about some of the limits to my attitudes Blink has created a new awareness in me of areas where my judgements have been too quick and based on prejudices. It helped me see areas where I have been influenced and not really thought about how I think. A great read.",
            "Provocative book on the positive power of snap judgments, but it also addresses how they can mislead us. The \"editorial review\" here is good so I won't go on and on about the book. I liked a section on how it is more effective to make decisions when you are 60-70% sure, rather than wasting extra time getting to 100%.",
            "I believe that Malcolm Gladwell belongs to the new generation of authors - the ones who definately look at the things out of the box and take their readers with them. The best thing about the Blink is that it makes you reflect on your own expereinces in life, even makes you think in a different dimention. I found this book a fascinating and easy reading - great book to read after work and add more enthusiasm into the daily routine. This book definately stays in your mind for a long time as a point of reference - and if you are interested in a deeper understanding of one of the concepts, Gladwell offers a wonderful choice of literature for the curious minds.",

I don't know what blinking has to do with it at all, though & that's why only four stars. Yeah!",
            "I have long believed that we need to trust our \"gut feelings\" about situations and people. This is now described and spelled out in a book - BLINK. A gut feeling has to do with instant recognition about something. It also has to do with your mind's ability to call up experiences on the spot as you confront a new experience or situation or person. BLINK affirms and ratifies those recognitions and judgments. The book details many interesting scenarios regarding this ability that we all possess and need to trust. Lynne Coates, retired teacher",
            "Blink is about rapid cognition, about the kind of thinking that happens in a blink of an eye. Making a decision within the first two seconds of looking-the glance that knows and interprets the fact in an instant. Gladwell emphasizes the first two seconds, because in that instant conclusions that we reach are really powerful and really important and, occasionally, really good. Unlike intuition, what goes on in the first two seconds is perfectly rational; it's just thinking that moves a little faster and operates a little more mysteriously than the kind of deliberate, conscious decision-making that we usually associate with thinking.Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology, he shows how the difference between good decision-making and bad has nothing to do with how much information we can process quickly, but on the few particular details on which we focus. Gladwell reveals how we can become better decision makers--in our homes, our offices, and in everyday life. The result is a book that is surprising and transforming. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.Gladwell, campaigns for snap judgments and mind reading with a gift for translating research into splendid storytelling. Building his case with scenes from a marriage, heart attack triage, speed dating, choking on the golf course, selling cars, and military maneuvers, he persuades readers to think small and focus on the meaning of \"thin slices\" of behavior. The key is to rely on our \"adaptive unconscious\"--a 24/7 mental valet--that provides us with instant and sophisticated information to warn of danger, read a stranger, or react to a new idea.The book is well rounded as it presents the limitations with rapid deductions. There are obvious caveats about leaping to conclusions as: marketers can manipulate our first impressions, high arousal moments make us \"mind blind,\" focusing on the wrong cue leaves us vulnerable to \"the Warren Harding Effect\" (i.e., voting for a handsome but hapless president). Then in explaining the Pepsi challenge he elaborates how people can be attracted to Pepsi (which is sweeter than coke) in taste tests. However if the entire drink is taken Coke is markedly more attractive to the same group. In a provocative chapter that exposes the \"dark side of blink,\" he illuminates the failure of rapid cognition in the tragic stakeout and murder of Amadou Diallo in the Bronx. He underlines studies about autism, facial reading and cardio uptick to urge training that enhances high-stakes decision-making.",
            "I think most of us are aware of this \"sixth sense\" or have heard of it before, but the evidence presented by the author is quite interesting. Definitely worth the read.",
            "This is an excellent, thought-provoking book, as was Tipping Point. I found it to be a fascinating and entertaining read. Malcolm Gladwell is terrific, as always.",
            "Had to pick this up for a class, and as with most examples of Gladwell's work, all you get are sloppy examples that may or may not loosely apply to the word he has chosen for a title. All he does is provide shaky examples of what he want's to \"prove\" without giving any kind of nod to a counter example. To make matters worse the topic of the book is a dangerous one for people who believe that Malcom Gladwell has anything good to say. Please, for the sake of mankind do not read this book.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell hit the nail on the head and produced a great book. This book (in short) is about analyzing a situation in the blink of an eye. It refers to professionals and everyday people. It gives examples about how and why your brain processes information so quickly. Anybody can read this book and everybody should read it.",
            "This 'series of shorts' is a great way to pass an airplane ride. But be careful, you might find a subject or two you want more info on. This particular book led me to several other purchases. Some were quite interesting. Others were so obtuse I was left wondering how Gladwell found an interesting subject in them.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell ties his stories well together - he is a master at making things previously unnoticed incredibly interesting.His books are very fast and easy reads and yet very applicable to your everyday life and outlook.",
            "I loved the first few chapters of the book.The story of the artists' judgement over the piece in the museum in a few seconds as against the thorough analysis of the scientists' and lawyers' was a great example of how sometimes decisions based on intuition are more accurate.I love the way Gladwell describes the storytelling problem of people wherein we try and justify things not because they have a justification but because a story makes it more believable. The examples of subjects exhibiting a racial attitude even when they thought otherwise and the explanation of racial attitude coming in two levels: conscious and unconscious was very provoking as well. Another wonderful theory was that of music auditions becoming fairer when a screen was brought in between the panel and the participant. Shutting off too much information by removing one of the senses really does make the other sense better. However, there were some examples in the latter half that seemed somewhat less convincing to me such as the war commander, the Pepsi challenge and the Warren Harding Error. When I read 'The Power of thinking without thinking' on the cover, I was hoping to read about some great instances of this power that throw more light into the art and make the reader more equipped with the decision making process.I was a little disappointed here. The booked lacked a conclusive and convincing end but it was still an enjoyable read with all its research and stories.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's Blink is an otherwise very interesting book with a very serious flaw: what he calls the Warren Harding Mistake. Gladwell makes the point that appearances can be deceiving, which most of us have experienced. But this example of Warren Harding is not a good one. Underlying his argument is an implied assumption that Harding was campaigning for President in the post 1960 television age. In 1920, most Americans still lived on farms and got their news delivered through the mail. There was no radio or television. Harding campaigned from his front porch like a Gilded Age candidate. It's doubtful that most voters even knew what he looked like.Harding was elected President in 1920 by 60 per cent of the electorate. It was one of the largest vote majorities in American history. His predecessor, Woodrow Wilson, had been elected and reelected by narrow pluralities and helped by a divided Republican party in 1912. After being reelected in 1916, Wilson led the country into World War I that began with a burst of patriotism but ended in dubious European diplomatic machinations and in anger and disillusionment.Gladwell mentions polls of historians that rank Harding as among the worst Presidents in American History. The poll of historians Gladwell is probably referring to is the 1962 poll commissioned by Arthur Schlesinger, Sr. President Kennedy was invited to participate because he was a published author of history, Kennedy declined, because after one year in office, he said he understood the role events played in making or breaking a presidency. Kennedy did comment, after seeing the results, he thought the poll had overrated Woodrow Wilson.What makes Harding's presidency the worst? Well, no doubt his was the one where a foreign army invaded the United States and burned down the Capitol and the White House? Wait a minute that was another President.The upshot of Harding's presidency was this: Harding died of congestive heart failure two years and five months into his Presidency, just as the Teapot Dome scandal boiled over. Coolidge assumed the Presidency upon Harding's death. Coolidge appointed a bipartisan team of special prosecutors. They indicted two cabinet officers. One was convicted, the other acquitted. The acquitted cabinet officer was forced to resign by Coolidge. Then he wrote a book blaming Harding for everything. Harding was unavailable for comment. Coolidge was elected to his own Presidency by 54 per cent of the vote in 1924.Where the historians saw idealism and nobility in Wilson, the electorate came to see megalomania and delusions of grandeur. Where historians saw Harding as a small town, corrupt Babbitt (referring to the character in the eponymous Sinclair Lewis novel), the electorate saw a familiar gilded age politician who was probably corrupt but wasn't a threat to their life and limb.The real Warren G. Harding mistake here is in assuming that expertise is without bias. I just don't agree that Harding is an example of looks deceiving the voters. I think the voters knew exactly who Harding was and that was what they wanted.But Malcolm Gladwell is a very original thinker and the rest of Blink is well worth your time.",
            "I was initially drawn toward Blink: the Power of Thinking Without Thinking, by Malcolm Gladwell, because of my interest in how people think, and why we choose to believe certain things or take certain actions. The subtitle leapt out at me, filling me with high expectations for Gladwell's book. Thankfully, Gladwell exceeded these expectations with his developed thesis and absorbing writing style. In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell explains how to predict the quality of a relationship in just a few minutes, how George Sorros made his billions, how to read a person's face, why speed dating is successful, and many other topics you'll wonder why you never wondered about. Blink is rightfully a \"#1 National Bestseller,\" as stated on the cover.Gladwell begins by explaining that our unconscious mind often helps us make decisions (called \"thin-slicing,\" \"snap judging\" or \"mind reading\"). However, we often misuse our intuition by stereotyping unknowingly, so we should make a deliberate effort to not judge by appearances. Then, Gladwell states that if we overanalyze a situation, we will probably make the wrong decision. We can improve \"mind reading\" with practice, as expert psychologists and food critics have done. Then, in the afterword, Gladwell tells us that his main purpose is to reduce racism and prejudice, whether it is unconscious or conscious.Gladwell masterfully adds layer upon layer to his thesis throughout each chapter. Each chapter contributed a new idea to the main idea, while staying on track, and not branching out into seemingly random topics, as some of his other books do, specifically What the Dog Saw. Gladwell proves his point with personal experiences, stories, statistics, and even a test that you can take online ([...])! I also appreciated Gladwell's straightforward writing style, which was especially helpful when explaining how people think - a very complicated topic!For me, the chapter that was the most attention-grabbing, and was the most aptly connected to all of Gladwell's points, was Chapter 6, titled \"Seven Seconds in the Bronx: The Delicate Art of Mind Reading.\" In Chapter 6, Gladwell vividly describes a shooting in the Bronx, in which the police, using intuition based on stereotypes, shot Amadou Diallo, because they assumed he was going to shoot them. Because of incorrect snap judgments, these police officers presupposed that Diallo, who was standing idly outside, was a burglar. They assumed that he had a gun, that he was pulling it out, and that he was going to shoot them, when, in fact, Diallo was just getting his wallet from his pocket, because he thought the officers would stop bothering him if they saw his ID. This tragic story demonstrates the pitfalls of amateur thin-slicing. Additionally, Chapter 6 was my favorite chapter because it allowed Gladwell's captivating writing style to shine. I found myself absorbed by Gladwell's play-by-play of the seven seconds that determined life or death for Amadou Diallo. This chapter encapsulated Gladwell's \"real lesson of Blink: It is not enough simply to explore the hidden recesses of our unconscious. Once we all know about how the mind works- and about the strengths and weaknesses of human judgment- it is our responsibility to act.\"Although, overall, I rated Blink as a five-star book, I felt that Gladwell could have shortened some of his stories. His constant summaries were very helpful, but they were excessive. (I find it odd that Gladwell first wrote Blink, and over-summarized, and then wrote What the Dog Saw, and couldn't manage to stay on the topic he said he would talk about.)Overall, I immensely enjoyed reading Blink, because it was a stimulating, smooth read. Gladwell successfully supported his thesis: we make split-second decisions, which we should ensure are well-made. In an interview with Malcolm Gladwell, he sums up Blink by saying we should pay attention to \"the smallest components of our everyday lives...when we meet a new person or have to make a decision under conditions of stress. I think it's time we paid more attention to those fleeting moments. I think that if we did, it would change the way wars are fought...the way couples are counseled...and on and on. And if you combine all those little changes together, you end up with a different and happier world.\"",
            "This book tells you two points: 1. Blink is possible 2. It takes practice. That's it. I don't think I've learned a lot from this book.",
            "I'll do what Gladwell suggests inside the first chapters, \"Thin-Slicing,\" where one brings all one's experience and intuition to bear in the first impressions of the book. It's a nice book for the safe discussion of what clever scientific observation would say normally goes on inside our skins. That's it. Unless you're in a field where you want to determine how people make decisions in popular culture, get this book from a lending library and save the shekels. This is a book I've read to find out why it sold well.And I'll offer this: it's a pleasant read with very interesting anecdotes. It could give more courage to your convictions that skill isn't always backed by decades of experience. But this is not a book to provide pointers on how to develop your skills in thinking without thinking. You already know how to do that. Those skills are called intuition and instinct.Maybe I'll change this review after I finish the book ;)",
            "From page one until the end of the afterword, there is onestory after the next, pitting the unconscious versus theconcsious mind in the decision-making proccess. I thoughtit was a tough booK to read aaannnddd understand all of it.The whole face-reading / mind-reading portion was wwaayy over-the-top. I would still like to read \"\"THE TIPPING POINT\"\",though!!",
            "With this book, Gladwell is out to do three things: (1) demonstrate that decisions made quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately, (2) show when we should trust our instincts and when we should be wary of them, and (3) tell us how our snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled. To carry out these tasks, he uses examples that grab your attention. He tells about a psychologist who worked out a method of accurately predicting whether a marriage will last by watching a couple converse for fifteen minutes. It is done through the recognition of patterns. Another example is how an employer could tell whether to hire a potential employee by examining his/her bedroom. He tells how a doctor need not fear malpractice suits if he/she does two things: spends more time with patients and treats them with respect. He looks at speed dating and notes that people tend to make better decisions about potential dates when they don't analyze why they like or don't like someone and just go with their instincts. He tells about how more women and people of color have been hired for professional orchestras when the auditioners are behind a screen. Gladwell's book is fascinating reading and will cause you to rethink the way you understand the decisions you make",
            "Malcolm Gladwell is an essayist who made his bones working for the New Yorker. His first book, THE TIPPING POINT, proved to be a pretty nice commercial and critical success. BLINK, the follow up, seems to stray away from the quality of his debut. BLINK: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking is a pop-psychology book whose main argument is that human judgment is best when its immediate. Gladwell's assertion is that our immediate reaction to events are often the most appropriate. The opposite claim is made as well -- we seem to make our worst judgments when we dwell on them and think about them critically.Gladwell always has an engaging and captivating voice. In his essays, he has the ability to take some of the most seemingly mundane subjects and make them a fascinating topic to think about. BLINK is no buck from this trend; it is very well written, and there's a lot here to think about. The biggest problem with this book is the biggest problem with many of his essays, and in particular, his third book OUTLIERS; he works to prove his hypotheses rather than disprove other possible alternatives. Gladwell uses an assortment of experiments to \"prove\" that our snap judgments are more valuable than otherwise, but he never really gives much credence to the myriad of evidence that suggests otherwise. He gives a few examples, a few anecdotes, a few interesting stories, and that's all the evidence the reader should be expected to want, right?Unfortunately, BLINK proved to not be very convincing. It did, however, prove to be a very fun and engaging book. Even though I was not quite convinced, the ideas presented here are fun to think about. I'd recommend BLINK to other fans of Gladwell's work (or popular science in general), but as always, take it with a grain of salt.",
            "I'm taking the time to write this review only to add to the numbers of 1-star reviews, and therefore hopefully give potential buyers pause before purchasing. I don't know when I've been so disappointed by a book. The reason why I was so disappointed is because the introduction to the book, and the cover of the book stating it's about \"the power of thinking without thinking,\" leads one to believe you're going to get some solid information about how to harness the power of thinking without thinking. Psych! Instead the book is (as the majority of reviews 2-stars and below point out) just a bunch of random anecdotes which teach the reader nothing about how to harness the power of thinking without thinking. The book cover and introduction are slick marketing which wrongfully lead the buyer to believe he or she will be getting some valuable information about how to begin effectively making snap decisions, and instead spend their time reading myriad stories about people who have made snap decisions. Super helpful. It's like booking a hotel online which promises an \"ocean view,\" then getting to the hotel and realizing it's nowhere near the beach.I will say that I relied on my gut feeling and started skimming through the book about 1/3 of the way through to see if he was ever going to actually provide any useful tools relating to making split decisions. After skimming to about 2/3's of the way through, I decided to move to Amazon reviews, which confirmed my impression that the book was never going to get anywhere. So there's an anecdote he can put in a future, revised edition of the book. My gut feeling saved me from experiencing the even greater annoyance I would have had by spending my time finishing a book that was already getting on my nerves.",
            "I didn't read this book in one shot, but many different segments during the course of a couple of months - A book has to be at least interesting to keep me going like this.I like the many stories in this book. They always offer me some insights, which not necessarily agree with the author's points. It's funny to see how the author himself contradict himself in the book - but understandably so, because we live in such a paradoxical world.Paradoxical especially when the unconscious mind is involved. Kudos to Malcolm to make a bestseller out of the subject of the unconscious mind, so the word does not only belong to the psychotherapists' arena.Are we going to trust our unconscious mind? The book gives many examples to do so, and many examples not to. It may not be because Malcolm Gladwell likes to contradict himself, but that there are layers of our unconscious mind. Some layers are innate, those we call \"instinct\". They are unknown to us until the snap judgment is made, in another word, we \"figure it out before we realize we have figured it out\". In those cases, it's a good idea to listen to the barameter of the body. But some unconscious layers are programed, like how to drive, like how we have unconscious prejudice towards a certain group of people.Another big insight I've got out of this book's stories is that those who have \"made it\" may not necessarily know how they made it, therefore they may not make good teachers. There is a fact that they've made it, and there is their own understanding of how they made it. There may be a huge gap between the two. So shall we trust what they teach and follow, or shall we learn from what they have done and follow it, which is to trust our own inner knowing? My answer would be obvious, as I'm a hypnotherapist and my business tagline is \"Access Your Inner Wisdom\".Another very useful question that you have to ask while reading this book is: Is it true that the more we know, the better we think?Or sometimes the best for us to do is to blink?",
            "I was looking for a book to help me remember to blink. \"Breathe\" (the book) worked so well for me, I figured I could supplement more of my autonomic functions this way. Beyond that, this book comes in audio format! Now I can use my Ipod to play it and avoid forgetting at all. I am still waiting on that for \"Breathe\", it would be nice to not scare the people on the bus by passing out again. All in all this is a wonderful product and a good means to self improvement.",
            "In \"Blink,\" renowned author of \"The Tipping Point,\" Malcolm Gladwell, explores the science of split-second decisions and their ramifications on our everyday judgments. Do we as humans really know how or why we make the decisions we do? How can we make better decisions without devastating repercussions? Gladwell explores these ideas using many stories and examples, and argues that we can come to very excellent yet lightning fast conclusions because of all the information already stored in our brains, and surmises that the first two seconds in our decision-making process is the most vital. With this in mind, Gladwell demonstrates that split-second decisions can be just as reliable as those made after much longer intellectual digesting. Every story in the book will leave you wanting to learn more about the subject, which is always a good thing. All in all the book's another triumph for Gladwell, and his ideas about \"thin-slicing\" will get you wondering, too. But in that there's a beauty, because he lets you come to your own conclusions, simply laying the foundation for his mind-bending theories, and opening up his interpretations for discussion.",
            "Gladwell introduces the reader to the concept of \"thin slicing\", which is our intuitive responses to a situation are often correct. This is interesting as we were raised to believe that our snap judgments are often misled. Gladwell, who is a journalist for the \"The New Yorker\", uses his journalistic skills to organize this book which highlights cases of research studies, discussions, interviews, and real world examples about the concept of thin slicing. His journalistic writing style allows the book to be a quick read, and Gladwell does not drown the reader in scientific mumbo jumbo. Gladwell provides solid evidence that our intuitions are often correct, however these intuitions may mislead us due to our inner prejudice. In order to fully grasp the power of thin slicing we have to calm our inner prejudice. \"Blink\" is a quick read that informs the reader of a concept that we use on an everyday basis, yet we are not conscious of it.",
            "Malcom Gladwell of course took the world by storm with Tipping Point and had a tremendous effort in Outliers about what makes great people great. In my opinion, BLINK is only a so-so effort from someone that could produce something much better.Blink discusses how we make snap judgements more than we think we do and how to harness the power of those, but also to beware of those as well. It discusses the number of different examples of how we do this, but it seems repetitive and redundant. I didn't really learn anything new in the 2nd half of the book that wasn't presented in the first portion other than that I should beware of these instincts. So what I am unclear on is, should I trust the instincts or beware of them? Both? Depends on the situation? I guess that can be left up to interpretation. There are tons of anecdotes which is what Gladwell does well. Some are very interesting such as New Coke vs. Pepsi and snap judgements we make when we meet different people, etc. Some are not so interesting such as that when he speaks of military snipers-his point being how it is interesting that in a sequence that is 2.5 seconds, you can describe it for several minutes or more what was going through your head-which I believe is true.There is value with this book-which is essentially in understanding those philosophies above. I will consistently think of my BLINK instincts and be aware of them whereas before I was not. I will also remember not to judge things on those BLINK instincts and \"Thin Slicing\"-which is easy for all of us to do. I'm glad I read it-which is why it gets 3 stars-but I can't say it will change your life, but then again Gladwell probably would not say that either. Was this review too long? I guess if it was longer than a BLINK maybe I lost you? Or maybe I didn't?",
            "I read the entire book (nearly 300 pages) and not once does he tell you how to utilize/hone/refine/implement any of the thin-slicing skills that the book is about. It's just a collection of short stories to prove the point that thin-slicing is as effective as exhaustive scientific research. This would be an excellent book for an undergrad Intro to Psychology class, but for someone looking to learn how to apply those skills in the real world, it is awful. What makes it so bad is that he implies that readers are going to come away with some sense of how to utlize their thin-slicing skills. I am actually upset that I read this entire book. I wish I could get my Sunday back.",
            "This book does nothing more than skims the surface on the subject of snap judgments and general psychology. Gladwell does nothing more than report on the subject matter, offering no depth, no analysis, no digging deeper into associated concepts to help the reader better understand the context and material in the book; not to mention that the more cognitive types will find it - quite literally - an empty read.Read it like a news story if you must, because in my opinion it's just one long-winded, repetitive news article.Cheers.",
            "Blink is a fun read, full of interesting anecdotes presented in Gladwell's typical writing style--threaded together from one to the next, like one big dinner party discussion. And if this is all one expects, it is enough. But Blink also tries to make an argument, and the weakness of that argument ultimately spoils the book.For anyone who's read Gladwell's writings in The New Yorker, Blink will be familiar in its off-beat focus on, well, whatever. Having previously written on such diverse subjects as the appeal of ketchup and job interviewing, Gladwell seems to be merely presenting a collection of stories about \"thin slicing\", as he calls it--the ability of people to make snap judgements. But in fact, Gladwell tries to convince the reader of the latent power of the brain's \"thin slicer\", to show that deliberation, logic, and carefully conscious thinking can, in fact, be drawbacks. It is here that Blink falls apart.First, Gladwell is never really clear on what his definition of \"thin slicing\" is--some vague form of intuition, of course, but past that he focuses very little on what, neurologically, he actually believes is going on. Instead, he sticks to these anecdotes, which, in fact, frequently don't really help his case.In fact, Blink could be forgiven for a little bit of vagueness--as a pop author, Gladwell knows his readers don't want heavy science and dry evidence collecting. But the skewed, unconvincing, often contradictory evidence presented by his anecdotes is sometimes unforgivable. For example, he presents, at one point, the story of a professor so skilled at reading facial expressions that, just by looking at a few frames of video, he could identify the members of a peaceful South American tribe as easy going, while he picked out members of a warrior tribe with a tradition of homosexuality as violent people with \"much evidence to suggest homosexuality.\" Are we really expected to take this story as proof that one can identify violent traits, not to mention sexual habits, merely from facial expressions?Gladwell sticks to his pop-science in many of his other anecdotes, eschewing unbaised accounts and empirical evidence in favor of interesting stories and, even, interpreting each account to uniformly support his hypothesis (careful readers of the Cook County Hospital story can be forgiven for wondering if this doesn't in fact disprove the power of intuition).Understandably, Gladwell doesn't want to author a dry book of psychology that will sit on shelves in university libraries, but he owes it to the reader to get his facts straight and hold himself to the same standards as, well, real scientists. Read this book if you need to pick up some conversation starters. Don't bother if you want to learn anything concrete.",
            "Blink is a shifting, slippery, difficult book. This is rather a strange thing to say about the book as a general statement because it's written in very, very plain language, is aimed clearly at a mass (though literate) audience, and is a very brisk read in a very svelte book. Many readers will describe it as eminently \"readable.\"Yet, we have a problem. Blink lacks a kind of focus. Good, academic non-fiction will have a point, or a statement of purpose, or a principle to prove. It will have something to say. Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond is an excellent example of this. The Mind's Sky by Timothy Ferris is another.Blink really does not. It is a book that has a very interesting subject and has some very interesting things to say about that subject but lacks the academic courage to declare anything about the subject that might be ultimately useful to the reader or testable by a researcher (this despite many anecdotal stories regarding researchers delving in to this topic).The subject at hand is snap-judgments--or, as the book has it, \"the power of thinking without thinking.\" It is the instinctive sense that our conscious mind makes decisions based upon innumerable and subtle details our subconscious is picking up or, in some cases, where certain training and expertise makes the perceiver unusually sensitive to subtle details others might miss. These conscious decisions come to us instantaneously, overwhelmingly, and ineffably. The author describes this as \"thin-slicing.\" These details coalesce within the subconscious ways that enable the conscious mind to make a very quick, often very accurate decision. The opening section of the book lively describes the process with the story of an art museum acquiring a statue (kouros) and how they went about trying to verify its authenticity. It's an interesting topic that will grab the attention of everyone from the curious dilettante in psychology to the hard-nosed salesman in the business world.But Blink then lapses in to a pattern that ultimately leads nowhere. It firstTells us how very, very accurate \"thin-slicing\" can be, thenHow experts can use thin-slicing to make even better, cooler decisions, thenHow awfully misleading thin-slicing can be--particularly in inexpert hands--along with a discussion of prejudice, then finallyA summation of how people should find a balance between accurate and inaccurate thin-slicing.What is lacking in this book is any kind of scientific rigor. It is replete with stories--many of them amusing--and very interesting concepts. But there are no control groups, laboratory experiments, testable circumstances, or even corollaries speculating on the use or mis-use of thin-slicing. There is nothing ultimately useful about the book. The best that can be said about it, in the end, is that we now have a label and a term for what would customarily be regarded as first impressions.There is a worse and ancillary effect of this book as well. People who read it cover-to-cover will find it wanting due to a lack of rigor. To them, it will at best provide some interesting casual conversation topics. But for the business community--a group of readers notorious for reading bullet points instead of paragraphs, executive summaries instead of full reports, and opening chapters instead of entire books--they will take this book, read the first few sections learning how exciting and accurate thin-slicing can be. Then, they will begin to apply that knowledge to the business world far out of proportion for what is wise to do. You see, they will never make it to the more cautionary sections at the end. If Blink becomes a popular business book, it will wreak incalculable damage on the business community as it teaches the struggling middle-manager new terms by which poor decision-making based upon first impressions are made.That is a scary thing.READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM",
            "Substantively not as good as \"The Tipping Point\", but delivered with the same easy prose. Especially in the beginning, there are some interesting recounts of real life situations. Throughout the book the author draws some conclusions that are tenuous at best and thus the book is probably better if read with a critical eye. The number of copies sold may be misleading in regards to the real world, business knowledge that can be drawn from the book. All in all, I recommend this book as simple, leisure read that should be approached critically.",
            "An entire book that provides nothing more than a problem with no solution. How this book made it onto the front marketing tables at my bookstore, I have no idea other than Gladwell's hair. It's certainly not his propensity for choosing interesting topics. You could get this information, along with informative insight and possible solutions to the problems he presents, by watching some kid show on PBS. Don't waste your time.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's obviously done his research. He writes clearly and articulately. But, I found Blink wanting.While the book starts strong, and presents a compelling argument, in my opinion I thought it kind of fizzled out. I would have enjoyed greater substantiation of the Blink theory.But, this is a pop psychology book. I'm sure the author was advised against inundating readers with too many facts. Still, when reading such a work, more supporting facts would have proven beneficial.It's certainly worth reading (and a fast read), but not necessarily justifiable hard cover material.",

I finished the book and hadn't learned anything new and was thoroughly disappointed. Don't waste your time or money.",
            "After reading this book, I'm left with a whole lot of cool little stories, but no real point. What was the thesis? What was the conclusion? I'm still confused.It did hold my attention, though.",
            "The two stars are for the interesting subject matter of the book only...the 'adaptive unconscious'. Unfortunately the author is not a subject matter expert. He relates a handful of anecdotes he's obtained from others and tells them over and over throughout the book. This book was in desperate need of another editor. The author should stick to shorter format periodical writing. You won't get anything more out the book than what you can find in the reviews below. Save yourself the money and look for another read.",
            "A mis-mash of other peoples findings, not even pulled together into a cohesive whole. Thought the book might have some original ideas about how to change our snap judgements - NOT SO.",
            "This book starts off well enough. The stuff about Gottman and Eckman was fascinating. Then he gets into the car salesman, and the Warren G. Harding chapter, and the book goes nowhere. By the end of the book, I felt totally ripped off. This was like a short essay expanded into a boring book. If you really want to know about thin-slicing, read Arny Mindell - he can tell you how to do it effectively. Get this book out of the library and read the first sixty to eighty pages. Don't waste your money on this book.",
            "This is one of those books you read through with mild pleasure, only to realize at the end that the author's entire point could have been summed up quite well with one simple sentence. In this case, the sentence is: Trust your intuition, because it offers insights that logic can't.That's certainly true. And the anecdotes and research Gladwell uses to support his thesis are entertaining, even if not all of them are as conclusive as he seems to think they are. But basically, this book is an somewhat belabored series of articles connected by the theme \"Trust your intuition.\" If you already believe in the power of intuition and trust your ability to sometimes make snap judgements based on gut feelings seemingly without reason or research, then this book will be a fun little read, but you won't really learn anything new. If you believe intuition is a poor tool in decision-making, and you prefer to research everything into the ground and ignore gut feelings, then I doubt this book will convince you otherwise (but who knows?)I bought this book because I'm studying improv, and my teacher recommended it. Improv requires snap decisions made without deliberation, and I was hoping this book would examine the transcendent state of suspension of deliberation that so many improv students have trouble achieving. How do you turn off your logical brain and react wisely without thinking? Sadly, Gladwell can't tell us how; I don't know whether anyone could. However, if you're interested in a more thorough and in-depth study of a closely related topic (how people can turn off the chattering parts of their brain and get into a groove where decisions come easily and without \"thinking\"), I very highly recommend Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's \"Flow,\" one of the definitive works in the field.Either way, buy \"Blink\" if you'd like some light airport reading. Don't expect anything very meaty, and don't expect any revelations.",
            "How can we decide something and how fast? This book explores this topic.The best thing about this book for me is in revealing how our prejudice miscolours the accuracy of the decisions we make. Gladwel provides some telling examples from associative thinking type questionaires that expose our subconscious assumptions about skin colour or gender that threaten making better choices than those we would make burdened with false assumptions.Blink overall is a fascinating book. Decisions made in a hurry can obviously be ace compared to compiling piles of data and analysing them in non-intuitive, statistical formats. The major buzzword in this book is \"Thin slicing\". Rather than having a whole cake of info on something as a basis on which to make a hopefully correct decision, how thin a slice would you need to arrive at the same conclusion. The answer is surprisingly very thin indeed.Things like a tone of voice can, according to this book prove just as decisive if not more than the content of any speech.Vast and exciting examples of decision making are explored: Simulated wars; police shooting the wrong man/men; judging art work for authenticity; assessing couples breaking up on the basis of their conversations; looking at facial expressions and even the \"Pepsi challenge\" and selling cars. The themes are explored in an exciting fashion.Gladwell reveals a lot about himself and illuminates many areas - helping us to focus on how we can train our faculties to make snap judgements weareas at the same time being wary of making decisions under stress or with wrongful assumptions about people in general.Gladwell conveys the problems inherent in making snap judgements that can be plain wrong. He does not expand too much on this - I suppose this is why many of us are reluctant to make too many snap judgements (on important matters), because this could be just too risky. However this book does help you to avoid any risks, especially if you like a small gamble.I read this book so fast and think it will be helpful and boost the confidence of any interested reader. It is not a long book to read. Please be warned that you should not make blink decisions and think of it as a virtue - it would be nice if you can spot your perfect partner in a blink, but would he/she agree? The fact of the matter is we continuously make snap decisions that are not especially consequential or even when we do make momentuous decisions that are good, it may rely on a good deal of subconscious input. As an example, I looked at this book for less than 10 seconds before buying it, and I'm glad I did.",
            "If you're line of work involves evaluating people in any way shape or form, this is a must read. You won't view your job or how you assess what people bring to the table the same way ever again.The book is a highly entertaining read. The central theme revolves around \"thin slicing\" or how people intuit what they're hearing or seeing. We all recognize that in most every decision making process we undertake, there is a \"gut feel\" that we have about which direction we should take. Why? Where does it come from and do we act upon it or not? Or, do we consciously reason our way to an alternative solution and if so-does that decision wind up being a good one?The author uses a variety of examples to demonstrate why this process of \"thin slicing\" is so powerful. There are a number of intriguing studies woven throughout the book that will have you hungry to learn more. The implicit versus explicit views that we all possess, many of them conflicting, are discussed and analyzed via a number of intriguing case studies.Yes the concepts introduced in Blink tend not to \"fit\" perfectly. The book doesn't satisfy some peoples need to have everything neatly summarized and laid out. But the book is extremely enlightening, thought provoking and leaves you hungry to learn more about the thought processes we all employ to make \"people\" decisions in life. I highly recommend it. You won't be the same after reading it.",
            "I enjoyed \"Blink\" a great deal. I greatly appreciated the discussions of \"thin slicing\" and unconscious thinking, reasoning, and judgments, and found them to be in congruence with other works I have read by psychologists, notably the brilliant Paul Ekman who is able to accurately predict the potential for divorce in marriages after only a brief observation. Interestingly, all of us are able to reach conclusions in much the same way that Ekman does, though we are not cognitively aware of it; this frequently accounts for initial impressions or rapid decisions that, while unexplainable on a conscious level, are actually deeply and quickly processed reactions to our perceptions of events. For more on this subject (mostly from a personal protection standpoint) I also recommend \"The Gift of Fear\" by Gavin De Becker.I am very enthused with Gladwell's critiques of micromanagement, and believe that not only is he correct that the time and energy diverted from workers by over-attentive supervisors is detrimental to workplace performance, but motivation and creativity as well. Upper level administrators should read this book with an eye to problems in their organizations.This is a very thought-provoking book about how we rapidly process information with a high degree of accuracy in our subconscious. As such, I found it informative in understanding hunches, suspicions, and initial impressions that we all make, though we aren't quite certain how or why. I was planning on giving the book five stars up until the very end, when the book just closed. The book really seems like an unfinished work: one page there are interesting, valid arguments being made, and the next page it's over. Were it not for the abruptness of the conclusion, I would easily give the book five stars: it is brilliantly conceived, and generally well executed; it is highly readable and utterly absorbing. I recommend this book without reservations.",
            "Maybe 3 stars is too low, the book had a really great premise, that our subconcious intervenes way more than we realize. Maybe it's mainly because I'm usually a fiction reader but I felt like I had to push to finish the book, and the only reason I kept going to the end was because it was the choice of my book club. Like I said, the premise was good and I did take away much food for thought. At first I felt that I should trust my inner-judgemental mind as one who would cut through the minutia to the truth. But, as the book went on, I realized that he was telling us we also needed to be very careful as that \"truth\" is very much influenced by our outlook on life -- in otherwords a snap decision can be very prejudiced and therefore wrong. I guess my reason for only giving it 3 stars is that I felt that Gladwell used many, many, many examples to get across the same idea, again and again and again. Each of the examples were good, but I think it could have easily been about half as long with his point well expressed.",
            "I rather enjoyed all the stories in this book; it definitely is food for thought, especially, I think, concerning the \"love lab\" experiments where observers can tell if a marriage is healthy or not by observing them conversing about a controversial subject. It is also absolutely fascinating to read about doctors and their decision making, and the study of facial expressions. However, a collection of stories do not make up a definitive discourse on how we make decisions. I thought it interesting that sleep was not even discussed. We all know that lack of sleep can impair our judgement drastically, and as a sleep-deprived parent at times, I can tell it affects my emotions and snap decisions way more than many other factors. That is why I say it makes the brain seem too simplistic; there are just too many variables to be covered. However, I would recommend reading it because it is a pleasure to read and is very quick; and I found it interesting how it caused me to pause and observe my son's pediatrician this morning more carefully. That makes it fun.",
            "Humans make snap decisions about people and things. That's a great concept to understand. But is that one concept worth an entire book?The problem with Blink is that once you agree with the author's initial concept, he never makes a value judgment about whether this phenomenon is a good thing or a band thing. In fact, he makes both arguments ...The first half of the book makes the argument that our \"gut\" instinct is usually correct - in fact - it's more accurate than using logic and reasoning.The second half debunks that theory by implying our biases skew the accuracy of our blink response.Both arguments are buttressed by interesting stories. Either could be true. But in the end, you don't really know which argument to believe. Should we trust our gut instinct? The book never answers that question.Additionally, the book misses the chance to teach readers how to influence a persons \"blink\" reaction. Marketers and salesmen who are reading this book to find out how to influence consumers had better look elsewhere.In short, this is a great title and an interesting book, but it's like a movie that starts off with a great concept, but leaves you disappointed when the lights come back on.",
            "Blink is an enjoyable and light read. With the title Blink: The Power of Thinking without Thinking, one might imagine that the book provides some insight how to be amazingly brilliant without trying.Not at all. The author is essentially making a case for instincts and the \"adaptive unconscious.\" The case is made by providing anecdotal (but enjoyable) stories for 250 pages.The book could have very easily and effectively been condensed into a decent-sized article in Psychology Today. In short, the concept behind the book was \"done/got it/move on\" in a few pages. However, the testimonial/example stories themselves and the author's references to items that I now plan to read (such as Sources of Power by Gary Klein) made the book worth my time.Again, this is not a book with \"ah-ha\" insights or \"put an encyclopedia under your pillow and you'll be brilliant the next morning\" solutions - it's a treatise on not ignoring feelings/instincts simply because you can't put your finger on WHY you know what you know.",
            "This book is full of many little stories that augment the author's point that many judgements are made as split second decisions. When I first started it, I was hoping that it would have more of a scientific understanding of how any why this works. After reading it, it seems as though all I've seen is a large collection of examples that support the point that decisions and judgements are made quickly, and that with practice this can be somewhat controlled.Overall, I don't think that it was a bad book; It just feels like there are a lot of examples that work to lead you to your own conclusions. To borrow a theme from the book, \"something just didn't seem that exciting about it, but it is difficult to put it into words.\"",
            "I wasn't sure exactly what I was in for with this book but because I enjoyed Gladwell's the Tipping Point so much I thought I'd give it a try and I'm glad I did. Here is a book which focuses on thinking without thinking...in other words the point being that using intuition, hunches, or just plain old gut feelings is often better than using logical, deliberate thinking. Interesting concept...going with your gut feeling, right?Malcolm Gladwell shares the results of recent research in psychology and related disciplines, such as neuroscience, which not only confirm the importance of intuitive cognition in human beings but also offer a qualified vindication of it. He argues that intuition is often superior to articulate thinking.Gladwell shares a number of anecdotal examples of where intuition both triumphed and failed, leading him to the conclusion that while both intuitive thinking and cognitive thinking both have their benefits and pratfalls, going with one's gut feeling is often going to be the better choice of the two as long as one is aware of any lurking bear traps, so to speak.The problem with the book is that for all its pseudo-technical terminology of using phrases like \"mind-blindness\" and \"thin-slicing\", the bottom line is that there really is no concrete scientific evidence to support his beliefs. In essence, he is using his own gut feelings and beliefs to support his theories. And how's that for logic! Still, whether you believe Gladwell or not, the fact remains that the book is a very entertaining read. The many examples Gladwell submits will put a smile on your face at least until you start shooting holes in them.",
            "Ok but not great...seem to wonder off in too many different directions at times.",
            "If you consider yourself an intellectual (you know who you are...Matrix is your favorite movie) you will appreciate reading this book. Thereafter, you will commit the anecdotal experiments to memory and will shamelessly flaunt them at wine tastings.The author introduces the concept of thin-slicing beyond the delicatessen. He also informs the reader that snap judgments are not merely relegated to NFL quarterbacks.",
            "I really liked this book. Read the whole thing at a bookstore. Fascinating look at how we humans make up our minds much quicker and with much less data than we think we do. I believe Gladwell is bringing us closer to the truth about how humans really make decision.",
            "Blink is a short and artful compendinum of many known incidents of foretelling in a crisis. There isn't a lot new here but its a well told stringing together incidents resolved by intuition. But intuition is too lax a discription. What, Gladwell really reveals is how bits and pieces of our past exprience come instantly together, a processes suggestive of lens clouded with the detrius of missinformation, but one which still renders the outlines of fact in the blur and hurry of a needed decision. \"Blink\" will be new stuff to many but to those who have been around a whild it is nonetheless a refresher course how decisions are made, often under duress.",
            "Is it true a fake can produce intuitive revulsion in the eye of a knowing observer? A blink is a glance, fast and frugal decisionmaking.The truth of a marriage can be understood by an observer in a short time. A relationship between people has a distinctive signature.Free will is an illusion. We can be coached, primed. Gladwell speaks of thin-slicing, the process of making decisions quickly on the basis of very little information. When you start second-guessing you may be undermining yourself. Sometimes extra information just confuses the issue.Thin slicing is recognizing patterns and making snap judgments. It turns out that buying jam is a snap decision. Less choice means more sales. The face is an enormously rich source of emotion. Every blink is a series of discrete moving parts.Music auditions are thin slicing moments. The use of screens, blind auditions, has changed the composition of orchestras.The notes at the end of the book are of great interest.",
            "I didn't read this book. I kind of flipped through it and got a bad feeling. Like I knew without reading it that it wasn't for me. Kinda weird.",
            "Instinctive decision and I placed the book back on the rack when I first picked up at a local bookstore. However, again some hidden instincts made me read the book. The cover page ain't impressive and its a snap judgement, maybe. In a Blink, the decision is instinctive - That's what the Book speaks about. The best selling author of 'Tipping Point', Gladwell reveals psychological facts on behavior patterns of people. Gladwell builds his cases that are supportively influential to a reader and makes him think small and focus on the meaning of \"thin slices\" of behavior. He has case studies on car selling, heart attack, etc. which explains his concept of thin slices - upon the information, derive to decisions. However, I feel that often the judgements may wry wrong with the decisions if its only based on information. The sixth sense or intuition plays an important role in thought manipulation. Snap judgements turn people off-track in decision making sometimes but in a blink, first decisions do turn the other way round. Experts in the field have proven decision and are correct in their presumptions. However, Gladwell's case studies is indepth as to pros and cons on accuracy and how one can go about 'Blink' - snap judgements. The book is fine as long as you like to ponder over. The fact remains - your own snap judgements or the intution, the sixth sense always helps you to make decisions! Fine read.",
            "This is Malcolm Gladbag's follow up effort to, \"The Power of Farting without Farting,\" and Bruce Lee's \"The Art of Fighting without Fighting.\" I took the quiz at the end of the book and got an A+. Thanks Malcolm!I defy anyone to give me a helpful vote for this review!No takers?....",
            "The book arrived so quickly and in such a good condition that I didn't even notice it came from an Amazon Marketplace vendor. Great service!",
            "Well, I rushed out to buy Blink and after the first 20 pages or so, I realized that this book was not worth the money. The Tipping Point was an interesting book, but in this boring and silly volume the author tries to analyze all sorts of topics without the credentials to do so. The reader is left with information that seems upsupported and in some cases outdated. Moreover, the book needs a good editor. Even some of the basics of English have been overlooked. For example, the author mixes a singular object with a plural subject in this sentence, \"we need the ability to know our own mind.\" There are a number of examples of this throughout the book and it made me think that the author and the editor rushed to get this book published. What a disservice to readers and what a shame. You know one would think if the author is so good at examining the mind, he would be as good at catching first-grade grammatical errors.",
            "If you're interested in finding out what researchers know about the unconscious mind and discover hints into reading others unconscious thoughts, Blink is a must. I'm thankful to my friend who reccommended it to me, but I'll charge him the eye drops I used because this book kept me so interested that I hardly blinked during reading it.",
            "This book is captivating and a quick read, but the ideas contained in it are quite deep. This book is actually a lot more nuanced than many of the other reviewers suggest: instead of making broad generalizations, the author describes different types of situations involving decisionmaking and discusses their differences.I especially like the way the author explores both situations in which snap judgments can be extraordinarily accurate, and those in which they are less so. I also like the contrast the author draws by introducing the use of data to make systematic decisions. This discussion may be of particular use to people in operations research, management, people who run small businesses, other organizations, or political campaigns.I think that most people would not only benefit from reading this book, but would enjoy it as well. It's fun, but deep.",
            "The basic idea behind Blink seems to be that subconscious analysis can be exponentially clearer and more accurate than conscious reasoned procedure in evaluating skills in other people and decisions we are faced with. Gladwell has ample evidence, much of it compelling, to back up his hypothesis, and yet his work still does far less than it could have.The reason for this, I have concluded, is that Gladwell largely refuses to dig into the characteristics that allow us to pick up signals in other people. In one anecdote, Gladwell explains that people can observe a mere few seconds of video of college professors -- with limited audio that disables word recognition -- and accurately rate the quality of each professor measured against the ratings of students who have completed one of the professor's courses. This is a fascinating discovery, and yet Gladwell refuses to say what is being \"thin sliced\" in the professor. Is it something as abstract as passion, or could it involve something more easily quantified, such as IQ? Gladwell doesn't know, and because of his \"locked door\" theory, he assumes those doing the rating do not have access to any of the information motivating their choices, either.In fact, Gladwell sidesteps IQ altogether. Perhaps because of his populist aspirations (though perhaps not), he demonstrates a lack of willingness to confront our ability to pick up cognitive function in other people or groups of people. This ability to accurately \"size up\" other people would seem to have far-reaching implications in explaining how society is economically and socially structured, and yet he refuses to look the issue in the eye. The impact of his work could be far greater if he worried a bit less about New Coke and tennis serves, and more about the broad implications of intuitive perceptual skill.",
            "I listened to the audio book version of Blink. The Amazon reviews here that try to pry out the book's shortcomings are missing the point entirely - you can read this book and personally understand a lot more about how you, as a modern, civilized, human being actually function in real life, not in between the covers of some peer-reviewed science or psychology journal.For example, I could never understand why, even after years away, I could perfectly navigate my way around San Francisco, until my wife started to question if I knew where I was going! The author, in relating his understanding of how the mind functions in split-second decisions, explains that right-brain (visual) functionality, becomes impeded when left-brain (verbal) functionality (answering questions) is forced to kick in. No wonder I don't like it when people talk 'at me' when I am trying to think - I think visually!I can't wait to read Gladwell's Tipping Point!",
            "Malcolm Gladwell does a good job of introducing and defending decision making based on quick deductions and first impressions. However, I found his examples to be needlessly racially biased--to the point I felt I was in a community college SOC 101 class. It could have been more entertaining, and less preachy.",
            "Blink wasn't quite as \"can't-put-it-down\" as The Tipping Point, but still very interesting, and I am undoubtedly glad I read it. I could see some people liking Blink better than its precursor, however. I'd say if The Tipping Point is for sociology fans, Blink will appeal more to those with a stronger interest in psychology.",
            "It puzzles me how some could not find any practical use for this information. It was pretty clear that snap thinking works, as long as you have fed your sub-conscious more complete data, and if you don't allow yourself to panic. I think it helps clarify what I have seen in successful decision-makers, both in business and the military. It is therefore no surprise that floor traders and professional soldiers can have a surprising amount of common ground.The book is well worth reading.",
            "I came to Blink after being so caught up by the Tipping Point that I expected the same level of greatness.This is a good book, and its central theme is intriguing. I think he raises great points for readers to use the knowledge in bits and pieces - thin slices - if you'll indulge me with the terminology. I find myself better able to understand what drives decisions. And even better, how to improve them. However, this took effort, and time away from the book to see the concepts in actions.The first part of the book is better than the latter parts. And i believe the parts focused on human beings under stress particularly intriguing.I also think the ability to focus, with laser sharpness on what we know, and begin to remove the artificialities is a concept I wish Mr. Gladwell would have explored more deeply - especially at the end - sort of a mechanism for putting this into practice more deeply (of course then someone might wrongly place it in the self help category).However, Blink is a fascinating study in understanding why you think you know what you - and fast you know it.",
            "I find the authors book to be very interesting. Thin slicing is something we all do everyday and do not realize it. I would recommend this book to everyone.The one suggestion I have would be to not go into so much detail with the examples provided. The story about the war and it's methods was way to long.",
            "Malcolm calls into question a certain notion of thinking most commonly used by \"experts\" of all stripes, decision makers in business, in marketing, in the military or in academia. He draws out the limits of reducing thinking to just another form of technology, in which experts will substitute technology, i.e. reason, for other forms of experience, i.e. feeling, experience, passion. The results are comic, especially in the first chapter concerning the forged Khourous, where technology supports wishful thinking.The implications are wide-ranging, i.e. poor military decisions supported by complex software, consumar marketing decisions supported by useless focus groups, prejudices supported by media influence, etc.Malcolm doesn't develop any normative rules for dealing with this zen-like moment of \"thinking without thinking,\" so don't look for many. I suggest reading the book without \"thinking\" and accept the absurdity of never being certain about anything.",
            "There are almost one thousand reviews for this book, most are positive, do I need to submit one? Yes.The author discusses split-second thinking, or \"in the blink of an eye\" speed of thought. He postulates that those rapid decisions are usually better. He backs it up with many examples of decisions made with more time, more information, and more discussion that turned out wrong, when the initial decision was actually the correct one. How does this happen?The subconscious mind processes many inputs and helps to steer our decisions. It is usually right and we need to trust it more often. I trade financial products and I have found that too much information does not give me a clearer picture of what is going to happen, especially in the short to very short term future. I don't know how many times each week while looking at the market, I get this flash of go long, or go short. I have started tracking these thoughts and they are correct almost 90% of the time. How is that possible? I don't know, but I assume my subconscious mind picks up small clues that my conscious mind misses, or needs more information to form an opinion.The whole process is very exciting and while I can't explain the details, I can verify the results. Another book that delves deeper into the thought process and the subconscious decision-making process isHare Brain, Tortoise Mind: How Intelligence Increases When You Think Lessan excellent book, which I read a couple of years ago and I think I am ready to pull it off the shelf and give it a second read.",
            "Where does it all go, after you are done experiencing the experience, thinking the thought, feeling the feeling? Nothing is ever lost. The subconscious is like a vast warehouse, limitless, in fact, and as Malcolm Gladwell illustrates in \"Blink,\" we access all that is stored in that warehouse with every blinking and waking moment.Usually, we call this instant access - gut instinct. Or, the inner voice of wisdom. Instinct, however, is nothing magical or mysterious. It is simply our accumulated and stored knowledge over a lifetime. If there was ever an argument for listening to those who have some serious and well-lived years under their belts, this is it. \"Blink\" illustrates with numerous and widely varied examples how life experience, the more the better, contributes to our ability to make quick, yet sound decisions. In fact, the quicker, the better.\"Blink\" is about what the author calls \"thin slicing.\" He defines this process as the moment of time in which we all make snap judgments. Two seconds, two minutes ... and we make an assessment of a situation or a person or a circumstance. The fascinating thing is - these snap judgments are, more often than not, precise ones. It is when we begin to over analyze and rationalize that we tend to go awry. The trick is to allow the accumulated wisdom rise up and do its magic, trust in it.Then again ...Gladwell never does make a concluding statement in his book, and perhaps it is up to the reader to decide (do it quickly?), but his many fascinating examples and his reports on various studies can lead one to think these snap judgments are the way to go - or, then again, thinker beware. For all the many situations in which that moment of initial wisdom is uncannily precise, there are other times that our deeply ingrained biases muck up the clarity of that process. Gladwell cites data to illustrate how stereotypes, for instance, persist - no matter how gallant our conscious efforts to overcome them. Telling yourself you don't really think what you think simply won't work. Only exposure to experiences, or positive visualizations, will change the false ideas and images our subconscious has absorbed over time. All of which is a strong argument for \"garbage in, garbage out.\" That is, be careful of what entertainment you choose (e.g. pornographic images, violent movies or games, etc.), because no matter how hard your conscious mind tries to guide you toward decisions and behavior that is more appropriate, your subconscious will always, but always win out.The idea of what you present to your eye is what you will later project out to the world is a convincing one, as the author finds himself unable to beat the test on stereotypes when he has to react quickly. Only exposure to more positive images over time can change his test results and dislodge his prejudices.Gladwell discusses this phenomena of instant response-true response in a manner of ways. How patients respond to their doctors (we sue the physician who has a lousy bedside manner, even if more skilled, but remain loyal to the physician who spends as little as three extra minutes talking with us); how facial expressions, when viewed on slowed down video, will without fail, always reveal deceit (there are facial movements that arise from our subconscious that we cannot control, and no matter how quickly we think we have our facial mask in place, there is always that instant that our faces tell the truth); the intricacies of marketing and advertisement and why the obvious ad, even when based on feedback of focus groups, may not be the effective choice; how military decisions by experienced military leaders are successful, but fail miserably when they are constrained by strategic analysis; how micro-managing in workplaces can only lead to mediocrity while suppressing creativity and innovation; how speed dating may be most effective in finding potential lifelong connections (we read about research that can pick out successful, longterm relationships in observing as little as two minutes of interaction between a couple - and no, it isn't the couple that argues that breaks apart); how our societal subconscious biases for certain physical characteristics, such as height or gender, often mislead us to make dangerously faulty snap judgments (Gladwell observes that most of our leaders are tall and male, and that our corporate world pays tall men higher salaries, factoring dollars down to the inch, regardless of intelligence or ability). On and on, in one fascinating example and study after another, Gladwell intrigues with his findings.And you know he's right. You know it ... in your gut. But if the author doesn't make any overall conclusion from all of this fascinating data, then the reader is left to her own wiles. Experience counts more than credentials. What we expose ourselves to on a regular basis molds who we are, how we view others, what choices we make and how we behave. Biases and prejudices are far stronger than our conscious will to overcome them; we must align our environment to align our subconscious. Our deepest self forgets nothing. All we have ever done and been and seen and observed leads to who we are today and tomorrow.All of which gives one pause. But don't pause too long. It is that initial millisecond that may matter most of all.",

But ultimately, it doesn't even end up proving or disproving any of the ideas on its jacket.Some people are good at trusting their instincts, and they end up right. Others are bad at trusting them. Other people's instincts themselves are untrustworthy. Other people don't trust their instincts. Some are right, some are wrong.It's the equivalent of snob candy--it feels like an intellectual book, but it really doesn't say much of anything. It just makes you feel smart for a few minutes, if that.I'd put money that no one will be talking about this book in two years. It's just the flavor of (last) month.",
            "Mr. Gladwell is very talented. He certainly did his homework on this one. At the end of the book though I was left wondering, \"Okay...so what is the conclusion?\" The book came to a rather abrupt ending and I couldn't tell if the author was for or against snap judgments.My biggest disappointment is that there was no warning regarding explicit language. I was listening to this work on CD with my young daughters in the car when all of a sudden he starts using profane words in an effort to quote others. Was it necessary to include such language?",
            "Forgive my poor English. I would like to quote a passage on \"Competing on analytics by Davenport and Harris\" which wrote what I failed to express. Enjoy!\"It's ironic that a book praising intuition would arise and become popular just when many organisations are relying heavily on analytics, but then perhaps that's part of its romantic appeal. It is fun and persuasive, but it doesnt make clear that intuition is only appropriate under what circumstances. The author is undoubtedly correct, for example, that human beings evolved a capability to make accurate and quick decisions about each other's personality and intentions, and it's rare for formal analysis to do that as well. Yet even the author argues that intuitions is a good guide to action only when it's backed by many years of expertise. Any many of the author's examples of intuition are only possible because of years of analytical research in the background, such as Dr. John Gottsman's rapid and seemingly intutitive judgements of whether a married couple he observes will stay together. He's only able to make such assessment because he observed and statistically analyzed thousands of hours of videotaped intactions by couples. It's also clear that decision makers have to use intuition when they have no data and must make a very rapid decision - as in the author's example of police officers deciding whether to shot a suspect.\" pg13-14",
            "With roughly 260 pages and seven chapters (including the conclusion), \"Blink\" is a well-written and insightful book on the subject of accurate \"snap judgment\" or two-second of \"looking.\" This book gives us, the reader, a great deal of information about our \"moment\" to see things accurately, either in quick reaction, warnings, reading strangers, as it is very much like \"gut\" feelings or first impressions.I personally found this book to be quite fascinating and insightful to which I enjoyed both Gladwell's flowing writing style and his clear organization. It took me a good few hours to read it as I could not put the book down. To understand our \"snap\" judgment is to reach an understanding of how basic a human being really is. Today's world, with all the media and overwhelming information, we tend to lose this kind of sense in ourselves.I would very much recommend this book.",
            "Blink is one of those books that has a profound effect on how you view the world. It involves a paradigm shift. Gladwell starts with three main tasks- to that snap judgments can be as good as well thought-out judgments, show when our instincts fail us and teach us that these snap judgments can be controlled.The stories that Gladwell uses to illustrate his points are fascinating and extremely well researched. You feel like you being lead along in a gripping novel instead of reading psychological paper.The most profound lesson that too much information can be overwhelming and severely disrupt our instinctive judgments is profound in a world where we have e-mail, cell phones, blackberries, 24-hour news, online forums - hundreds of sources of information on every conceivable topic. The most effective methods for controlling our instinctive reactions have profound and insightful ideas on how to effectively deal with the subconscious racism that lingers in our society and expresses itself in everything from criminal convictions to choosing chief executives.",
            "Blink ponders the concept of snap decision making utilizing several examples in order to prove its point...Some of the examples begin to be a little redundant, but I do recommend this read",
            "The book is a page-turner, sprinkled with several anecdotes and contextual stories. Though I normally post my reviews of books on Amazon and not on this blog, ideas in the book resonated with the theme in my earlier blog entry. It pertains to Gladwell's analysis of \"The Warren Harding Error: Whey we fall for tall, dark, and handsome men.\"In the chapter, while analyzing an experiment at Chicago area car dealers, he points to how \"Even after forty minutes of bargaining, the black men could get the price, on average, down to only $2,551 above invoice. After lengthy negotiations, Ayers's black men still ended up with a price that was nearly $800 higher than Ayeres's white men were offered without having to say a word.\"With my distinctly South Asian features and accent, I am no Warren Harding but I got to experience and observe the reversal of the `error' that Gladwell points to. In the early nineties, when I first landed in the US, and was looking for a car at the local auto dealership in the heart of the Midwest - Kentucky - the salesman wouldn't give me the time of the day. I was distinctly `foreign,' probably without a credit history, with questionable finances. The salesman literally told me that to my face (something the dealership later apologized for when I wrote to the manager, but that's a different story).Fast forward to present day. It is interesting to observe how younger South Asian and Indian expat `kids' on offshore engagements, walking into a Honda, Toyota or other auto dealerships get kid-glove treatments (pun intended). It is probably because in the blink of an eye, the sales-men/women now equate them to the `white male' in Gladwell's narrative: seen as knowledgeable, internet savvy and possibly with a high-tech job that pays well. This `thin slicing' happens subconsciously even while the kid walks into a dealership, thanks in part to the hype over the flattening world (apologies Tom Friedman) and buzz in the media over offshoring. A phenomenon, one could call the reverse of Gladwell's description of spotting the sucker: spotting the buyer!",
            "This book is conversational and easy to read. This book has a few amazing points. More so, I would read this book again to refresh the idea of \"mind reading\" by thin slicing microexpressions with the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). I would buy a follow-on from this author to learn how to control my facial expressions which unknowingly give other people the edge in \"reading my mind\".",
            "The book made a decent impression leaving me a few good ideas. It was a very fast read with little left to ruminate upon.",
            "I have now given this book to the entire family to read. We are all Gladwell fans and read everything he writes. I have just finished reading Blink for the second time. The great thing about Gladwell is that he presents complex material in an easy-reading way, no easy task. I highly recommend reading everything he writes!",
            "It is somewhat less technical thanHow We Decidebut gives different examples of the conscious decision making process vs. the unconscious process. Allows the reader to gain an understanding that while you are heavily influenced by environmental stimuli and data we are consciously unaware of, we can train our conscious mind to identify those influences and adapt/compensate for them. There is a part that even goes into mind reading (no joke). This is a must read for humans.",
            "I have read several of Gladwell's books and this is my favorite. I find his ideas fresh and interesting and I love the way he looks at the world. Mr. Gladwell certainly has many \"sticky\" ideas; my husband and I still find ourselves often saying, \"So what's your blink?\" Meaning of course, What is your first impression? While we certainly believe the author is onto something when he says first impressions (often without even realizing you are having them) are accurate, there are certainly times when second and third and fourth are well deserved...and Gladwell does acknowledge this. Fun read.",
            "As I read this book, I could not help but feeling a sense of deja vu. Many of the concepts and examples that Gladwell presents have parallels in my own experiences. The knowledge that something is the right choice even before being able to consider all the circumstances can be both liberating and troubling in that you can spend as much effort second-guessing yourself as plodding through the decision process. In that manner, I really enjoyed the book as it seemed to reinforce that one could indeed experience effective thinking without thinking about it. However, I can also understand the negative reviews as well. The experience and enjoyment of the book can really be related in the old saw, \"for those that have, no explanation is required - for those that can not, no explanation is possible.\"",
            "I liked this science behind making fast decisions. Why speed dating can be more effective than dating services or viewing a person's home can be more revealing than a 2 hour job interview. This book proves the natural ability that so many of us have to make good, but unexplained decisions. However, Malcolm Gladwell also explains how our decisions and even self image can be manipulated prior to making decisions. A good read, but not a complete answer to why we make the decisions that we do.Doug Setter, author ofStomach FlatteningandOne Less Victim: A Prevention Guide",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's book takes research from existing fields and combines them with compelling case studies, accessible prose and entertaining style. He persuasively demonstrates that we can make intelligent and founded \"snap judgments\" in the blink of an eye. It really helps to break down what many of us entertain as instinct and intuition.It's great for professionals who want to advance their careers. This book discusses how we judge others in professional contexts, but that these seemingly \"gut feelings\" we have can lead to making effective decisions that will sometimes prove more beneficial than excess analysis or simulation modeling.The book gives broad examples of these \"intelligent\" blink-of-an-eye judgments, from how people can prevent fraud and save millions, win in simulations, judge others in professional contexts, as well as win over strategic analyses by using experience.It's one of my favorite books of all time and I refer to it when training professionals on First Impressions and it's inspired me to do more research, training and writing on the field. He's a trail blazer because he takes makes this area of interest fun and readable to the general public.",

            "Gladwell presents snap decision making and gut instinct well. I think for those that have the ability to evaluate situations quickly either by \"thin slicing\" or just common sense this book will validate that your abilities have merit in the world. Not a book for everyone and those scared to make decisions without all the facts probably will be frightened by it.",
            "This book is a great read. We are reading this book as a team and every manager has learned something. I highly recommend this book! I thought it was a little slow at first, but then it took off and I am very pleased.",
            "Do you believe that your snap decisions are better than those you worry about, mull over, and even lose sleep over? Malcolm Gladwell does, and this book is his defence of that idea.Gladwell is a superb writer, and even if you find yourself questioning some of his evidence, you will learn a lot from \"Blink.\" He has amassed material from a huge range of sources to give you insights into police work, art fraud, speed-dating, firefighting, classical music, marriage counselling ... the list is enormous. The author's gift is finding a common element in seemingly unrelated areas, as he did so effectively in his previous best-seller, \"The Tipping Point.\" In \"Blink,\" that common element is that people make better decisions, he believes, if they follow their intuition and decide quickly, rather than weighing up every facet of a problem and taking a long time to decide.I largely agree with his theory. But the reason it works may be that most of the examples he gives are of people who know their subject inside out because they have had so much experience or training in it. His first example tells how an art fakebuster felt there was a problem with an ancient sculpture that a museum was considering buying. All the tests showed the sculpture was ancient, but the fakebuster's first hunch that it was a fraud turned out to be right. I suspect it was not so much the snap decision that was the key, but the years of experience in art fraud the fakebuster's subconscious was relying on.Nevertheless, this is an interesting book. Not quite up to \"The Tipping Point\" standard, but well worth reading anyway. If it does nothing else, it will probably convince you that faster decisions are at least no worse than slow decisions. And that will save you time and stress.",
            "Popularizing scientific research is always a dicey game. Gladwell does it better than many, especially in the complicated arena of cognitive science. He oversimplifies things, but he has a knack for looking at the human/social consequences of whatever it is he's discussing.BLINK promotes some pop-psych stereotypes I wish he'd dealt with more cogently. That applies in particular to his imprecise use of terms relating to the distinction between what we are aware of and what goes on in that 80+% of our brains that we don't have explicit ('conscious') access to. I guess I would have liked some more neural science here. But keep I remind myself that it is a book intended for a mostly non-scientific audience; and maybe one has to tone down the science-speak these days, for the sake of broadening the spectrum of those buying the book, who would otherwise not have bothered.All in all an excellent and worthwhile piece of popular science, tackling what is a difficult subject and showing clearly that, as with all things, the powers of our minds always hold as much promise as danger.Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, CONTINUITY SLIP, SELADIENNE",
            "Excellent analysis of the mind and how the unconscious plays a role in everyday life. Anyone looking to learn more about those things called intuitions or \"hunches\" should definetly check it out.",
            "Blind provided excellent examples of people making snap decisions -- when it works and when it doesn't. Based on that, you find things you can start or stop doing. For example, do you expect a leader to be a tall, thin man? Yet those qualities have nothing to do with leadership. Why do you let physical appearance drown out other information about the person? The book also gave examples of experts who are trained and have the vocabulary to verbalize what they sense. While the rest of us could only say we like or don't like something without being to explain why. Although we may be right, we don't give snap decisions credibility because we don't have facts to back it up (or the training/vocabulary to explain why). The only problem with this book was that it lacked a conclusion. It didn't provide steps on how you can \"think without thinking.\" You need to come to your own conclusions based on the stories.",
            "Perhaps I might take a shot a clarifying the disparity between some of the ratings this book has been getting. Gladwell is a highly regarded journalist for the New Yorker and Blink is pure journalism - a trusted observer reporting ideas and insights in a particular subject - in this case, the way we make decisions. Gladwell is reporting on the ideas of others, evaluating and making connections. Many reviewers have given the book poor marks for the obviousness of its ideas, but these are not really Gladwell's ideas per se, nor are they bleeding-edge new. Gladwell is doing essentially the same thing he does for the New Yorker, just in a longer format. I found it to be a highly entertaining and thought-provoking survey of the psychology of decision-making - though neither comprehensive nor revolutionary - so if you're looking for 'meat' on these bones or fancy yourself an expert, skip the book and use the notes at the end as your shopping list. I read through Blink in an afternoon and found it to be the most enjoyable and informative book I've read this year.",
            "There are many, many reviews of this book, so I expect mine isn't really needed, but I enjoyed this book so much I want to share my thoughts.My husband and I were on a road trip last week and spent several hours in the car. While I read \"Blink\", I kept reading passages to him because it was so interesting. He has a degree in psychology, so we would talk for miles and miles, based on what I was reading and sharing with him.The book progresses through its several topics and each builds on the one before it. He is a lively and interesting writer. You don''t need any sort of degrees or special knowledge to understand this book - my education is lit and business - not psych!I learned a lot from this book and am enjoying thinking about what I learned. I suspect I'll reread this book at some point to revisit some of his insights and stories as I live with what I've learned.Very good book. I recommend it highly.",
            "The point of the book was not that snap judgements are always correct. The author shows how more factors than just logic come into play when making decisions, and how if we rely soley on logic we can reach wrong conclusions.It was an easy read but very thought provoking. I liked this book much more than \"Freakonomics\" because the author is not using the book as a vehicle to impress the reader with how smart he is (although he clearly is, and is a good writer, but he lets his work speak for him).",
            "Malcolm Gladwell works in the area where he's trying to know the unknowable (at least at first glance). In \"The Tipping Point\" he examined how small and apparently inconsequential incidents ensure the success or failure of campaigns to influence the public. In \"Blink,\" he shows how, on the basis of minimal evidence, skilled people can make correct decisions.Since both these ideas fly in the face of common sense, he has his detractors. However, in \"Blink\" he has many examples where his theories hold water. Perhaps the most important is the one about military games where one team was given huge amounts of information and proceeded to work from this database. However, the team suffered heavy losses from unexpected attacks, even though they had the means in place to find traces of the the preparations of attacks. In fact, the leader of the opposing team did not behave in the way the \"rule book\" said he would and thus deluded the other side, even with all their knowledge.It is one of the things that we pride ourselves on - the ability to make correct decisions using all the evidence - yet sometimes the gut reaction is correct over the best person to hire, and sometimes also the supporting evidence turns out to be false.Gladwell makes it clear that this method of arriving at decisions is not necessarily true for most people or for most of the time, yet he manages to have numerous examples of, for instance, cops not shooting a suspect who appears to be reaching for a gun. What appears to be a hostile act may or may not be accompanied by other signs that make the cop more likely to believe he's in danger.The most fascinating chapter in the book for me - \"Seven Seconds in the Bronx\" - cover a police shooting of a man reaching for his wallet, but interspersed with that is the method used by Paul Ekman, who looks for fleeting facial expressions and can also teach this to others. This would be worth a book on its own, but careful examination of slow-motion film shows people revealing their feelings for a split-second at a time - the signs that experienced people look for.I think that \"Blink\" will make you never view the world in the same way again. Read it and see.",
            "Ok so at the end of the book you are given the full belief that what you work out in your mind in the first couple of seconds of any situation you are right and just go with your \"gut\" instinct. Unless of course you are doing the cola challenge or rolling in a car with 3 other cops and are carrying weapons.The book is nice fast read but is hard to use for any practical application.",
            "It's not clear whether this book has anything in it that could be called a 'theory'.Gladwell (if he wrote it - there's so much race awareness that I can't help wondering if the book was ghosted for a professional half-caste) has two characteristics, typical of the market aimed for: [1] They must have no knowledge outside any conventional establishment beliefs, [2] They must be swayed by emotions - violence, typically, though softer emotions peep in as well.Some of Gladwell's examples are taken (I'd guess from popular books) from such worlds as art appreciation, wars, police activity, market research into drinks, and formal music. In each case the 'American' view is assumed without thinking (even momentarily). A few examples: Tom Hanks has appeared in essentially misleading films on e.g. AIDS, Vietnam war, Second World War, NASA - but Gladwell knows nothing of this, and quotes some real or imaginary casting person talking about Hanks's supposed wonderful screen image. There's an account of a cheap brandy, packaged in a boring way, losing ground to another brandy, packaged attractively. There's something similar about 'colas' - the amazing insight that one sip of a drink may have a different effect from a whole bottle. A 'veteran' of Vietnam is discussed (there is a painfully long digression on military matters) with no discussion of the rather overwhelming superiority of firepower.The examples Gladwell gives of accurate spli-second decisions generally need huge amounts of preliminary work - e.g. whether a classical trombone player is good, whether an artwork is a fake, how to sell cars, whether a facial expression exists - two men (who appeal to Derren Brown) get quite long mentions, but their decisions are only possible because videos of facial expressions now exist. All of this material is what might resonably be called 'learning'. Some material, for example the effect of facial expressions on emotions (in addition to the other way round - something claimed by William James) or of words of a certain tone on peoples' behaviour (New Yorkers becoming polite because of reading scrambles sentences with polite words in) doesn't seem to connect with the general idea of the book.One star. But only because I'm in a good mood.",
            "Like many others I bought this book thinking that it contained more scientific information. The book is just a compilation of anecdotes that the author repeats over and over again. If you read the story about the Getty's Kouros you have read the whole book.",
            "I too decided to read the book due to hype and enjoyed the beginning of the book. I soon found myself skimming forward due to the meaningless examples, military, doctors, etc. Please, we all know that data can be 'sliced' and manipulated to prove anything, even opposing viewpoints so why the long self-serving studies. I don't disagree that certain subconscience responses can guide our actions and views, tell me how to tap into that. Tell me more practical applications and everyday life situations. I found the book to be 25% value and 75% filler.",
            "Is blink worth thinking about. What do you think. OK. Just do not think.Confused! Well, now you are ready to read the book.Gladwell is a great thinker. He talks of instinctive decision-making process and starts of with how some are better at making snap judgments than others. To justify this, he tried (may be he did not think) on what could be a supportive crutch. Well, he meandered through game theory, probability, neuroscience, rapid cognition. He added a term called `thin slicing' for whatever two cents it was worth.Wow! Lazy bones and quarter brains like me, would just love this exciting piece! If some one who does not know me at all, can so confidently tell that I can take decisions in two-seconds, without thinking, why not!The examples are excellent. They are very diverse from police files, music, marriages, museum, and advertising. Great short stories that could well be a Bollywood flick. (Hmm...may be not! There is no running around trees). Also, one would need to remember how music on page 46 and is related to a police chase in page 256.Well if you are reading Gladwell, you are better off without thinking.Gladwell covers the mastery of thin slicing as a science. Excess information is a bane. Thin slicing can be done if you have practiced for 20+ years, with tons of information analysis. The example is about the two elderly women, who can clearly differentiate and articulate the thousands of flavors of margarine. God must have really given a real great number of taste buds. Quite interesting indeed!This is a very unusual book, well written, makes you think again and again and again. The later part of the book, talks of how split-second decisions have failed. The earlier part talks of how long scientific decisions fail. For heavens, take a stand.I have discussed with people, about this book and they have some extreme opinions. They better have. This book swings between extremities and we lesser humans in general have an aversion to grey areas. Think about it!I am still thinking, on what this book is all about. It is over 60 days, since I have read this book.Is it airy nothing or is it the essence of life.Is it an attempt by Gladwell to make some money without readers thinking;or is it an attempt to have readers make money without thinking.Yes, snap judgments are sometimes right and sometimes wrong.Yes, our analyzed judgments are sometimes right and sometimes wrong.Moreover, yes, the more the experience, better is our ability to make either of these judgments.Mr. Gladwell communicates the above three sentences extremely well using in the 288 page book using 4,172 sentences, 71,276 words and 412,533 characters.Well worth a read.(...)",

            "I'm surprised by all of the glowing reviews here. Unfortunately for me I suppose, this book was my introduction to Malcolm Gladwell. Wasn't impressed.As another reviewer noted already, the idea was good in theory, but apparently very difficult to approach in practice. There were far too many anecdotes (some of which dreadfully recounted the procedures of quantitative research... an absolute snore-fest), and to top it off, some of the points CONTRADICTED each other to the point where one just couldn't be sure what he was arguing for anymore. Judging from this book alone, Gladwell reminds me of one of those college professors that looks good on paper and in person, but doesn't say very much anything at all. That one obnoxious tenured professor who reads directly from PowerPoint slides and then expects her/his demonstration of lazy thinking to pass for good teaching.If you're the type of reader that recoils from the idea of using indirect--possibly irrelevant and tangential--anecdotes to make an argument, then you'll probably, at the very least, strongly dislike this little number (**SPOILER: the example that immediately comes to mind--although I'm sure there are better ones--is when he talks about the quantitative data overload suffered by the Blue Team versus the ingenious invention of the valid and reliable heart condition survey administered in Cook County). As a side note--though no less critical a point--I also found problematic the fact that he doesn't even DESCRIBE or DEFINE in any considerable detail the nebulous and highly contested term, \"unconscious.\" He just sort of takes it for granted that we all have one and use it in the same way, and on a regular basis. Again, lazy thinking.I hate giving books lousy reviews because I know from personal experience how difficult drafting a book can be. However, I would be remiss if I didn't suggest to potential readers of this book (especially the ones that are thinking about making a purchase) that there is definitely better material out there (and for FREE, no less). Just run a key search on Google Scholar and you'll find a plethora of material on this subject and related issues that are more thoroughly parsed out than the half-hearted attempt of this book. College graduates will probably know this fact all too well.",

I dont know if I buy into every point made within the book, but I defenitly enjoyed learning the new ideas, and even though I read it two years ago, some of the ideas I got from it come back to me and help me understand the split decisions I make.",

            "Throughout the novel Gladwell uses different studies, and stories to back up his beliefs, and ideas. This adds the element of reading a non-fiction book, yet Gladwell's descriptive ability, and ability to add a light tone to his research, and findings add a fictional side to the story. Gladwell does bring up many interesting topics throughout the novel, like the topic of thin slicing. I found it fascinating how many times our gut instincts are really our unconscious surveying a situation, and deciding on an opinion, or side to take. This did add much insight into my life, and allowed me to survey situations that are presented to me with new eyes.The topic that I found most interesting in this book was when Gladwell mentions how the majority of the time people have race preferences toward white people over black people. I later took the racial preference test and found that I too have a strong preference of blacks over whites, which I found amazing, and at the same time very eye opening.The topic that fascinated me the most about this book was when Gladwell talked about facial expressions, and how they, unlike verbal communication, can show someone's true feelings. Also how there was one man, Silvan Tomkins, who could easily decode and decipher anyone's facial expressions, and figure out their true personality, who inspired me.Since this book is an easy read, it was not hard for me to understand many of the topics that Gladwell covers throughout the book, like the topics that I mentioned above. Gladwell does describe and inform the reader thoroughly about each topic, and he provides many different real life situations where each topic can be applied, which makes this book fun and interesting. I enjoyed reading this book, and I am sure that many others have too; it will bring much insight and understanding into your life, as it did mine!- Avery O'Hara",

            "I love Malcolm Gladwell. He takes a unique approach to analyzing cultural phenomena as it relates to the world or buisness and management. You can learn from this book.",
            "While not science, this book is thought provoking, interesting, and fun to read. The writing is proficient, the subject is intriguing, and the author offers advice when to trust a snap judgment, and when not to trust it. Good book.",
            "Gladwell is an impressive author, and his understanding shows in this book. He applies the principles he discusses in \"The Tipping Point\" and his numerous articles in the writing of a book that is catchy and easy to read without sacrificing information. Many of the conclusions he draws are surprising and challenging to how you view everything from yourself to the justice system, but the arguments are strong, drawing on both example and research data. All told, an excellent book.",
            "We've all had the experience of knowing something we haven't really meshed through cerebrally YET ... where does this come from? Malcolm Gladwell has put it into works for us! If you are the type who likes to muse over the roots of your thoughts and their interaction with other thoughts, and well ... thinking in general, you will love this book. Not only is it informative but has offered me a greater confidence in my \"initial responses.\" So many times I've said to myself, geez I knew that why didn't I act on it?! Because my sociatal-thinking told me the data hadn't been chewed on enough. Don't you think there are some thinking processes that do not require in-depth analyzation? That they are strong enought to stand on there own! Well ... read the book!",
            "It's rare indeed that objectivity is brought to bare on a subject as ethereal as intuition. Malcolm Gladwell seem to have made strides to build a bridge that focuses our attention on this phenomenon, and to outline a possible technique to making it a practical ability. 'Blink' is a 'must read' for anyone looking for a clearer understanding of that inner voice, that sometimes come to the forefront, and demands to be heard in one's decision making.",
            "Blink and intuition go hand-in-hand. First impressions do count, and rarely are they off base.

            "I enjoyed this book much more than Gladwell'sThe Tipping Point(which I rate a 4 out of 5). Gladwell presents inBlinksome wonderful insight into our ability (and in some of us our super-ability) to intake lots of information, assess and analyze it, and come to some final decision literally in the blink of an eye.I've personally been interested in the topic of intuition and how we might be able to develop it as a skill. Gladwell's work has enabled me to further my understanding of intuition tremendously. He gives many examples and provides a lot of scientific explanation of how it works, or at least how it might work.Gladwell also provides several case studies in a variety of areas ranging from assessment of rare antique art to predicting divorce in married couples. For the case studies alone Blink is worth the price of the book.Best Of The Book: Gladwell's chapter on \"Listening with Your Eyes\" and how we often allow non-pertinent factors, such as what we SEE, to be the deciding factor in major decisions. I particularly enjoyed his description of how Abbie Conant became First Trombone for The Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. `Course it's in the conclusion of the book and you really should read the earlier chapters so you get the full impact.I recommend the book for anyone interested in how we can make snap decisions and, depending on our knowledge and expertise, often be correct.I hope you enjoyBlink.",
            "It is a really interesting book with good ideas in it about snap shot judgements and making decisions quickly. The only thing that I feel that it lacks is the application. There are different examples of how other people made decisions but it lacks information when it comes to how we can use these types of techniques in our every day lives. Good book though",
            "This book is a great read! Gladwell has a great gift for being able to tie things together and come up with general principles that make sense based on the evidence. The examples given in the book are great. Some of the conclusions are counter-intuitive to begin with, but make a lot of sense once you have had some time to think about them. A great book with good lessons.",
            "I was absolutely fascinated by this book. I got bogged down in a few places, but overall, the studies, observations, and anecdotes that Gladwell combines in his trademark readable style were absorbing. My edition had an Afterword which I highly commend--conclusions he's come to from feedback since the book's first publication.I was particularly interested in the studies on facial expressions and their significance. I'd always heard that you should smile when you're talking on the telephone, but studies indicate an even more powerful connection between facial expression and emotion. When researchers intentionally mimicked facial expression identified with negative, sad, or evil emotions, they literally started feeling bad!Another fascinating conclusion the Gladwell comes to -- and of particularly significance in this age of information overload -- is that there is a \"sweet spot\" of optimal decision making where we make the best decision, and after that, more information actually deteriorates the quality of decision making. Interesting stuff!",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's Blink is about how unconscious thought, maybe can referred as instinct, affects human behavior and decision making.For example, professionals do what they do without thinking because they have conditioned themselves on the basics so much so that they no longer have to think about it - they just do it. It is like chewing gum and walking at the same time. Two of those things are so basic that most people can do it without thinking about it and moreover while thinking about something else. It is these unthinking thoughts is what Blink describes.Blink also describes about gut feelings. Gut feelings compel people to do or not to do things. Because of the nature of gut feelings, people cannot really describe why they have them. Blink discusses these undescribable gut feelings and how they help us and harm us.Also, Blink talks about situations of TMI (Too Much Information) and how sometimes people who rely on gut and experience can survive and outsmart those who are armed with TMI. I thought the part about TMI was pretty good. Sort of makes me wonder if people who try to integrate TMI really know what they are doing.I have read Outliers, The Tipping Point, and What the Dog Saw. To me, the story about panic and choking from the What The Dog Saw was an extension from Blink. Blink ranks about 2nd best from his books, Outliers being the best. From reading this book, it sort of makes me wonder how how he thinks and how he notices common subtleties of human life. Blink was a different book - it relates more to thought than behavior or effort.Blink was a good book. I was left still thinking about the unconscious thoughts that Blink describes.",
            "\"Blink,\" one in a series of excellent books by Malcolm Gladwell, is one of those rare publications that actually makes you think about how you think. This concept, covered in an engaging and entertaining voice by Gladwell, may seem confusing, strange, boring, or all of the above at first glance. Rest assured -- this book is anything but boring, strange, or confusing -- it is a wonderful publication that entertains and teaches in equal measure.With a rhetorical style akin to that conveyed by Michael Pollen inIn Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto, Gladwell presents readers with data and hypotheses. He carefully and logically supports his conclusion(s), but does not force his perspective on his readers. Gladwell's style, rather, is one of engaging and involving the reader on a journey of learning.For the interested reader, Gladwell offers stories and characters that engage, and ideas and perspectives that stimulate thought. This is a wonderful book that is well worth a read.",
            "This book is a great read. Very engaging and thoughtful. The author provides some wonderful new insights into how we make decisions from the gut or at the blink of an eye. From this insight you can start making more intelligent decisions on how you take advantage of your instincts.My only complaint and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that the author doesn't give enough definitive advice about what we can do to better ourselves with the knowledge he provides. There are suggestions and hints but any conclusion is a little weak. Regardless, I have read this book twice and will read it again so I can continue to understand my own gut instincts and make better decisions in the blink of an eye.If you enjoy this book, check out Emotional Intelligence. Although a little dry, Emotional Intelligence reflects some of the points made by Malcolm Gladwell in Blink.",
            "Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking is Gladwell's book of accurate decisions made rapidly. Gladwell uses examples throughout the book to support his thesis of something he calls \"thin-slicing.\" This term is the snap judgement that crosses a person's mind at a spontaneous moment. The book is laced with interesting and unusual topics of rapid cognition.Although the topics are unusual, they reflect every day life situations for the reader. This gives his audience a connection to the examples that he uses. In the first few hundred pages of the book he uses first impressions in the eyes of an art connoisseur, a car dealer, politicians, and doctors. Each example the person is forced to make a snap judgement. Gladwell's examples make these snap judgements based off years of experience and knowledge. These examples link to the thesis that Blink is based upon.Gladwell gives interesting examples that focus on the unconscious. In the priming experiment a student was given a group of tangled sentences that all give the state of being old. After the student was done reading the sentences, he walked more slowly like an elderly person. This experiment goes behind what Gladwell calls it as the \"locked door\" in your unconscious. This example in the book was unpredictable, unlike some of the other examples that Gladwell gives.After getting further into the book, the examples become less relevant to the thesis. In the beginning, the stories appeared more interesting, but the book sidetracked to other irrelevant topics. One example in particular made me want to skip the section entirely. The topics ranged from a blind taste test of Pepsi product verse Coca-Cola to a singing artist named Kenna who was cheated out of making it big.While reading, I had this feeling that if I were to just randomly pick up this book and start in the middle, I would already have a sense of what the book is primarily about. Although Gladwell is a very good storyteller, his stories didn't seem to have any sort of structure. The book began to lose it's interesting connotation by being repetitive. Gladwell took the \"thin-slicing\" theory and traveled off on a tangent.At the end of the book, there wasn't much of an ending. It ended with another story. If thats the case, then the book could have ended after the first chapter of thin-slicing. Toward the end of the book the people in certain examples are sketched with less experience. For instance, the taste testing challenge and the song artist wouldn't have as much experience as the two women who were professionally taste testers. They have had years of experience and knowledge of understanding their tongue pallet.Overall, the book had a very good point. The author was saying that the more education and experience a person has, the more likely they are to make a better snap judgement. It seems like the author wanted people to be able to slow down the thinking process to control their responses to the event that is taking place.",
            "This book is a real eye opener. It isn't quite like a how to book as the sub title suggests. It is more of a book that explains the brain works. The title suggests is is about how to think. It really focuses on how the brain makes decisions.The points are very interesting but nothing revolutionary. He goes back several times to the point how the brain needs just enough information. To much information overloads the brains and slows the process. These principles are things you already know and experience but didn't quite realize. After reading the book you will find out why those things happen. Through reading the book your mind will start to work. I am sure the average person will think of things where they could apply the principles. I am sure some people will reap huge rewards from the principles in the book. Most will just be enlightened. Overall it is a real good read.",
            "I feel this book provides insights from real world examples which make the book much more tangible for me. As a professional working for a large corporation as well as a citizen in the U.S. the amount of red tape is startling. That said, as with all information one must read it understand how it applies and remember not all situations will ever be the same. Taking the concepts from this book into my job has been very useful. It provokes thought and is very entertaining.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell continues to deliver good reading material which makes the reader think and - if you'll pardon the lame joke - blink in surprise more than once. Gladwell's style is that of the pop intellectual or pop psychologist, but the anecdotes and academic studies he discusses are legitimate and not easily dismissed.Much of the book centers on innate biases, hard-wired perceptive abilities, and the often-surprising strengths and weaknesses of the human ability to make split-second decisions. For readers who are not familiar with heuristics, \"priming\" (the vulnerability of the human brain to the power of suggestion), and basic psychology, this book opens a fascinating realm of discovery and will leave the reader wanting more. Even for readers with a fairly high level of knowledge on such topics, there is certain to be some unfamiliar territory in this book, making it fascinating and fun reading. Just remember: it is a popular book and not an academic treatise. I recommend, whatever the reader's level of familiarity with the topics Gladwell discusses, treating it not as an endpoint but as a launching pad for further investigation.Overall, this is a great and fun read.",
            "I am giving this book four stars for bringing together so many interesting studies and facts into one book. As a hypnotherapist the commentary on the various aspects of the power of the unconscious mind were fascinating to me. The book could have been more cohesive and explained why split second impressions can be both beneficial or detrimental. The weave of all this information was a little loose, and it tended toward repetition of the same concepts over again. I enjoyed it and have recommended it to others.",
            "A must read for anyone who has or needs a clue. Facinating examples about what sets people apart as thought leaders and experts using cognitive strength. Hard to put down once you start.",
            "This is one of a number of recent books that could be subtitled \"Aren't Humans Quirky?\".You will learn a great deal about how your preception works, often in counter-intuitive ways.It is a light read that will both entertain and educate you. You may come away with the tendency to make less assumptions about your experiences and the need to pay much close attention to what is going on around you and how you preceive it.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's obviously done his research. He writes clearly and articulately. But, I found Blink wanting.While the book starts strong, and presents a compelling argument, in my opinion I thought it kind of fizzled out. I would have enjoyed greater substantiation of the Blink theory.But, this is a pop psychology book. I'm sure the author was advised against inundating readers with too many facts. Still, when reading such a work, more supporting facts would have proven beneficial.It's certainly worth reading (and a fast read), but not necessarily justifiable hard cover material.",
            "While people from all walks of life will enjoy this book and benefit from it, I have been recommending it to all of my clients who must \"sell\" for a living. Many of the principles Gladwell espouses have been covered in greater detail elsewhere (many of the NLP books out there come to mind) but none have been so enjoyable to read and so easily understood. His notion of \"thin slicing\", and how it can at times provide a better answer in a \"blink\" of an eye as compared to more lengthy and robust analysis is right on the money.I also enjoyed the book's focus on the power of the unconcious mind and the examples provided that show just how easily influenced our unconcious minds are. Again, plenty of selling and marketing applications can be seen.In my opinion Gladwell has hit another winner following on the heels of the Tipping Point.",
            "Blink\" is carried along by the strength of the vignettes and the author's clear understanding of a very innate ability: interesting how even on this review list how much those belief patterns we all have. I loved the book and had to see what Malcom's latest book was about. Wow. I'm just blown away by the information in this book and the insight into why our first impressions are right sometimes and wrong other times. I highly recommend this book.",
            "Now that I reflect on this book, I think that the central message that it conveys is common sense: if you have deep expertise in a particular domain, then the snap judgments that you make in that domain may give you as good or better results than any amount of analysis. Even so, the book is still a very enjoyable read - the anecdotes that Gladwell uses to illustrate his points are each entertaining in their own right. I recommend the book as a good diversion, and as a source of interesting anecdotes across a range of topics (attributes to watch out for in assessing the likelihood that a couple will stay together, leading without micro managing, understanding the entire range of factors that influence purchase decisions (new coke), when to be wary of your intuition, etc.).",
            "The author makes compelling arguments about when quick decision making--in a blink--works and when it doesn't, but he doesn't highlight them, so they're easy to miss. I suggest reading it a chapter a time. Even though it's short, give it some time for the impressions to sink in.The examples and stories are stupendous. They'll stick with you. I still find myself referring to them months after I read it.",
            "Blink was fast and fascinating reading. The idea that subconscious mind constantly churns in the background, only to reveal its accurate conclusions as feelings and intuition makes a great foundation for this book. The author's insight and logic add great value to the well-researched facts.I found it to be profound and thought provoking. I am learning to trust my intuition.",
            "I enjoyed Gladwell's writing style and ability to incorporate data from many fields. In the end, I find his analyses a bit shallow, but useful food for thought.",
            "Blink kept me engaged in its stories and got me thinking about things I never gave much thought. I also went to a web site that he had mentioned and it actually worked! I recommend it especially to anybody who's job requires them to make split second decisions.",

            "This book is one of the few non-fiction books that has had been rivetted.

            "My writing would sound a little freaky -try weirdo sometimes- to the western mind; but as a Muslim, what so called Blinks is part of your daily life. You are somehow told to always try to understand by perception what you cannot see by your eyes.I have noticed that far-eastern philosophers and strategists entice their followers in the same manner: thanks God we are not alone in this one as well!!Well, the book is a mess, a kind of mumbo-jumbo worthless ritual, works as multiple articles in a newspaper as one of the reviewers put it; but not in a good one. In some chapters, we are told how brilliant it is to relay on blinks (or on that thin layer of your... whatever) and in others we are told how deadly this could be. In some chapters, mathematics approve the blinking facts, in others chemicals tests disapprove it... so all in all, there are no positive definite evidences, nor negative definite ones: meaning, there is no theory!!So why the author wrote a book about it? Is it to make money, or simply because he know how to write in fluid and smooth way? He really does; and I am almost confident that when he speaks he never stops. Because the book could be 100 pages less if you remove the chewing of the repeated fractions of it; which, somehow -if you are in an airplane for example- could make you believe that you are finding a series of rings that would form a chain ultimately.It is a simple fact that logic theories do not apply on spiritual matters such as perceptions. It has not been proven that brains have layers (like cakes). And it is dead wrong to write books telling us that there are such layers before real science discovers it.",

            "Having read recent articles written by Gladwell in the New Yorker, and having offered him the courtesy of access to information for the purposes of more objective reporting, and yet never hearing from him, it strikes me that the content of anything written by the author has to be taken as \"for comedic purposes only\". How anyone can consider Gladwell a serious author or innovative thought leader needs to complete more detailed research in to his writing. Blink proves to be ample additional proof that in future generations, when school children are reviewing the work of early 21st century writers, Gladwell's work will be used as an example of what NOT to aspire to...",
            "Although many people does make decisions quickly and those decisions appear to come out of thin air, the author omit the fact that many of them may not want others to know why they make those decisions. Those intuition all based on many years experience and logic deduction, and the only way to be able to make those seemingly blink decision is to immerse yourself into the relevant environment and make many decisions based on facts and logics, eventually, you will be able to reach the level of making quick and correct decision without a lot of pondering.",

I'm hoping it'll pick up the pace as I keep reading.",
            "The book \"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\" by Malcolm Gladwell covers the unconscious ability to make correct answers or reactions by trusting in instinct. He wrote this book on the theory that a snap decision from a person can become a more accurate response compared to a well thought out conclusion. Gladwell tries to prove his idea in an interesting way by presenting different occurrences in stories that involve the use of a gut-decision becoming more reliable in relation to evidence and thought. He wants to demonstrate to us that we have the aptitude to use this sense in many situations but we just don't notice it yet. Gladwell also clearly refutes his idea by saying that your unconscious decisions can most commonly be wrong when becoming sidetracked using emotions or facts to consider your final answer.Overall he wrote a good book by incorporating interesting stories with a well-written description of each to establish proof that his theory of unconscious judgments are correct. I read through this book becoming more and more interested after each anecdote Gladwell described. However, I may not be fully convinced that what he is trying to validate is true. There were some problems that went through my head that were not very clear when reading Gladwell's book. For example one of his goals for writing this book was to teach the reader how to notice these unconscious signs. On the other hand, all he wrote about was different cases where people were correct when using snap judgments. He never went into showing us how to recognize the signs ourselves. Also with many of his stories he never went into excessive detail that could have otherwise been major factors proving why a person was instinctively right. All together, Gladwell's book was an enjoyable read and I would definitely recommend this to others!",
            "Gladwell has done what the rest of us did not think of doing - thats his 'tipping point' - he states the obvious. Everything in this book is basically stating the obvious. It is not new - just taking the pbvious and writing it up in a really nice way. Would I recommend it? - NOT REALLY",
            "Gladwell has a lot of great points but for me they get lost in long drawn out stories. The stories themselves are good, but if you goal is to get to the meaty part then you have to wade through pages of stories to get to what is often a one sentence point. A cliff notes version of this book would be recommended.",
            "The first half of the book was definately worth the read and i would suggest you buy it just for the ladder half, however about halfway through he gets entirely off subject and starts talking about Coke-cola and Pepsi in taste tests vs entire drink tests etc... How things are advertised etc...I can see how it fits into the subject, about Thin slicing, but he got so far off subject that i was no longer able to hold an interest in the book and stopped about 3/4 the way through.The first half of the book talks about Thin slicing; the process in which your mind relates the information it is receiving to past events in order to gain an understanding of it. He gives numerous examples of this and it is rich in detail. Definately a good read until he gets off subject. Two stars.",
            "Well I think books like these are easy to read, easy to grasp, easy to relate to and somewhat easy to digest. This probably explains its massive popularity. However as some of the other reviewers have rightly mentioned that there's not much of an insight or new findings presented. It's just anecdotes, events, encounters and happenings of rather random nature but presented in a way that really invokes interest.",
            "I genuinely could not put down this book. If you have any personal insight, you should enjoy this book. A fascinating look at how much our subconscious influences everything we do everyday. I'm shocked at the other reviews. I think perhaps it's a bit of the whole \"inconvenient truth\" thing; maybe it's not that they don't like the book but they don't like to face what it's trying to tell them - that we do not have complete conscious control over everything. Scary, maybe, but this book can help teach us how to harness that. I'm an actor and director and for someone who has to look at what makes people tick, it's a brill book. My husband got bored of me telling everyone we meet every piecce of research in it!",
            "The number one, rated 'most helpful' review of this book is flawed. It starts out wanting to prove Gladwell wrong, like SO MANY 'ARMCHAIR' intellectuals.There is a study in this book about college students. Their friends rated what kind of people they were, and then strangers looked through their room, and filled out a report on what kind of people they thought they were.The point of contention is that -Gladwell- never explains in the book how the study was conducted. The 'most helpful' review acts as though this was Gladwell's study and that Gladwell had the burden in 'Blink' of explaining the scientific controls for it. That is MORONIC and CHILDISH.This is a book citing DOZENS if not HUNDREDS of scientific studies. If you are the kind of person who wants to prove Gladwell wrong because he is successful, PLEASE READ THE STUDIES HE IS REFERRING TO. They are complete, explain the experimental method, and are interesting of their own right.I am SICK TO DEATH of people who think they are SO SMART who think they have 'proved Gladwell wrong' all because they are DEATHLY AFRAID of primary source technical documents. If you don't even understand what I just said, guess what - you aren't the sad lonely person who is going to prove Gladwell wrong.He does this for a job and its not because everybody isn't as smart as you that they like him, reviewers.If you don't know how to look up reports and studies, and the idea never even occurred to you that this isn't a book of experimental data, please just read 'Clifford the Big Red Dog' instead of trying to prove you are a genius. You're probably not.",
            "Isn't it good to know about the things we know but don't realize how we know them? This book will give you insight on your reactions and some situations where we are not making good decisions. Fast and enjoyable read.",
            "The subtitle `The power of thinking without thinking' nicely captures the essence of this fascinating book.Malcolm Gladwell, author of The Tipping Point, here sets out to explore why it is that sometimes the thinking in the blink of an eye provides greater understanding and insight than that which follows a mountain of analysis. He asserts that our subconscious is continuously collecting and processing information, much of it directing our actions but in ways totally unseen by our conscious mind.The book begins with an introduction to some intriguing examples to illustrate this power of insight and introduces the idea of `thin slicing', the ability we all have to evaluate a situation very quickly, capturing core information on which to base a decision.Having introduced the concept Malcolm is at pains to explain that he is not simply advocating the abandonment of analysis in favour of gut reaction. Our instinctive judgements sometimes prove correct but at other times can lead us astray. His key message is that they offer different approaches to creating understanding, and both analysis and intuition may be performed well or badly. However in some instances, particularly in a rapidly changing world, there is simply not the time for the laboured analysis required in an attempt to understand everything, and the only viable course of action is to thin slice.The good news is that thin slicing skills can be learned and honed. We all collect this information, all of the time, the subtle skill is in being able to use it effectively.This is a fascinating book with ideas of relevance to everyone dealing with change. What makes it particularly engaging is the breadth of examples used to illustrate the ideas. Many of these may have you rethinking not only what you think, but how you think.For example there is a study made by insurance companies of the risk doctors face of being sued. The study identified that the risk had little if anything to do with the quality of the doctor, or even the number of mistakes they made. Rather the level of risk was a direct result of how much the doctor was liked by their patients. The risk was not a function of what the doctor was doing, but how they were being.Another example brings into question the confidence we may have in conducting any kind of customer testing. There's a fascinating account of the testing of types of brandy which deduced that the stated taste preference of customers had nothing to do with the brandy at all. Subconsciously and unbeknown to them it was the shape of the bottle that made the brandy taste better.Once we become aware of this priming of our subconscious, we can use it to our advantage. For example studies have shown that test scores can be dramatically influenced simply be priming our minds with thoughts of success. Students answering questions from the Trivial Pursuit board game scored 55.6% after they had spent five minutes thinking what it would be like to be a professor. In contrast when they spent five minutes thinking about football hooligans they scored 42.6%. Just thinking about professors, primed them to achieve more.Profoundly disturbing is the example of what can happen when we are pressured to rely on our subconscious when it has been miss-primed. The case of Amadou Diallo who was shot by four police officers is used to illustrate the effect similar to autism that is created when our intuition is inappropriately primed.This is an engagingly written account that had me hooked as I read it cover to cover. It develops an interesting idea using examples that will set your thinking running in new directions. An enjoyable and stimulating read. It leaves you at one and the same time seeing things as far less and yet far more simple than they've ever been before.",
            "It was an interesting read, and anecdote laden at that. It has given me food for thought on how I rapidly view my world on a minute to minute basis, all on a subconscious level. Basically, 'thin-slicing' is a tremendous skill set a person can have in navigating the minefield we call Ordinary Life, i.e., our jobs, our family, our friends, our connections to the world. I am also appreciative of the fact that the author has also highlighted hidden dangers and negative costs for thin-slicing, such as 'temporary autism'. Sometimes, there's just no substitute for experienced judgement that only builds in a person after decades of wisdom, expertise, and just plain creative savvy. Overall, a recommended read.",
            "Snap judgments are arrived at by a ruthless pruning of information, which our brains process without our being aware of it. A good snap judgment occurs when the information which has been discarded is irrelevant to the matter in hand; a bad one when it is not. An overload of information leads to a paralysis of judgment, which is why information-gathering bureaucracies are often not merely inefficient but grotesquely error-prone.Gladwell's book, which starts well enough, meanders and begins to go off the point about halfway through. This is probably because the subject cannot sustain a full-length study without digression. His style is conversational and easy to read but (for me at least) too colloquial.",
            "Blink by Malcolm Gladwell has a lot of interesting and unusual observations, mixed in with research and life stories that all tie together neatly. Some of it is fun, you get to take tests. You also have to figure out what people are saying to each other, when you suspect the words of the conversation have nothing whatever to do with what they are actually trying to tell each other. Thinking while talking and listening is a skill and this book helps develop that skill by teaching you to hear between the lines.What's really great about this book is it is not boring and there are plenty clever tips you can add to your communications skill set. It also has some fascinating things to say about decision making and personal motives.Though none of the information is really provocative, some of it very unusual. I thought the military decision making was especially interesting. All and all it was solid information delivered in an easy to read style that kept it interesting and entertaining as well as educational.",
            "How do individuals in critical roles such as firemen, airline pilots and process plant operators make split-second decisions that happen to be correct most of the time? And what causes them to make the wrong decision from time to time? This book is filled with examples of what appear to be \"gut feel\" decisions that upon detailed examination prove to be the result of calculated situational assessments and analyses, all in a fraction of a second. Gladwell attributes this phenomenon to the \"unconscious\" mind and its ability to process lots of input data rapidly to arrive at the right decision.This is a must read for every engineer, designer, consultant and manager who is concerned with human performance. It is a fun/fast read.We in the processing industries operate on the belief that ALL accidents are preventable. Given that all accidents - minor and catastrophic - can ultimately be traced back to human error at one point or another - either by neglecting to take action when necessary or taking the wrong action - it is imperative that professionals in the field of HUMAN PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT understand how critical decisions are made in an instant. Particularly in the filed of process plant operations, where every year we still see accidents take lives and maim individuals, it is crucial that proper systems be put in place to support operators in their critical decision making process. Two factors lead to making the correct decision during moments of chaos - the competency of the operator and the quality of the data presented to him.The only criticism of this book (and why it did not get the 5 stars) is that it is very heavy on examples to prove its point and too light on measures to improve chances for better decision-making.",
            "(Helpful? Not? Please vote, so I know someone is reading these :^) I have now enjoyed both of Gladwell's books. Blink is quite a bit better annotated and organized than the first, IMHO, and though the last couple of chapters seemed a bit disjunct, he managed to tie it all back together (though a bit abruptly). I'd say, it's not a treatise on instantaneous perceptions, but is a good all around view of several issues surrounding the snap judgments we all make every day. \"Blink\" dissected what I'd call subconscious cognition (if that's not a nonsense term), and started me thinking about the more minute details or sub-sections of the phenomenon. A nice example of this was his discussion of professional food tasters. Who'd have thought there would be a 10-pt scale for a dozen different measures of food texture, all contributing to the final texture rating?!? Slipperiness ... Crispiness ... and so on. This only to illustrate that experts have a different view into things than you and I. This is loosely true of each of thousands of professions, so it gets one to thinking about all that specialized knowledge out there that leads one person to make a different snap decision than another.I think that this might be a good jumping off point for several areas of continued reading. I was particularly intrigued by the sections about facial expressions, and how cops \"remember\" a shooting incident. How parts of our mental abilities can shut down, and how others can heighten involuntarily. I can't say \"Blink\" is the kind of treatment of the subject that would be called exhaustive, or overly scientific, but Gladwell includes plenty of statistics, correlating facts and annotations for further exploration. As I said, it's a fun read, and also a good jumping off point as well. You can consume this book easily in a couple of sittings, and I think you'll enjoy it.",
            "As with \"The Tipping Point,\" Malcolm Gladwell manages to be both insightful and entertaining with \"Blink.\" A very easy and fast read, and yet there is a lot of thoughtful information presented on difficult topics such as racism and sexism. It reveals the problems of trying our best not to be prejudiced, even toward ourselves. If we slice responses thin enough, our intent is replaced with how we actually see the world - and we might not like it.",
            "I like Malcolm Gladwell. He's criticized by some for a lack of academic rigor. While I agree that his work tends to focus more on witticisms, I consider that fact to be mostly positive. Even though I enjoy intellectual people, I have a distaste for some aspects of academia. Academics argue that information is lost when technical ideas are distilled into common language. But even if that's partially true, I think it's more important for an idea to be widely understood by the general populous--because that's when an idea really takes on power.For an idea to really take on that power, you have to feel it. There's a possibility for danger in that sentiment, because it's possible to feel something that's not true. But if something's true, AND you can feel it--that's a powerful idea with ability to spread.Malcolm Gladwell does an excellent job of spreading ideas. Most of them are great. Those that aren't great aren't a big deal, because they can be refined and corrected in the robust discussion that his books promote.",
            "The first chapter was the hook, but as it went on it began to get a little repetitive. It wasn't really adding anything new and the topics began to feel scattered. It was as if the author had a bunch of really cool stories and facts that kinda-sorta all fit together, so he slapped them in.That said, I found most of it very interesting. It was also pretty easy to read - despite feeling scattered. If you're interested in a collection of psychological research in a fun, easy to read and understand format, pick up a copy of Blink. I enjoyed reading it.Also Recommended Understanding: Train of Thought.",
            "If you're interested in learning more about the psychology of consciousness, \"Blink\" is a good place to start. Filled with entertaining and insightful anecdotes which illustrate the workings of the unconscious mind, this book will definitely get you thinking about the psychological (and, to a lesser degree, the philosophical) issues surrounding how we think.However, I'm afraid that some readers may conclude that mere insight into the unconscious mind will change behavior for the better - this isn't always the case. Don't read this as a how-to book for changing your unconsciousness mind, but rather just as a general over-view of one branch of cognitive psychology. If you're feeling adventurous after reading this, check out Jayne's \"Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind\" or Wegner's \"The Illusion of Conscious Will\".",
            "I was riveted from start to finish. Gladwell reveals how we can become superior decision makers, in our homes, our workplaces, and in our daily lives. It's remarkable to realize that this book represents the life work of many brilliant researchers, most of whom we would never know except for this book. Gladwell has taken decades and volumes of highly technical research and made these concepts accessible to the average reader and anyone can see almost instantly how it applies to everyday situations we all encounter.I also recommend Understanding: Train of Thought.",
            "As with his breakthrough surprise best-sellerThe Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference, Malcolm Gladwell's follow up offering is stuffed stem to stern with fascinating anecdote, and presented in the same breezy manner. And while, I suppose, there's a consistent argument buried somewhere in there, I'm blowed if I know what it is.Gladwell apparently can't make up his mind whether snap judgments are good things (as they seem to be for the purpose of spotting art forgeries and waging guerilla warfare) or bad things (as they seem to be when manifesting themselves in a form of temporary cop autism which causes innocent bystanders to get shot). What one is left with is a collection of anecdotes about the subconscious and immediate, each fascinating in its own right, make no mistake, and each of which undoubtedly carries its own situation-specific lesson, but which together sum up to precisely nothing at all. Sometimes Blink-style judgments are good; sometimes they proceed from our innate primordial racism. Great. Kind of.The story I found most interesting though, on reflection, perhaps the least genuinely on point (assuming the point is \"how snap judgments shape the world we live in\"), was the importance of a physician's bedside manner in assessing his (or her) likelihood of being the subject of a medical negligence suit. Gladwell would say this has everything to do with \"thin-slicing\" - but it is difficult to see the similarity between this sort of thin-slicing and the thin-slicing encapsuated in cop shootings or on-the-fly military strategics. But there is definitely a lesson in there for those following the professional services calling: If your clients think you're nice, you are less likely to get sued, no matter how useless you might really be - and vice versa! That's a banker.That observation might equally apply to this book itself: it doesn't uncover any single great insight about our mental lives, but Gladwell gets away with it because he's such an affable chap, and he writes in such an appealing way, that it seems churlish to hold this against him. We don't begrudge him what really is a fairly poorly knitted cardigan of fireside yarns - since ugly old jumpers are perfect for loafing about in on holiday, and on holiday is certainly where I read this book: as a kind of extended weekend paper feature it seemed just fine.Olly Buxton",
            "This is not as good as The Tipping Point. Having said that, it is very much worth reading. Today's world requires that we make important decisions quickly. The total quality management movement has lead to an over-emphasis/reliance on data and the important notion of gut feel has been diminished. We often don't have time to research exhaustively. However, even when we do, the initial feel of something is critical.Gladwell draws on social psychology to help us understand the biases we bring to decision making. He also helps us understand that our capacity to quickly size someting up accurately is a gift we'd do well to recognize and appreciate.If you live a life where you have to make choices, read this book.",
            "Here's some words that describe this lenghty and boring book - lenghty and boring to begin, not useful, too basic, did i mention boring? Oh yes i did. Outier is a way better read.

Use that instead, unless you're eating a hamburger.",

I just wish they would have been their original size.",
            "I really did enjoy this book, but it didn't change my life or make me desperately want to read anything else by this author.The negatives: The start of the novel is a touch disjointed and jumps around a bit. Lacks focus at the beginning. (The book's flow is just fine at the end though). It still jumps around though. This book is racially charged and clearly written by an African American. This isn't a bad thing, but all the racist accusations are pointed toward white against black. Nothing of Islam or Middle Eastern prejudice or others. He does touch a bit of blacks being prejudiced against blacks which is interesting, but I would just love to have heard more expanded research into some concepts.Positives: If you're a fan of the TV show, Lie to Me, you'll at the very least like this book. Interesting read. Has some great incites. I'm tired of writing this review now.....",
            "It was a good book. Just not what I had expected from the book based on what I had heard from a 3rd party. Not the fault of the seller. It was the fault of the person that recommended it to me.",
            "I found this book absorbing and I enjoyed Gladwell's pleasant and approachable style of writing. I find human behavior fascinating and if you do too I can't imagine how you wouldn't enjoy this book. It made for an ideal beach book as you can read it in short bursts or stay absorbed in it for long hours. I go to the beach with my large family, ( = frequent interruptions), and I found this book held my interest strongly yet was not so deeply complex that I would have to back way up if something broke my train of thought.",

            "This book is written in a great way. It keeps you turning the pages until the last page. However as the author is journalist and not a psychologist, folks who expected a technical book might be disappointed. Nevertheless a great read for an everyday person.",
            "Good read, not a dull moment. Covers lots of related and interesting topics such as snap judgement, thin-slicing, the right and wrong and mind-reading, etc. Perfect summer read. No deep thinking is required here but it does make you ponder more about our everyday's thinking. Recommended!Just happened to read an article today about Malcolm's other office, Savoy in SoHo, where he wrote a big chunk of this book there.[...]I cannot help but to think that from the restaurant windows where he could see people on the street walking by ... what a environment it was for him to write a book about people. How he might have witnessed the bystanders using snap judgement and thin-slicing while he is working on the very same material.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's \"Blink\" is an engaging collection of miscellaneous sociocultural and psychological studies, observations, and research that establishes the unconscious brain's focal role in making instinctive, comprehensive and rapid judgments about external stimuli in interactions with others and in everyday to emergency situations. Gladwell brings up an interesting and innovative theory that as human beings, our instincts are one of the most essential and powerful driving forces in our lives, and that our intuition is nevertheless often neglected and manipulated by our outside environment through prejudice, misleading information, first impressions, and superficial appearances. \"Blink\" is fascinating as a whole, even though certain articles are a bit too lengthy and meticulous in detail, and appeals to a wide range of people, as almost anybody can relate with the experience of feeling an emotion so strongly that you can't begin to explain or rationally justify. I would definitely recommend this book; Gladwell explains much of the often ignored impulses that human beings naturally experience and furthermore guides the reader to be more confident in their instincts, whether in making business decisions or in getting involved with other people at work or in personal relationships.",
            "In Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, Malcolm Gladwell explains that \"thin-slicing\", the ability to sum up a situation and make decisions and assumptions based on very little time and what seems like very little information, is sometimes as good or better than making decisions after lots of thought and research. He gives the reader lots of examples including salesmen, war tactics, firemen, hospitals, job hiring, science, museums, and relationships, among many others. I find that the examples are fascinating because it seems like there is a lot of truth in it all. People give the subconscious much less credit than it deserves. By \"thin-slicing\", one's subconscious makes decisions and choices all day long even when one does not feel like they are actually doing so. One's subconscious can pick up on little thoughts and indications that sometimes one does not even know they have.However, Gladwell also addresses the fact that sometimes one's subconscious can make the wrong decision based on biases that one may not even be aware of. Therefore, there is a time and a place for snap judgments, or \"thin-slicing\", but there is also a time and a place for careful and detailed research and analysis. His examples at the beginning are very strong but as the book goes on they get more and more vague and disconnected from what seemed like his main point originally. Overall though I enjoyed the book and found it very interesting because the stories and examples are engaging and amusing.",
            "Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell interestingly enough is a book that will make you think about thinking. The idea that most of our decisions are made in the blink of an eye and that we can't even explain the reasoning behind them is intriguing and sometimes a little scary. Readers may find themselves pausing while going about their everyday activities to question a decision they made without realizing they made it. Gladwell describes the concept in a way that leaves the reader wondering why they never thought of the points he makes. His examples give a deeper understanding of the idea of making a decision without knowing why even if the examples are sometimes experiments that make the reader squirm a little as they read. The section where Gladwell discusses a military exercise gives a moment's pause about the inflexibility of military thinking but could also be applied to any situation that pits two groups against one another. Gladwell also spends quite a bit of time talking about the results of testing that examine our preconceived and possibly subconscious thoughts about others. He explains the benefits and the pitfalls of thinking without thinking. Blink is a simple but powerful and fascinating look into the way our brain works often without our knowledge to make split-second decisions.",
            "Disappointment comes along when you get far less than what you'd expect. I am simply disappointed at this book. Read hundreds of pages to understand what the author tries to delivery to its readers. Here they are:- \"Subconscious part of human brain can be overwhelmed and eventually become dysfunctional if loaded with more information than the brain needs in order to make decisions.\" Well, this is called redundant info. This can, of course, paralyze your decision making process because your brain needs to factor this redundant data into decision making process even in the dark side (subconscious). So there is nothing new here.- \"The dark-side of our brain, people can have biased attitudes towards others on the basis of race, gender, weight, height. Nothing fancy here either.\" Even advertisers use various techniques to conquer a piece from this side of our brain to have us make biased decisions when we see their product on the shelf or TV. or simply switch to a news channel.- \"Our subconscious is so powerful that sometimes it helps us see something while others keep looking or make decisions that turn out to be good later down the road.\"- \"Rapid cognition and snap judgements are some good examples of how human subconscious works.\"It would be nice to read something about how this \"subconscious\" in human brain develops over time since we are born as the majority of the points in the book revolve around this \"subject\". Happy readings.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell seems to have made a career out of writing one-idea books and turning them into bestsellers! I liked this one better than the Tipping Point (some ideas have \"stickiness but we don't really know why) and Outliers (It takes ten thousand hours to become expert at something- perspiration instead of inspiration)Having said all that, Gladwell writes very well. It's smooth ride from start to finish and there are some moments that will yield genuine surprise. These books read like some sort of dissertation, a hypothesis with supporting arguments. But you always feel that the question was decided at the outset and Gladwell doesn't present or deal with much information to contradict his hypothesis. In that sense, perhaps it is (as one reviewed remarked) one part \"junk science\"",
            "Mr. Gladwell explores in detail the nuances of first impressions and the split-second decisions we make based on those first impressions. This his second book which was followed by Outliers - which focused on how those we consider excellent become excellent - this book focuses on how snap judgments can oftentimes be absolutely correct judgments. It also delves into how sometimes snap judgments can be horribly wrong and even at times deadly.My opinion:After reading Mr. Gladwell's third book Outliers and being extremely impressed Blink only goes on to solidify Mr. Gladwell's reputation for excellent research woven into intriguing storytelling. If you ever wondered if your \"hunch\" about someone was right...Gladwell shows proof that often times it is in fact correct. I enjoyed this book for the most part but at times the truth that Gladwell exposes raises concern; especially to someone whom, like Gladwell, shares ancestors from the African continent and thus is exposed to many snap judgments that are not helpful to the one being judged simply because of the color of one's skin. That being said, the book gives the reader many reasons to \"trust their gut\" while also giving situations when it might be a better idea to second-guess said \"gut\".",
            "I was assigned this book for my AP Econ class and was worried that it was going to be like an English summer reading assignment, where you dreaded picking up the book and beginning. But as I started the book, I could not put it down. Even while I was on vacation, I still had it in hand reading. Blink discusses the reasons why we do the things we do and it was very interesting. The writing was entertaining and easy to understand. Some may be skeptical about a book dealing with the economy, but this book deals with the pyschology behind it all. I recommend this book to anyone.",
            "Most of the so-so or negative reviews I've seen of this book base their opinions on the cohesiveness of the examples Gladwell uses. In doing so, I think they're missing the point, and worse - the overall message.Part of the reason for this is in the book's name and marketing. The name, \"Blink\" seems to suggest that every example in this book will showcase some amazing decision made in a split second. The Amazon review (which I suspect comes from the physical book's dust cover - I listened to the unabridged audiobook) supports this view, in the first sentence, which reads, \"Blink is about the first two seconds of looking -- the decisive glance that knows in an instant\". \"Blink\" makes a great book name, and the synopsis sounds intriguing, but does not accurately describe the goal of the book. In a bit of irony, considering the book's content, I feel that many readers are unsatisfied with the book because their expectations are different from what it delivers.I don't know if that is Gladwell's fault, or the Publisher's, but either way, you shouldn't let that get in the way of enjoying and learning from this book.This book is really about how we make decisions, and how focusing on a few important pieces of information is often more important than gathering as much data as possible and trying to organize it in a way that it helps us make a more informed decision. In a day and age where technology gives us instant access to more information than we've ever had at our fingertips, it is refreshing to see scientific proof that too much data can actually HARM the decision process, and result in worse decision-making. This doesn't always happen in the blink of an eye, as the book's marketing has you believe, but the concept of \"less is more\" when making decisions is consistent throughout the book, in each fascinating example.The breadth and variety of examples not only help make the book more interesting for the reader, but also helps us understand how this concept might help us view and weigh decisions differently. As a geek and technophile, I have a tendency to gather as much information as possible to weigh and analyze before making a decision. Reading this book has made me realize that all the best decisions I have made have focused on just a few important pieces of information. Though they seem simple and obvious in retrospect, this book highlights how easy it is to get lost in a forest of information. Even the very best experts and largest companies with enormous research budgets are capable of great successes or failures based on the smallest and most basic differences in decision-making.I don't know if this book makes decision-making harder or easier for me, but I think it is a more enjoyable read if you don't base your expectations on the name and synopsis. It isn't about the Warren Harding effect, thin-slicing, or weighing complex decisions in the blink of an eye, though all of these come up in the examples. It is an exploration of how a simpler approach to decisions can be more effective in many cases.",
            "Intriguing, fascinating... the list could go on. \"Blink\" sums up so perfectly what many of us feel, but can't put our finger on the \"why.\" I was hooked from the first page, but found the final chapters even better. It's well written, flows smoothly, and is put so that the average person can understand the entire process.The various examples put forth show us how the mind can be manipulated and guided by suggestions.I bought copies for friends, and will be ordering more... I can see my copy being \"loaned\" and am looking forward to sharing and discussing the book with friends.",
            "It is curious that Blink gets low marks from some Amazon reviewers. Blink is an interesting, entertaining, and engaging. Blink is a solid effort by an excellent craftsman. Mr. Gladwell tries to explain the unexplainable using example after example of real world situations and scientific study. The result is, in his words, a conversation starter. Blink is a thought-provoking look into the mystery of how we perceive the world. I liked Blink. Okay, there were some parts where I got a little bored - like the grading of mayonnaise!!!! But, from the standpoint of applying these ideas to communication, personal relationships and the marketing of products, Blink delivered even more useful stuff than The Tipping Point.Ray Dodd, author of \"The Power of Belief\" (Hampton Roads 2004)",

In the first half of the book, the author tries to categorize rapid, unconsciousness decision making as an \"instinct\" that the human mind makes on its own. The second half of the book the author wonders off into a re-interpretation of unconscious thinking as something that is a product of extensive training and experience. The preface of the book is \"The power of thinking without thinking\". With the two different interpretations of unconscious thinking, I am not sure the thesis of the book was proven. For anyone with little education into the human mind, this could be a good primer on unconscious thinking, otherwise, leave it alone.",
            "I don't normally write reviews, but this book (actually I bought it as an audio CD) could be the most fascinating piece of literature I have ever listened to. The information contained within Malcolm Gladwell's expose&eacute; is both enlightening and captivating. I purchased a few other books on mind mechanics and decided on a \"snap decision\" to include this work (last) on the list. Boy, am I glad I did.The concepts which Gladwell presents have, overnight, harnesed themselves into my own cognitive decision-making processes, happily and beneficially. I think the crux of his research really amounts to whether it is of benefit to make decisions based on a \"hunch\" (ba-da-boom-cha) [anyone who has seen Marty Feldman in Young Frankenstein might find that allusion funny,]...but back to the point....Upon purchasing this audio CD (which I unequivocally recommend as opposed to the book, as what better way to be stimulated than by listening to a terrific work such as this in the car when you would not normally be doing anything else as productive) I was finding myself tearing up upon hearing what amazingly interesting and insight-reaching information Gladwell has unearthed to draw upon for his work. I find it absolutely fascinating that, for example, Ted Williams always said he could \"follow the ball to the point where it made contact with the bat\" and upon further research, it was revealed, and then pointed out to Ted, that at the last 5 feet of a pitch, it was [italics here for emphasis, please people...] Physically Impossible to manage this given the speed for which the ball was traveling. And of course Ted's reaction was \"Well, I guess it just felt like I was following the ball all the way to the bat\". That's good stuff.I'm sorry, but gems like this, juxtaposed with Gladwell's own likable and again, the word which comes to mind is 'captivating', reading of the disourse on the CD make this work an absolute must have, a clear-cut leading addition to anyone's Summer Book Club listening list, and for that matter Winter, Spring or Fall.It is indeed rare and delightful when a tome of information such as this bridges the gap between written work to be browsed over and moved aside for the next, and, in contrast, \"Bink\", which can be absorbed, digested, and then assimilated into your own behavior patterns, and in doing so making you feel all the wiser and more knowledgable for having begun the process of recognizing and then pinpointing the cognitive processes which make up a chunk of our own mind behaviors at work, given the fact that we all must possibly \"thin slice\" numerous times throughout the course of the day without actually knowing we are doing so and that even better still, actually are utilizing a part of our awareness which operates, dare I say, subconsciously, for our own benefit if only we would give it a forum to breathe and become aware of it's time-saving and seemingly omnipitant intelligence.As a note to Mr. Gladwell, I would suggest taking the Blink discovery one step further. Let's discover what additional components, universally, present themselves as part of significant timetable events, in addition to the \"hook\" of the initial telltale information disclosure which seems to exist ubitiquously in connection with querried factual conclusions.Otherwise, what other components do completed factual events share universally, besides the thumbprint of an associated initial informatinal Blink keyhole portending the concluding outcome. We could learn more about what patterns to look for, what experience comes next after the Blink, we must journey through before arriving at our final conclusion. There must be a deeper, larger, more fundamentally encompassing mechanism operating behind this Blink story.Well worth the price of admission, I give this work 5 stars and look forward to anything more Mr. Gladwell has on his next \"to publish\" list.",
            "Blink is a fast read. The case studies show how the human brain is hardwired for certain actions and shaped by others. Anyone who enjoys psychology or the nature versus nurture discussions will get a lot from Blink. The synopsis of a police officer's thought process when shooting at a person or being shot at was revealing and riveting.",
            "It is hard to put this book down.It can be read in a single day.One of the best things to gather from this book was its reasoned discussion of the Amadou Diallo shooting and the use of the time scale on which the whole event happened as an explanation for WHY it happened.Another very strong point of the book is his use of experimental details of experiments run to explain sociological phenomenon. So, for example: A lot of people will repeat typical banalities about \"Internalizing the hatred of the oppressor\" and \"Minorities being marginalized by society\" but Gladwell actually gives the basis by which phenomenon can be measured and demonstrates the experimental techniques that can be used so to do.Also, when Gladwell talked about the experiments that were run to analyze couples he took it all the way to the conclusion by detailing how well the experiment predicted the results. (This may seem like a small point, but a lot of scientists don't respect psychologists for the very reason that their discipline does not deal with the experimental aspects very well.)Even if you are not a hardcore scientist, there are so many good things in this book that everyone will be able to find something of interest.",
            "I thought that Tipping Point was a decent book (4 stars), and I was much more interested in the subject matter of this one, but it was kinda disappointing. The individual stories he uses to illustrate his points are informative enough, I guess, but I really don't think he has any business drawing conclusions from any of it. Unfortunately he just doesn't have the expertise, he's only a writer. Stil, I did read it all the way through, and got some interesting bits out of some of the experts he quotes. I got it fom the library and am glad I didn't buy it. Gladwell has potential, but whereas Tipping Point was on par, this one is a bogey.",
            "Best-selling author Malcolm Gladwell exercises his formidable talents at storytelling and research with 'Blink,' and excellent exposition on how people make decisions.Why are some of us good decision-makers and others very poor? What are the hidden skills and 'instincts' that let some folks excel at snap judgments. What are the key bits of information that go into a correct decision and how do they differ from popular misconceptions about how people really decide?With a wealth of real-world case studies, Gladwell takes us from food tasters to the insurance industry and the military. Good prose and an eye for the captivating anecdote and key detail make Mr. Gladwell a top author.You will enjoy this book and may be unable to put it down. Go make a snap decision to buy it!",
            "The greatest weakness of this book, in my opinion, is how useless it is in daily living for non-experts.Gladwell offers numerous examples of how expert make decisions based on thin-slicing, but unlike the experts that Gladwell mentions, I have not spent 20 years analyzing behavior like some tennis expert, military expert or social psychologist. I suppose it does tell me that if I did spend those 20 years studying a field, I'd be good at making decisions.Nonetheless, it is a fun read and a quick read and it's a good place to start thinking about the psychology of decision making.The Main Point: The human unconscious tries very hard to find patterns. Sometimes these patterns result in wonderful success. Sometimes they result in miserable failure. However, if we find a good pattern, our mind can do amazing things.People criticize him for arguing with himself. They also criticize him for presenting an unbalanced presentation. In my opinion, it seems like he's arguing with himself because he's presenting both sides of the issue. He seems like he's offering an unbalanced picture because he's sensationalist with the benefits of thin-slicing and consiliatory with the weaknesses of thin-slicing.He's really more of a story teller than a theorist. Buy this if you want a series of good and interesting stories. Don't buy it expecting a good presentation of a psychological theory.",
            "Much like The Tipping Point, Gladwell does well as a cocktail guest relating interesting stories and anecdotes. Many of these are insightful and fun, but altogether, they do not serve to back up any points layed out in the beginning of the book. Worse yet, several examples/chapters contradict the points made in others. For example, he states that there is great power in 'thin slicing', and that it can serve to come to logical conclusions automatically without thinking, then demonstrates how police officers mistakenly gun down innocent people because of the same process.He says that thin slicing should be done without prejudice, like the symphony auditions conducted behind a sheet for anonymity... but his early favorite example of thin slicing is of art experts who 'instantly' knew a statue was a fake, but they only knew this in the context of a gathering to determine authenticity, so suspicion was already in the air. Then he sites a musician who is only appreciated for his 'true' genius when listened to in the right context of praise by trusted reviewers/musicians... effectively requireing prejudice.The book then dives into a study on sensation transferrence, which would imply that genuine 'thin slicing' of telling whether food, products, or people would be impossible for anyone but a person specifically trained or genetically predispositioned for the task at hand.I'm almost afraid to think what people might try to take away from the book. If you dig deep into it, he's saying that if you are trained extensively for years on some specialized thing, that your brain can automatically pick up on the few key things to classify a situation one way or another. This is not thinking without thinking... this is thinking backed by exhaustive and comprehensive training. The person who knew with 95% accuracy when a tennis player would double-fault was a tennis coach who spent his life analyzing the scenarios. The book jacket seems to imply that people can just trust their first snap judgements about anything.",
            "I found this book pretty shallow. I think the same message could have been communicated in a short essay or paragraph. 95% of the book is examples which simply dilute the basic message.",
            "This book is a fascinating treatise of how we use our intuitive mind to make snap judgements. The author takes us into situations where our mind can lead us to places we had no idea it inhabited. We get a graphic look at how unconsciously we are prejudiced and why we react the way we do to certain people, colors, tastes, animals & inanimate objects.You will see clearly how you are manipulated by the marketing industry all the way back to the original marketing concepts of \"Imperial Margarine\" & \"the Pepsi Challenge\". The material is surprsing and will help you gain insight into how marketing affects our everyday choices. You can clearly understand how marketing affects children who are exposed to hours & hours of TV ads from infancy to adulthood.You come to understand that it is possible to educate your mind (ie: hone your skills) so that you can enhance your power of snap judgements, intuitions, \"thin slicing\", face recognition etc. to react in a rational manner to situations.When I first began reading this book, I thought to myself that it would make it would make a perfect companion to Gavin de Becker's book, THE GIFT OF FEAR, & I was right because Mr. Gladwell, the author of this book, begins to quote examples from Mr. de Becker's book on page 230.The last chapter of this book lays bare the erroneous thought that we have the ability to judge based solely on what we see and hear. Rather that we are uncounsciously programmmed by subtle & not so subtle prejudices picked up from our families & the world around us. If we can educate ourselves to set these thoughts aside, we might just see how much we are missing.",
            "I bought this book all excited because various critics raved about it. I also love insights into human behavior. Was I ever disappointed? Mr Gladwell starts off well,his stories reporting seemingly unusual events are interesting and well written, his analysis highly flawed and his agenda pretty evident. I would suggest that Mr Gladwell stick to books telling amusing anecdotes , and leave the analysis of these anecdotes to psychologists because he doesn't have a clue. His conclusions on speed dating and the car salesman is stretching the truth so far that its quite amazing that a publisher would bother publishing this as anything other than fiction.",
            "I just heard Malcolm Gladwell on CNN. He actually said that as soon as he grew his hair into what was a mini-afro, which he was sporting during the interview with Anderson Cooper - he started getting speeding tickets all of a sudden, as well as being hassled at the airport on a regular basis. It was such a lie. If you ever see a picture of this man, you'll know he's lying. He ain't getting hrassed at the airport looking like that, that's for sure. So we know right off that he's a liar. Anderson Cooper laughed thinking it was a joke for a second and asked him if he was serious. Gladwell said that he was actually serious. I didn't buy it; I'm not sure about Anderson but if he didn't he wouldn't have shown it, anyway. Gladwell is an obvious fake. No need to elaborate any further.My problem with Gladwell is that he takes valid points outside the context of his arguments and then ties them to his own totally subjective conclusions. The IAD tests he mentions are a total joke. Most of the book is common sense stuff that sgould only surprise you if you're not that bright to begin with. His analysis on height biase is also just common sense extrapolated from some out of context example and then added to subjective conclucions.Most of the biase is actually from Gladwell himself, who is ONLY in favour of an analysis which shows height and race and other biases. An analysis that would explore an alternative interpretation isn't even explored by Gladwell. Why not? In the end, Gladwell succedes only in promoting paranoia by creating new target groups and unfairly exaggerating the disadvantages of others. Don't buy this book. He makes alot of money by giving naive people a lot of nothing to worry about. GLADWELL: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND A REAL THINKER IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEAR ABBY AND STEPHEN HAWKING.

Seriously someone published this guy? The book was a bunch of antidotes that didn't deserve the page space that they received. There was maybe a small nuance of a point but it was so minor that it wasn't really a point at all. This is highway robbery. I wish desperately I could get a refund.

For the latter: proof is often in consequences and conclusions, not processes.Well worth reading - if only because it challenges the supremacy of logical processes in every day decisionmaking.",

You might say \"I have a feeling that this is...\" but not be sure about where that feeling comes from. In Blink Malcolm Gladwell exposes some thinking behind this phenomenon. As with his previous book Tipping Point, Malcolm's writing is extremely readable and easy going. I `get the feeling' from reading his words that I would like him. He is smart, observant and descriptive.I give this book 9 out of 10I loved the writing and the content kept my attention through most of the book. The pace is mostly good.To get a 10 I think there could have been some deeper probing into some of the ideas, by the end of the book I got frustrated with the repetition of some of the content.",
            "This is not a book that will teach you to make better decisions in the blink of an eye. There is no magic formula in this book that will change your decision making.It will however try to show you how we all \"thin slice\" people and situations even without realizing it. The author gives many examples to support this theory. There is alot of information in this book about how the police officers thin slice people, sometimes correctly and sometimes incorrectly with horrible results. The book talks about Amadou Diallo of NY extensively and the police officers who fired 41 shots, killing Amadou Diallo.My favorite chapter in the book is the last chapter: Listening with your eyes. I think this chapter captures the essence of the book better than any other.Many of the example in this book, I think, can be explained by the fact that our experiences say alot about our decision making. The tennis pro, the sculpture artist, the police officers all make a \"gut\" decision because they have all been faced with similar situations before. There is no magic in their decision making.",

It contributes to the delicious mystery of life.",
            "Malcom Caldwell has done a good job with Blink, his latest work. Blink is a good introductory book on the growing field of behavioral scientists performing research on how little things, which appear to be meaningless, do carry a lot of power. Those things can make or break the next big deal you are working on, help you advance your career or help you have a wonderful long-lasting marriage.The book is still very unstructured and in many cases comes out as anecdotical. The truth is that Malcom had the courage to write about something in which science is only beggining to get his hands on and therefore there are not many major studies that can place of this wonderful knowledge in a structured system to be used. Despite this fact, the lessons from Blink are very relevant to your professional and personal life.If you really want to make the book experience more meaningful, look for other studies related to snap judgement. Of particular interest is the MIT's research on Micro-Inequities, or subtle-discrimination acts that often come as simple as a change in the voice tone or a gesture addressing a co-worker that is different from how you address the rest of them. It's very likely that your colleague will pick this immediately, even if you are speaking kind words to him or her.The truth is we do process tons of information every single day and the phenomenon is not easing in the information age. We will continue to process more and more info and therefore snap judgements will grow in your daily life. People are very selective in which things they pay attention to and which things they dismiss -- it has become an act of survival to the information overload. If you do really want to win the next project or you want to avoid presenting you or your company in a negative way you do need to know your customers and know which buttons trigger their snap judgement. In many cases you don't even have one hour to persuade somebody to buy your product -- it can be as short as 30 seconds on a call or a glance on an internet ad; or even in the first few minutes of the sales call in which you customer makes her mind. If you actually want to use this for marketing purposes I also recommend you to read Robert Cialdini's classic Persuasion.Blink also tells us that in some professions and under some extenuating circumstances (e.g. police work, physicians) our snap judgements are made over a very narrow set of variables. Understanding this can help us avoid those situations and actually save lives.Finally, you can also use many of the learnings from here to understand how simple, rather innocent situations can destroy valuable personal relationships, such as your marriage.Blink is a good book, entretaining read, given its storytelling. Its major flaws are that it is still unstructured and therefore its lacks contundent conclusions. Also, without reading other books on related subjects you can probably see most of the contents as unrelated anecdotical material. But don't judge it on a blink -- it helps understand other behavioral studies on how we deal with information better and that is priceless.",
            "Is it true a fake can produce intuitive revulsion in the eye of a knowing observer? A blink is a glance, fast and frugal decisionmaking.The truth of a marriage can be understood by an observer in a short time. A relationship between people has a distinctive signature.Free will is an illusion. We can be coached, primed. Gladwell speaks of thin-slicing, the process of making decisions quickly on the basis of very little information. When you start second-guessing you may be undermining yourself. Sometimes extra information just confuses the issue.Thin slicing is recognizing patterns and making snap judgments. It turns out that buying jam is a snap decision. Less choice means more sales. The face is an enormously rich source of emotion. Every blink is a series of discrete moving parts.Music auditions are thin slicing moments. The use of screens, blind auditions, has changed the composition of orchestras.The notes at the end of the book are of great interest.",

It's more like you smack your forehead and say \"why didn't I think of that?\" It's fascinating to read the articles in the archives of Gladwell's website and see the evolution of his books. I can't help but wonder at what point these disparate topics coalesce into one idea. Gladwell then melds them into an entertaining, enlightening, and cohesive narrative. Read and enjoy.",

            "This book is terrific and has opened my eyes to so many things I never even knew before about the way the mind works and the subconscious. The stories that are told are like non-other. I recommend this book to all.",
            "No, though how we make decisions is still not fully understood. This book compares decisions made in an instant, with those made in a more deliberate fashion. Since much of our thinking is done unconciously, even experts in a given field cannot fully understand how they can determine something in an instant, though they can generally tell when a gut decision is preferable to a well-thought out one. Instant decisions are improved when the number of factors to be considered can be narrowed down. There are caveats, as instant decisions are prone to grave errors due to prejudices or paralyzing fear; but training and practice can help overcome this problem.Many interesting examples are given, though they are loosely organized and there's no overall conclusion. Some of the examples given, discussing the perils of determining public taste in the arts or in foods, or decision making during a war exercise, don't really seem to prove any point at all. And the opening example, determining whather a marble statue was a forgery, seems to prove the power of both a momentary and non-momentary decision. The gut sense that it was a forgery was correct but ultimately proven only after further exhaustive testing.My take-home message is that where the stakes are high, take the time to clarify (in advance) how the decision should be made. This book would be strengthened by more examination of this point as opposed to trying to justify decisions in a blink.",
            "Oddly, my least favorite read of the Gladwell social-science trilogy has proven to be the most enlightening.It's been valuable to consciously note (though, not always act on) my initial reaction to any person or scenario upon first contact. I've begun recommending it to my people as well.Beyond the direct scope of the book, there's plenty to explore from the \"other side of the Blink\" that is - how to be aware of, and subsequently direct, others' Blinks of you.

            "Malcolm Gladwell has already proved with best-sellers such as `The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference' and `Outliers: The Story of Success' that he can write a page-turner on a popular psychological subject, and `Blink', published in 2005, is no different in this respect. His potential public is large as the subject matter could interest de facto everybody: how come that snap judgements, taken intuitively, often seem to render better results than decisions based on more-informed and very rational reflections?Gladwell is a gifted speaker and this is reflected in his writing style whereby the reader is directly addressed, questions are posed and the attention is grabbed by revealing examples: E.g. it can be disconcerting to know that an experienced observer can predict with an uncanny high probability if a marriage will last or end in a divorce and this by simply overhearing (and analysing) a short conversation between both partners; `priming experiments' show that the mere use of words associated with old age made the participants in the test walk slower...These are only two of the examples given, the book provides quite a lot of very interesting anecdotes to surprise people on boring cocktail parties.The book has undoubtedly entertainment value and Gladwell keeps the readers interested, but more seriously now, what message does he want to transmit?Gladwell illustrates that conscious decisions made on basis of a lot of information are oftentimes not better than `snap decisions' which are taken fast and unconsciously. Most people do find it hard to accept that these snap judgements, this `rapid recognition' based on mysterious, unknown rules, do have value.More problematic is that these snap judgements can be prone to error as well and this due to the fact that in certain circumstances the use of stereotypes and implicit associations does lead to wrong conclusions. People can be manipulated, first impressions (e.g. judging somebody purely on appearance) can be thwarted. People are not always aware of this. Especially in cases where people are confronted with something completely new, first impressions are not that helpful, but rather confounding. However experience can help, the intelligent user of this unconscious decision-making process is aware of all these drawbacks and can use snap judgements in a controlled, efficient way.Gladwell knows how to tell his story, however what I did not like that much is his use of a very specific `technical vocabulary' whereby he wants to make a compromise between scientific concepts and popular terminology resulting in words such as `thin-slicing', `the mystery of the locked door' and titles and subtitles tending to hyperbole (e.g. the subtitle of the book: The Power of Thinking without Thinking).Calling Gladwell `one of the world's most original thinkers' (mentioned on the cover of my paperback-edition) is of course a gross exaggeration, however `Blink' is a fascinating read on an interesting subject and it offers quite some startling examples. The most important lesson that I have drawn from this book is that intuition is something which can be helpful, can be trained (the protestant work-ethic which one can also find in other books of Gladwell, e.g. in `Outliers') and adds a valid approach to solve problems, supplementing a purely logical, conventional method. The lesson is that we are not always better off by gathering more information.What lingers on as well, by the myriad of sometimes very intriguing examples - and this probably less intended by the writer - is the observation how fascinating and manipulation-prone beings we are.",
            "If you've ever wondered why first impressions are so powerful, or how unconscious cues are perpetually influencing conscious perception, \"Blink\" is your book. \"Blink\" explores the neurological science behind snap-judgments, intuition and our brain's ability to filter and evaluate massive amounts of information in a split-second. But Gladwell expertly puts the science into layman's terms, using everyday examples to explain how we all \"think without thinking.\" I read \"Blink\" over two years ago, and still find myself regularly noticing and reflecting on the phenomena it discusses in my daily life. \"Blink\" is definitely a book you won't soon forget.",

            "I've read many self-help books. I picked up this one espcially because I have \"The Thinker\" personality and it usually takes me time to take in data and decipher information before I make a decision. I can sum up the idea of \"Blink\" in a blink:When it comes to making a decision, often times, there's something inborn in us that (your gut) that can make the \"right\" decision for you in three seconds. So follow your gut! On the other hand, our guts are prejudice at times, and they can lead us to make the wrong decision. So be aware of prejudices you have before going with your gut.The book is filled with examples wherein people made wrong judgements in a blink, such as the electing of Warren Harding as US President, New Coke and Amadou Diallo. Although the books tells you that the right decision can easily come by you, it is short on HOW people can make the right decisions in a blink - and that's what's most disappointing of all.",
            "This book is weighed down with anecdotes, and never delivers on it's central promise of showing you how to train yourself to make good snap decisions.It's still a worthwhile read (particularly if you just skim most of it). The central premise is that our subconscious can make accurate judgments on a variety of subjects in a matter of a second or so. He tells some interesting stories about when you should, and should not, trust these snap judgments, and the nature of some of our biases.Overall a good book, but it could have covered the subject matter as well in a third of the length.",
            "This book is enjoyable, like all of Malcolm Gadwell's writing, but some organizational problems torpedo the main message. It's NOT to trust your instincts; in fact it's almost the reverse. It's that a few key data points can help you make a decision, provided that you have identified those data points through good research or you have enough experience to know what they are. And often the data points that really matter are not obvious. For example the coke/pepsi chapter shows that first-glance instincts tell a non-expert that Pepsi is better than Coke, because a non-expert doesn't understand that in the long run, sweetness will reduce enjoyability. The art experts are able to identify a fake on instinct only because they have a huge set of experience that gave them the ability to figure out what information actually matters, not because instincts matter more than logical analysis.The problem is that this point (find out what data points ACTUALLY matter and then you can make quick, good decisions) is not explicitly stated. I blame a lack of good editing, or sloppiness in a rush to publication, or a desire to being the book with a catchy story even though it misleads. It would have been much better to launch and frame the story around the heart attack data---experts thought that age, gender, smoking, etc. matter most in detecting a real heart attack when they didn't.",
            "Blink is a fine work by the highly engaging author, Malcolm Gladwell. The premise of the book is, might it be that we make better decisions in the first few seconds rather than after hours or days of thinking about it? Well, it depends, but Gladwell presents convincing evidence why many decisions can likely be made nearly instantly. His writing is always captivating and his examples are convincing to many. This is a good book to read so long as you step back and consider alternatives and that more thorough studies are needed to validate his claims. A light read.",
            "I enjoyed Blink quite a bit, but it could have been a little shorter. You pretty much get the point by the 150th page or so.So what is the point of the book? Well, basically it's about what our subconscious is able to process in the blink of an eye. Our subconscious is working constantly to pick up all kinds of signals from the world around us/people around us, and our conscious doesn't know that a lot of this is actually happening. The conscious can also complicate the signals that your subconscious is picking up-maybe that's why people always say go with your first guess on a multiple choice test??Gladwell uses a lot of social examples and clinical studies to back himself up. For example, there is this psychologist who has been studying marital relationships for years. He can tell in a single session whether or not a couple will stay together by reading their faces, inflections, and body language to see what's going on under the surface of their conversation.Psychology is so fascinating because it seems like whenever you learn new things about it, you already kind of knew them! I don't know if that makes sense, but psych sort of opens your eyes to things that you would probably otherwise ignore. I'd suggest reading the book if you haven't already.",
            "Having read Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point a few years back, I decided to read his followup Blink. The main premise behind Blink is that sometimes we don't need all the information in the world to make a correct, quick and informed decision. Our brain processes enough of the information it needs to make a snap decision which most of the time turns out to be a better idea then weighing out too much data. The old adage of \"go with your gut\" seems to be proven by much of Gladwell's writing and reporting on other studies completed.This does not always prove to be the case, however. The \"Pepsi Challenge\" from the 1980s is a good example of this. Whereas people might prefer the taste of Pepsi in a 2 oz cup in a blind taste test, it doesn't mean they will drop Coke altogether and switch to Pepsi. The New Coke disaster of the 80s is an a testament to this.Whereas Gladwell gives us both sides of the coin about whether to trust your gut or weigh out all available information before making a decision, he is inconclusive about which is better. There is no real right or wrong answer, which is disappointing. Nor anywhere in the book is it determined that there is a set of guidelines one should follow to say whether a first impression is the right impression. The Tipping Point gave us closure and a conclusion. Blink gives us ideas and beautifully presented studies which leaves us wanting more. This lake of a final answer takes the book down a peg in this reviewer's humble opinion.Blink is interesting and definitely worth a read. Unfortunately it's not perfect.4/5 stars.",
            "Classical music was once almost exclusively the preserve of white men. It was believed that women could simply not play as well as men, for they did not have the strength, attitude or resilience for many pieces of music. Over the past few decades, though, classical music has undergone a transformation. Musicians, rather than facing auditions held in the dressing room of a conductor, now audition in front of selection committees. Perhaps the greatest change, though, is that they now audition from behind a screen. Since these screens went up, thirty years ago now, a strange thing has happened: the number of women in the most celebrated American orchestras has increased fivefold. The world of classical music came to realize \"that what they had thought was a pure and powerful first impression--listening to someone play--was in fact hopelessly corrupted. 'Some people look like they sound better than they actually sound, because they look confident and have good posture...other people look awful when they play but sound great.\" The fact is that the first impression of seeing a person, even if for only a brief moment, colors how the mind enjoys and understands the music another person makes. A man only sounds better than a woman of equivalent talent when a person has first seen that the person playing is male. All of this is not to say that the world of classical music was terribly corrupt and chauvinistic. A woman playing the french horn really did sound worse than a man playing the same instrument. This was only true, though, because of the mind of the listener. Seeing a woman settling in to place to play a piece on the french horn would so color his perception that his mind would register an inferior performance.This brief example shows the power of the first impression. Blink is a book dedicated to that first impression--the first two seconds of looking at someone or something. Gladwell argues, quite convincingly, that we need to have greater confidence in our first instincts. Our society tells us that the best decision is one that is labored over. When faced with a medical condition, a doctor will order test after test after test. A patient will consult another physician and seek a second opinion. Only when we have gathered an immense amount of data do we feel confident in moving forward. Yet so often it was our instincts, those first two seconds, that were correct all along. \"The first task of Blink is to convince you of a simple fact: decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.\"But this \"blink,\" this first two seconds can also be deceptive, so Gladwell devotes some effort to understanding those moments when instincts betray us. The infamous New Coke provides just such an example. Dismayed to see that participants in blind taste tests were consistently choosing Pepsi over Coke, Coke executives decided to retire their product in favor of a new version that tasted much more like Pepsi. We all know how well it worked. Coke drinkers rebelled and immediately demanded the return of the former product. It was quickly reintroduced as Coca-Cola Classic. Where did Coke go wrong? They based too much on the \"blink.\" While Pepsi continues to be rated as tasting better in a single sip, this is not how people drink a can of soda--people drink it a can, glass or bottle at a time. Some find that Pepsi's sweeter taste becomes nauseating with a larger quantity. Some people simply prefer Coke because they have always enjoyed it. The fact that Pepsi may taste slightly better does not mean they will switch drinks. Coke was led astray by the blink.What Gladwell seeks to show is that those who have succeeded at becoming great decision makers are those who have mastered the art of \"thin-slicing.\" These people seek out and filter a very small number of important factors, ignoring a large quantity of other seemingly-important variables. He provides examples of firefighters and soldiers, doctors and marriage therapists, all of whom have found ways of cutting through the clutter and extracting only the most important information. This leaves us with a psychologist who can predict with great accuracy, based upon only a few minutes of observation, whether or not a marriage will last. It leaves us with a tennis coach who can predict almost perfectly whether a player will double-fault before the ball has even made contact with the racket.This decision-making ability is not necessarily inherent in a person. Thin-slicing, Gladwell tells us, can be educated and controlled. A person who is intimately acquainted with his particular area of expertise, whether it be commanding a squad of soldiers or selecting members of an orchestra, will be more able to make successful split-second decisions.While Blink is absolutely fascinating, the area where I would suggest Gladwell does not do so well is in forming a unified theory. He gathers a large amount of fascinating information and puts all of this within the two covers of a single book, but the reader may be left wondering how it all fits together. At times Gladwell presses forward with little proof. Too often he relies on a single study to create a theory that is wide-ranging in its scope and meaning. At one point he discusses an autistic man and from that theorizes that even people without mental handicaps can suffer temporary autism during moments of high stress. Yet this is not premised on hard evidence. So perhaps Gladwell stretches himself a little thin at times. Perhaps he attempts to take his theories just a little too far, venturing from what is factual into what is merely possible. The Tipping Point, Gladwell's previous book, was, in my view, more complete and reached a more satisfying, holistic conclusion.Despite this criticism, this is a very interesting book and one that, despite the complexity of the topic, is quite easy to read and understand.",
            "Well my first impression of this book was a little mixed, sometimes during the course of reading it, it was difficult to assimilate where the author was going or trying to go.Then there is the fact which this book discusses a lot of is, that generally elusive 6th sense which it tries to bring out with examples of how some people know about something in advance and basically benefit from it.In my Opinion it is okay for a one time read.",
            "What happens when you meet someone for the first time, or walk into a house you are thinking about buying, or read the first few sentences of a book? You mind is taking about two seconds to jump to a series of conclusions. And according to author Malcolm Gladwell, those instant conclusions we reach are really powerful and really important, and occasionally -- really good.Blink looks at rapid cognition, about what happens in the blink of an eye. According to Gladwell, what happens is perfectly rational.He states: \"It's thinking - its just thinking that moves a little faster and operates a little more mysteriously than the kind of deliberate, conscious decision making that we usually associate with \"thinking.'\"Gladwell analyses what is going on in our heads when we engage in rapid cognition. For example, when are snap judgments good and when are they not? What kinds of things can we do to make our powers of rapid cognition better?Gladwell compares rapid decision-making with the way most of us have been taught to make decisions as children. Often we were taught to gather as much information as possible before making a decision. Gladwell states that sometimes this process is useful, others times it is not.He gives a poignant example of this from the Emergency Room at Cook County Hospital in Chicago. A few years ago, Emergency Room doctors changed the way they diagnosed heart attacks. They were instructed to gather \"less\" information on their patients. They concentrated on just a few symptoms: chest pain, blood pressure and the ECG - while ignoring everything else, including age and weight and medical history. The results were shocking. Cook County Hospital is now one of the best places in the United States at diagnosing chest pain.Caldwell examines numerous fascinating stories like Cook County Hospital where the idea of gathering more information is not always the best way to make a decision. Some examples include: marriage, World War II code-breaking, ancient Greek sculpture, New Jersey's best car dealer, speed-dating, medical malpractice, how to hit a top-spin forehand, and what you can learn from someone by looking around their bedroom.Blink contains a lot of psychology that has not been written before for the general audience, but at the same time is a fascinating and enjoyable read.",
            "Heard an interview with Malcolm Gladwell, the author of BLINK, on NPR earlier this year. It was just after I had to make a critical spot decision in seconds... then wondered for hours whether it had been the right thing to do. As it turned out weeks later, it was the correct decision to make, and in those weeks I had taken the opportunity to read this book, an impromptu personal gift from someone very close.Had I read the book before, I would have felt more confident in my ability to make an intuitive snap decision that was right.We all have to make quick decisions in our daily lives, some mundane and some critical. We make quick decision as simple as to what we will eat for lunch. We may also have to make fast critical decisions, such as how to avoid an impending car accident: do we brake, swerve or accelerate. And it's just this \"rapid cognition\" that Gladwell writes about so well that can make the difference.One could easily assume that BLINK is about dealing with intuition, as a colleague of mine thought when I described the book. That's not what it's about, because intuition is more of a concept used to describe our \"gut feelings,\" our emotional reactions that aren't always very rational. BLINK deals with those rational first two second that are our rapid cognition.Gladwell points out that contrary to the way were raised from childhood, there are times of stress and high pressure when fast judgment calls and first impressions are a better choice than slow, deliberate thinking for making sense of the world around us.His examples are superb: code breaking during World War II, speed dating, marriage, medical malpractice (insightful - do read it twice). He even covers things as unusual as what you can discover about a person by being aware of what you see when looking around their bedroom, and interesting views about the best car dealer in New Jersey. You'll just have to read the book to understand where rapid cognition fits in.There is an entire chapter dealing with the power of \"thin slicing\" that deals with what some psychologists have recognized is our ability to make good judgement calls based on the \"thinnest slice of experience.\" The author delves into this subject quite well, and the examples that he offers are amazing.But can rapid cognition go wrong? It it always the right way to approach things? Just read about what Gladwell calls the \"Warren Harding Error\" for the answer. He makes a compelling case for the fact that we can and will make \"Warren Harding Errors\" in so many types of circumstances, especially when it comes to hiring personnel. His suggestions here will help one recognize the differences between good rapid cognition and bad rapid cognition. Split-second decisions can often be either more accurate than many months of project management or scientific planning, or they can become tragic disasters. In this book the author shows that you can educate and exercise your rapid cognition to avoid hazardous traps.We all recognize the importance of what happens in dating relationships at that instance when two people first meet. But it seems difficult to face the significance of what happens in the critical first seconds when we interview someone for a job, someone offers a new idea, or when a police officer has to make a critical quick decision at the moment a crime is being committed. Gladwell makes a compelling case to make us take rapid cognition as a part of our critical thinking process.BLINK deals with those small situations we all face in our daily lives, with assumptions that show up when we meet new people, make important personal and business decisions under stress, or when we are forced to meet complex situations head-on.This is one of those books that comes along and changes the way that you see the world around us. It's a fairly fast read, neither too light nor too heavy, and if you're anything like this reader, you'll want to read it a second time just to get a bit more out of it.Highly recommended, a keeper and easily worth a five-star rating. And now I have to get and read Gladwell's previous book, THE TIPPING POINT.Please also see my review of FREAKONOMICS, by Steven Levitt. Another reader emailed me, noting that Gladwell had said that Steven Levitt \"has the most interesting mind in America.\" I agree.",
            "I have to say that I believe Malcolm Gladwell has really done something here. I think BLINK is a great follow up (and better read) to The Tipping Point, and I didn't think he could outdo himself as I loved that book as well.BLINK gives so many great examples into unconscious decision making. I think it is extremely insightful as to why certain things happen the way they do. His fantastic examples of Doctor Patient lawsuit as it relates to the level of rapport has massive practicality to helping Medical Schools prepare doctors to be people-centered first rather than the somewhat obtuse and cold approach many doctors take today. When rapport is built, patients feel more comfortable to share \"real\" symptoms, real fears and doctors can anticipate their required course of care better when they are relating to the patient as a person, not a patient and his/her illness.The book is packed full of useful content that will have you thinking which I believe all books should make you do. I would recommend this book without a doubt!",
            "We live in a fastbreak society, and the ability to make quick judgements is critical. Gladwell lays out the case for discernment, courage, and action. Quick-thinking is increasingly a matter of survival and Gladwell gives the readers tools to speed up that decision-making process and to improve the accuracy of those decisions.Far from calling influencers to be shallow, he challenges the reader to become better informed and equipped so that when moments of crisis arise, a minimum of time is spent on hand-wringing, navel gazing, and palaver.It's a well done book that will have particular application to people in positions of leadership and influence, whatever the field. Lots of broad, practical applications here....",
            "I would recommend one borrow not purchase this book, and after the half-way point return it. I found the first half extremely interesting and captivating. The remainder loses the reader in a case with racial overtones and fails to establish a logical relationship with the first half. I read a comment by another that seemed apropos: describe a new method of building an office building by explaining briefly a new building method and what the building might look like when finished. And, then talk about some of the surrounding pavement, you'd have \"Blink,\" well--in a blink.",
            "In the small arena of unconscious thought, Gladwell explores two main areas that on first glance contradict each other. First he argues that our instinctual impressions can be trained to give us insight beyond what our intellect allows. Next he points out that those same instinctual impressions can easily lead us astray and exacerbate our prejudices and emotional biases. So which is it?Both--although the balance between the two approaches is mostly ignored. Gladwell lays out the principles of _Blink_ on pages 14-15: Snap judgments can be as good as deliberate decisions; you can learn when to listen to them and when to ignore them; and you can educate and control them for when you do listen. The first and third of the principles are explored in great depth, but the second doesn't get any attention. That's a shame, because all his examples hint at the possibility of codifying which decisions should be \"blinked\" and which should be thought out traditionally.The one main conclusion Gladwell draws is that if you do \"blink\" a decision, you'd better have experience. The stories consistently show that if you have practice making snap judgments, you make them better. You can learn traits of a field to improve just in that area (reading facial expressions is one such example), but nothing substitutes for experience. So build your own or hire someone who has it, and then you can \"blink\" well, your products can \"blink\" well, and you'll know to keep your eyes open when you're not \"blinking\".",
            "I just began reading this book.And with having past knowledge of decision making, I understand what this book will already be about.But to say that you expected a manual on how to refine your snap judgements; Maybe you should read the book twice. I understand it isnt a manual to do what you wanted it to do, but within the first two chapters i see hints on how to refine your snap judgements.For instance the example about the deck of cards, the subjects being tested got the idea of how it works after a while. Thus experience in a certain field can make you have better judgements.I was once told an example of a manager(i believe) and how he always forecasted the number of sales for a certain product, almost perfectly, without doing specific calculations. Granted it took him some time of pacing back and forth in a room mumbling to himself. But his intuitive thinking led him to make a decision that didnt take him hours of numbers, to figure out. It was all in his brain, juat as Gladwell described; \"and some part of their brain did a series of instant calculations...\"but when he moved into a marketing setting, his snap judgements didnt work. (assuming because of his lack of experience there)I believe in order to start making snap judgements, you must prepare yourself for \"lateral thinking\" and other methods of smart decision making. Just as the example of the statue. They had experts view this statue, and they thought it was real. But the thing they overlooked is, their bias. That they \"wanted\" it to be real.Im off to continue reading this book, but just as The Tipping Point, theres small details you might miss that are hidden beneath the surface of the words, that can help you/train you help you find the \"maven\".i hope this helped.",
            "I found this a rather typical self-help book, but Gladwell's insights into thinking and how we do it, why we make the decisions that we do, and how to \"look both ways first\" are still interesting. Worth a look, but don't expect to learn something truly earthshaking and groundbreaking.",
            "BLINK is entertaining, illuminating and at times humorous. In a highly readable account, Gladwell gives a clear description of implicit cognition and explains the most up-to-date theories of neuroscience and psychology through a series of fun and accessible stories. The examples, drawn from a wide range of situations and fields of human endeavor, illustrate the complex thinking processes that support \"snap judgments.\" With case after case, Gladwell demonstrates how the depth of knowledge and expertise developed over years of observation informs the mind to \"thin slice\" - make quick decisions at the blink of the eye that seem instantaneous but are actually based on years of experience. Thought-provoking, entertaining and worth a read. I also recommend Understanding: Train of Thought.",
            "Ironically, my first instinct seeing this book was that it would probably be a collection of subjectitvely picked research to back some unconvincing hypothesis of overstated importance. Well of course part of that was true, after all Gladwell is a journalist and not a scientist. However, in general, he does a great job in describing the research and its relevance to our everday lives.Blink focuses on 2 seperate but related concepts. The first is that of \"time slicing\", which demonstrates how important information can be encoded in a very short period of time. Most of Gladwell's examples are socioloical, and the most striking of which was research which aimed to predict whether married couples would get divorced after analyzing a single conversation with them.The other concept is how the brain acts subconsciously to certain stimulus. Gladwell's proposal is that if we can recognize this power of the brain we'd make the world a much better place and all sorts of other grand things. So, although not perfect, this is a good and interesting book.",
            "This is an ideal book for the beach or an airplane ride. It reads quickly and covers an eclectically wide range of topics: a case of art forgery, the presidency of Warren G Harding, the world of food tasting, an online test for unconscious prejudices, the marketing of New Coke, the Aeron chair, the nature of autism, gender discrimination among classical musicians, the Battle of Chancellorsville and the complete categorization of facial expressions just to name a few that immediately come to mind.As to the supposed main topic there is not a whole lot to say. Gladwell starts with a case of art forgery and tells how experts could intuitively recognize it. You may suspect from this that the book would concentrate on the power of intuition. However, to the extent that the topic comes up, he dwells mainly on the negative aspects - how we can be led astray by unconscious prejudices and superficial impressions.",
            "I enjoy Gladwell's perspective and he does a good job of correlating the research to his observations. A good read but the book needs a little more depth.",
            "The author declares \"introspection destroys your ability to solve insight problems.\" He then builds a case for acknowledging the subtle influences that can bias our impressions or instinctive reactions and suggests that with insight we can train ourselves to shift our reactions (the results of our rapid decision making). Introspection or lack of it can both work toward positive goals in our own maturity and training. But then he contradicts his theory by showing how we make good decisions - and bad decisions - by relying on intuition. Oops - different kinds of intuition. One is well-trained and the other not. OK. So we can re-train our intuition with new input.The book is written more like a series of interesting and informative stories roughly related to a theme than a book on a topic. And there are some inconsistencies. Just be alert. The author wanders through various subjects that have some relationship to the theme. It's a pleasant journey, but I wasn't surprised to read at the end that he writes for a magazine. In retrospect the book reads more like a collection of themed articles than a cohesive whole.Still, it gave me a more concrete appreciation for the intuitive sense I've developed after years in my profession and more confidence to rely on it. It's also given me a bit more critical and sympathetic eye for evaluating the actions of others after the fact. Every juror should read about split second judgments and instinctive reactions that allow us to make instant decisions under pressure. You'll never look at police shootings or hospital emergency room mistakes in quite the same way.It gets bogged down in places. But don't let that or the flaws keep you from taking away some gems from this book.",
            "Gladwell did surprise us with a lot of hard facts about how certain people possess the ability to \"do the things right\" without even thinking. An interesting read, but unfortunately lacks of a central belief in his book. After reading, you just have this difficulty to conclude the lesson learned here!It reminds me of another book, \"From Lowbrow to Nobrow\" (Peter Swirski, 2006) which is with an enjoyable writing style and a strong point to support the writer's keen observations and insights to fulfill your apetitie of learning. It clearly depicts the unique phenomenon of the popular culture of today. I personally highly recommend you to take a look at this book as it is a book of thinking power!",
            "Mr. Gladwell's work is a similar to data that was introduced in \"Emotional Intellegence\" by Daniel Goleman and \"Wisdom of Crowds\" by James Surowiecki. Both books brought forward much of the data that is presented in this book.However Mr. Gladwell really makes you think about the power of snap judgments. It is a difficult subject. We are really good at somethings and really bad at other. The book \"Mean Genes\" was very good at looking at where we fall short on our snap judgments. They noted that in areas like number greater than a few dozen we get into trouble. We really can't understand that our chance at winning a lottery are virtually zero, etc. I wish Mr. Gladwell had added these areas.Overall I like the book. It made me think. It gave me idea, and that is why I read.",
            "Blink exposes the power of subconscious mind in make instanteous decisions. If \"Tipping Point\" explains forces causing trends than \"Wisdom of the Crowds\" explains how a group of independantly minded people can accurately make a prediction; so one should consider \"Blink\" an micro economic explanation of how an individual can instanteous and accurate decision.Student evaluations. A group of students were asked to make an evaluation of a group teachers, after being shown a 30 second clip; next, the clips were shorted to 10 seconds; and finally, too 2 seconds. The results were roughly the same suggesting the immediate and direct impulse remain consistent despite duration and amount of information. Interestingly, the same students were asked to evaluate the teachers after taking the course and the results were similar to the 2 second clip evaluations.Predicting divorce. A system of evaluation was devised to measure positive gestures against negative gestures using a numeric ranking system: defensiveness, inflexibility, hostileness, and anger. The researcher analyzed short segments of interaction and rate it then compiled the results into a mathematical graph. A trend line was next established. The trend line suggests that once a pattern line converged downward, the results predictable were divorce, 94% of the time. A micro glance immediately suggested divorce or long term relationship potential.Economics. A system of cards was devised where red cards caused loss and blue cards caused profit. Participants discovered the profit loss pattern usually within 50 to 80 cards. After connecting a machine to measure stress, participates stress measures suggests they knew within 10 cards, the profit loss pattern.Expert reaction. A forge statutue was immediately recognized as flawed even though scientific instrumentation suggested the statute was dated at 550 B.C. The expert response were immediately negative about the authentic celebration of possessing a rare prize. The impulse reaction was immediately vocalized as negative. The musuem eventual discovered the marble sculpture was a fake. The impulse reaction was right.Rationale. Blink claims the individual is perfectly rationale and this rationale is not necessarily a laborous and tendous process. The decision can be summoned by the collective experience, emotions, and feelings of the person making the decision.",
            "This book is interesting although it is short and sometimes difficult to grasp entirely. I am still skeptical as to the accuracy of the statistics in this book. It seems that Gladwell is arguing (for the first half of the book) that answers jump out at you and that it is usually the correct answer. Then he says that the answers that come to us so quickly are influenced by our prejudices. Did anybody not already notice this about themselves and/or others? Although most of us already grasp the basic message of the book, I would still recommend reading it. It's able to put things together to make this penomenon easier to understand. Just don't plan on spending over 2 or 3 hours reading it.",
            "Over 500 people have reviewed Blink, and still counting. The one thing most folks agree on is that Gladwell can write. His stories are engaging and blink reads fast.But when it comes to rating the book, people are pretty polarized. They tend to either love it or see it as a waste of time. Why? Those who love it think Gladwell's discussion of snap decisions in such areas as speed dating, consumer marketing, police work, and hospital admissions, is insightful and fascinating. His narrative weaves cool research with real examples and makes both come alive. On the other hand, Gladwell's critics get annoyed that he bounces around, draws questionable conclusions, and doesn't connect the dots very well.Both arguments have merit. Here's why. Early on in Blink, Gladwell promises to convince us of three things: (1) that quick decisions can sometimes be better than deliberate ones, (2) that there are times to trust our intuitions and times to question them, and (3) that snap judgments can be \"educated and controlled.\" He does fine with the first two but doesn't really deliver on the third. If anything, his examples seem to show just how difficult such education and control can be. All of the experts he profiles have spent years improving their snap successes in areas that are often very narrow in scope. For these and other reasons, Gladwell is least convincing when drawing conclusions and making generalizations about snap judgments.So liking or disliking the book seems to depend largely on reactions to how Gladwell handles the third promise. If you care deeply about understanding #3 or expect Gladwell to neatly tie up all the ideas in Blink, you will almost surely be disappointed. But if you're the kind of person who is interested in how people make decisions and likes to speculate, this book will probably get your juices flowing. I liked it. You decide.",
            "I bought this book for my nephew. He works as an actuary and I thought he would enjoy it.",
            "I found the proposition interesting and was not disappointed. The mix of explaination and examples was a nice way to illustrate the ideas.",
            "This is a really important book. In fact, I found it more valuable than The Tipping Point, which I thoroughly enjoyed reading. There are numerous powerful insights, but the key insight for me--Look for the essential thing and do not let additional information about a subject cloud your vision. I did not understand how distracting too much information can be. I recommend the book and the insight in all my leadership seminars.",
            "The book is an incredibly enlightening piece of work providing insight into the human brain. Worth the read and probably worth reading more than once.",
            "His second book is no less riviting than his first (The Tipping Point), in Blink, the author looks closely at why and how we do better with first impressions sometimes than labored thought.",
            "The author makes the following points: 1) sometimes you can make a correct decision very quickly; 2) sometimes a very quick decision is wrong. In his book he states that he has taken a whole year to write this slender volume. This book is the scientific equivalent of a trashy airport novel - it passes the time and then you forget it. It would be a very good buy if you don't read novels and are taking a trip - a short trip.",
            "This book offers a lot of intresting ideas. It really makes you think, and will help you decide things much more efficentily. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to improve their decision making skills, or just wants to learn about the thought process.",
            "Great look at how a person's entire existence and experience can impact the snap judgments they make when faced with a decision, the book also does a nice job of giving encouraging a person to trust your instincts - unless of coarse you have very little background in the decision you are about to make. Fun read similar to Gladwell's other book tipping point.",
            "This is an excellent book. It really makes you think about snap decision making, how we all do it, how some people are more adept at it, and how to become better at it. It's a really enjoyable read.",
            "You ask yourself, \"What could be so interesting about 'The Power of Thinking Without Thinking'?... What does that even mean?\" I didn't know how to approach this book, except with anticipating curiousity. I actually bought this and avoided reading it until I could take in Gladwell's earlier success \"The Tipping Point\". After loving that, I knew it was time to address the secret workings of split-second decision making and human perception. The book sounds ambiguous, inaccessible, and odd... it is not. It - like only a handful of books I have read over the years - truly reshapes your focus of the world. I can't do justice to describe the capability of Gladwell's analysis... but from one average reader to the next, put this book at the top of your wishlist and get to it shortly. (Then I'd move on to the Tipping Point)",

            "According to Gladwell, we think without thinking by using limited information to come to our conclusion. This is an approach we use in the time of information overload, probably do reduce the intelectual stress of the overload.Rapid cognition is a different name for hunch or intuition and several of the examples Gladwell discusses are interesting: the discovery of a Greek statue that fooled one group of art experts, but was later shown to be a fake by another group. Based on this example, the book analyzes alternative uses of thinslicing and gives a wide range of example from speed dating, tennis, war games, malpractice suits, popular music, and predicting divorce. The stories are interesting and Gladwell expertly weaves these examples with accounts of scientific studies. He points out an important fact: science partially, but seldom full, explains the largely unconscious phenomenon that we have all experienced at one time or another in our lives.I agree with many reviewers that thinslicing reflects our experiences, training, knowledge and prejudices.This book is probably one of the more thoughtprovoking books that I have read. He writes well and the text is engaging. Recommended.",
            "tipping point was a much better book in my opinion. i enjoyed the diversity of the examples in the tipping point. blink caught my attention faster but towards the end, the ideas and examples began to get repetitive. Not a bad read though!",
            "Most of us have experienced a split second of \"knowingness\" when confronted by a particular individual or circumstance - the heart pounds faster, the hands become clammy; \"something\" tells us to steer clear of this person or situation, only to discover later that our instincts were absolutely right. I cannot count the numerous occasions this has occurred over the years. This instinct we all possess is hard wired in our brains, fined tuned over millions of years of evolution. Of course this is nothing new. We have always been told to \"trust\" this inner voice, to run with it, that it is, more often than not, the right call. However, this is not always the case. As Gladwell points out in \"Blink\", our unconscious minds can be influenced by implicit cultural conditions, and this \"instinct\" can be terribly wrong, leading in some extreme cases, to total disaster.Gladwell's message is that these implicit feelings, these instinctive signs, is one of the more powerful skills we posses. He suggests that our so-called \"snap-judgement\" based on \"thin slicing\", that is computing minimal but important observations from the environment, can be fined tuned. Unfortunately, he does not explain exactly how this \"fine-tuning\" can be effectively done. If we are all simply products of our environment, conditioned from an early age to believe and see the world in a certain way, how is it possible to \"un-learn\" the false data we've accumulated over a lifetime, to ensure our \"snap-judgements\" are the right ones?As Gladwell does in his best selling book, The Tipping Point, he supplies the reader with a plethora of examples and tests to substantiate his arguments. The most interesting example was the gentleman who could \"read minds\" solely based on interpreting facial expressions. In the studies of Paul Ekman and Wallace Freisen, they focus on the literally thousands of facial expressions we learn from infancy, and how a vast majority of our expressions are involuntary, revealing our true and innermost thoughts. Gladwell suggests that all of us, at least unconsciously, can read these expressions, which aid us in interpreting and contextualizing our environment.\"Blink\" is an interesting discussion on our instincts, proposing that operating on less information and following our \"guts\" is usually the wiser path. Gladwell's conclusion, however, is an age-old one, and that is attaining a balance between body, mind and spirit. The ancient Greeks gave this same advice over three thousand years ago. It is good advice, but similar to anything apparently simple, it is easier said than done.",
            "Gladwell said all he needed to say in the first 10 pages. Need I say more?",
            "Alright, I did start it, but I could not finish it. It was that boring. Don't make a snap judgment though, you should read it for yourself and realize that anyone without a brain can get published these days. A former boss who liked to drink and employ the services of hookers gave our team this as a Christmas gift which were some of the many Blink judgments he made.",
            "For a book that has received so much acclaim, I'm surprised by the number of logic holes in Malcolm Gladwell's arguments. He is also very verbose and talks about many random things that are unrelated to the topic of the book. The arguments look like obvious attempts to make money by deceiving the general public. By far, one of the poorest books I've read in a long time.",

            "I really enjoyed reading the book \"Blink\" by Malcolm Gladwell. It is an easy read yet very profound. I said to myself \"wow! How many times have I known in an instant that I was right about something but because it was inconvenient at the time to acknowledge it, I disregarded what I knew\". In the end my initial hunch was correct!I really enjoyed the chapter \"Seven Seconds in the Bronx: The Delicate Art of Mind reading\". It was about the NYPD's encounter with Amadou Diallo but it really hit home the concept of \"the judgments we make and the impressions we form of other people\". In the case of Amadou Diallo the policemen's \"mind reading\" was way off base. Many times people rely on past experiences to dictate how they should act NOW and ignore theinformation right in front of them. Simply put, they were not present.A book I really enjoyed about being present is Ariel & Shya Kanes, How To Create a Magical Relationship. One powerful chapter in the book was \"You are not the story of your life\". It reminded me of all the times that my expectations of how something should turn out caused it to turn out exactly as I had expected, as if it were a self-fulfilling prophecy. I realized it was my unconscious expectations that determined the outcome of something, rather than seeing what was truly in front of me and making the appropriate choices. I highly recommend both of these books.",
            "While it's not the same idea as The Tipping Point, it's a similarly interesting one, and leave it to Gladwell to pull together the most wide-ranging variety of examples to make his points come to life.Whether it's art fraud, the Coke/Pepsi taste test or a $250 million war game exercise where a rogue Arab state (played by a retired general) sank our Persian Gulf fleet using fishing boats and Cessnas, it makes for some damn fine reading.Of particular fascination was the opening segment about how researchers were able to observe couples interacting and based on watching just minutes of footage could tell you with amazing accuracy whether they would still be together seven years from now.It's an excellent book that takes aim at overly-cautious, committeed-to-death, CYA decision making. It's not advocating snap judgements (not the same thing)... you'll see if you read it.Definitely a pass-around book once you've finished it, as The Tipping Point was. Not too long, quick read... a few slower passages here and there but all in all it breezes by.",
            "I am reading blink for the 2nd time now due to the enjoyment I had when I first read it. It is a very animated and easy to read book that basically highlights several examples of our adaptive unconscious mind and how it works and comes up with decisions. He also dwells on the concept of thin slicing which is the predicting patterns and behaviors/trends by zooming in on the slices of experiences that matter the most and coming up with a rather unsconscious decision from it.. I really love the book and highly recommend it. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because it merely highlights how the process works but does not provide means and ways of improving our skills of the adaptive unsconciscous.. however the author points out to other works by authors like Paul Ekman and John Gotman and others that provide the next step...",

            "I'd seen Mr. Gladwell's interviews on television about his book several months ago. So when I saw the title sitting on the shelf at the library my thinslicer nearly snapped my elbow in two to take it home.This is literally the most interesting book that I've read in years. Mr. Gladwell doesn't try to convince you that your brain is too sophisticated to ever be doubted. He doesn't try to tell you that it's so fallible that you ought to run a mathmatical diagram to back yourself up, either. He gives you a look at the different ways that the \"snap judgements\" work for us and against us.I had an instance several years ago, after my sister in law had died in a car accident, that made perfect sense after reading this book. I'd halfway thought I'd had some sort of \"psychic\" interlude or a \"God had touched my heart\" thing, which I'm in no way inclined towards. My brothers wife had died about 6 months before this. He and I were in our respective vehicles. I was driving towards him on the road that we live on. A two lane road that we passed each other on many times. As I passed him, keep in mind this was at 35-40 mph, there was something about the position of his head that it immeditately went through my mind that something was very wrong. I didn't get a look at his face. I was driving and just took a glance after recognizing his truck. I turned around in a parking lot and followed him home. He was so overwhelmed by grief that day that he was honestly a hairs breadth from a complete emotional nervous breakdown. This man is one of the strongest, most resilient man I know, but his wife's death was about to send him over the edge. I spent the rest of the afternoon with him. Letting him talk, and listening to him tell me about her. By the end of the day he had come down off of that terrible place and he's moved on in life.This book made me finally realize what that split second glance had been for me. Not that I'm an expert on my brother. Not that if I were to see that exact same situation in a rank stranger that I'd have the same reaction... just that my mind took the scene and broke it down and put it back together in a frame of time that is absolutely infinitesimal, and gave it back to me in a quick \"hunch\" to tell me that something was wrong with my brother.Mr. Gladwell isn't trying to sell you on this. Merely to highlight it and help you to look at why things happen in life and marvel over what a amazing machine we all have in our grasp.There's a quote that I believe is by Zig Ziggler? Which goes along the lines of... \"Information can circle the world in a second and take 20 years to penetrate that quarter inch of space between my ear and my brain\". Don't let that happen to you.",
            "The author feeds you some entertaining anecdotes about everyting from the fraud archelogical findings to cops in extreme circumstances to marketing research. Unfortunately, the point of the book is a very primitive one: sometimes we are right in our snap judgements and sometimes we are wrong. He even comes up with the a catchy new term: \"thin slicing\". In my opinon however, the only place where you can't go wrong with thin slicing is a deli. So, go spend your money on a nice sandwich and skip this book. If you must read it - get it from a library.",
            "You've probably been to a doctor who starts talking to you, but never really listens to what you have to say . . . if that be the case, then you'll probably find the doctor wanting . . . andyou should listen to your feelings because you've engaged in a practice known as \"thin-slicing,\" wherein you take what matters most from an overwhelming number of variables.Malcolm Gladwell (author of THE TIPPING POINT, a previous favorite of mind about how we understand the world around us) explains the aforementioned concept in BLINK, a dandy little book with a subtitle that says it all: THE POWER OF THINKING WITHOUT THINKING.He looks at how choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--aren't always as simple as they seem . . . yet some people seem to be able to make them successfully; e.g., the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact . . . by the same token, Gladwell examines why \"blink\" theory has led to such great failures as New Coke.I especially enjoyed reading about the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minuets of observing a couple . . . the key: If Gottman observes one or both partners in a marriage showing contempt toward the other, heconsiders it the single most important sign that the marriage is in trouble.There were several other memorable passages; among them:[analyzing people involved in speed dating] Kailynn stood to the side, by the bar that ran across one wall of the room. \"If you are enjoying the connection, time goes quickly. If you aren't, it's the longest six minutes of your life,\" she said as she watched the couplesnervously chatter. \"Sometimes strange things happen. I'll never forget, back in November, there was a guy from Queens who showed up with a dozen red roses, and he gave one to every girl he spoke to. He had a suit on.\" She gave a half smile. \"He was ready to go.\"[comparing sales of cars] The results were stunning. The white men received initial offers from the salesmen that were $725 above the dealer's invoice (that is, what the dealer paid for the car from the manufacturer). White women got initial offers of $935 above invoice. Black women were quoted a price, on average, of $1,195 above invoice. And black men? Their initial offer was $1,687 above invoice. Even after forty minutes of bargaining, the black men could get the price, on average, down to only $1,551 above invoice. After lengthy negotiations, Ayres's black men still ended up with a price that was nearly $800 higherthat Ayres's white men were offered without having to say a word.[explaining why there are more women now in orchestra] The fact that there are now women playing for symphony orchestras is not a trivial change. It matters because it has opened up a world of possibility for a group that had been locked out of opportunity. It also matters because by fixing the first impression at the heart of the audition--by judging purely on the basis of ability--orchestras now hire better musicians, and better musicians mean better music. And how did we get better music? Not by rethinking the entire classical music enterprise or building new concert halls or pumping in millions of new dollars, but by paying attention to the tiniest detail, the first two seconds of the audition.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell is one of my all-time favorite writers and I always rejoice when the latest New Yorker includes one of his articles. Tipping Point focused on the way critical mass influences everything from crime statistics to footwear choices. Blink directs our attention (paradoxically) to unconscious thought processes.As always, Gladwell relies on findings from mainstream research to make his points. He cites psychologists whose work belongs on syllabuses of graduate seminars. Unfortunately, that's where most of their work ends up, when in fact there are enormous implications for all parts of our lives.Blink begins by noting that often we need only small \"thin slices\" of information to make predictions about behavior and events. For instance, psychologist Gottman can predict whether a couple will divorce after listening to only a few minutes of dialogue. Researchers Levinson and Ambady found that they could predict a doctor's likelihood of being sued not from his technical skills, but from an analysis of his personality - based on a \"thin slice\" of videotape.Gladwell also addresses the \"dark side\" of thin slicing, namely stereotyping. Because President Warren G. Harding was elected because he looked handsomely presidential, Gladwell refers to the \"Harding effect,\" bad judgment associated with thin slices.On the other hand, sometimes a thin slice can be more accurate than a larger picture: judges of jam became less accurate when asked to describe why they favored one brand over another.And conversely, sometimes thin slices are inadequate to make judgments. Police officers, for instance, perform more responsibly if they're forced to slow down, so a one-officer car actually becomes safer: the officer has to wait for backup. A new music sound fails the market research test, but listeners love the sound when they hear a whole concert.Some reviews have been critical because Gladwell seems to be saying, \"Sometimes snap judgments work...and sometimes they don't. So what?\"However, what Gladwell does is identify specific situations when think slices predict behavior - although the behavior predicted may not be reasoned or even desirable. It's a little scary to think that students who observe ten minutes of a class will make predictions that correlate with student evaluations for an entire term or that ten minutes of observing a doctor will predict his liability for lawsuits.The real problem seems to be that the more thorough, reason-based evaluations may also derive from single cues - not thoughtful integration of multiple insights. In fact, we may not be capable to moving beyond thin slices.We read thin slices accurately when we have expertise. Thus Thomas Hoving and other art experts detected a fraud from the \"feel\" of a piece. A firefighter knows when it's time to clear out a building. As a career coach I find that clients with lots of corporate experience can read a job interview easily - but they can't trust their insights as they consider a new career field or a business.In fact, recent televised reports of trials show how jurors rely on cues that they interpret through the lens of \"common sense,\" not realizing that common sense often conflicts with scientific findings. One juror claimed, \"Scott Peterson didn't look sorrowful enough,\" yet in fact researchers find a wide variety of \"normal\" ways of expressing grief. In a trial of a doctor accused of poisoning his wife, a juror dismissed an expert's theory that the victim died of a heart attack because \"there was no history.\" Yet for many heart attack victims, the first symptom is a fatal heart attack. I can't help wondering if jurors interpret \"different\" as \"bad,\" just as ordinary people reject unfamiliar music.This book reads as entertainingly as any novel. Many of us will have \"aha\" moments, as we learn, for instance, why more women have been accepted into classical orchestras. But ultimately, it is easy to feel frustrated by the gap between scientific knowledge and the realms of marketing, justice, education and other systems.We know why Mary Tyler Moore and All in the Family came close to being denied an audience - yet a promising young musician faces the same system with a less happy outcome. We realize that people cannot predict how their own minds will function - yet judges routinely ask prospective jurors about bias.These beliefs are no different than those of orchestra conductors who say, \"Women don't have powerful lungs,\" yet we continue to confuse common sense - the Harding fallacy - with real knowledge.Blink is the kind of book that should be read, talked about, analyzed, and discussed widely. I wish I could be more hopeful about the ability of scientific findings to change the way we live and conduct the business of society.",
            "When you read this book, you will most certainly notice that Gladwell is not a linear thinker. It will come out in the way that he manages to link up a multitude of seemingly unrelated phenomena and events in pure genius fashion, but also in the way the book appears slightly disorganized. In anecdote after anecdote, Gladwell shows us how our first impressions are better than spending a lot of time with something trying to figure it out IF (and this is a big \"if\" that some of the people reviewing seem to have missed) we have some good, reliable experience with what it is we're forming a first impression of. The rule of thumb appears to be this: first impressions are better than too much thinking, but first impressions can also be wrong and fool us if we don't know much about what we're trying to form an opinion of or, more importantly, if we let our biases get in the way. And as he tells us, the more experience we have with something, the less our biases affect us during our first impressions.What this book does is bridge the gap between a lot of disciplines (without actually using the terminology of many of them) to make it readable and useable for the general public. The main problem with it, as I previously alluded to, is that sometimes it's difficult to remember where he's been or to tell where he's going next. At times he attempts to remind you, but there's never any overarching summary. The cardinal rule of speeches or books like this is: \"Tell people what you're going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them.\" Gladwell only does the second one. If you can keep in mind his main thesis, this book will absolutely change the way you see the world and yourself.",
            "The Salon review of this book makes a remark that Gladwell's mission is to be entertaining, and not useful. I think that if you read this book in the spirit of that remark, you will not be disappointed.Blink is a great book to while away a few hours on a plane or train without feeling as though you are killing your brain cells with junk reading. It has the effect of listening to a really gifted cocktail party conversationalist string together a number of smart stories in search of a common theme. It doesn't quite work, but it is really impressive when it lasts, and darned fun to listen.Blink is amiable and entertaining. It admittedly fails to really build a case for a cohesive scientific thesis on thin slicing and subconscious decision-making. However, given its slim 254 pages and the wide range of stories that it contains, I would argue that it was always meant to give an impression of the subject rather than to be conclusive.Like I said, a good read if you go in expecting the right things.",
            "Gladwell has a tendency to write about obvious ideas and concepts as if they were his own ground-breaking insights, but it's easy to forgive him for doing so because he is such an engaging and easy-to-read writer.He culls heavily from major psychological studies, and illustrates points with anecdotal profiles of different people and events, disseminating all this information in an easily digestible and thought-provoking way. He is a gifted storyteller, even though he is not writing a story per se.In short, his theories aren't always cohesive and the evidence he provides is a little shaky at times, but as a writer, Gladwell doesn't fail to entertain.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell, a staff writer for The New Yorker and former business and science reporter for the Washington Post, synthesizes the complex topic of conscious and unconscious decision making in Blink. In this work, Gladwell dissects how people think and how their exterior provides valuable and often scientific explanations to their thought process. In short, he states that it is a book about \"thinking without thinking.\" Using numerous examples of recent research in the fields of psychology, military warfare, behavioral sciences, and other relevant areas, Gladwell highlights these examples to advance the thesis that we often have the ability to make a correct decision in the blink of an eye.* First impressions are often correct: In the opening chapter, Gladwell outlines the details of an ostensibly genuine and rare Kuoss statue. He talks of the pain staking labor that the J. Paul Getty museum went through to establish the bona fides of this artifact. After more than a year, the museum curators, the forensic specialists and others, verified that the statue was genuine. Unfortunately, as Gladwell notes, they were wrong. After the first Kuoss statue experts came to view the Kuoss (this was over a year after the museum had purchased and verified the statue's authenticity), they made instantaneous, and startling, remarks that the statue \"looked like new\" or \"had a mirror like image.\" These comments were not taken lightly by the museum, and after further review it was determined that the statue was a fake. Gladwell makes the point that the forensic and museum experts did not determine the authenticity of the statue after a year of analysis and research, and the statue experts made the correct determination in less than a minute. This example sets the tone for Blink, as the following chapters discuss why the Kuoss experts were able to unlock and trust their first thoughts - even though the statue was ostensibly proven to be genuine.* Unlocking the unconscious: Using a series of research examples from psychological experiments, Gladwell details some interesting facts about how we determine \"snap\" decisions. In essence, the snap decision is based on a set of pre-conceived and established notions that one has developed over the course of their lifetime. For instance, one of Gladwell's research examples exposes word and action correlations. The test, developed by Anthony Greenwald and others, was called the Implicit Association Test (IAT). In short, a series of words (both positive and negative) were given to a tester - with another set of words and/or pictures of individuals of different races. The tester was instructed to make associations by matching the differing word sets. Essentially, the quicker that a tester made an association, the higher the correlation between the word sets. For example, the results showed that there was a racial bias in almost all the testers. They would have negative correlations between a person of a certain race and the word \"good.\" The results were a bit disturbing, as they showed \"that our unconscious attitudes may be incompatible with our stated conscious values.\" According to Gladwell, this is the \"Warren Harding\" error, as the former president was a tall and handsome person, but lacked any tangible political savvy to hold the highest office in the United States. U.S. Citizens associated a strong president with his physical attributes and not his political qualifications. This sort of bias still exists today, as illustrated with the IAT. To further this conclusion, Gladwell note that most research illustrates that those in positions of power, in this case CEOS, are overwhelmingly tall white men - the medium, he explains, was just a shade under six feet. This \"dark side\" of thin slicing, according to Gladwell, is responsible for our biases and discriminations in decisions making.* The science behind quick decision making: Gladwell uses many examples in his latter chapters to solidify that people are hard-wired to make snap judgments. These decisions are the product of training and experience, notes Gladwell. The more you have of each, the more apt and adapted you will be to make the correct decision in a snap. For instance, a military war game strategy highlights this technique. Gladwell outlines the details of a 2002 War Game exercise that details the military tactics of two teams: red and blue. Both teams were not evenly matched, as the blue team enjoyed superior tactics and technology - not to mention the best analysts and military strategists. The red team had fewer resources, and the commander was meant to represent a rogue commander in the Middle East. USMC General Paul Van Riper, or \"Rip,\" as he was called by many, was chosen as the commander. A military officer who had a reputation for making good decisions in stressful situations, he proved to be an exceptional commander in Vietnam and his future endeavors. So the stage was set, Rip was up against the greatest war game team in modern day history. To make a long story short, Rip defeated the Blue team in less than one day. The blue team had assumed that Rip would use the latest technology for communications such as cell phones and satellites. But this was an incorrect assumption; Rip was able to sink the majority of the Blue Team's naval forces by using old signal communications. For instance, the Blue Team did not calculate that he would use light signals to land and launch his fighter planes. The point of this example was to illustrate that high stress experiences and training allowed Rip to make snap decisions that would defeat those who lacked those experiences and training. In this case, the Blue team lacked a Commander with the aforementioned attributes. In other words, all the expertise and technical advances could not replace the keen snap judgment of Rip. In similar examples, Gladwell illustrated that experienced stock brokers and police officers are able to make snap judgments in a blink of an eye. Mainly, their training and their experiences allow them to make the right split second decisions.Good judgment is at the core of leadership and management, and this work outlines \"how we think without thinking.\" On top of the important and somewhat novel thesis, it is an interesting story of the latest revelations in psychological research that illuminates the thought process. Blink is a page turner and a book that keeps your attention.",
            "I loved reading this book. I am fascinated by psychology and this book definitely fed my fascination (for awhile!) I felt like I was sitting in an open-roofed train and the author was guiding the rails. It was an awesome trip, pieces of this and that, and other things I never would have thought of. It was very interesting and actually educational.The book really makes you think (yes, think!!) about issues in a new way. For example, how simple signs, and comments can signal whether or not your marriage will last, why cops shouldn't have partners, I could go on and on.Blink, is a worthy read, for anyone, for any reason.",
            "The thesis of this book is that we all make snap judgements, relying on reasoning not available to our conscious thought processes. This is not a novel idea. Gladwell develops this idea by examining under what circumstances such judgments may be surprisingly good, and when they may be terrible. He is not the most disciplined of writers, and this is not entirely a bad thing. For example, I enjoyed the explanation of why a cola can do well in a taste test limited to sipping, yet do poorly as an everyday choice, although this does not really relate to the main ideas of the book. I do sometimes find him verbose, and he frequently employs that breathless style that many popular science writers seem prone to. Still, this is a deservedly popular book, interesting and informative. For readers who want to understand unconscious thought processes in somewhat more depth, I unreservedly recommend \"Strangers to Ourselves: Discovering the Adaptive Unconscious\" by Timothy B Wilson. It is a tribute to Gladwell, that although I read his book after Wilson's, there was enough new stuff to keep me interested. I wish every citizen could read Gladwell's discussion of the science behind high speed chases and their behavioral aftermath - think Rodney King case which led to the LA riots.",
            "Enthralling. Unique. One-of-a-Kind. Blink was one of those books that you pick up and cannot put down. Malcolm Gladwell's novel explores rapid cognition and the snap decisions we make in our mind without recognizing that we have come to a conclusion. These quick assessments continually affect us as we meet new people, go on a first date, or take action in an emergency. Gladwell sheds light on our unknown mental processes through sharing results from various studies and experiments. My favorite example he gives is speed dating. Speed dating exercises our \"thin-slicing\" deductive reasoning. While participating in a speed dating event, several single people of opposite genders gather at a central location to meet each other. All the guys have a seat at a table as the women sit opposite of them and rotate with the sound of a bell at a set time interval. In this time the couple decides if they would like to see each other again based on first impressions. The man running the speed dating service noted that women participating in the evening knew within a minute if they wanted to pursue an actual date with the man in question. Gladwell added, \"when it comes to thin-slicing potential dates, pretty much everyone is smart.\"I found Gladwell's style laid back and informative. The personal stories allow for the reader to create enough of a connection with the book to remain interested. After completing the book I sat back and realized how vital snap judgments play into everyday life. Blink allowed me to appreciate the quick decisions I make before I give an issue much thought.",
            "This book is about the power of your subconscious mind. In case, you haven't read it, there's a book with that title. During encounters that require split-second thinking, the conscious is not quick enough to respond. This is where the subconscious kick in. We should learn to trust our subconscious but at the same time, be conscious of factors that may affect the subconscious from performing optimally. Such factors as stress or misinterpretation of the subconscious or bad information being registered into the subconscious from years of childhood experience may have adverse effects on the subconscious. Take for example, racism. Such ideals may be present in the subconscious without conscious even knowing. Years of association with a particular race will affect the subconscious either in a positive or negative light. But only by being conscious of this fact can we begin to correct this however so slowly. The mind is very powerful and mysterious and you will find it ever so true after reading this book.",
            "I liked it more than I thought I would - being a bit predisposed to skepticism of Mr. Gladwell (which may or may not be fair..)A lot of very enjoyable anecdotes & good research, which is typically what I like most about these kinds of books, but unfortunately it doesn't add up to much.It feels a bit like a debate student buttressing his argument with a multitude of dubious supporting 'evidence', but even worse, here it seems to be not because his argument is untenable but because there's not really much of an argument to speak of! The only discernable hypothesis being that we use all of our past experience to intuitively make split-second high-pressure decisions on-the-fly rather than taking the time to think about it consciously - but there's certainly nothing ground-breaking or world-view-shattering about that! Of course we do!It ultimately feels more like a marketing pitch for the catchy title & premise than a open-minded investigation into a quite interesting topic, as though the title takes precedence over any deep insight that could be gained from the material at hand, which I have a feeling is more dissonant, inconclusive, & mysterious than he would have you believe here.",
            "My first intuition for this book was good (or what Gladwell would say \"was my gut intuition\"), but I failed. This book is boring, full of repetitive examples (some of them very interesting, specially the first chapters), but at the end you get nothing in conclusion. We all know that people with more experience on their fields can get a very accurate explanation to some phenomena with very little information, is this new? My gut intuition did not work for this book.",
            "This is a quick read and suitable for anyone who is human and struggles therefore with inherent patterns of emotion and thought that result in actions that can be either harmful or helpful to yourself and others. This is my interpretation of Malcolm's objective but somewhat rambling style, of this book which by matter of fact points out that stereotypes can and do taint our decisions but how we can also leverage this intuitive power to make better decisions in a blink. To turn this weakness into strength we need to develop our expertise and ourselves as Malcolm shows us through examples with police officers, food tasters and mind readers! Malcolm is subtly helping us to become aware as we learn about how commercial strategies can convince us to like certain flavors and other suggestions that impact our daily lives maybe without our even knowing. Since 55% of communication is non verbal, Malcolm's inclusion of Ekman's facial studies should incline us to pay better attention to that which is not said by our politicians; actions speak much louder than words. References to Ekman's research and the unknown depths of the unconscious although brief, might be enough for readers to seek more understanding about their own locked rooms so they can in turn air them out. Malcolm's own experiences when he grew a mess of curly hair tactfully placed outside the book in the Acknowledgement end pages further proves his point that is \"the truly successful decision making relies on a balance between deliberate and instinctive thinking;\" sometimes we need to consider the obvious so we can think.",
            "First, the good -This book does an admirable job of demonstrating how and why people can make snap, \"gut feeling\" assumptions on topics they are experts in and be right, even when they can't give you a rational explanation for why they think what they think. Mr. Gladwell calls this \"thin slicing.\" I like the term, as it's descriptive and accurate. It is a phenomenon most of us are familiar with yet can't explain. Why did you switch lanes right before that other car swerved? Why did you get that feeling that person was just \"wrong\" before they suddenly went off? Most of us have experience this yet can't explain it. Gladwell does an excellent job.Where is all goes wrong, for me, is when Gladwell takes it into areas where the normal systemic processes are either altered or co opted, particularly in law enforcement. I've been in LE work for the better part of two decades and I can say that \"thin slicing\" is very applicable when cops are doing their routine work (why did they stop that guy right there who just happened to have an active warrant and a gun on him?) but once we start adding adrenal stress \"thin slicing\" becomes more problematic. When adrenaline hits the body in a crisis situation the amygdala, the part of the brain dedicated to survival, takes over, which is why it's hard to think under extreme stress. There are pre-programmed survival routines in everyone's brain, with the additional ones that can be added through appropriate training. When faced with a survival situation, the brain will shut down all non-essential functions and focus on surviving. This process includes the release of the drug adrenaline, which is the chemical authority the amygdala uses to enforce it's mission. This drug can very much influence perception. If you cannot accurately perceive an event you cannot \"thin slice\" it. This should be self-evident. Would we expect the art experts Gladwell mentions in one chapter make the same determinations if they were high on say, LSD? Of course not - altered perception alters results. Yet somehow Mr. Gladwell equates the calm, rational deliberation of art experts with the fear-addled, adrenaline charged incident of police officers engaging in lethal force situations. This does not compute. The standards are not the same and can't be judged equally.Place the art directors in fear of their life and let's measure that response, then we'll have an appropriate comparison.Minus the either intentional misrepresentation or misunderstanding regarding the effects on the human body of a life-threatening stress event, Gladwell makes some excellent points. This flaw, however, significantly damaged his hypothesis in my opinion.",
            "Blink is a book about the human brain. While it helps the reader better understand how the human brain works, don't expect to be able to use that understanding to your advantage. In fact, while the book provides a fascinating discovery of how the human brain \"thin slices\" both people and events, the main takeaway from this is that thin slicing is either accurate or it's not.Gladwell points out some cases where thin slicing based on limited information is just as accurate (or more accurate) as making a decision on piles of research. In other cases, thin slicing causes us to have wrong impressions about a person and therefore causing us to make wrong decisions. Even still, there are the instances where thin slicing completely fails and everything goes sour.The one thing I did take away, is that the human brain is not always capable of allowing us to verbally explain the things we do or think. Unless you're particularly skilled in a certain area, once you try to explain why you initially think this or that, the reasoning begins to break down and often fails entirely. This can then cause us to come to conclusions that are contrary to what we really believe. Strange, yeah, I know.That's what makes Blink fascinating. The human brain is so complex that it often doesn't even work in the ways we would think. But it can be trained. Immerse yourself into something and your brain develops the capability of knowing why you like or dislike certain things or even to read things in high-stress situations that the normal person would not.As a business owner I didn't find Blink to be as useful as The Tipping Point, also from Gladwell, but the author does have a way of bringing oddities to light and presents them in a fascinating way.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell could write about paint drying and make it fascinating. His New Yorker columns (sadly far more infrequent these days) are a joy. This book was fun to read - his usual flair for thought-provoking and interesting examples, well-written.Why only 4 out of 5 stars? Because I thought this book lacked a coherent overall argument. What is the bottom line? You should trust your gut instinct .... except in those cases where you shouldn't. He fails to make clear exactly what it is that distinguishes one situation from the other. As a result, the examples, while interesting to read, leave the reader unsure in the end what point Gladwell is really trying to make.",
            "Blink is a pleasant read of the extended magazine article type, with snappy stories and observations that move right along and can keep the reader engaged. I don't see making a big fuss about the content and conclusions, which are relatively straightforward. Most interesting were the examples, such as the married couples, where it may be possible for a trained observer to make quick and accurate judgments on little information, as long as it is the proper information. The marriage example is one of the few where a rigorous explanation is actually offered: if the analyst can flush out a tendency for one partner to show contempt for the other, that would certainly sound like a solid negative indicator.Other stories work less well. Sure, people let their known and unknown biases affect their thinking and, sure, making snap judgments can lead to bad outcomes, as in the case where a man was shot when he shouldn't have been. Sometimes intuition is good and sometimes it isn't. Mr. Gladwell tries to distinguish what he's talking about from intuition, yet his argument didn't persuade me. He also easily condemns bias, especially racial bias, without addressing the context of such bias and whether in some cases there might even be some justification for \"thin slicing\" that incorporates bias.Gladwell's example of singer \"Kenna\" could probably just as well be balanced by artists he doesn't like getting lucky or unlucky. The Coke vs. Pepsi story doesn't seem especially relevant, because in this case the sip test was a bad idea. If you want to show how thin slicing has surprising power, why include this example?I also don't see the big deal about the war game scenario. The \"hero\" of the story did what a creative leader should do: come up with a strategy that works well, given your opponent. When you are outmanned, try some unconventional techniques. When you don't have a lot of information, maybe gamble more than you would. To me, that thread was actually very interesting, but did not really fit with Gladwell's thesis beyond the need to focus on what information is important and not get buried by info overload. In this case, you still need creative thinking whether you have minimal information or excessive.Because the book is an easy meal, it can be read for entertainment and as motivation to examine our own prejudices and why and how we are either good or bad in reading people, using our intuition, or making quick decisions. If I'm not good at quick decisions under stress, why not? Do I have a history of effective reading of person-to-person clues? Do I give off vibes that I don't intend to? When I interview people, am I really making a decision in the initial seconds and then justifying that subconscious choice? Maybe these ideas could prompt some self-analysis at the individual or team level. You won't get much advice from Blink regarding how to go about the task, so true introspection and improvement will require guidance to be found elsewhere.3.5 stars, with credit for style and entertainment value, not rigor.",
            "blink: the Power of Thinking Without Thinking, the title itself is attractive enough to make someone interested in reading this text by Malcolm Gladwell. Author has done a great job in weaving examples from a wide variety of professions, functions and areas like relationships, politics, military, medical, crime, personality, connoisseurs, etc. to illustrate his main point:The Power of Adaptive Unconscious of Human Mind.Author states that human mind works through two strategies, the conscious strategy and through adaptive unconscious. First strategy is when use data, information and analysis to draw a conclusion and make decision, whereas second is when we make decisions on basis of that \"gut feeling\". This is when we act instantly on a thought which flashes in our mind and forces us to make a decision. The question now is: Is the accuracy or quality of a decision is directly related to the time and effort spent into making it? Per Gladwell, \"Decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.\"Author has used technique of \"thin slicing\" i.e. power of our unconscious (the internal computer) to create a subjective impression using very little information., to explain this kind of decision-making. He has also cited some erroneous decisions (Warren Harding Error & an encounter in Bronx) and some great decisions from medical and military, (Cook County Hospital in Chicago & Van Riper, respectively).In my opinion, our brain certainly has that great power of making a split-second decision, but it is upto us, how we develop and tap that unusual potential. We can use these techniques like mid reading, facial expression recognition etc but it certainly requires practice and a certain level of expertise to utilize them for our benefit. I would recommend reading this book with an unbiased mind and think, don't just blink.",
            "This is such an interesting book. It looks like a book about psychology, but the truth is, when I read on, I realize that the psychology factor, how we think in a snap second or \"blink\" is everywhere in our everyday lives. The book also shows the very broad knowledge the author has. When I am interested by the new ideas he presents, I am also learning so many things at the same time. It is a book that's worth reading and not at all a waste of time like some books are.Very importantly, this book does NOT say \"Always judge a book by its cover.\" It suggests that sometimes our instinct does a better job; the other times careful examination and thinking process produce a better result than thin-slicing. He also says that we still cannot conclude when exactly we should thin-slice and rely on our instinct. This is a book about his researches and studies on many cases where either instinct or thorough thinking is what IS helpful with solving a problem.Finally, don't try to skim or skip ahead in the book. He is very smart about it. He likes to repeat and conclude over and over to prove a point or compare throughout the book.",
            "This book was recommended to me by a friend, Rory, a fellow student in the doctoral program in Leadership Studies at Gonzaga University. What a totally amazing book. I was intrigued and spellbound the entire time.\"The Theory of Thin Slices: How a Little Bit of Knowledge Goes a Long Way\" is the driving theme for this book. Malcolm Gladwell, also author of \"The Tipping Point\", incorporates ample research and rich detail to add depth to the discussion of the incredible ability of the human mind to make split second decisions. He explains how our neurolinguistic program plays a role in our interpretations of the world around us before our conscious mind ever catches on to the automatic decisions that have guided us to survival or success. Whether we are judging the authenticity of an ancient work of art or selecting an ideal mate, the automatic decision maker often selects a better decision for us than we have consciously derived after hours of discourse and deliberations. This book is about those \"thin slices\", decisions made literally in the blink of an eye.Technology has come a long way in helping us to understand how the mind works. An understanding of these complex concepts helps us to interpret the decisions and actions that we make in our daily interactions with others. A better understanding of these concepts might help us to change how we train and educate leaders for a more ethically sensitive society. The author continues to add depth to substantiate the thesis through many interesting examples and research studies.I highly recommend this book.",
            "I bought this on the back of reading Malcoms really interesting \"The Tipping Point\" book.Blink is worth a read, however you are left with the feeling that its all a little padded out to compensate for what really could be a much shorter book. There are some good insights into the way people unconsciously make decisions about things.Some of the more interesting studies quoted explain how a high percentage of corporate leaders are taller than the average person. And how every extra inch in height can equate to about an extra $1,000 in salary. The goal of this book is to try to explain why these kind of things happen. It seems we all subconsciously make decisions based on predefined perceptions.Some ideas it this book really overlap with NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming). If you have read anything about NLP then I think you will see the overlap.People really should rely a lot more on their gut feelings with things as this book proves. Even though you may not know why you have a gut feeling about something this gut feeling comes from your subconscious evaluating and making decisions. The most powerful thing you can do, I believe, is try to be a bit more aware of your first gut feeling about things, it is easy to not pick up on them.",
            "Gladwell takes a fascinating topic -- how the mind works without us knowing it -- and does some of his best reporting work. He covers a broad spectrum of research and events that are fascinating, especially when connected under the broader topic. I've read it twice and referred to it several other times. I was hoping for something at the end to give me clarity on what to do with the information now that I have it, but it wasn't there. That may have been intentional on the author's part; he might want us to draw our own conclusions. But that was an expectation I developed as I was reading that wasn't fulfilled in the end. That does not in any way take away from the quality of the writing and the expansiveness of the information. \"Blink\" quickly made my list of favorite reads.",
            "The premise IS interesting. The process is not. Author relates one study after another, after another, after another. These articles are meant to establish that we know what we know instinctively.The big turnoff in this book was the author's heavy racial bias.",
            "One of Rudyard Kipling's famous \"Just So Stories\" was about the Elephant's Child, an animal \"filled with 'satiable curtiosity\". Malcolm Gladwell is clearly something of an Elephant's Child himself and his curiosity leads him into exploration of an extraordinary range of interesting and useful phenomena.His \"The Tipping Point\" was a tour de force on how epidemics, ideas and fashions propagate and what causes the sudden take-off that is characteristic of an epidemic - or a fad. From his findings, he drew out many conclusions that are directly useful to business, as well as being interesting in themselves.\"Blink\" is that rare thing - a second book that is as good as the first. It looks at several related phenomena, particularly:* the power of first impressions and what we call intuition, why they are often right and what are the factors that can cause them to be systematically wrong; and* the related power of understanding the use of what he calls 'thin slices' (a limited number of very specific elements that are always present in complex situations or judgments) to improve judgment.The book provides a systematic, fascinating and highly entertaining examination of these phenomena - how they manifest themselves, why they work as they do, why some people are much better than others at making sound judgments from apparently little evidence, what can be done to improve first impression judgments and, perhaps even more important, avoid being led astray by first impressions. It also demonstrates the extraordinary amount of detailed work that is necessary to identify consciously the tiny clues that our subconscious registers, so that they can be turned into useful tools for improving rapid judgment, and helps one to glimpse the awe-inspiring capacity for subtlety of the human brain.One of the key messages for business is the power of our unconscious biases and how important it is to recognize that they exist and to take steps to minimize their impact.A second key message of the book is the obverse of that: learn to trust your intuition and to cultivate it. Our subconscious is often better at detecting dissonance than are our analytical skills.A third is that, out of the flood of data available by which we might judge a situation, only a few factors are truly influential (Pareto's Law applies here too). Effort put into identifying those factors and then learning to use them can bring great rewards.Gladwell has in full measure the rare gift of helping readers to learn a great deal while enjoying themselves thoroughly.",
            "While this book is well written as an introduction to the influence of Intuition in decision making, it is relatively \"thin soup\". I would suggest that folks with an interest in this topic read \"Educating Intuition \" by Robin Hogarth. R.Olsen, Decision Scientist.",

But after skimming it, I thought it might offer positive insights into the all-too-human habit of immediate judgments. Having now read it, I will be forever grateful to Malcolm Gladwell for proving that my initial assessment, albeit hasty, had been right. Had I applied the power of thinking without thinking in the store, I would have saved myself $15.",

Can someone please help me spell gobblely-gook?",
            "I read The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell and now have finished his next book, Blink. This book is about the first two seconds that we take to evaluate something. \"The first tastk of Blink is to convince you of a simple fact: decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.\" Sometimes, it is not scientific information or rational thinking that gives us our most important information but rather it is the first two seconds, or blink, that gives us what information that we need most. The scientific information may seem very compelling but sometimes it is our instincts that are right on.\"So when should we trust our instincts and when should we be wary of them? Answering that question is the second task of Blink.\"\"The third and most important task of this book is to convince you that our snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled.\" In fact, \"the power of knowing in that first two seconds is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few. It is an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves.\"\"The task of making sense of ourselves and our behavior requires that we acknowledge there can be as much value in the blink of an eye as in months of rational analysis.\"The book goes through various experiments such as those by the pre-eminent marriage counselor, John Gottman to show that in fifteen minutes he is able to predict which married couples will still be married years from now.He looks at racial and gender profiling under all sorts of conditions and examines the outcome. He shows how \"we're a bit too quick to come up with explanations for things we don't really have an explanation for.\" Often, we think we are smarter than we are and it's important that we accept our ignorance more frequently.He tells the story of Warren Harding, considered one of the worse president of our country who was elected because of his looks and manner of speech. We often choose people by how they look rather than the qualities they possess. CEO's are often taller than average, handsomer but not more educated or more able.In the blink of an eye we can make life saving decisions that are better off not researched than researched. This is a paradox that is true but goes against all our thinking.An interesting book, Gladwell discusses all sorts of situations where a blink of an eye can render the truth far more accurately than years of research. I found the book fascinating and, at times, oxymoronic, but true.",
            "Another \"instant classic\" from Malcolm Gladwell in his now signature style. The idea this book explores is the gut feeling of instant decision making - and how we can learn to trust snap judgements when it counts. This is not to say that studied research and fact gathering is invalid or unnecessary - in fact, this book uses standard research and academic methodology to actual prove that certain kinds of split second decisions (using what Malcolm describes as \"thin slicing\") are just as accurate as concerted inspection.There are many great examples in the book, but my two favorites are:1) The student judging the teacher: College students were shown short clips (e.g. 30 seconds) of prospective professors and were asked to rate whether they each one was a good or bad teacher before taking the course (with no other qualifications or prior knowledge). At first glance (pardon the pun), this seems to be nowhere near enough time to rate professor effectiveness - no content, no fact checking, no lecture. However, the results (positive or negative) were statistically insignificant from (different) students' post-course surveys whom had taken the entire course with each prospective professor. In other words, the snap judgements by prospective students about a prospective teacher were the same ratings as the students whom had already taken the course.2) The probability of medical malpractice lawsuits: It turns out, it has almost NOTHING to do capability or skill level. It has everything to do with bedside manor. Doctors who spend more time with their patients, or have an overall good relationship with their patients, are far less likely to be sued than doctors who spend less time or have a gruff or seemingly cold bedside manor. It all comes down to engagement and being in the moment during consultation, and almost nothing to do with actual education or skill level of the doctor.This book just further reinforces the power of the parallel processor that is our brain, and how hard it has proven to be to model artificial intelligence. We don't yet understand completely how we can do certain things so well (e.g. being \"in the zone\") or how we can make certain kinds of correlations-to-judgements (\"thin slicing\" and generalization), but examining the human animal proves to be an endless fascination of Mr. Gladwell's (and obviously, the many purchasers of his best sellers).On the same topic: I recently heard about Japanese hen sorters, or specifically \"chicken sexers.\" This is a technique, or really more of a subconscious trained behavior, which allows humans to instantly distinguish between a male and female chicken (thereby determining which will be egg producing). What is amazing is that there is basically no difference to a layperson's eye between male and female chicks at an age prior to 3-5 weeks. But, chicken sexers are able to immediately identify the difference and sort accordingly. This is an example (not in the book) of the instant decision making based on some form of unconscious input and the power of parallel processing - much like a well-trained eye of an FBI agent can pick up on an out-of-place element in a room upon first visit.",
            "I thought, hoped that this would be as good as the Outliers. It wasn't. I didn't finish it, which I rarely don't.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell, in his book blink brakes down the idea of instincts and discusses their possible credibility. As is the subtitle of the book, `thinking without thinking,' Gladwell leads the reader, mainly through examples and scientific findings, to the idea that we have two separate modes of coming up with a solution; the general one which we call thinking and a second one which he refers to as rapid cognition (or instinct).In his introduction, Gladwell talk about a very expensive statue which had to be evaluated for a possible fraud before the museum made their purchase of it. He goes on to list several art experts, who at first sight of the statue either got a `hunch' that something was amiss, or said that they felt cold, or even strongly suggested that the statue not be purchased. The story line follows that a 14 month investigation that the museum conducted bought them to the conclusion that the statute in fact was a fake. What took the museum 14 months to figure out, the exert `understood' within the first couple of seconds. \"Blink is about those first two seconds.\"Gladwell begins to build his argument by separating the two types of ways our brains can make sense of a situation: first, the common sit-down-and-think-about-it until you've consciously figured it out. And the second, which operate much faster than the first strategy, and generally operates completely outside our conscience. The latter method, which he compared to a giant self-operating computer, is referred to as the adaptive unconscious. He proposes that the adaptive unconscious is in place as a survival mechanism, because when we are in danger we don't always have time to rationally think about how we can solve the urgent matter. We can see this mode in action when there is a car coming right at us, and we are also privileged to see this kind of fast thinking when we get our `first impression' of someone or something.This form of \"rapid cognition\" says Gladwell, might put the reader into suspicious. He expands; haven't we always been told to `stop and think' and `not judge a book by its cover?' But can this be partially false, questions Gladwell? Can first impression and snap judgments be of any value? Yes, answers Gladwell as he begins to present his goals for blink.First, that these unconscious decisions can be as good as those made with general `slow' thinking. Second, when and how we can pick out times that these quick instincts can yield to false conclusions. Third, that we can educate and control out snap judgments and first impressions. And forth, Gladwell's personal hope for the world, that once the readers begin educate and control their rapid cognition it can improve the world on an economic, political, and social.The book is then broken down into six chapters and a conclusion. The chapters are used as different arguments to support Gladwell's goals for the book. The chapters are broken down into sub sections in which he builds up each argument premise by premise.",
            "\"Blink\" inspires me to listen to my intuition as I pay attention to my initial impulses and not over-think or second-guess myself. Malcolm Gladwell speaks of \"thin slicing\" - that first, unexamined \"intuitive hit\" that we experience before we start to analyze situations. Trusting my intuition can be particularly challenging when I have personal agendas that conflict with intuitive information I receive. I find that my intuitive skill set is easy to access when I am present with any given moment and not lost in my thought process, analyzing every little thing.Another book that has strengthened my intuitive skill-set is Ariel & Shya Kane's \"Working On Yourself Doesn't Work\". It is a brilliant book that has taught me that choices are always appropriate when I don't reach for conclusions based on my past experiences. With their easy & practical principles, I have found a deep sense of ease in my life as I learn to trust my intuition. Within the realm of wellbeing - intuition blooms!",
            "In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell offers us a fascinating survey of recent research in neuroscience and psychology. Much of the book is an examination of \"thin-slicing,\" which Gladwell defines as \"rapid cognition . . . the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behavior based on very narrow slices of experience.\" When we experience gut-level responses, form a first impression, or make a snap judgment, we are thin-slicing, making a decision outside of consciously controlled logical processes.Late in the book, Gladwell describes Blink as \"a journey into the wonders of our unconscious,\" and as a reader moves through his various case studies, you can see why that characterization is fitting. But Gladwell's enthusiasm is always grounded in seriousness. \"We have, as human beings, a storytelling problem,\" he writes. \"We're a bit too quick to come up with explanations for things we don't really have an explanation for.\" The book's case studies, especially the ones on communication patterns between married couples and on war games, are surprising and disturbing, and frequently contain public-policy ramifications.The brain is a chemical and physical marvel, and Gladwell's balanced account of thin-slicing, which often provides better results than our conscious deliberations but which also exposes us to the errors and damage of mistaken conclusions and subtle discrimination, only deepens our respect for its complexity.Blink presents scientific research in clear and compelling language. Gladwell's curiosity, enthusiasm, and humor permeate the book, and idealistic intellectuals should delight in his call to use \"practical problem solving,\" grounded in our understanding of how our thinking actually works, to address social ills such as racially biased criminal convictions.As a reminder of the frequent flaws of conscious decisions and an introduction to the potential of the brain's unconscious power, this book is highly recommended.Armchair Interviews says: Important message for everyone.",
            "Gladwell writes very well. Blink captured my attention for the few hours it took to read it, and it was hard to put down. The problem is that Gladwell focuses more on fluff than on substance. He practices what he preaches, \"thinking without thinking.\" The end result is a book that is entertaining without educating. For me, that is not enough.As Thomas Edison was fond of saying, \"There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking.\" Gladwell gives us lazy people an excuse to rely on our intuition and avoid thinking. But can we tap the power of thinking without thinking? I don't think so.Although not as well-written, and nowhere near as popular, I found Michael LeGault's critique of Blink, titled Think, the better book. In my mind, better think than blink.",

It is delightfully written (I imagine that Gladwell is a great conversationalist - the writing is very smooth and pleasing).Other reviewers have attacked this book because the writer is not a cognitive expert - they have questioned his credentials and conclusions. This is not a textbook, it's a popular treatment. The author discusses intuition not on the level of psychology professors but on the level of average readers. In my view he does this very well. The author takes an anecdotal approach - each aspect of his theory is supported by his analysis of an event, sometimes backed by interviews with experts.In short, a new take on the idea of intuition that is accessible to the common man, and presented in an entertaining and thought-provoking style.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell has pulled together a series of nicely-told anecdotes about .... something. He doesn't put much effort into trying to explain what is going on, whether in fact anything interesting actually is going on, nor does he make a convincing case that the various examples he uses actually have anything in common. I couldn't see much connection among museum curators being able to recognize fake sculptures, psychologists predicting the strength of a couple's relationship based on watching a conversation, and a former Special Forces soldier using unconventional guerilla tactics to outwit the military establishment. Gladwell's journalistic background comes through in his easy writing style and lack of intellectual rigor. It's easy to read and easy to forget.",
            "How can a few experts tell in a blink of a second that a sculpture is a fake when all of the scientific tests say it is authentic?What is examined in this book is the minds ability to make snap decisions with the barest amount of information and often doing much better than people with unlimited time and information.I have to say that this book is very interesting and actually reflects my personality. The longer I have to think about something the more liekly I will get it wrong. I was trained as an infantry sergeant which requires snap decisions but I have been this way my whole life.On the whole this book was a good read and I recommend it to others but I remember thinking the whole time I was reading it that all of the examples were anecdotal. I can find enough anecdotal evidence to support just about anything no matter how ridiculous. The books major failing is its ability to show any hard data to support its suppositions.Read it but don't take it too seriously",
            "Malcolm Gladwell has done a masterful job of enlightening the reader about the pitfalls of decision making. Due to weaknesses in our cognitive processes, we are subject to flawed decisions that have a wide range of negative consequences, from missed opportunities to deadly results.The book contains a wealth of information for improving organization decision making. For example --- Gladwell's examination of insight is particularly powerful. Organization leaders are often their own worst enemy. Their demand for justification for new ideas often kills these ideas before they have a chance to mature. \"Insight is not a light bulb that goes off inside our heads. It is a flickering candle that can easily be snuffed out.\" This has strong implications for organizations seeking to nurture new ideas for innovation, especially since creative ideas are typically the result of intuitive insight rather than deductive reasoning.- Our preconceived notions work against making effective decisions without our slightest awareness. These biases prevent people from objectively seeing what is actually right before their eyes, even when they are sincerely attempting to be objective.- Frugality in decision making matters. Overloading decision makers with information destroys their ability to intuitively pick up the underlying pattern necessary to make effective decisions.Fortunately there are methods to improve the use of deduction and intuition as well as reduce the impact of biases. Gladwell's engaging writing style brings these points home in colorful stories of real dilemmas for all types of organizations and decision makers.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, which creatively examines the impact and implications of making snap decisions. The variety of examples the author puts forth to explore the significance of intuition is exciting and fascinating. Gladwell finds one aspect that virtually all major industries and successful people in those industries have in common. He uses professional athletes, art historians, music producers, soft drink companies, etc., to show how meaningful it can be to give heed to the most basic instincts we have. I think that he has made an excellent study, however \"cursory\" it may be. I found that I was able to relate to many of the situations in the book, especially the consequences of over-thinking and second guessing yourself. When intuition is a result of subconscious or unconscious \"knowledge\" and not the result of a psycho-emotional judgment (rooted in neuroses), than I think it has the power to help us make excellent decisions that can transform our lives in an instant.",
            "There are a few good ideas in here, which attracted me (as well as millions of others) to pick up this book. I am impressed at the sheer number of people he's convinced to buy his book at first blink. However, Mr Gladwell ultimately falls victim to his own preachings as he seems to shun the alternative logical, methodical way of doing things, resulting in a work with a few interesting but embryonic ideas and no clear flow of themes.What really rankled with me was the writing. It's appalling. From Chapter One: \"He's gotten so good at thin-slicing marriages that he says he can be in a restaurant and eavesdrop on the couple one table over and get a pretty good sense of whether they need to start thinking about hiring lawyers and dividing up custody of the children.\" This is undoubtedly the most tortuous sentence I've read in print. Come on Mr Gladwell, haven't you heard that \"it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing\"?Perhaps he should have taken a cue from \"Freakonomics\" author Steven Levitt and gotten a journalist to do the writing for him. In addition, the editing is just sloppy. The frequent typos quite spoiled for me this otherwise fairly entertaining light read. It's an informal collation of behavioural experiments and amusing incidents illustrating triumphs of instinct, but don't expect to walk away with a clearer understanding of how and when to use this intuition any better. I'm just glad I borrowed it because I wouldn't have paid to read this.",
            "I have just finished listening to this book. I enjoyed it. I found it very interesting and entertaining. Do NOT, however, buy this book for educational purposes. The author tells many stories of how other people are able to use their gift of quick thinking, but gives no instruction on how to enhance this ability in oneself. But, just to reiterate, it was a very enjoyable book.",
            "In a blink...\"BLINK: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\" is a rip-off! Malcome Gladwell's \"BLINK\" had a great review in the New York Times and was (is?) a top seller. However, I was so under whelmed after reading it that I passed the book on, without comment, to a couple of friends, (possibly ex-friends now) for their reactions. It could be that I was missing something. One of my pals later told, me in describing his thoughts on \"BLINK\", that this tome was exactly what the philosopher Harry Franfurt was describing in his book, \"On Bull....\". The author of \"BLINK\" has scraped together some university \"studies\" to give credence to his dissertation. By puffing out the studies and inserting some personal observations he managed to fill some two-hundred odd pages with pap. I had been scammed. Here, in my opinion, is the encapsulated wisdom to be gleaned from \"BLINK\" and what you should know before starting the read: If you carefully observe what you are doing while repeating the same process over, and over, and over, you will one day be able to repeat the process without a lot thinking...sort of an intuitive thing. It's kinda like shooting a basketball.It's Pavlov, basic 101 Pavlov. The implied benefit to you will be an ability to recognize these processes within, let's say, maybe, two seconds or a \"BLINK\" of the eye. Oh yeah, the writer also throws in some personal grievances about an entertainer friend(?) of his who gets panned by critics and trys to lead you into concluding that they must be some kind of music bigots. The only benefit in reading this rip-off is that I should be on my way to recognizing literary nothingness within a \"blink\".",
            "Highly readable, and I definitely recommend, as it is a very enjoyable collection of stories about \"gut feeling\" decision making. But, I ended the book not being sure what the author wanted me to take away by reading it. It is common knowledge that experts in any field develop an inner guide that allows them to make quick decisions and quickly see what others do not see (and there are plenty of examples of this in the book); it is also common knowledge that sometimes those instant judgements are not necesarily right (and there are also examples of this in the book). I was expecting a theory out of that book and there is none. Read it anyhow, you will likely enjoy it.",
            "I read a brief review of this book and it sounded like an interesting read. I tend to always look for an author's previous work before buying the current bestseller. To my surprise Gladwell's other work was also a bestseller...still!!!So I read Tipping Point, it was a very quick read and very entertaining to me. However, that being said it still was getting very bad reviews here on Amazon. I kept thinking that maybe I'd put off Blink until it comes down in price and/or came out in paperback. All of that was about 2 months ago. In the meantime, I've read three other books and found myself in a Amazon dry spell (Waiting for 4 new books to be delivered). So I went over to my local price club and picked up Blink for $17 dollars. I liked Tipping Point, I thought it was engaging up until the end where it dragged slightly but I suspect it was the rehashing that caused that. Anyway, Blink is a little different in that it starts to become bogged down halfway through, not because of the rehashing (Which it does plenty of) but because Gladwell chooses to insert a message into the book. I'm not against it and I don't want to turn others off because I think the book is still a good product. It was very obvious to me that the tone of the book changes and vears from an exploration into a dissertation on certain unfortunate facts of life that effect everyone. But the tone and message do make the argument very one sided and doesn't even begin to consider the other point of view. Both books are good reads and will not hurt you or make you feel like a lemming, unless of course you let yourself feel that way. I believe that's why so many people have left very terrible reviews here. They feel betrayed by themselves because they expected to get a better read. The venom is unneccasary... Move on. I do suspect though that Gladwell will make a trilogy and will tie all together. Hence Gladwell's Journey.",
            "The premise of the book is that \"instinct\" or hunches can be formed by a first glance (thin slices) of information inputs; this data sometimes is enough as our subconscience focuses on what is really important in that decision long before we can clearly articulate our analysis of the data inputs. On that note, the key thin slice of information you need to know is: don't buy the book as that is the entire message. The remainder of the book is a host of wonderful examples, but no concrete further pertinent information is offered.Early in the book, the author suggests that sometimes the hunches can go awry, but \"for a very specific and consistent set reasons, and those reasons can be identified and understood. It is possible to learn when to listen to that powerful onboard computer and when to be wary of it.\"If the purpose of the book was to highlight and divulge in a clear and precise manner \"when to listen... and when to be wary of it\", it would be a very useful tool to enhance decision making. Having failed to offer this, the book fails to give the reader any real value beyond what we instintively already know.Ironic, isn't it? We have enough information about the book very rapidly: it is entertaining but lacking value.",
            "-----It is interesting to look at all the Amazon reviews of this book. They are so divergent. Some reviewer love it, others hate it. Why? My own response may be suggestive. I liked his writing. He has a talent to take abstract academic psychological concepts and turn them into interesting ideas and examples the lay reader can easily read and understand. In this way, he is similar to Antonio Damasio who popularized neurology (Descartes' Error) and Carl Sagan who did this for astronomy. But there is a problem. Unlike these authors, he is not an expert in the field. They were accepted by their professions--an outstanding neurologist or an exceptional astronomer. He is accepted only as an outstanding writer.-----His knowledge of the subject matter comes from interviews with some experts in the field or reading some books. But he doesn't have the years of experience examining scientific journals, considering counter evidence, or applying the scientific method to test his hypothesis. As a result, his book reaches some basic conclusions that are not only erroneous, but many professionals consider being the exact opposite of what they should be.-----True, our brains do quickly organize data into patterns; he calls them \"blinks or \"thin-slicing,\" others call them schematas or gestaltens. True, these blinks may prove to be correct. But equally true they may be false. The question is, how do we determine which ones are true and which ones are false? We can't tell from the blinks themselves. The false ones feel just as strong, just as certain, as the true ones. The only way we can tell is by collecting data and analyzing how accurate our past blinks have been.-----Accepting our blinks uncritically can cause mountains of problems. The vast majority of patients I have treated accepted a phony intuition uncritically: the four-time divorced woman who kept marrying alcoholics because her intuition told her he was Mr. Right; the panicked adolescent who intuited that there was great danger whenever he left his house, the suspicious business man who \"blinked\" that people who talked in whispers were plotting against him. The first step for all these people was to challenge their instant perceptions. It would be helpful if this book clearly said, \"Don't trust your blinks,\" instead of hinting at the opposite.",
            "The book Blink is nothing more than a collection of anecdotes about snap judgements and decision making without thinking. The problem is that there is very little science or other supporting evidence to back up or explain the phenomena that are the subject of this book. The book is more pop science than a work of serious study.God forbid if more people think without thinking. We have enough of that as it is in business, government, and other areas where real thinking and leadership are required.",
            "Here's a glimpse from the recent NYT article: The Gladwell Effect. \"For all their resonance and success, Gladwell's books have also been criticized, most often for demonstrating, or encouraging, lazy thinking. In a scathing review in The New Republic, the judge and author Richard Posner found \"Blink\" full of banalities and contradictions, \"written like a book intended for people who do not read books.\" Some social scientists have also been unimpressed. \"I think what he leaves people with is not that scientists are doing some interesting work, but that Malcolm Gladwell has a couple of good ideas,\" said Thomas Schelling, who shared last year's Nobel in economic science and did pioneering research on the \"tipping point,\" a formulation that originally referred to the point at which white families would leave a neighborhood after black families began moving in.\"The introduction points out that college students know in the first second how well they will like a teacher. And this is a good thing?! Someone is writing an apt take off: Blank: The Power of Not Thinking at All...",
            "This is a great book for anyone intersted in the mind, thinking, and decision making. It is not exhaustive in these areas, but entertaining and thought provoking. It is filled with interesting studies and info. that make you think and consider your ability to \"blink.\" If I were to rename this book, I'd call it \"Instinct and Behavior: A Few Case Examples.\"I really did like the book. It made me think about my own instincts and unconscious thought and how real the hypothesis forwarded in this book may be. I am still considering it.I did not like two particular things about the book: 1) It never really tells us how to get a hold of our unconscious thinking, i.e. to be better at it; 2) A few of the case studies seemed... not on target (i.e. they required insightful discoveries to see their applicability).So, if you want some fun information about the mind (in the form of case studies) and our split-second decision capacity, buy it. If you want to walk away a better instinctual decision maker, with great understanding of the human psyche, don't buy it.To fully enjoy this book, INTROSPECTIVE READING AND UNDERSTANDING IS NECESSARY. Don't like to have to think about what your reading to understand it? Run from this book.",
            "I thought The Tipping Point was a great book. Entertaining, enlightening and relevant.My pitch on this one: \"We intuitively 'know' in our gut what's right or accurate 'at first blink'. And more often than not, that reaction is accurate more than 50% of the time. The more we 'think' about something or get emotionally involved, the less accurate our 're-thinking' it is. Professionals who have lots of experience in a particular area of expertise develop an ability to process very complex concepts or situations unconsciously and are right more often than wrong.\"Malcolm goes on to cite plenty of entertaining examples around art forgery (pros who spot a fake but can't tell you why it is), marriage consultants (who predict with over 90% accuracy whether a couple will be together), gamblers (who change their betting behavior before they consciously know what's wrong), a tennis critic (who could predict a fault before the ball hit the racket) and plenty of others that are interesting.After reading a couple chapters, my wife said, \"I call it a woman's intuition\"...no big deal.I can't say that's all there is to the story, but there's some truth in the comment.The bottom line: it's a fun, fast read and it's good for some entertaining conversation with friends and business associates.The good- Very Entertaining- Well-written- Malcolm is a great story-teller (or has an awesome editor or both)- The stories are relevant and interesting- He boils some complex ideas down into easy to understand stories- As a consultant, it's an easy book to recommend to others- Very good conversation materialThe not-so-good- It's not a \"how to\" nor do I feel that there significant distinctions or lessons that can be applied to your real or business life - adjust your expectations now- It's \"kinda mushy\" - I'd categorize this a \"Pulpy Pop Business Book\"- Not as revealing or useful in a business environment as \"The Tipping Point\"My \"Blink\":- I'm betting he got a multi-million dollar advance on this book- If you like Dan Brown's books (The Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons), you'll like this. Note that there's no connection between the content, author or material here. It's just an instinctive reaction- Malcolm needs to write another book as great as \"The Tipping Point\" or he won't be seeing another big advance like this one.All in all, it's a nice \"Chinese dinner\". Great tasting, enjoyable but I felt hungry an hour after the last bite.",
            "I am sad to say how disappointed I was with Blink. After reading Tipping point I expected this book to be another phenomenal book, making the complex simple. Alas it did what Einstien warned us about \"Make things as simple as possible and not any simpler.\"This book tried to argue that we need to let go of the logical thought and analytical thinking in favor of gut feelings. \"Think\" by Michael LeGault is a rebuttal to this book and I think it is worth reading in conjunction with Blink. Why? because implications of pattern based thinking (whcih is how our brain processes information at the fundamental level) and what Blink argues for, is deeply powerful, yet is a fundamental imperative to use the carefully balanced approach in decision making that uses instinct and mixes it with analytical thinking. Without this balance our society can be regressing towards middle ages as opposed to advancing towards the next creative era of growth.",
            "You have got to be kidding! Tedious anecdotal \"stuff\". It saddens me to think THIS was a best seller and I actually bought it!",
            "Malcolm Gladwell understands the concept of writing for the reader; he is able to empathize with the layman while keeping the book informative and interesting.It is a very interesting book detailing the power of the brain that we never knew existed; he writes mainly about the subconscious actions of our brain and how it effects our conscious actions without our even realizing it.Gladwell does his best to introduce novel concepts in simple terms so that everyone (even those with no prior exposure to neuroscience or psychology) can understand it without having to go back to re-read sections at a time. Although he writes about a relatively new subject, his colloquial style is unassuming and modest. His master prose and story-telling ability help to relate these new ideas to real-life stories. It is important to say that all ideas proposed in Blink are theories; it is more speculation based on insight and analysis than hard facts.Blink is about rapid cognition, about the kind of thinking that happens in the blink of an eye. More generally, it is a book about intuition and how people harness this power or how it causes situations to go awry. Gladwell uses a variety of real-life examples to push his point, spanning from gambling to speed dating to police situations. The overall theme is that the mind can subconsciously understand a situation before the individual can consciously decode it; the mind can also erroneously conceive the details of a situation due to pre-determined associations made through society. He quickly jumps between stories as he discusses various topics such as thin slices, priming, expertise, selective processing and mind reading. Gladwell's style of writing may leave the reader slightly stranded as the reader attempts to figure out why he tells the stories he does. He leaves the reader curious about the association between concepts and stories until he finally and unexpectedly explains the relationship. Gladwell's great skill has always been to take mostly mundane, unnoticed topics and bringing them to public attention in a way that makes us wonder how we never noticed it before.Gladwell at times strays from the topic of his own book simply because he wants to tell another interesting story. He stretches to connect some examples of theories to the overall theme of rapid cognition. For example, his analysis of the Coke vs. Pepsi question boils down to the \"sip vs. whole-can-drinking.\" This has nothing to do with rapid cognition but rather of first impressions. To his credit, he explains his ideas of why first impressions are rapid cognition but only relates them to first impressions of people, and not to the senses. Another topic where he strays from the overall theme is over analysis. It seems that instead of trying to prove the power of rapid cognition and thin slicing, he tries to prove that over analyzing in certain situations is more detrimental than good. This notion of proving one idea wrong in order to show that another idea is correct is at best childish.Gladwell gets his information from many researchers focused expressly on the topics he writes about. While it is clear that the researchers are doing very prominent work, Gladwell instead spends a lot of writing space describing his interactions with the researchers. It almost seems as if he is infatuated more with the person performing the research than the ideas behind the research itself. In some cases (but not all), the background of the research is prudent and helps to clarify why the researcher is individually important to the story.Blink ends in a very abrupt manner. There is no summarization or recap of ideas as the reader would expect. There isn't even a formal conclusion about rapid congnition at the end. Instead, it seems as if Gladwell just decided he was done writing and stopped. The book would do much better with a formal ending that summarizes the broad range of concepts explored in Blink.Malcolm Gladwell chooses great topics to explore in Blink and has great enthusiasm in his writing and story telling; however, many of his arguments for the topic are left unfinished and sometimes seems to be mere speculation. I highly recommend reading this book to be introduced to new ideas of subconscious levels of thinking but be cautious. Not everything in the book is fact and further self-driven research can find more information based on scientific research.",
            "Blink has two important messages - First it breaks the news that we are all capable of making snap decisions and yet make them right.At the same time it repeatedly alerts us to the danger of judging a person by his mere appearance or outlook.It essentially differentiates between objects and human beings - all examples where snap decisions can be trusted without doubt deal with objects only, however any decisions involving humans are complicated and need more prudence and experience to make the right move.The author effectively promotes and puts the power of a superhero in the palm of our hands.He tells you about superman's x-ray vision and brings home the idea that each one of us can see through the book cover and judge its actual content to some considerable accuracy. Though, it strongly negates the idea of sixth sense and focuses on case studies and examples which every person can relate to and hope to achieve.One of the key achievements of the author is bringing forth real life instances where people with some relevant experience have proved the ability to make snap decisions and make them right.It is an effort to explain the heart and soul of a human being and how important it is in judging situations and enables us to think in a blink.It also guides us through the dark side of snap decisions - how to hone our snap decisions without being affected by our underlying prejudices. Everything that glitters might be gold but that greatly depends on an individual's definition of gold. This is also the part that needs more practice runs and trials before trusting our blink abilities wholly.The author bundles up the message that humans are not objects and therefore should not be treated as such or classified into groups, races or nationalities. To make the right snap decisions, one has to free his mind from bias and prejudice and all other factors that may have a positive or negative impact on our decision.The larger theme of the story is about understanding human nature, dealing with a person's underlying racial discrimination and yet toning one's mind to think in a blink - but Malcolm never tries to make it a \"lesson,\" it's simply part of the world he describes.In a just world an innocent man should be found not guilty. But if you want to know what this has to do with a 2 second decision or the strategy of war in Iraq, you'll have to read the book!In all, the book inspired me to check out the Aeron chair and download one of kenna's songs: Freetime.",
            "On the face of it, journalists leave us academics in the shade. They get to speak and write authoritatively on a vast range of subjects, versus our pathetic little micro-specializations. Moreover, they do so in the public domain, adding the luster of \"public intellectual\". They often do this with zero academic qualifications, or indeed anything we would recognize as \"knowledge\" in our mean-spirited ways. Finally, they get paid extremely well for their trade books, particularly if they already have day jobs, and can hold those jobs without anything we call \"qualifications\" in our jealous little minds.Why then is journalism of \"popular science\" nature often held in such contempt ? this book's fundamental thesis on \"thin slicing\", the tautological idea that suitably attuned experts are, in fact, expert, relates to cognitive science. This subject studies mind as an informational system; it incorporates elements of philosophy, psychology, linguistics, AI, ethnoscience and - increasingly - neuroscience and other biological sciences. However, perhaps a suitably equipped journalist can just raid the area and - Blink! - all is made clearSo we get a range of examples, well-commented on already. To see the real argument, de Sousa's 1980's textThe Rationality of Emotion (Bradford Books)is still worth looking at; it is described on P.63 ff ofThe Search for Mind: A New Foundation for Cognitive Science. Gladwell's \"Blink\" book is close to being the worst and most intellectually irresponsible book this reviewer has ever read, and his only regret is that the rating system here seems to force him to give a star.Se&aacute;n O Nuall&aacute;in Ph.D. 4u Meitheamh (san tSin 35 Bealtaine) 2009",
            "Gladwell laid out 3 objectives at the beginning of the book: (i) to convince the reader that \"decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately\"; (ii) to answer the question of when to trust our instincts vs. when to be wary of them; and (iii) to convince the reader that snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled.Point (i) was delivered brilliantly - a very pleasurable read. On point (ii), we got a very limited answer and only in the Afterword section - quite unsatisfying. On point (iii), Gladwell doesn't have an answer to the bigger question of HOW we can make educated and controlled snap judgments.Perhaps there are simply no straight answers for (ii) and (iii), but the way the book was set up, one can't help but feel a bit let down at the end of it.",
            "I don't understand what the rage is about this book. I found it to be disjointed and lacking in real actionable or interesting information. We should study Gladwell in terms of how he has somehow managed to have an entire generation of savvy business leaders depend on what he says when his own real experience in leading a business is nil.In terms of marketing, and leadership I would recommend \"Beyond Buzz: The Next Generation of Word Of Mouth Marketing\" - there's an amazing amount of actionable and easy to understand applicable ideas in terms of behavior, business, customers and making meaning instead of buzz.Beyond Buzz: The Next Generation of Word-of-Mouth Marketing",
            "Once again, Malcolm Gladwell has written a series of intriguing chapters on the human decision-making process, but without a unifying principle--and that's hard to find with such a fiendishly complex topic--it doesn't hang together as a book. The book felt too long as I waded through a number of real life situations without a punch line; at the same time the book felt way too short to adequately cover some of the issues raised. The chapter on the Iraq war games was fascinating and scandalous--did the Pentagon really rig the game to produce a stated result? (I guess I shouldn't be surprised!) There's a great book there alone. Another example was the tragic Amadou Diallo killing in NYC several years ago--Gladwell's treatment of this tragic and complex event seemed superficial and unoriginal.I had the same problem with \"The Tipping Point.\" Gladwell writes very well, but he's more the journalist than analyst. He has good points, although not new ones--we often make decisions at lightning speed for reasons we don't understand; too much data can overwhelm; words rarely convey the full meaning of what a person is thinking and feeling at any one time; much, if not most, of communication is non-verbal. But you can't fit all of that into one book.",
            "Which is better, thinking deep and hard or making snap judgements on instinct? Gladwell makes the case for quick thinking in his book of thinking without thinking. Gladwell argues that in many cases - emergency heart attack diagnosis being a good example - too much information not only doesn't help a bit, but actually makes decisions worse.Humans are very capable of making quick, unconscious decisions - some brain damage or other disorders prove that, when that capability is lost. According to Gladwell we should pay more heed to our unconscious, as it often helps to make good decisions fast. However, it's not that simple: quick thinking without thinking leads to prejudice and trouble, if one is not careful.Using lots of real-life examples, Gladwell makes a coherent case. The book is quite shallow, but that's what you should expect from a short bestseller like this. Blink, like Gladwell's previous success,The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference, is swiftly read. While it never delves deep or really satisfies the reader, it certainly succeeds in being thought-provoking and entertaining.",
            "The content was fascinating and the writing was engaging (though with more vulgarity than was necessary.) However, the book promised in the beginning promised to teach the reader how to make use of the principles. Perhaps I was reading into it more than it said, but that is what I understood the promise to be. At the end, I was left hanging. It was the work of a journalist, who discussed what others have done, but ended abruptly with no usefulness.(This was from the audiobook version.)",
            "The strangest thing about Blink! Is the contradiction between the contents and the cover. Did any of the people quoted on the back cover actually read the book? (Hint: Blurb writers rarely read the books they comment on.) The quotes rave about the power of snap decisions, but Gladwell is much more ambivalent. He's particularly concerned with how racial stereotypes misinform judgments, so much so that Gladwell finds he has an intuitively negative opinion of African Americans -- despite being a black man. I suspect he spent some time thinking about when he was going to introduce his Jamaican mother; the book itself is an experiment in the power of framing and bias.Contrary to the back cover, and the subtitle of \"the power of thinking without thinking\", this is a book about both the power and the treachery of the unspeaking mind. On the one hand we have powerful non-verbal detection of deception and emotional context, on the other hand we have unconscious bias based on height and ethnicity, the election of George ... err .. Warren Harding and the shooting of Amadou Diallo.I'd been expecting a superficial justification of impulsive thinking, so I was pleasantly surprised to find Gladwell's Blink! is a much deeper work. On the other hand, the book is also somewhat muddled. Once Gladwell moved away from domains in which natural selection has build powerful non-verbal tools, such as deception, mating and eating, his examples of good impulsive analysis became much less persuasive. The \"red team\" commander's success seemed to owe much more to correct and measured analysis than impulsive decisions (I'd read the story before by the way. The US military needs to retire a lot of generals.). The Cook County MI algorithm story is about the superiority of an analytic decision tree over both analytic human reasoning and non-verbal impressions. I couldn't tell what the Diallo story was trying to communicate, I think he was saying that under high stress situations human reasoning collapses (the autism connection is highly speculative and has no biological foundation). That's certainly true, but hardly novel.In other cases I had a \"Blink\" type suspicion that we was cherry-picking and shading anecdotes. I'm particularly suspicious that there was more to the Cook County story than we were told -- it would be very odd for a test to be so sensitive and specific that prior probability of disease was irrelevant. In an afterword he introduces new research findings that contradict the simplistic models in the early book; that's commendable but it doesn't make the book more cohesive.I think Gladwell lost out by omitting an evolutionary context to human thinking -- a choice that may reveal his biases. An evolutionary approach to cognition explains why the \"silent mind\" can do so well with decisions lizards, birds and primates evolved around, such as mating, eating, fighting and deceiving. It also explains why the non-verbal mind can make terrible mistakes when evaluating CEOs, presidents, or cell phones. He could have connected the evolution of mind with his thesis experts do best when they combine the silent mind with formal symbolic analysis (words).I did learn one or two new things. I was impressed by the research on how easy it is to alter emotional state through priming methods. Maybe those days when everyone around me seems to be driving badly are the results of some particularly noxious talk radio show.Ultimately Gladwell comes across, to me, as suspicious of the intuitive mind. I think he decides that non-experts should \"trust\" their intuition in domains where natural selection operates, but that even there they need to identify and adjust for bias based on appearance, gender, ethnicity, race, etc. Domain experts do best when they combine non-verbal intuition with analytic reasoning; they can use the intuitive input as a guide to developing a rational and defensible decision (something non-experts are said to have great difficulty with).That sounds like a plausible path. When making expert decisions in the non-primeval world, write down that initial \"Blink!\" impression -- but don't trust it. Adjust for bias and use it as the basis for a time limited and bounded analysis by translating it into a defensible rationalization. Then attack the rationalization. If it survives, then credit the silent mind. If it dies, recognize the failure of the paleolithic mind in a technocentric century.",
            "Well, as a huge fan of Gladwell's last book, The Tipping Point, I was excited last week to finally get my hands on his new effort: Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking. This time around Gladwell's basic thesis is that often snap judgements (what he calls \"thin slicing\") can be more accurate than well researched, careful analysis. Gladwell uses many examples (most are interesting) to demonstrate this behavior such as determining when art is faked, sizing up car buyers, picking presidential candidates and determining the characteristics of a person by observing their living space. This has always been Gladwell's talent: taking just-under-the-radar topics and bringing them into the public's view through great journalism and storytelling.Gladwell is also careful to examine the flipside of this phenomenon: the times when \"thin slicing\" misleads us or gives us the wrong results. For instance, he presents examples where the mind works based on biases that don't necessarily enter the realm of conscious thought, but are nevertheless there (age, race, height, and so on).It's a great topic and Gladwell sets it up with some wonderful examples, but then the book begins to have problems. First, the book is a little too anecdotal. Anyone who has ever had a 200-level psych class knows that what looks like cause and effect may be accounted for by an independent variable that wasn't considered (e.g., concluding cancer rates are higher in some area of the country because of pollution, when in fact the area has higher smoking rates as well). Given this, I found that too often conclusions are made on basic handwaving, or that important aspects of studies are not mentioned. For instance, Gladwell describes a study were observers are asked to determine certain characteristics (such as truthfulness, consciensciousness, etc.) of students by observing their dorm rooms; but, never does he mention how exactly one would determine these characteristics of individuals in a scientific manner for comparison. Such omissions leave the reader a little less than convinced.Nevertheless, even with this flaw the first third of the book supports the thesis and makes for the usual entertaining reading; but things derail from there. The examples start to seem more peripheral: a rogue commander beating the conventional forces in a war game exercise, an artist known as Kenna who apparently should have made it big but didn't (why this example is interesting I've yet to figure out), and some rehash about coke vs pepsi from one of his older articles.By the end of the book the whole thing derails into examples that just don't seem appropriate for the topic. Sure a study of why Pepsi always does better than Coke in blind tastes tests is interesting (and you can read his article on this without buying the book on Gladwell's web site), but does a study of \"sips\" vs \"whole-can drinking\" - people prefer sweet for sips (Pepsi) - really say something about unconscious rapid cognition?One of Gladwell's greatest strengths is in recognizing interesting things, and then bringing them into conscious awareness so we actually realize these things are happening (whether it be tipping points or rapid cognition). I think he's partly achieved that in this book, but it doesn't come together the way the Tipping Point does. One gets the idea that this topic may have been better handled in an article rather than a full blown book.",
            "The mistake was too try and get all of these wild animals onto the same boat. The book a series of semi-socio-scientific articles on insight and intuition. It is not a cohesive theory.The writing is enjoyable - I read the most of it in a single plane flight. Some of the insights provide building blocks for understanding how certain professionals (people who practice a subject or skill for many years) are able to develop an additional sense about things -- gamblers, art curators, policemen. They are essentially seeing something that doesn't register at the conscious-level but provides them a gut-feel about the thing. Actually, I should say that these articles are how this MIGHT be happening - it's more speculation based on the diverse theories of a number of different researchers. Individually the stories and ideas are believable. Unfortuately, Gladwell fumbles in trying take them into some unified theory that is comprehensible let alone cohesive -- at times you wonder \"where is he going with this?\". Without that thread the indivudal beads get lost and fade into memory as clever ideas...and not much more. Without confidence in the grand idea, the individual pieces begin to feel simply exploratory. It's a shame because there are some remarkable ideas. He's a good documenter of curiousities of research (sort of like a Ken Burns is to historical things) so the storytelling is good enough for entertainment. Another reviewer likened it the addage about Chinese food, tasty but hungry an hour later. I agree. Flawed but still some interesting ideas to puzzle over.",
            "I bought the book before a flight after reading the adulatory comments on the front and back.It started well, with the premise that the subconsious forms a conclusion long before the consious mind is aware of it. I suppose it is obvious, but he makes the point well.From there things get a bit lost. Reading along I soon realised that I was nearing the end and the number of pages left for a profound and all-encompassing conclusion was rapidly diminishing.Unfortunately it never came.This is a very short book which promises much but delivers little. I hope that the author will follow up with something more worthy of the title. It is really just a collection of true stories, mostly about racial or sexual prejudice, which leave a bad taste in the mouth. Each story is drawn out as well, a little like the History Channel.I'm sure that there is a good book somewhere in this subject matter, but I can't for the life of me reconcile the reviews that this book has received (Compelling, Astonishing, Brilliant) with my experience. Maybe they only read the first chapter. Maybe I missing something.Since reading this book I have been looking around and found this one:The Genie Within: Your Subconcious Mind, how It Works And How To Use It (Paperback)Maybe this would be a better choice for this subject matter.",
            "I am a great admirer of Malcolm Gladwell's writing, having read him for years in \"The New Yorker\" and loving \"The Tipping Point,\" his earlier book. But \"Blink\" is no \"Tipping Point.\"The idea here is that people often have intuitive first impressions that are more valid and valuable than carefully considered, well-thought-out, researched conclusions. Except when they aren't, because first impressions of individuals, for example, can be clouded by (and Gladwell even discusses this) such matters as attractiveness, gender, race -- and even height (what Gladwell calls the \"Warren Harding\" error). And how are we to know when our quick-as-a-blink reaction is valid and when it isn't? Well, that's the problem with the book. Ever experienced love-at-first-sight and then realized the person wasn't really everything you thought s/he was...?This entire book flies in the face of an excellent article Gladwell wrote in 2000 called \"The New-Boy Network\" [...] about how worthless the typical job interview is (because it relies too much on gut impressions) and how \"structured interviews\" are the only worthwhile ones (an excerpt from the article: \"This interviewing technique is known as \"structured interviewing,\" and in studies by industrial psychologists it has been shown to be the only kind of interviewing that has any success at all in predicting performance in the workplace. In the structured interviews, the format is fairly rigid. Each applicant is treated in precisely the same manner. The questions are scripted. The interviewers are carefully trained, and each applicant is rated on a series of predetermined scales.\")Even examples he uses in this book are not very on-target, such as the Red/Blue military exercise he spends a considerable amount of time discussing. He implies repeatedly that the victory of the Reds was due to thin-slicing and their quick judgments, but by his own description a lot of well-thought-out strategic decisions about communications, etc., really were at the heart of the victory, not intuitive decisions made in the blink of an eye.On the other site of the intuition vs. analysis coin, a very good read is Michael Lewis's \"Moneyball.\" Central to that book, with applications well beyond its baseball setting, is the realization that the gut reactions of seasoned baseball scouts are often unreliable, being clouded by how a player looks rather than his actual on-field accomplishments. A more analytical approach has helped Oakland make the playoffs repeatedly with a salary a third (now a quarter) that of the Yankees -- and also was at the heart of general manager Theo Epstein's player moves that helped the Red Sox win the World Series.Gladwell certainly loves the social sciences, and runs all over the landscape discussing various experiments, theories, etc., but it doesn't really come together here like it did in \"The Tipping Point,\" or in many of his articles. My \"thin slice\" (as Gladwell would say): a disappointment.",
            "There are a number of writers and reporters out there who never fail to impress me with their skill in gathering and presenting information and at the same time never fail to stun me with foolish conclusions. Malcom Gladwell, whose writing graces the pages of the New Yorker, is one such writer. He is such an excellent reporter and writes such beautiful prose that his readers seem to swallow even his most dubious and unjustified conclusions.Perhaps it's simply a consequence of his narrow education, but Gladwell manages to present the grossly obvious as if it were a brilliant insight while at the same time making inferences that are just this side of nonsensical. In this he reminds me of William Greider, whose \"Secrets of the Temple\", although the best history and description of the US Federal Reserve system ever written, in full of nonsensical conclusions, i.e., that inflation helps fuel economic recoveries. Tell that to Jimmy Carter.Gladwell's earlier book, \"The Tipping Point\", postulated that various phenomena take off once a critical point has been reached. Now put that way, it sounds profoundly obvious, and it is. Ice freezes at a critical temperature. Water boils at 100C. And so on. But Gladwell also accepts, at face value, a number of sociological theories that are without theoretical base, or even data, other than some casual observations. He doesn't, for example, touch on graph theory, which &lt;em>does&lt;/em> have some bearing on the spread of phenomena.In this book, his insight is that sometimes snap judgements are better than well-thought out ones. Again I'm reminded of Samuael Johnson's comment to a writer that \"Your manuscript is both good and original. But the part that is good is not original, and the part that is original is not good.\" There is a good deal of recent research that looks at the processing between pereception and cognitive awareness, but when Gladwell touches on this he gets both his anatomy and his function wrong. Much of his discussion- like the fact that voters often choose attractive political candidates regardless of their qualifications- has more to do with factors other than the immediate perceptions he's trying to make a case for.I still often enjoy reading Gladwell in the New Yorker- his recent piece on drug prices was a fine bit of reporting, even if his conclusions were not of the same caliber. But his books don't seem to be in the same category.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell is one of the most brilliant non- fiction writers working today. He is a researcher and a thinker who looks into social phenomena and makes connections between diverse activities and areas of life in startling and interesting ways. While he is most known for the concept of ' the tipping point' I personally found his most remarkable essay to be on key figures in human social networks, and the way one individual may connect hundreds of even thousands different kinds of people together. In this present work which I have read the British edition of he writes about what he calls 'adaptive unconscious' about processes of mind and decision that determine much of our action in life. He opens with a consideration of the Getty Museum's considering the purchase of what seemed to be a great new discovery, a statue of a certain kind called a 'kourous. The Getty went to the greatest experts in scientifically evaluating the materials of the statue and they come up with it as genuine. However when the Getty showed the stature to people who live in the world of art history most of them instinctively recoiled from it. They made the kind of ' blink' split - second decision which bypassed their consciousness. They proved to be right. Gladwell goes on to consider ' thin- slicing' decision making in other areas, that is decision-making which is based on a very small set of experience. In his second chapter he looks at the work of a psychologist John Gottman who has developed a method of predicting whether a couple will eventually divorce through noting certain qualities revealed in a fifteen - minute conversation between them. Stonewalling, criticizing are two of the factors attended to but the key one is the degree of contempt one of the partners may have for another. But for Gladwell the focus is on understanding that it does not take a prolonged process of consciously investigating and collecting data but rather a quick- thin- slice evaluation to get to the truth of the situation. Gladwell investigates other kinds of situations in which in one case a firefighter, in another a Vietnam War veteran and Marine officer show a kind of instinctive ' right action' which would not be possible had they talked or thought too much at the wrong time and confused themselves in the process. Gladwell writes of very interesting characters , finds people of extraordinary abilities even when it comes to selling cars or tasting food. He centers on non- conventional figures who have in one way or another extraordinary gifts in ordinary life. In one chapter he looks at the diagnosis of heart- attacks in emergency room and shows how a method a researcher tried to push and had rejected for years has enabled quick, life- saving diagnosis. In this situation too he shows how too much information, too much conscious rehashing of data can interfere with a kind of quick- decision making a kind of ' in a blink' judgment. Here however it should be pointed out that Gladwell insists that in many areas of life it is only because there has been prior training, study, rehearsal that such wise- snap judgment is possible. All in all this is a richly informative and highly interesting work, a very pleasurable read.It will take more than one blink to read, but it will be worth it.",
            "This is one of the most fascinating books I have read in some time. The book centers on the concept of how fast we really do make judgments, called \"thin slicing\", and how deeper analysis can sometimes provide less information than more. It is all about cognitive speed.The concept of \"thin slicing\" is dissected and explained. What I found fascinating, and also common sense, is that we process information on a subconscious level, \"behind the door\", and process so holistically that to over analyze can actually hinder our ability to make decisions.Several key points are applicable in business. One of the in depth studies looked at a military leader who was particularly successful. One of his more poignant observations was that a great leader needs to let the people do their work. When deciding how often to follow up \"you are diverting them, now they are looking upward instead of downward. You are preventing them from resolving the situation\". (Page 118) Further \"allowing people to operate without having to explain themselves constantly ... enables rapid cognition\" (Page 119). It seems that most micro-management actually prevents people from successful decision making.Another strange phenomenon occurs when we try and explain how we come to some conclusions. It seems that the more we try to analyze how we come to some conclusions the less reliable they become.The ability to absorb and detect minute changes in facial expressions allows us to essentially \"read minds\" if we pay attention. There are several chapters on how reliable we can be in predicting behavior with very little information.Overall, this book is so well written that I had a hard time putting it down. My only compliant, and it is a minor one, is that the book just ends. No summary or wrap up, just \"boom\", it's over. However, that is more a testament to how engaging the book is I suppose. Highly recommended!",
            "This book suffers from numerous problems. The first is that while it claims to be about \"the power of thinking without thinking,\" this is only one of three ideas that are discussed. The failure to mention the other ideas in the title might have been acceptable if they were mentioned explicitly in the text, but it is unclear that Gladwell realizes the distinction. The second problem is that the book is made up of six distinct essays, and they have been sloppily edited to produce a book that is simultaneously disjoint and repetitive. Though perhaps the second problem is really just a symptom of the third problem, that Gladwell's style is painfully repetitive to begin with. Gladwell does not simply beat dead horses, he beats the dust into which he has reduced their carcasses. The fourth problem is that towards the end of the book Gladwell goes off on a tangent about \"situational autism\" that is both poorly motivated and very likely to offend the autistic community. And finally, rather than having an introduction and conclusion that tie the book together, these sections present whole new situations; the conclusion in particular seems largely unrelated to the rest of the book.The book has four points. First, is that the human mind has an impressive ability to process information at an unconscious level very quickly. For instance, by listening to a brief snippet of a doctor speaking, even if the recording is digitally altered so that all you can hear is the tone, you can very accurately determine whether the doctor has good bedside manner. Similarly, by watching a few seconds of a college professor's lecture, even with the sound turned off, you can make a remarkably accurate determination of whether the professor is a good lecturer.The second point is that this ability often leads us astray. Our unconscious can be shown to harbor prejudices against blacks, women, and others, and these prejudices are bad for both us and society. And on a less socially relevant note, people consistently prefer the taste of liquor that comes in fancy bottles. The book gives absolutely no advice about how to improve our unconscious's attitudes towards either minorities or conventional packaging of foodstuffs.Without explicitly mentioning it, the book points out the importance of making decisions based on relevant information, rather than large quantities of irrelevant data. The best example of this is given in the introduction. An apparently ancient Greek statue is analyzed with all sorts of fancy chemistry equipment, and the lab technicians come back and say that the marble is indeed from an ancient Greek quarry and that the surface of the marble has a chemical composition that is usually the result of centuries of weathering. On the other hand, any art historian worth his salt can tell you that the feet of the statue are carved in a style never seen in any other Greek statue. While the information from the chemists seems more concrete (their equipment costs more), the relevant fact here is the style of carving in the feet-the statue is a modern forgery.Finally, the book talks about ways to improve decision making under intense time pressure, for instance in a military engagement or police shootout. The conclusion, not surprisingly, is that practice making split-second decisions is important. Also, if you can slow down the pace of the engagement in order to allow yourself more time, you should do so, but if slowing down gives your opponents a greater advantage, you shouldn't.If you have made it through this review, there is certainly no need to read the book. Every idea Gladwell had has been summarized and clarified here. Which should really make you wonder how he stretched the book past 20 pages, let alone 200!",
            "One anecdotal story after another with a weak conclusion (which was yet another anecdotal story) attempting to tie it all up left me flat. Here's my summary: All you need to know is \"Don't judge a book by its cover.\" well... unless you're an expert of some sort. In that case, you can trust your initial reaction, because you're probably right. Well... unless you've paid attention to the wrong things... in which case you are proabably wrong. So, Don't judge a book by its cover - ESPECIALLY THIS BOOK!! You will see it on the bestseller list and assume it is worth reading (as The Tipping Point arguably was) rather than a weak, seemingly rushed attempt to ride on the coattails of his earlier success.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell is a \"gatekeeper.\" In his book, Blink, he opens the gate to a room of self-discovery - a room that allows the reader, perhaps for the first time, to realize that our actions and judgments often are not as \"objective\" as we might think. Mr. Gladwell, through a series of examples and stories, explains that we each have our own \"programming\" - dare I say \"prejudices\" - about how we (and the cultures we grow up in) judge and respond to things we \"see\" and \"know to be true\".He also says there are other more benign, untainted impressions that come to us in the \"blink\" of an eye. About these untainted impressions he says: \"We don't know where our first impressions come from or precisely what they mean, so we don't always appreciate their fragility.\" Implicitly he suggests that we also don't realize how powerful our \"programming\" is to potentially override and taint those benign and fragile first impressions.Mr. Gladwell provides examples of what some people have done to preserve their \"blink\" experiences and offset their \"pre-programming\" - a fun read - I recommend it.As I was reading through the book, I was reminded of two other books (both of which I highly recommend) by Ariel and Shya Kane. In Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation and Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment, the authors include discussions of human mechanical behaviors - behaviors we absorb from our families and cultures at an early age. They point out that we are mostly unaware of these mechanics and until we become aware of them, they can influence and even \"control\" our behavior and life choices - very eye-opening and easy to read as well!All three of these books are well worth reading - enjoy!",
            "Blink is a collection of amazing stories centered around \"the power to think without thinking.\" Your unconscious mind has come up with a decision quickly, perhaps in seconds, but you may not recognize it consciously for hours or even years later. It's somehwat relatable to a gut feeling; you know something is what it is in your gut but cannot explain why you feel that way. It is a quick and easy book to read. The true stories are written in a well thought out cohesive flow and tend to be inspiring.Why 3 Stars? Stories is all this book is, nothing more, nothing less. If you expect this prior to purchasing the book, it will probably rate higher than 3 stars in your mind. For some reason I was expecting this book to give pointers or guidance on how someone can \"think without thinking\" or, at least, more insight on to how the people in the stories accomplished this. Although the stories are great, I did not feel left with a greater ability to \"think without thinking.\" The book left me further aware that this phenomena can and does happen, but I was already aware of this prior to reading the book.",
            "Malcom Gladwell, a staff writer for the New Yorker magazine, has written a fun little book that attempts to answer the following question: \"Are we capable of making quick, accurate decisions based on very little information by harnessing the power of the subconscious mind?\"When I first picked up this book, I was extremely skeptical. After all, the last thing we need is another dumb pop psychology screed that claims to reveal some shocking new \"secret\" about human nature. However, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.Gladwell's essay-length book is actually quite convincing -- even if you don't buy the whole argument for \"adaptive subconscious reasoning\" and \"thin slicing.\" Fun to read, too. Gladwell illustrates his case with some fascinating anecdotes from the worlds of fine art, pro sports, marriage, medicine, marketing, law enforcement and politics. He underpins his argument with research studies from academic and professional psychology. (Another Dr. Phil he ain't...)So why does this book make certain people so angry? The level of contempt and ridicule for Gladwell on these pages is amazing to me. He's not advocating shallowness or some metaphysical \"eeny meeny chili beenie\" approach to decision making. Rather, he's raising some legitimate points about our ability to reason in a hurry based on very limited information. Works wonders in some situations, and not so well in others.Is \"Blink\" the ultimate cosmic insight into the human psyche? Nope. But it sure is thought-provoking and innovative. Don't miss it.",
            "I'm reading this book now, and I have to say I'm a bit disappointed. Gladwell's a good author, but he has little authority. I suppose I might really buy into this if it were, say, written by an expert in some field... but Gladwell isn't. He's a journalist. It's sort of like- he's not an expert, but he plays one on TV.I looked at the blurb about the author at the end of the book, expecting to see that Gladwell is professor emeritus of (insert esoteric field of expertise here) at (insert over-glorified university here), and on and on and on for the rest of the page and then the name of his golden retriever. But there's only a sentence about him, saying only something like that he writes about science for the New Yorker. The New Yorker's a great magazine, don't get me wrong, but I was hoping for something a little more. Oh well, I guess he doesn't have a golden retriever.Am I just a little bitter that it was his idea to gather up all these other peoples' loosely associated experiences and ideas, package them neatly in a book and get rich off of it before I could? Yeah, okay, I can admit that. I am slightly embittered.But I'll tell you what really gets me. I keep getting fed the same 4-5 sentences and catch phrases over and over and over again, as he tries to pound it in my head that his themes are something more than loosely associated. I'm already very tired of hearing about how much smarter the world's art afficianados are than the stupid scientists that the Getty hired to examine the Greek kouros statue.That's probably more criticism than the book really deserves. It's actually pretty good, and a very fast read. It's not exactly life changing, and it's not exactly coherent. The connections aren't really all there, but it's still something that you are better off having read.",
            "In writing \"Blink\", Malcolm Gladwell writes another masterpiece as a follow-up to his prior book, \"the Tipping Point.\" In brief, \"Blink\" is a book about our decision making processes and what informs them. Gladwell's basic contention is that immediate reactions are often more accurate than those deliberated on for too long, perhaps the origin of the expression TMI, or too much information.At the beginning of the book Gladwell introduces the reader to the concept of \"thin slicing\", a method of profiling that rovides particular effectiveness to those with lots of experience in their field. Without that experience, thin slicing is less useful, and in fact can be quite harmful.Of particular fascination are the pieces on John Gottman's love lab where Gottman can tell, after looking at every frame of an hour of film of married couples talking to one another, whether they'll stay together, and this with 95% accuracy? Wowzer! He also covers a piece on perception and art fraud, one on listening to doctors as a way to predict their potential for being sued, one on the \"power of the glance\" which is an affectation of the alpha-chimp, and a great one on \"speed-dating\" which explores male-female instant attractions. He also gets into one of my favorite subjects, one that explores the inate genetic ability to excel at making sound judgements, on-the-fly, without undergoing emotional crisis if wrong (IMO the mark of a leader around whom others coalesce.)On another level \"Blink\" addresses the decision making difficulties brought on by \"the fog of war\", the stressful conditions under which cops and soldiers are supposed to make calm and insightful choices while undergoing cognitive overload, not to mention the extremes of cognitive dissonance.He proceeds to develop the idea of the \"Warren Harding error', something he calls FAE or the \"fundamental attribution error\" in his previous book, \"the tipping point.\" I immediately thought of Bill Clinton and any number of other charismatic leaders in history who, like Harding, did not emerge with the best historical reputation after being heralded as the next best great new thing.Thin-slicing is all about simplifying complex problems or profiling as it were. It's about finding patterns in chaos. It's about game theory, neuroscience, and snap judgements,...... and the efficay of blind auditions for classical musicians.Gladwell says he wrote the book after the experience of being pulled over by the cops because of his hairdoo. I suspect that his book is borne more of his quest to understand racial discrimination and how to mitigate it as much as is possible in a world of thin-slicing decision makers.As a post-script, this book makes me think of the phrase \"paralysis by analysis\", one that describes the inability of beauracracies to respond less effectively to societal problems. Although never mentioned by Gladwell, the book is an argument for the efficacies of a free market pricing system as a way to run an economy (see \"the road to serfdom\" by Hayek) rather than the top down, command and control methods promulgated by those who advocate bigger government. A terrific read and a thought provoking book. Don't miss it!",
            "Like The Tipping Point, Blink has a very simple point which it elaborates from a variety of perspectives. In this case, the point is that our subconscious mind can integrate small, subtle clues to very quickly make great decisions . . . as long as we have been trained to know what clues to focus on.In developing that simple idea, Mr. Gladwell makes the case for \"going with your gut\" in many instances . . . especially when time is of the essence (such as during emergencies and in combat). He also rescues analysis to show how analysis can train people to know what to look for so they can use their instincts more effectively.But instincts have a downside. Based on conditioning, we make associations that are harmful to ourselves and to others. He recounts how an innocent man became a victim of under trained, over stimulated police officers and how even African-Americans display prejudice against African-Americans.Most of the book is devoted to looking at prejudice and how to overcome it. For those who are interested in that subject, this book will be much more interesting than for those who want to understand how to improve their decision-making.I thought that the book failed to reach the average mark as a book about how to improve decision-making. There's no real guidance for what we can each do to improve our important decisions. We are just left with hope that we can do better. I graded the book up a bit because I liked the insights into racism.I thought the material on branded products was much too long and didn't add anything to what I knew already.Mr. Gladwell writes well, though, so it's mostly a pleasant trip in the book. He makes science more interesting, but leaves a bit too much of the science out to make the results satisfying. He's writing for a dumbed-down audience with science backgrounds at the 8th grade level.The book's opening made me feel like I was really going to learn something. As the book continued, I found myself disappointed compared to the high expectations that the opening set for learning better decision-making practices. As a result, all I got from the book was to pay attention to external clues and my own physiological cues as I react to a situation. I already do that, so I felt that the book didn't really deliver a solid benefit to me beyond teaching me a few new stories about decision makers.",
            "This book is packed full of interesting stories, most of which adhere to the central theme - we have a second mode of thinking. Mr. Gladwell forecefully argues for the relevance of recognising this \"thin-slicing\" mode, showing that it acts whether we choose to recognise it or not. By the end of the book, you most likely will agree with him, and come away with a new understanding of what Oz is doing behind your own personal curtain.That said, some of the stories seem only somewhat relevant to the topic at hand and make the book seem more tangential, taking away focus from the central tenet. Also, we're left at the end with an understanding that we have this new way of thinking, but little idea of what it implies to the larger world. In the end, the book is a collection of compelling anecdotes, a few mind-jarring insights, and some boundless entheusiasm. I recommend it - it'll make you think, in more ways than one.",
            "The premise here is how we make quick decisions with little data; some of these decisions are suprisingly accurate,some, not suprisingly, quite inaccurate. As to the former, there are examples of art historians who can spot well executed frauds at a quick glance and pshycologists who can watch small snippets of spousal conversations and very accurately predict who will or won't be married fifteen years forward. As to the latter, there are examples of how people make bad decisions based on the unconscious use of racial and sexual data. One of the final chapters on how some specialists have learned to read facial gestures using a scientific method by analyzing specific muscle movements is, as I recall, adapted from a more extensive and more interesting article which appeared in the New Yorker several years ago. I would recommend the article over the entire book. When I finished this book after a few hours, I realized there was a lot of filler--some of the stories seemd interesting but not connected to the overall theme. As an example, there is a chapter on a talented singer who, for some reason has not been able to catch on. As I read this, I thought the chapter had little bearing on the subject matter and it seemed to me that Gladwell was using his book to see if he could ignite this singer's career --that is using his audience to see if it could generate a tipping point, the theme of his last book.In all the book has some superficial appeal; it moves around to a range of stories which are not well connected. Some chapters are very interesting without regard to their connection to the overall theme and there is very little information explaining how the \"blink\" phenomenon operates.",
            "In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell suggests that first impressions significantly affect our actions and attitudes in business, dating, and even shopping. He describes the deeply complex concept of implicit cognition in an understandable and applicable way, and while Blink is not the foremost authority on this subject, Gladwell does an excellent job explaining how and why first impressions occur. I would suggest Blink to anyone who is interested in better understanding first impressions and the influence that \"thin-slicing\" has upon how we interact with the world around us.",
            "I was about to buy the book, since the subject and the assumed hypothesis look appealing and interesting. Then my Amazon friend Conan wrote a rather lukewarm review and I delayed the purchase. Then I found the book on my daughter's shelf. Thanks to Conan for saving my money.I borrowed the book and read it. In a blink I thought it was as interesting as it had promised. It took me more than a blink to find out, that it does not deliver: you learn some interesting anecdotes about marriage predictions and about malpractice suits (my other Amazon friend Joe Neuschatz will be interested) and such things, but you never really get nearer to understanding what the alleged special rapid intelligence process really is.The book reminds me a bit of the style of articles in Der Spiegel: journalism well short of science. Sometimes entertaining, but mostly disappointing.",
            "the basic thesis of the book is as follows: intuitive decision making (snap, blink, or unconscious) can be more effective than scientific/analytical decision making IF we train them to be less biased. it's an interesting point, especially in our culture of scientific determinism, but did he have to take 260 pages of anecdotes to argue that? and isn't scientific knowledge/study exists to remove those inherent biases which he so vehemently argues against?it reads like many of the self-help/business strategy books - pseudo-psychology/pseudo-sociology, which has pseudo-valid point(s).more interesting than the theis of the book are the various anecdotes ranging from vic braden being able to predict double faults in professional tennis players to police accident in brooklyn, which are much more entertaining and educational than the premise and the argument of the book. buy it read it if your blink decision tells you to, which probably tells you that you have a very flawed and biased subconscious: like me. but i have a copy for sell if you do.",
            "One of Rudyard Kipling's famous \"Just So Stories\" was about the Elephant's Child, an animal \"filled with 'satiable curtiosity\". Malcolm Gladwell is clearly something of an Elephant's Child himself and his curiosity leads him into exploration of an extraordinary range of interesting and useful phenomena.His \"The Tipping Point\" was a tour de force on how epidemics, ideas and fashions propagate and what causes the sudden take-off that is characteristic of an epidemic - or a fad. From his findings, he drew out many conclusions that are directly useful to business, as well as being interesting in themselves.\"Blink\" is that rare thing - a second book that is as good as the first. It looks at several related phenomena, particularly:* the power of first impressions and what we call intuition, why they are often right and what are the factors that can cause them to be systematically wrong; and* the related power of understanding the use of what he calls 'thin slices' (a limited number of very specific elements that are always present in complex situations or judgments) to improve judgment.The book provides a systematic, fascinating and highly entertaining examination of these phenomena - how they manifest themselves, why they work as they do, why some people are much better than others at making sound judgments from apparently little evidence, what can be done to improve first impression judgments and, perhaps even more important, avoid being led astray by first impressions. It also demonstrates the extraordinary amount of detailed work that is necessary to identify consciously the tiny clues that our subconscious registers, so that they can be turned into useful tools for improving rapid judgment, and helps one to glimpse the awe-inspiring capacity for subtlety of the human brain.One of the key messages for business is the power of our unconscious biases and how important it is to recognize that they exist and to take steps to minimize their impact.A second key message of the book is the obverse of that: learn to trust your intuition and to cultivate it. Our subconscious is often better at detecting dissonance than are our analytical skills.A third is that, out of the flood of data available by which we might judge a situation, only a few factors are truly influential (Pareto's Law applies here too). Effort put into identifying those factors and then learning to use them can bring great rewards.Gladwell has in full measure the rare gift of helping readers to learn a great deal while enjoying themselves thoroughly.",
            "While this book is well written as an introduction to the influence of Intuition in decision making, it is relatively \"thin soup\". I would suggest that folks with an interest in this topic read \"Educating Intuition \" by Robin Hogarth. R.Olsen, Decision Scientist.",

But after skimming it, I thought it might offer positive insights into the all-too-human habit of immediate judgments. Having now read it, I will be forever grateful to Malcolm Gladwell for proving that my initial assessment, albeit hasty, had been right. Had I applied the power of thinking without thinking in the store, I would have saved myself $15.",

I then went into what I can only describe as a comatose state and didn't wake up until the very next morning - what a strange phenomenon! Fortunately, since I was able to return this book for a full refund today, I believe that no permanent damage was done...Now to the content: Simplistic pop culture. Pseudo-science wrapped in the guise of profundity. A waste of time for any right-thinking, concerned individual.I grow so weary of the AVALANCHE of trendy, pop-culture, pseudo-science books that is sweeping over the literary landscape today. Can someone please help me spell gobblely-gook?",
            "I read The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell and now have finished his next book, Blink. This book is about the first two seconds that we take to evaluate something. \"The first tastk of Blink is to convince you of a simple fact: decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.\" Sometimes, it is not scientific information or rational thinking that gives us our most important information but rather it is the first two seconds, or blink, that gives us what information that we need most. The scientific information may seem very compelling but sometimes it is our instincts that are right on.\"So when should we trust our instincts and when should we be wary of them? Answering that question is the second task of Blink.\"\"The third and most important task of this book is to convince you that our snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled.\" In fact, \"the power of knowing in that first two seconds is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few. It is an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves.\"\"The task of making sense of ourselves and our behavior requires that we acknowledge there can be as much value in the blink of an eye as in months of rational analysis.\"The book goes through various experiments such as those by the pre-eminent marriage counselor, John Gottman to show that in fifteen minutes he is able to predict which married couples will still be married years from now.He looks at racial and gender profiling under all sorts of conditions and examines the outcome. He shows how \"we're a bit too quick to come up with explanations for things we don't really have an explanation for.\" Often, we think we are smarter than we are and it's important that we accept our ignorance more frequently.He tells the story of Warren Harding, considered one of the worse president of our country who was elected because of his looks and manner of speech. We often choose people by how they look rather than the qualities they possess. CEO's are often taller than average, handsomer but not more educated or more able.In the blink of an eye we can make life saving decisions that are better off not researched than researched. This is a paradox that is true but goes against all our thinking.An interesting book, Gladwell discusses all sorts of situations where a blink of an eye can render the truth far more accurately than years of research. I found the book fascinating and, at times, oxymoronic, but true.",
            "Another \"instant classic\" from Malcolm Gladwell in his now signature style. The idea this book explores is the gut feeling of instant decision making - and how we can learn to trust snap judgements when it counts. This is not to say that studied research and fact gathering is invalid or unnecessary - in fact, this book uses standard research and academic methodology to actual prove that certain kinds of split second decisions (using what Malcolm describes as \"thin slicing\") are just as accurate as concerted inspection.There are many great examples in the book, but my two favorites are:1) The student judging the teacher: College students were shown short clips (e.g. 30 seconds) of prospective professors and were asked to rate whether they each one was a good or bad teacher before taking the course (with no other qualifications or prior knowledge). At first glance (pardon the pun), this seems to be nowhere near enough time to rate professor effectiveness - no content, no fact checking, no lecture. However, the results (positive or negative) were statistically insignificant from (different) students' post-course surveys whom had taken the entire course with each prospective professor. In other words, the snap judgements by prospective students about a prospective teacher were the same ratings as the students whom had already taken the course.2) The probability of medical malpractice lawsuits: It turns out, it has almost NOTHING to do capability or skill level. It has everything to do with bedside manor. Doctors who spend more time with their patients, or have an overall good relationship with their patients, are far less likely to be sued than doctors who spend less time or have a gruff or seemingly cold bedside manor. It all comes down to engagement and being in the moment during consultation, and almost nothing to do with actual education or skill level of the doctor.This book just further reinforces the power of the parallel processor that is our brain, and how hard it has proven to be to model artificial intelligence. We don't yet understand completely how we can do certain things so well (e.g. being \"in the zone\") or how we can make certain kinds of correlations-to-judgements (\"thin slicing\" and generalization), but examining the human animal proves to be an endless fascination of Mr. Gladwell's (and obviously, the many purchasers of his best sellers).On the same topic: I recently heard about Japanese hen sorters, or specifically \"chicken sexers.\" This is a technique, or really more of a subconscious trained behavior, which allows humans to instantly distinguish between a male and female chicken (thereby determining which will be egg producing). What is amazing is that there is basically no difference to a layperson's eye between male and female chicks at an age prior to 3-5 weeks. But, chicken sexers are able to immediately identify the difference and sort accordingly. This is an example (not in the book) of the instant decision making based on some form of unconscious input and the power of parallel processing - much like a well-trained eye of an FBI agent can pick up on an out-of-place element in a room upon first visit.",
            "I thought, hoped that this would be as good as the Outliers. It wasn't. I didn't finish it, which I rarely don't.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell, in his book blink brakes down the idea of instincts and discusses their possible credibility. As is the subtitle of the book, `thinking without thinking,' Gladwell leads the reader, mainly through examples and scientific findings, to the idea that we have two separate modes of coming up with a solution; the general one which we call thinking and a second one which he refers to as rapid cognition (or instinct).In his introduction, Gladwell talk about a very expensive statue which had to be evaluated for a possible fraud before the museum made their purchase of it. He goes on to list several art experts, who at first sight of the statue either got a `hunch' that something was amiss, or said that they felt cold, or even strongly suggested that the statue not be purchased. The story line follows that a 14 month investigation that the museum conducted bought them to the conclusion that the statute in fact was a fake. What took the museum 14 months to figure out, the exert `understood' within the first couple of seconds. \"Blink is about those first two seconds.\"Gladwell begins to build his argument by separating the two types of ways our brains can make sense of a situation: first, the common sit-down-and-think-about-it until you've consciously figured it out. And the second, which operate much faster than the first strategy, and generally operates completely outside our conscience. The latter method, which he compared to a giant self-operating computer, is referred to as the adaptive unconscious. He proposes that the adaptive unconscious is in place as a survival mechanism, because when we are in danger we don't always have time to rationally think about how we can solve the urgent matter. We can see this mode in action when there is a car coming right at us, and we are also privileged to see this kind of fast thinking when we get our `first impression' of someone or something.This form of \"rapid cognition\" says Gladwell, might put the reader into suspicious. He expands; haven't we always been told to `stop and think' and `not judge a book by its cover?' But can this be partially false, questions Gladwell? Can first impression and snap judgments be of any value? Yes, answers Gladwell as he begins to present his goals for blink.First, that these unconscious decisions can be as good as those made with general `slow' thinking. Second, when and how we can pick out times that these quick instincts can yield to false conclusions. Third, that we can educate and control out snap judgments and first impressions. And forth, Gladwell's personal hope for the world, that once the readers begin educate and control their rapid cognition it can improve the world on an economic, political, and social.The book is then broken down into six chapters and a conclusion. The chapters are used as different arguments to support Gladwell's goals for the book. The chapters are broken down into sub sections in which he builds up each argument premise by premise.",
            "First, the good -This book does an admirable job of demonstrating how and why people can make snap, \"gut feeling\" assumptions on topics they are experts in and be right, even when they can't give you a rational explanation for why they think what they think. Mr. Gladwell calls this \"thin slicing.\" I like the term, as it's descriptive and accurate. It is a phenomenon most of us are familiar with yet can't explain. Why did you switch lanes right before that other car swerved? Why did you get that feeling that person was just \"wrong\" before they suddenly went off? Most of us have experience this yet can't explain it. Gladwell does an excellent job.Where is all goes wrong, for me, is when Gladwell takes it into areas where the normal systemic processes are either altered or co opted, particularly in law enforcement. I've been in LE work for the better part of two decades and I can say that \"thin slicing\" is very applicable when cops are doing their routine work (why did they stop that guy right there who just happened to have an active warrant and a gun on him?) but once we start adding adrenal stress \"thin slicing\" becomes more problematic. When adrenaline hits the body in a crisis situation the amygdala, the part of the brain dedicated to survival, takes over, which is why it's hard to think under extreme stress. There are pre-programmed survival routines in everyone's brain, with the additional ones that can be added through appropriate training. When faced with a survival situation, the brain will shut down all non-essential functions and focus on surviving. This process includes the release of the drug adrenaline, which is the chemical authority the amygdala uses to enforce it's mission. This drug can very much influence perception. If you cannot accurately perceive an event you cannot \"thin slice\" it. This should be self-evident. Would we expect the art experts Gladwell mentions in one chapter make the same determinations if they were high on say, LSD? Of course not - altered perception alters results. Yet somehow Mr. Gladwell equates the calm, rational deliberation of art experts with the fear-addled, adrenaline charged incident of police officers engaging in lethal force situations. This does not compute. The standards are not the same and can't be judged equally.Place the art directors in fear of their life and let's measure that response, then we'll have an appropriate comparison.Minus the either intentional misrepresentation or misunderstanding regarding the effects on the human body of a life-threatening stress event, Gladwell makes some excellent points. This flaw, however, significantly damaged his hypothesis in my opinion.",
            "Blink is a book about the human brain. While it helps the reader better understand how the human brain works, don't expect to be able to use that understanding to your advantage. In fact, while the book provides a fascinating discovery of how the human brain \"thin slices\" both people and events, the main takeaway from this is that thin slicing is either accurate or it's not.Gladwell points out some cases where thin slicing based on limited information is just as accurate (or more accurate) as making a decision on piles of research. In other cases, thin slicing causes us to have wrong impressions about a person and therefore causing us to make wrong decisions. Even still, there are the instances where thin slicing completely fails and everything goes sour.The one thing I did take away, is that the human brain is not always capable of allowing us to verbally explain the things we do or think. Unless you're particularly skilled in a certain area, once you try to explain why you initially think this or that, the reasoning begins to break down and often fails entirely. This can then cause us to come to conclusions that are contrary to what we really believe. Strange, yeah, I know.That's what makes Blink fascinating. The human brain is so complex that it often doesn't even work in the ways we would think. But it can be trained. Immerse yourself into something and your brain develops the capability of knowing why you like or dislike certain things or even to read things in high-stress situations that the normal person would not.As a business owner I didn't find Blink to be as useful as The Tipping Point, also from Gladwell, but the author does have a way of bringing oddities to light and presents them in a fascinating way.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell could write about paint drying and make it fascinating. His New Yorker columns (sadly far more infrequent these days) are a joy. This book was fun to read - his usual flair for thought-provoking and interesting examples, well-written.Why only 4 out of 5 stars? Because I thought this book lacked a coherent overall argument. What is the bottom line? You should trust your gut instinct .... except in those cases where you shouldn't. He fails to make clear exactly what it is that distinguishes one situation from the other. As a result, the examples, while interesting to read, leave the reader unsure in the end what point Gladwell is really trying to make.",
            "Blink is a pleasant read of the extended magazine article type, with snappy stories and observations that move right along and can keep the reader engaged. I don't see making a big fuss about the content and conclusions, which are relatively straightforward. Most interesting were the examples, such as the married couples, where it may be possible for a trained observer to make quick and accurate judgments on little information, as long as it is the proper information. The marriage example is one of the few where a rigorous explanation is actually offered: if the analyst can flush out a tendency for one partner to show contempt for the other, that would certainly sound like a solid negative indicator.Other stories work less well. Sure, people let their known and unknown biases affect their thinking and, sure, making snap judgments can lead to bad outcomes, as in the case where a man was shot when he shouldn't have been. Sometimes intuition is good and sometimes it isn't. Mr. Gladwell tries to distinguish what he's talking about from intuition, yet his argument didn't persuade me. He also easily condemns bias, especially racial bias, without addressing the context of such bias and whether in some cases there might even be some justification for \"thin slicing\" that incorporates bias.Gladwell's example of singer \"Kenna\" could probably just as well be balanced by artists he doesn't like getting lucky or unlucky. The Coke vs. Pepsi story doesn't seem especially relevant, because in this case the sip test was a bad idea. If you want to show how thin slicing has surprising power, why include this example?I also don't see the big deal about the war game scenario. The \"hero\" of the story did what a creative leader should do: come up with a strategy that works well, given your opponent. When you are outmanned, try some unconventional techniques. When you don't have a lot of information, maybe gamble more than you would. To me, that thread was actually very interesting, but did not really fit with Gladwell's thesis beyond the need to focus on what information is important and not get buried by info overload. In this case, you still need creative thinking whether you have minimal information or excessive.Because the book is an easy meal, it can be read for entertainment and as motivation to examine our own prejudices and why and how we are either good or bad in reading people, using our intuition, or making quick decisions. If I'm not good at quick decisions under stress, why not? Do I have a history of effective reading of person-to-person clues? Do I give off vibes that I don't intend to? When I interview people, am I really making a decision in the initial seconds and then justifying that subconscious choice? Maybe these ideas could prompt some self-analysis at the individual or team level. You won't get much advice from Blink regarding how to go about the task, so true introspection and improvement will require guidance to be found elsewhere.3.5 stars, with credit for style and entertainment value, not rigor.",
            "blink: the Power of Thinking Without Thinking, the title itself is attractive enough to make someone interested in reading this text by Malcolm Gladwell. Author has done a great job in weaving examples from a wide variety of professions, functions and areas like relationships, politics, military, medical, crime, personality, connoisseurs, etc. to illustrate his main point:The Power of Adaptive Unconscious of Human Mind.Author states that human mind works through two strategies, the conscious strategy and through adaptive unconscious. First strategy is when use data, information and analysis to draw a conclusion and make decision, whereas second is when we make decisions on basis of that \"gut feeling\". This is when we act instantly on a thought which flashes in our mind and forces us to make a decision. The question now is: Is the accuracy or quality of a decision is directly related to the time and effort spent into making it? Per Gladwell, \"Decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.\"Author has used technique of \"thin slicing\" i.e. power of our unconscious (the internal computer) to create a subjective impression using very little information., to explain this kind of decision-making. He has also cited some erroneous decisions (Warren Harding Error & an encounter in Bronx) and some great decisions from medical and military, (Cook County Hospital in Chicago & Van Riper, respectively).In my opinion, our brain certainly has that great power of making a split-second decision, but it is upto us, how we develop and tap that unusual potential. We can use these techniques like mid reading, facial expression recognition etc but it certainly requires practice and a certain level of expertise to utilize them for our benefit. I would recommend reading this book with an unbiased mind and think, don't just blink.",
            "This is such an interesting book. It looks like a book about psychology, but the truth is, when I read on, I realize that the psychology factor, how we think in a snap second or \"blink\" is everywhere in our everyday lives. The book also shows the very broad knowledge the author has. When I am interested by the new ideas he presents, I am also learning so many things at the same time. It is a book that's worth reading and not at all a waste of time like some books are.Very importantly, this book does NOT say \"Always judge a book by its cover.\" It suggests that sometimes our instinct does a better job; the other times careful examination and thinking process produce a better result than thin-slicing. He also says that we still cannot conclude when exactly we should thin-slice and rely on our instinct. This is a book about his researches and studies on many cases where either instinct or thorough thinking is what IS helpful with solving a problem.Finally, don't try to skim or skip ahead in the book. He is very smart about it. He likes to repeat and conclude over and over to prove a point or compare throughout the book.",
            "This book was recommended to me by a friend, Rory, a fellow student in the doctoral program in Leadership Studies at Gonzaga University. What a totally amazing book. I was intrigued and spellbound the entire time.\"The Theory of Thin Slices: How a Little Bit of Knowledge Goes a Long Way\" is the driving theme for this book. Malcolm Gladwell, also author of \"The Tipping Point\", incorporates ample research and rich detail to add depth to the discussion of the incredible ability of the human mind to make split second decisions. He explains how our neurolinguistic program plays a role in our interpretations of the world around us before our conscious mind ever catches on to the automatic decisions that have guided us to survival or success. Whether we are judging the authenticity of an ancient work of art or selecting an ideal mate, the automatic decision maker often selects a better decision for us than we have consciously derived after hours of discourse and deliberations. This book is about those \"thin slices\", decisions made literally in the blink of an eye.Technology has come a long way in helping us to understand how the mind works. An understanding of these complex concepts helps us to interpret the decisions and actions that we make in our daily interactions with others. A better understanding of these concepts might help us to change how we train and educate leaders for a more ethically sensitive society. The author continues to add depth to substantiate the thesis through many interesting examples and research studies.I highly recommend this book.",
            "I bought this on the back of reading Malcoms really interesting \"The Tipping Point\" book.Blink is worth a read, however you are left with the feeling that its all a little padded out to compensate for what really could be a much shorter book. There are some good insights into the way people unconsciously make decisions about things.Some of the more interesting studies quoted explain how a high percentage of corporate leaders are taller than the average person. And how every extra inch in height can equate to about an extra $1,000 in salary. The goal of this book is to try to explain why these kind of things happen. It seems we all subconsciously make decisions based on predefined perceptions.Some ideas it this book really overlap with NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming). If you have read anything about NLP then I think you will see the overlap.People really should rely a lot more on their gut feelings with things as this book proves. Even though you may not know why you have a gut feeling about something this gut feeling comes from your subconscious evaluating and making decisions. The most powerful thing you can do, I believe, is try to be a bit more aware of your first gut feeling about things, it is easy to not pick up on them.",

I was hoping for something at the end to give me clarity on what to do with the information now that I have it, but it wasn't there. That may have been intentional on the author's part; he might want us to draw our own conclusions. But that was an expectation I developed as I was reading that wasn't fulfilled in the end.

I found it fascinating how many times our gut instincts are really our unconscious surveying a situation, and deciding on an opinion, or side to take. This did add much insight into my life, and allowed me to survey situations that are presented to me with new eyes.The topic that I found most interesting in this book was when Gladwell mentions how the majority of the time people have race preferences toward white people over black people. I later took the racial preference test and found that I too have a strong preference of blacks over whites, which I found amazing, and at the same time very eye opening.The topic that fascinated me the most about this book was when Gladwell talked about facial expressions, and how they, unlike verbal communication, can show someone's true feelings. Also how there was one man, Silvan Tomkins, who could easily decode and decipher anyone's facial expressions, and figure out their true personality, who inspired me.Since this book is an easy read, it was not hard for me to understand many of the topics that Gladwell covers throughout the book, like the topics that I mentioned above. Gladwell does describe and inform the reader thoroughly about each topic, and he provides many different real life situations where each topic can be applied, which makes this book fun and interesting. I enjoyed reading this book, and I am sure that many others have too; it will bring much insight and understanding into your life, as it did mine!- Avery O'Hara",

From listening to his best friend describing the relationship, I without any doubt put in my two cents from my thinly sliced comprehension aka \"gut\" - that the marriage is over. His best friend got angry and yelled at me for not understanding completely and my negative judgement. A month later they filed for divorce. A year later this book was published.

It doesn't quite work, but it is really impressive when it lasts, and darned fun to listen.Blink is amiable and entertaining. It admittedly fails to really build a case for a cohesive scientific thesis on thin slicing and subconscious decision-making.

            "Malcolm Gladwell, a staff writer for The New Yorker and former business and science reporter for the Washington Post, synthesizes the complex topic of conscious and unconscious decision making in Blink. In this work, Gladwell dissects how people think and how their exterior provides valuable and often scientific explanations to their thought process. In short, he states that it is a book about \"thinking without thinking.\" Using numerous examples of recent research in the fields of psychology, military warfare, behavioral sciences, and other relevant areas, Gladwell highlights these examples to advance the thesis that we often have the ability to make a correct decision in the blink of an eye.* First impressions are often correct: In the opening chapter, Gladwell outlines the details of an ostensibly genuine and rare Kuoss statue. He talks of the pain staking labor that the J. Paul Getty museum went through to establish the bona fides of this artifact. After more than a year, the museum curators, the forensic specialists and others, verified that the statue was genuine. Unfortunately, as Gladwell notes, they were wrong. After the first Kuoss statue experts came to view the Kuoss (this was over a year after the museum had purchased and verified the statue's authenticity), they made instantaneous, and startling, remarks that the statue \"looked like new\" or \"had a mirror like image.\" These comments were not taken lightly by the museum, and after further review it was determined that the statue was a fake. Gladwell makes the point that the forensic and museum experts did not determine the authenticity of the statue after a year of analysis and research, and the statue experts made the correct determination in less than a minute. This example sets the tone for Blink, as the following chapters discuss why the Kuoss experts were able to unlock and trust their first thoughts - even though the statue was ostensibly proven to be genuine.* Unlocking the unconscious: Using a series of research examples from psychological experiments, Gladwell details some interesting facts about how we determine \"snap\" decisions. In essence, the snap decision is based on a set of pre-conceived and established notions that one has developed over the course of their lifetime. For instance, one of Gladwell's research examples exposes word and action correlations. The test, developed by Anthony Greenwald and others, was called the Implicit Association Test (IAT). In short, a series of words (both positive and negative) were given to a tester - with another set of words and/or pictures of individuals of different races. The tester was instructed to make associations by matching the differing word sets. Essentially, the quicker that a tester made an association, the higher the correlation between the word sets. For example, the results showed that there was a racial bias in almost all the testers. They would have negative correlations between a person of a certain race and the word \"good.\" The results were a bit disturbing, as they showed \"that our unconscious attitudes may be incompatible with our stated conscious values.\" According to Gladwell, this is the \"Warren Harding\" error, as the former president was a tall and handsome person, but lacked any tangible political savvy to hold the highest office in the United States. U.S. Citizens associated a strong president with his physical attributes and not his political qualifications. This sort of bias still exists today, as illustrated with the IAT. To further this conclusion, Gladwell note that most research illustrates that those in positions of power, in this case CEOS, are overwhelmingly tall white men - the medium, he explains, was just a shade under six feet. This \"dark side\" of thin slicing, according to Gladwell, is responsible for our biases and discriminations in decisions making.* The science behind quick decision making: Gladwell uses many examples in his latter chapters to solidify that people are hard-wired to make snap judgments. These decisions are the product of training and experience, notes Gladwell. The more you have of each, the more apt and adapted you will be to make the correct decision in a snap. For instance, a military war game strategy highlights this technique. Gladwell outlines the details of a 2002 War Game exercise that details the military tactics of two teams: red and blue. Both teams were not evenly matched, as the blue team enjoyed superior tactics and technology - not to mention the best analysts and military strategists. The red team had fewer resources, and the commander was meant to represent a rogue commander in the Middle East. USMC General Paul Van Riper, or \"Rip,\" as he was called by many, was chosen as the commander. A military officer who had a reputation for making good decisions in stressful situations, he proved to be an exceptional commander in Vietnam and his future endeavors. So the stage was set, Rip was up against the greatest war game team in modern day history. To make a long story short, Rip defeated the Blue team in less than one day. The blue team had assumed that Rip would use the latest technology for communications such as cell phones and satellites. But this was an incorrect assumption; Rip was able to sink the majority of the Blue Team's naval forces by using old signal communications. For instance, the Blue Team did not calculate that he would use light signals to land and launch his fighter planes. The point of this example was to illustrate that high stress experiences and training allowed Rip to make snap decisions that would defeat those who lacked those experiences and training. In this case, the Blue team lacked a Commander with the aforementioned attributes. In other words, all the expertise and technical advances could not replace the keen snap judgment of Rip. In similar examples, Gladwell illustrated that experienced stock brokers and police officers are able to make snap judgments in a blink of an eye. Mainly, their training and their experiences allow them to make the right split second decisions.Good judgment is at the core of leadership and management, and this work outlines \"how we think without thinking.\" On top of the important and somewhat novel thesis, it is an interesting story of the latest revelations in psychological research that illuminates the thought process. Blink is a page turner and a book that keeps your attention.",
            "I loved reading this book. I am fascinated by psychology and this book definitely fed my fascination (for awhile!) I felt like I was sitting in an open-roofed train and the author was guiding the rails. It was an awesome trip, pieces of this and that, and other things I never would have thought of. It was very interesting and actually educational.The book really makes you think (yes, think!!) about issues in a new way. For example, how simple signs, and comments can signal whether or not your marriage will last, why cops shouldn't have partners, I could go on and on.Blink, is a worthy read, for anyone, for any reason.",
            "The thesis of this book is that we all make snap judgements, relying on reasoning not available to our conscious thought processes. This is not a novel idea. Gladwell develops this idea by examining under what circumstances such judgments may be surprisingly good, and when they may be terrible. He is not the most disciplined of writers, and this is not entirely a bad thing. For example, I enjoyed the explanation of why a cola can do well in a taste test limited to sipping, yet do poorly as an everyday choice, although this does not really relate to the main ideas of the book. I do sometimes find him verbose, and he frequently employs that breathless style that many popular science writers seem prone to. Still, this is a deservedly popular book, interesting and informative. For readers who want to understand unconscious thought processes in somewhat more depth, I unreservedly recommend \"Strangers to Ourselves: Discovering the Adaptive Unconscious\" by Timothy B Wilson. It is a tribute to Gladwell, that although I read his book after Wilson's, there was enough new stuff to keep me interested. I wish every citizen could read Gladwell's discussion of the science behind high speed chases and their behavioral aftermath - think Rodney King case which led to the LA riots.",
            "Enthralling. Unique. One-of-a-Kind. Blink was one of those books that you pick up and cannot put down. Malcolm Gladwell's novel explores rapid cognition and the snap decisions we make in our mind without recognizing that we have come to a conclusion. These quick assessments continually affect us as we meet new people, go on a first date, or take action in an emergency. Gladwell sheds light on our unknown mental processes through sharing results from various studies and experiments. My favorite example he gives is speed dating. Speed dating exercises our \"thin-slicing\" deductive reasoning. While participating in a speed dating event, several single people of opposite genders gather at a central location to meet each other. All the guys have a seat at a table as the women sit opposite of them and rotate with the sound of a bell at a set time interval. In this time the couple decides if they would like to see each other again based on first impressions. The man running the speed dating service noted that women participating in the evening knew within a minute if they wanted to pursue an actual date with the man in question. Gladwell added, \"when it comes to thin-slicing potential dates, pretty much everyone is smart.\"I found Gladwell's style laid back and informative. The personal stories allow for the reader to create enough of a connection with the book to remain interested. After completing the book I sat back and realized how vital snap judgments play into everyday life. Blink allowed me to appreciate the quick decisions I make before I give an issue much thought.",

During encounters that require split-second thinking, the conscious is not quick enough to respond. This is where the subconscious kick in. We should learn to trust our subconscious but at the same time, be conscious of factors that may affect the subconscious from performing optimally. Such factors as stress or misinterpretation of the subconscious or bad information being registered into the subconscious from years of childhood experience may have adverse effects on the subconscious. Take for example, racism. Such ideals may be present in the subconscious without conscious even knowing. Years of association with a particular race will affect the subconscious either in a positive or negative light. But only by being conscious of this fact can we begin to correct this however so slowly. The mind is very powerful and mysterious and you will find it ever so true after reading this book.",
            "I liked it more than I thought I would - being a bit predisposed to skepticism of Mr. Gladwell (which may or may not be fair..)A lot of very enjoyable anecdotes & good research, which is typically what I like most about these kinds of books, but unfortunately it doesn't add up to much.It feels a bit like a debate student buttressing his argument with a multitude of dubious supporting 'evidence', but even worse, here it seems to be not because his argument is untenable but because there's not really much of an argument to speak of! The only discernable hypothesis being that we use all of our past experience to intuitively make split-second high-pressure decisions on-the-fly rather than taking the time to think about it consciously - but there's certainly nothing ground-breaking or world-view-shattering about that! Of course we do!It ultimately feels more like a marketing pitch for the catchy title & premise than a open-minded investigation into a quite interesting topic, as though the title takes precedence over any deep insight that could be gained from the material at hand, which I have a feeling is more dissonant, inconclusive, & mysterious than he would have you believe here.",
            "My first intuition for this book was good (or what Gladwell would say \"was my gut intuition\"), but I failed. This book is boring, full of repetitive examples (some of them very interesting, specially the first chapters), but at the end you get nothing in conclusion. We all know that people with more experience on their fields can get a very accurate explanation to some phenomena with very little information, is this new? My gut intuition did not work for this book.",
            "This is a quick read and suitable for anyone who is human and struggles therefore with inherent patterns of emotion and thought that result in actions that can be either harmful or helpful to yourself and others. This is my interpretation of Malcolm's objective but somewhat rambling style, of this book which by matter of fact points out that stereotypes can and do taint our decisions but how we can also leverage this intuitive power to make better decisions in a blink. To turn this weakness into strength we need to develop our expertise and ourselves as Malcolm shows us through examples with police officers, food tasters and mind readers! Malcolm is subtly helping us to become aware as we learn about how commercial strategies can convince us to like certain flavors and other suggestions that impact our daily lives maybe without our even knowing. Since 55% of communication is non verbal, Malcolm's inclusion of Ekman's facial studies should incline us to pay better attention to that which is not said by our politicians; actions speak much louder than words. References to Ekman's research and the unknown depths of the unconscious although brief, might be enough for readers to seek more understanding about their own locked rooms so they can in turn air them out. Malcolm's own experiences when he grew a mess of curly hair tactfully placed outside the book in the Acknowledgement end pages further proves his point that is \"the truly successful decision making relies on a balance between deliberate and instinctive thinking;\" sometimes we need to consider the obvious so we can think.",

Think about the first time that you met your wife...you get that bolt of lightning in your stomache, its mixed with lust of course but then it settles down to some thing more permanent. When you are with your beloved you are constantly getting affirmative reactions from her eyes, her veldtenschund and her very being. So you get married lust lasts about 2 years and by then a baby now makes your family 3 and you can bond with your wife on a more permanent basis. This book describes how we get initial impressions that we call intuition, understanding or a general gut feeling. We do it all the time. Look at your surroundings and see how people are conversing, sizing each other up and having a dance of feelings which sometimes have nothing to do with their expression. Gladwell intimates that we are hard wired to do this from birth--the flight or fight syndrome makes a good case for following his ideas as men as hunters had to make decisions in the blink of an eye in order to get food, clothing, shelter and a mate that would give him a helper. One thing that could have been tied in here is the phrenomes that humans have. Phrenomes are scents that men and women have that we are not aware of. It is thought that these phrenomes have something to do with the attraction of a woman to a man or vice versa.",

So began a fascinating investigation into first impressions - how we make them, how accurate they are and how to make your first judgments more accurate.BLINK is entertaining, illuminating and at times humorous. In a highly readable account, Gladwell gives a clear description of implicit cognition and explains the most up-to-date theories of neuroscience and psychology through a series of fun and accessible stories. The examples, drawn from a wide range of situations and fields of human endeavor, illustrate the complex thinking processes that support \"snap judgments.\" With case after case, Gladwell demonstrates how the depth of knowledge and expertise developed over years of observation informs the mind to \"thin slice\" - make quick decisions at the blink of the eye that seem instantaneous but are actually based on years of experience.

            "After his bestselling book brought the phrase \"tipping point\" into popular usage, which is that moment when an idea, product or concept suddenly catches fire with the population at large, Malcolm Gladwell now gives us two more phrases that are likely to become equally well-known: \"blink\" and \"thin-slicing.\"We \"blink\" when we think without thinking. We do that by \"thin-slicing,\" using limited information to come to our conclusion. What's interesting is that in our age of information overload, according to Gladwell, we often make better decisions with snap judgments than we do with volumes of analysis.The book opens with what reads like a heart-racing detective story about the discovery of a statue that initially fooled one group of art experts for being genuine and was later shown to be a fake by another group. The first group had exhaustively studied and analyzed the statue. Members of the second took one look --- \"blinked\" --- and declared it suspect and ultimately a forgery. And they were right. Why? How did they know? Why was the first group so wrong? Are there dangers in overanalyzing? Are we always right when we blink? Can we be wrong, even dead wrong? What is the science behind blinking? What can we learn from this phenomenon?Gladwell addresses these questions and gives a wide range of examples of blinking from the worlds of gambling, speed-dating, tennis, war games, the movies, malpractice suits, popular music, and predicting divorce. Interspersed are accounts of scientific studies that partially, but never completely, explain the largely unconscious phenomenon that we have all experienced at one time or another in our lives. Nevertheless, the hypotheses, the scientific experiments, and the examples are very interesting.A researcher tells the story of a firefighter in Cleveland who answered a routine call with his men. It was in the back of a one-and-a-half story house in a residential neighborhood in the kitchen. The firefighters broke down the door, laid down their hose, and began dousing the fire with water. It should have abated, but it didn't. As the fire lieutenant recalls, he suddenly thought to himself, \"There's something wrong here,\" and he immediately ordered his men out. Moments after they fled, the floor they had been standing on collapsed. The fire had been in the basement, not the kitchen as it appeared. When asked how he knew to get out, the fireman thought it was ESP, which of course it wasn't. What is interesting to Gladwell is that the fireman could not immediately explain how he knew to get out. From what Gladwell calls \"the locked box\" in our brains, our fireman just \"blinked\" and made the right decision. In fact, if the fireman had deliberated on the facts he was seeing, he would have likely lost his life and the lives of his men.It took well over two hours of questioning for the fire lieutenant to piece together how he knew to get out. (First, the fire didn't respond as it was supposed to; second, the fire was abnormally hot; third, it was quiet when it should have been noisier given the heat.)One take-away from the book is that how we blink is a function of our experiences, training, and knowledge. For example, prejudice is so unconsciously woven into our society that, despite our best intentions, at an unconscious level it can lead to really bad blinks. This is partly why tall people are frequently seen as natural leaders when there is no basis in reality for that belief. And, in the case of the Amadou Diallo killing in 1999, it is why four policemen incorrectly thin-sliced a situation and wound up killing an innocent man by mistake.Gladwell is obviously fascinated by the phenomenon of blinking. Properly understood --- and properly prepared for --- it is a valid way to make decisions. Gladwell says, \"A world where snap judgments and thin-slicing is taken seriously is a better place.\" I know some people who might object to that viewpoint, particularly when it comes to decision-making in foreign policy, but if you want an entertaining read, fast-paced, rich in entertaining anecdotes and some unusual scientific research, then BLINK is worth picking up.--- Reviewed by Anne Miller",

In between these two chapters all he does is to narrate examples of supposedly( i havent heard of any of these people) famous people on how they trusted their 2-second snap decisions / judgements. The author has made very little attempt to give any sort of insight on how our instincts really work. I must agree with one reader that its like going through psychology 101.

            "Although the Author does not use these exact words, the book is all about how your Intuition, Sixth sense or \"thin slicing\" (as the author puts it) plays important role in our day to day snap decisions and also about how to guard against mis-reading your Intution.The author enumerates this power with numerous examples ... for example ... how some experts can tell whether the marriage will survive based on just few minutes of interactions between the pairs ... how some folks can tell whether double fault is going to occur by just observing the beginning of the serve ... how some folks were able to tell that a statue was fake by just one brief glance.Additionally, the author enumerates different examples where \"thin slicing\" fails. He analyses and presents information which can help one from getting into the trap.At times the chapter gets long and obvious, in such situations once you get the essence of the subject, you may want to just skim over some of the chapters .Overall my take away was ... in times of quick action, do try to listen to what your gut tells.

            "Malcolm Gladwell understands the concept of writing for the reader; he is able to empathize with the layman while keeping the book informative and interesting.It is a very interesting book detailing the power of the brain that we never knew existed; he writes mainly about the subconscious actions of our brain and how it effects our conscious actions without our even realizing it.Gladwell does his best to introduce novel concepts in simple terms so that everyone (even those with no prior exposure to neuroscience or psychology) can understand it without having to go back to re-read sections at a time. Although he writes about a relatively new subject, his colloquial style is unassuming and modest. His master prose and story-telling ability help to relate these new ideas to real-life stories. It is important to say that all ideas proposed in Blink are theories; it is more speculation based on insight and analysis than hard facts.Blink is about rapid cognition, about the kind of thinking that happens in the blink of an eye. More generally, it is a book about intuition and how people harness this power or how it causes situations to go awry. Gladwell uses a variety of real-life examples to push his point, spanning from gambling to speed dating to police situations. The overall theme is that the mind can subconsciously understand a situation before the individual can consciously decode it; the mind can also erroneously conceive the details of a situation due to pre-determined associations made through society. He quickly jumps between stories as he discusses various topics such as thin slices, priming, expertise, selective processing and mind reading. Gladwell's style of writing may leave the reader slightly stranded as the reader attempts to figure out why he tells the stories he does. He leaves the reader curious about the association between concepts and stories until he finally and unexpectedly explains the relationship. Gladwell's great skill has always been to take mostly mundane, unnoticed topics and bringing them to public attention in a way that makes us wonder how we never noticed it before.Gladwell at times strays from the topic of his own book simply because he wants to tell another interesting story. He stretches to connect some examples of theories to the overall theme of rapid cognition. For example, his analysis of the Coke vs. Pepsi question boils down to the \"sip vs. whole-can-drinking.\" This has nothing to do with rapid cognition but rather of first impressions. To his credit, he explains his ideas of why first impressions are rapid cognition but only relates them to first impressions of people, and not to the senses. Another topic where he strays from the overall theme is over analysis. It seems that instead of trying to prove the power of rapid cognition and thin slicing, he tries to prove that over analyzing in certain situations is more detrimental than good. This notion of proving one idea wrong in order to show that another idea is correct is at best childish.Gladwell gets his information from many researchers focused expressly on the topics he writes about. While it is clear that the researchers are doing very prominent work, Gladwell instead spends a lot of writing space describing his interactions with the researchers. It almost seems as if he is infatuated more with the person performing the research than the ideas behind the research itself. In some cases (but not all), the background of the research is prudent and helps to clarify why the researcher is individually important to the story.Blink ends in a very abrupt manner. There is no summarization or recap of ideas as the reader would expect. There isn't even a formal conclusion about rapid congnition at the end. Instead, it seems as if Gladwell just decided he was done writing and stopped. The book would do much better with a formal ending that summarizes the broad range of concepts explored in Blink.Malcolm Gladwell chooses great topics to explore in Blink and has great enthusiasm in his writing and story telling; however, many of his arguments for the topic are left unfinished and sometimes seems to be mere speculation. I highly recommend reading this book to be introduced to new ideas of subconscious levels of thinking but be cautious. Not everything in the book is fact and further self-driven research can find more information based on scientific research.",
            "Blink has two important messages - First it breaks the news that we are all capable of making snap decisions and yet make them right.At the same time it repeatedly alerts us to the danger of judging a person by his mere appearance or outlook.It essentially differentiates between objects and human beings - all examples where snap decisions can be trusted without doubt deal with objects only, however any decisions involving humans are complicated and need more prudence and experience to make the right move.The author effectively promotes and puts the power of a superhero in the palm of our hands.He tells you about superman's x-ray vision and brings home the idea that each one of us can see through the book cover and judge its actual content to some considerable accuracy. Though, it strongly negates the idea of sixth sense and focuses on case studies and examples which every person can relate to and hope to achieve.One of the key achievements of the author is bringing forth real life instances where people with some relevant experience have proved the ability to make snap decisions and make them right.It is an effort to explain the heart and soul of a human being and how important it is in judging situations and enables us to think in a blink.It also guides us through the dark side of snap decisions - how to hone our snap decisions without being affected by our underlying prejudices. Everything that glitters might be gold but that greatly depends on an individual's definition of gold. This is also the part that needs more practice runs and trials before trusting our blink abilities wholly.The author bundles up the message that humans are not objects and therefore should not be treated as such or classified into groups, races or nationalities. To make the right snap decisions, one has to free his mind from bias and prejudice and all other factors that may have a positive or negative impact on our decision.The larger theme of the story is about understanding human nature, dealing with a person's underlying racial discrimination and yet toning one's mind to think in a blink - but Malcolm never tries to make it a \"lesson,\" it's simply part of the world he describes.In a just world an innocent man should be found not guilty. But if you want to know what this has to do with a 2 second decision or the strategy of war in Iraq, you'll have to read the book!In all, the book inspired me to check out the Aeron chair and download one of kenna's songs: Freetime.",
            "On the face of it, journalists leave us academics in the shade. They get to speak and write authoritatively on a vast range of subjects, versus our pathetic little micro-specializations. Moreover, they do so in the public domain, adding the luster of \"public intellectual\". They often do this with zero academic qualifications, or indeed anything we would recognize as \"knowledge\" in our mean-spirited ways. Finally, they get paid extremely well for their trade books, particularly if they already have day jobs, and can hold those jobs without anything we call \"qualifications\" in our jealous little minds.Why then is journalism of \"popular science\" nature often held in such contempt ? this book's fundamental thesis on \"thin slicing\", the tautological idea that suitably attuned experts are, in fact, expert, relates to cognitive science. This subject studies mind as an informational system; it incorporates elements of philosophy, psychology, linguistics, AI, ethnoscience and - increasingly - neuroscience and other biological sciences. However, perhaps a suitably equipped journalist can just raid the area and - Blink! - all is made clearSo we get a range of examples, well-commented on already. To see the real argument, de Sousa's 1980's textThe Rationality of Emotion (Bradford Books)is still worth looking at; it is described on P.63 ff ofThe Search for Mind: A New Foundation for Cognitive Science. Gladwell's \"Blink\" book is close to being the worst and most intellectually irresponsible book this reviewer has ever read, and his only regret is that the rating system here seems to force him to give a star.Se&aacute;n O Nuall&aacute;in Ph.D. 4u Meitheamh (san tSin 35 Bealtaine) 2009",
            "Gladwell laid out 3 objectives at the beginning of the book: (i) to convince the reader that \"decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately\"; (ii) to answer the question of when to trust our instincts vs. when to be wary of them; and (iii) to convince the reader that snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled.Point (i) was delivered brilliantly - a very pleasurable read. On point (ii), we got a very limited answer and only in the Afterword section - quite unsatisfying. On point (iii), Gladwell doesn't have an answer to the bigger question of HOW we can make educated and controlled snap judgments.Perhaps there are simply no straight answers for (ii) and (iii), but the way the book was set up, one can't help but feel a bit let down at the end of it.",
            "I don't understand what the rage is about this book. I found it to be disjointed and lacking in real actionable or interesting information. We should study Gladwell in terms of how he has somehow managed to have an entire generation of savvy business leaders depend on what he says when his own real experience in leading a business is nil.In terms of marketing, and leadership I would recommend \"Beyond Buzz: The Next Generation of Word Of Mouth Marketing\" - there's an amazing amount of actionable and easy to understand applicable ideas in terms of behavior, business, customers and making meaning instead of buzz.Beyond Buzz: The Next Generation of Word-of-Mouth Marketing",
            "Once again, Malcolm Gladwell has written a series of intriguing chapters on the human decision-making process, but without a unifying principle--and that's hard to find with such a fiendishly complex topic--it doesn't hang together as a book. The book felt too long as I waded through a number of real life situations without a punch line; at the same time the book felt way too short to adequately cover some of the issues raised. The chapter on the Iraq war games was fascinating and scandalous--did the Pentagon really rig the game to produce a stated result? (I guess I shouldn't be surprised!) There's a great book there alone. Another example was the tragic Amadou Diallo killing in NYC several years ago--Gladwell's treatment of this tragic and complex event seemed superficial and unoriginal.I had the same problem with \"The Tipping Point.\" Gladwell writes very well, but he's more the journalist than analyst. He has good points, although not new ones--we often make decisions at lightning speed for reasons we don't understand; too much data can overwhelm; words rarely convey the full meaning of what a person is thinking and feeling at any one time; much, if not most, of communication is non-verbal. But you can't fit all of that into one book.",
            "Which is better, thinking deep and hard or making snap judgements on instinct? Gladwell makes the case for quick thinking in his book of thinking without thinking. Gladwell argues that in many cases - emergency heart attack diagnosis being a good example - too much information not only doesn't help a bit, but actually makes decisions worse.Humans are very capable of making quick, unconscious decisions - some brain damage or other disorders prove that, when that capability is lost. According to Gladwell we should pay more heed to our unconscious, as it often helps to make good decisions fast. However, it's not that simple: quick thinking without thinking leads to prejudice and trouble, if one is not careful.Using lots of real-life examples, Gladwell makes a coherent case. The book is quite shallow, but that's what you should expect from a short bestseller like this. Blink, like Gladwell's previous success,The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference, is swiftly read. While it never delves deep or really satisfies the reader, it certainly succeeds in being thought-provoking and entertaining.",
            "The content was fascinating and the writing was engaging (though with more vulgarity than was necessary.) However, the book promised in the beginning promised to teach the reader how to make use of the principles. Perhaps I was reading into it more than it said, but that is what I understood the promise to be. At the end, I was left hanging. It was the work of a journalist, who discussed what others have done, but ended abruptly with no usefulness.(This was from the audiobook version.)",
            "The strangest thing about Blink! Is the contradiction between the contents and the cover. Did any of the people quoted on the back cover actually read the book? (Hint: Blurb writers rarely read the books they comment on.) The quotes rave about the power of snap decisions, but Gladwell is much more ambivalent. He's particularly concerned with how racial stereotypes misinform judgments, so much so that Gladwell finds he has an intuitively negative opinion of African Americans -- despite being a black man. I suspect he spent some time thinking about when he was going to introduce his Jamaican mother; the book itself is an experiment in the power of framing and bias.Contrary to the back cover, and the subtitle of \"the power of thinking without thinking\", this is a book about both the power and the treachery of the unspeaking mind. On the one hand we have powerful non-verbal detection of deception and emotional context, on the other hand we have unconscious bias based on height and ethnicity, the election of George ... err .. Warren Harding and the shooting of Amadou Diallo.I'd been expecting a superficial justification of impulsive thinking, so I was pleasantly surprised to find Gladwell's Blink! is a much deeper work. On the other hand, the book is also somewhat muddled. Once Gladwell moved away from domains in which natural selection has build powerful non-verbal tools, such as deception, mating and eating, his examples of good impulsive analysis became much less persuasive. The \"red team\" commander's success seemed to owe much more to correct and measured analysis than impulsive decisions (I'd read the story before by the way. The US military needs to retire a lot of generals.). The Cook County MI algorithm story is about the superiority of an analytic decision tree over both analytic human reasoning and non-verbal impressions. I couldn't tell what the Diallo story was trying to communicate, I think he was saying that under high stress situations human reasoning collapses (the autism connection is highly speculative and has no biological foundation). That's certainly true, but hardly novel.In other cases I had a \"Blink\" type suspicion that we was cherry-picking and shading anecdotes. I'm particularly suspicious that there was more to the Cook County story than we were told -- it would be very odd for a test to be so sensitive and specific that prior probability of disease was irrelevant. In an afterword he introduces new research findings that contradict the simplistic models in the early book; that's commendable but it doesn't make the book more cohesive.I think Gladwell lost out by omitting an evolutionary context to human thinking -- a choice that may reveal his biases. An evolutionary approach to cognition explains why the \"silent mind\" can do so well with decisions lizards, birds and primates evolved around, such as mating, eating, fighting and deceiving. It also explains why the non-verbal mind can make terrible mistakes when evaluating CEOs, presidents, or cell phones. He could have connected the evolution of mind with his thesis experts do best when they combine the silent mind with formal symbolic analysis (words).I did learn one or two new things. I was impressed by the research on how easy it is to alter emotional state through priming methods. Maybe those days when everyone around me seems to be driving badly are the results of some particularly noxious talk radio show.Ultimately Gladwell comes across, to me, as suspicious of the intuitive mind. I think he decides that non-experts should \"trust\" their intuition in domains where natural selection operates, but that even there they need to identify and adjust for bias based on appearance, gender, ethnicity, race, etc. Domain experts do best when they combine non-verbal intuition with analytic reasoning; they can use the intuitive input as a guide to developing a rational and defensible decision (something non-experts are said to have great difficulty with).That sounds like a plausible path. When making expert decisions in the non-primeval world, write down that initial \"Blink!\" impression -- but don't trust it. Adjust for bias and use it as the basis for a time limited and bounded analysis by translating it into a defensible rationalization. Then attack the rationalization. If it survives, then credit the silent mind. If it dies, recognize the failure of the paleolithic mind in a technocentric century.",
            "Extremely interesting examples how we react to information and have no idea that the process is occuring. The section on how we respond to cultural cues I found very eye-opening. The fact that someone who was aware of this phenomenon, took the Implicit Association Test every day, and yet discovered that the day that his score changed was a day he happened to watch a documentary on Martin Luther King Jr beforehand- which he didn't even realize until he sat down and analyzed what was different about that day. The flip side is the Warren Harding effect, where we make an assumption based on surface factors and never revisit the matter, often to our detriment. Again, just really thought-provoking. And the example of the way that women and black men are given rock-bottom car prices that are $750 to 1500 more on average than those given to white men is very eye-opening and practical information to have- not based on racism or sexism as such, and the salespeople have no idea they are doing this. You just need to read this book. Very good.",

            "First of all, let me say the examples Gladwell provides in the book are fascinating, from the war game general who succeeds despite having far less information to the police officers who misunderstood a situation.However, once he's done presenting the data, he has one short chapter of summary, then the book is over.I would've liked some additional analysis or other way of incorporating lessons learned into one's personal life rather that just given a collection of \"raw data\".",
            "I felt this book came as a highly rated \"Bestseller\" but I find I am disappointed. While I haven't completely finished the book yet it seems to contain several very long descriptive stories of how people behave according to their preconceived ideas.

            "The information in the book was quite interesting, but I expected the concept to be expanded to include ways in which we could use this concept in our own experience. A bit of a dissapointment and way too long to get the point across.",

            "The basic idea is interesting and held my attention for a while, but eventually lost my interest.",
            "The concepts described in the book could easily git a single chapter or be summarized in a magazine article. Thin-slicing is a concept researched by author, where the humans frequently make decisions based on the first impression, and sometimes those decisions tend to be correct right away, sometimes they are totally wrong. It's the book about gut felling and horse sense with some academic research supplied by the author.But right as you are about comforted with the fact that you bought a book that is a bit scientific and enriching, the author moves on to tell how how racist your sorry ass is, and how you're subconsciously biased against black people, and how you should watch Olympic games and listen to Colin Powell to get rid of that bias.The point is well made, but Gladwell goes at it at length, like a senile Grandpa at retirement home starting with his war stories and never knowing when to stop. Gladwell is repetitive, often redundant and way too verbose. For simple concepts that he's describing, he could've easily written a book with 5% of the pages that \"Blink\" has and still make a point. You wish you could smack him on the head and say \"Enough! I got you. Move on, please\" throughout the chapters.",
            "the book began with lots of interesting observations and new ideas, really eye catching so to speak but after a couple of chapters, it is the same thesis rehashed many times with different stories to illustrate the same concept(s). i thought the writer could have done a magazine feature article on this topic instead of writing a full length book. so, definitely borrow the book from the public library as you can finish the whole book in 2 hours. on content alone, this book does not deserve a \"buy\" but deserve a \"borrow\".",
            "The first chapter was enthralling. It tells us how a number of art experts, using the latest available scientific techniques, failed to spot a fake whereas a few other experts, believing in their gut reactions spotted the piece of art work as a fake. Great start.But then the obvious question arose. We all know how our gut reactions, our instincts or 6th sense, call it whatever you might, have failed us in the past. How does one tell the real McCoy from the fake one? I was hoping that the book could help answer that question. It didn't.So what does it make this book? An entertaining read. That's all. It really hasn't changed my decision making process in life, and I doubt it will change anybody's decision making process in their lives either.",
            "After reading this book, never again will I think about thinking the same way again. Never will I look at someone's facial expression and not analyze what they might be thinking. I will hopefully make better split of the moment decisions in things like war simulation games, sports and other high tense situations that may occur. Thin slicing, the new miracle of personality analysis. I will now constantly thinking about why I am making an opinion about someone and try not to have biased opinions about things, I will try and base my thoughts on people about how they act and not things like appearance, age or environment. I will try and listen to my subconcious mind more often and go with my instincts. See with my eyes as they say and not with my mind. I reccommend this book to anyone willing to read it.

            "Malcolm Gladwell expanded his argument through various examples. Insight into events in history as well as inclusion of his own anecdotes provided the momentum that kept the book a page-turner. Blink can easily become a quick read because of its gripping nature. I initially thought his argument was simplistic, but throughout the course of the book, he introduced many layers that made his reasoning much more complex in a pleasant way.This book is highly recommended for anyone who wants to understand decision making on an often subconcious level.",
            "I had read it before and enjoyed it so sent it on for a gift.",
            "I found the book very enjoyable, although chapters four and five had a little too much detail for me.This book is a must read as it clearly presents the role that your unconscious mind plays in decision making. A role that is often discounted and replaced by detailed analytical analysis. In the blink of an eye, your unconscious mind is able to give you insights about a specific situation or object. You may not be able to articulate these insights or justify them to others. However, they are often correct. The author describes a psychologist who can predict whether a marriage will last based on a few minutes observing the couple. This analysis is based on what is called \"thin slicing\" - focusing on the few factors that are critical, without over analyzing. Indeed, great decision makers are often those who have perfected the art of \"thin slicing\".However, the author also points out situations where your unconscious mind can lead you astray. For example when you have been culturally conditioned to believe in a certain way or where you have been conditioned to make certain associations. The author illustrates how people who are not racist, including blacks, can be unconsciously biased (slightly, but enough to make a difference) against blacks.If you are a police officer, thinking of becoming one or know someone who is, you will find Chapter Six: The Delicate Art of Mind Reading very interesting.",
            "\"Blink\" inspires me to listen to my intuition as I pay attention to my initial impulses and not over-think or second-guess myself. Malcolm Gladwell speaks of \"thin slicing\" - that first, unexamined \"intuitive hit\" that we experience before we start to analyze situations. Trusting my intuition can be particularly challenging when I have personal agendas that conflict with intuitive information I receive. I find that my intuitive skill set is easy to access when I am present with any given moment and not lost in my thought process, analyzing every little thing.Another book that has strengthened my intuitive skill-set is Ariel & Shya Kane's \"Working On Yourself Doesn't Work\". It is a brilliant book that has taught me that choices are always appropriate when I don't reach for conclusions based on my past experiences. With their easy & practical principles, I have found a deep sense of ease in my life as I learn to trust my intuition. Within the realm of wellbeing - intuition blooms!",
            "In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell offers us a fascinating survey of recent research in neuroscience and psychology. Much of the book is an examination of \"thin-slicing,\" which Gladwell defines as \"rapid cognition . . . the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behavior based on very narrow slices of experience.\" When we experience gut-level responses, form a first impression, or make a snap judgment, we are thin-slicing, making a decision outside of consciously controlled logical processes.Late in the book, Gladwell describes Blink as \"a journey into the wonders of our unconscious,\" and as a reader moves through his various case studies, you can see why that characterization is fitting. But Gladwell's enthusiasm is always grounded in seriousness. \"We have, as human beings, a storytelling problem,\" he writes. \"We're a bit too quick to come up with explanations for things we don't really have an explanation for.\" The book's case studies, especially the ones on communication patterns between married couples and on war games, are surprising and disturbing, and frequently contain public-policy ramifications.The brain is a chemical and physical marvel, and Gladwell's balanced account of thin-slicing, which often provides better results than our conscious deliberations but which also exposes us to the errors and damage of mistaken conclusions and subtle discrimination, only deepens our respect for its complexity.Blink presents scientific research in clear and compelling language. Gladwell's curiosity, enthusiasm, and humor permeate the book, and idealistic intellectuals should delight in his call to use \"practical problem solving,\" grounded in our understanding of how our thinking actually works, to address social ills such as racially biased criminal convictions.As a reminder of the frequent flaws of conscious decisions and an introduction to the potential of the brain's unconscious power, this book is highly recommended.Armchair Interviews says: Important message for everyone.",
            "Gladwell writes very well. Blink captured my attention for the few hours it took to read it, and it was hard to put down. The problem is that Gladwell focuses more on fluff than on substance. He practices what he preaches, \"thinking without thinking.\" The end result is a book that is entertaining without educating. For me, that is not enough.As Thomas Edison was fond of saying, \"There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking.\" Gladwell gives us lazy people an excuse to rely on our intuition and avoid thinking. But can we tap the power of thinking without thinking? I don't think so.Although not as well-written, and nowhere near as popular, I found Michael LeGault's critique of Blink, titled Think, the better book. In my mind, better think than blink.",
            "This book is a very entertaining one from cover to cover. It is delightfully written (I imagine that Gladwell is a great conversationalist - the writing is very smooth and pleasing).Other reviewers have attacked this book because the writer is not a cognitive expert - they have questioned his credentials and conclusions. This is not a textbook, it's a popular treatment. The author discusses intuition not on the level of psychology professors but on the level of average readers. In my view he does this very well. The author takes an anecdotal approach - each aspect of his theory is supported by his analysis of an event, sometimes backed by interviews with experts.In short, a new take on the idea of intuition that is accessible to the common man, and presented in an entertaining and thought-provoking style.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell has pulled together a series of nicely-told anecdotes about .... something. He doesn't put much effort into trying to explain what is going on, whether in fact anything interesting actually is going on, nor does he make a convincing case that the various examples he uses actually have anything in common. I couldn't see much connection among museum curators being able to recognize fake sculptures, psychologists predicting the strength of a couple's relationship based on watching a conversation, and a former Special Forces soldier using unconventional guerilla tactics to outwit the military establishment. Gladwell's journalistic background comes through in his easy writing style and lack of intellectual rigor. It's easy to read and easy to forget.",
            "How can a few experts tell in a blink of a second that a sculpture is a fake when all of the scientific tests say it is authentic?What is examined in this book is the minds ability to make snap decisions with the barest amount of information and often doing much better than people with unlimited time and information.I have to say that this book is very interesting and actually reflects my personality. The longer I have to think about something the more liekly I will get it wrong. I was trained as an infantry sergeant which requires snap decisions but I have been this way my whole life.On the whole this book was a good read and I recommend it to others but I remember thinking the whole time I was reading it that all of the examples were anecdotal. I can find enough anecdotal evidence to support just about anything no matter how ridiculous. The books major failing is its ability to show any hard data to support its suppositions.Read it but don't take it too seriously",
            "Malcolm Gladwell has done a masterful job of enlightening the reader about the pitfalls of decision making. Due to weaknesses in our cognitive processes, we are subject to flawed decisions that have a wide range of negative consequences, from missed opportunities to deadly results.The book contains a wealth of information for improving organization decision making. For example --- Gladwell's examination of insight is particularly powerful. Organization leaders are often their own worst enemy. Their demand for justification for new ideas often kills these ideas before they have a chance to mature. \"Insight is not a light bulb that goes off inside our heads. It is a flickering candle that can easily be snuffed out.\" This has strong implications for organizations seeking to nurture new ideas for innovation, especially since creative ideas are typically the result of intuitive insight rather than deductive reasoning.- Our preconceived notions work against making effective decisions without our slightest awareness. These biases prevent people from objectively seeing what is actually right before their eyes, even when they are sincerely attempting to be objective.- Frugality in decision making matters. Overloading decision makers with information destroys their ability to intuitively pick up the underlying pattern necessary to make effective decisions.Fortunately there are methods to improve the use of deduction and intuition as well as reduce the impact of biases. Gladwell's engaging writing style brings these points home in colorful stories of real dilemmas for all types of organizations and decision makers.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, which creatively examines the impact and implications of making snap decisions. The variety of examples the author puts forth to explore the significance of intuition is exciting and fascinating. Gladwell finds one aspect that virtually all major industries and successful people in those industries have in common. He uses professional athletes, art historians, music producers, soft drink companies, etc., to show how meaningful it can be to give heed to the most basic instincts we have. I think that he has made an excellent study, however \"cursory\" it may be. I found that I was able to relate to many of the situations in the book, especially the consequences of over-thinking and second guessing yourself. When intuition is a result of subconscious or unconscious \"knowledge\" and not the result of a psycho-emotional judgment (rooted in neuroses), than I think it has the power to help us make excellent decisions that can transform our lives in an instant.",
            "There are a few good ideas in here, which attracted me (as well as millions of others) to pick up this book. I am impressed at the sheer number of people he's convinced to buy his book at first blink. However, Mr Gladwell ultimately falls victim to his own preachings as he seems to shun the alternative logical, methodical way of doing things, resulting in a work with a few interesting but embryonic ideas and no clear flow of themes.What really rankled with me was the writing. It's appalling. From Chapter One: \"He's gotten so good at thin-slicing marriages that he says he can be in a restaurant and eavesdrop on the couple one table over and get a pretty good sense of whether they need to start thinking about hiring lawyers and dividing up custody of the children.\" This is undoubtedly the most tortuous sentence I've read in print. Come on Mr Gladwell, haven't you heard that \"it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing\"?Perhaps he should have taken a cue from \"Freakonomics\" author Steven Levitt and gotten a journalist to do the writing for him. In addition, the editing is just sloppy. The frequent typos quite spoiled for me this otherwise fairly entertaining light read. It's an informal collation of behavioural experiments and amusing incidents illustrating triumphs of instinct, but don't expect to walk away with a clearer understanding of how and when to use this intuition any better. I'm just glad I borrowed it because I wouldn't have paid to read this.",
            "I have just finished listening to this book. I enjoyed it. I found it very interesting and entertaining. Do NOT, however, buy this book for educational purposes. The author tells many stories of how other people are able to use their gift of quick thinking, but gives no instruction on how to enhance this ability in oneself. But, just to reiterate, it was a very enjoyable book.",
            "Oddly, my least favorite read of the Gladwell social-science trilogy has proven to be the most enlightening.It's been valuable to consciously note (though, not always act on) my initial reaction to any person or scenario upon first contact. I've begun recommending it to my people as well.Beyond the direct scope of the book, there's plenty to explore from the \"other side of the Blink\" that is - how to be aware of, and subsequently direct, others' Blinks of you. Combine Blink with Nick Boothman's '90 Seconds or Less' layover duo, (How to Connect in Business...&How to Make People Like You...), and you'll be on top of your cocktail game in no time.TW",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author is very insightful. Now I understand where we get our \"gut feelings\" from. Malcolm Gladwell has outdone himself.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)",
            "The level of benefit you get from a such a book depends on the level of information you believe to receive; in this perspective, I consider this book as \"eye opening\".",
            "This is my third Malcolm Gladwell book in the last 12 months. The title makes it sound like one of those hand-wavy, self-improvement books that will help you be all you can be. Instead it it is a deep look at the power of first impressions and what really happens in those first micro-seconds (ie. in the Blink of an eye).",
            "Really enjoyed this. (Listened to the audio book and find the author's voice very relaxing.)The content is fascinating, as to be expected from Mr G. It's authoritative and eye-opening. Plenty of food for thought. Love it!I'm off now to download The Tipping Point...",
            "I grabbed the book of an airport bookstore...a known author...a catchy title...a good opening! From there it was downhill. Lesson learned...don't buy a book with such minimal information. Read reviews or borrow it from the library first!",
            "A collection of illustrative stories...that helps explain \"that feeling\" when something does not seem right. A well written easy-read.",
            "This is better than the tipping point, but it is not as good asOutliers: The Story of Success",
            "Again, another interesting read with significant relevance to the security professional, despite not being immediately apparent for the less experienced\"",
            "A book filled with flabby logic and intellectual laziness. Very frustrating, as I concur with the underlying premise that we should recognize and employ our gut reactions. This is a popular journalist's version of a subject better handled by someone with more expertise.",
            "I have only read it once, but will read again. Its more insightful then any other book I have read on a broad spectrum of ideas. Sending it to my son, the homicide detective.",
            "I've read many self-help books. I picked up this one espcially because I have \"The Thinker\" personality and it usually takes me time to take in data and decipher information before I make a decision. I can sum up the idea of \"Blink\" in a blink:When it comes to making a decision, often times, there's something inborn in us that (your gut) that can make the \"right\" decision for you in three seconds. So follow your gut! On the other hand, our guts are prejudice at times, and they can lead us to make the wrong decision. So be aware of prejudices you have before going with your gut.The book is filled with examples wherein people made wrong judgements in a blink, such as the electing of Warren Harding as US President, New Coke and Amadou Diallo. Although the books tells you that the right decision can easily come by you, it is short on HOW people can make the right decisions in a blink - and that's what's most disappointing of all.",
            "This book is weighed down with anecdotes, and never delivers on it's central promise of showing you how to train yourself to make good snap decisions.It's still a worthwhile read (particularly if you just skim most of it). The central premise is that our subconscious can make accurate judgments on a variety of subjects in a matter of a second or so. He tells some interesting stories about when you should, and should not, trust these snap judgments, and the nature of some of our biases.Overall a good book, but it could have covered the subject matter as well in a third of the length.",
            "This book is enjoyable, like all of Malcolm Gadwell's writing, but some organizational problems torpedo the main message. It's NOT to trust your instincts; in fact it's almost the reverse. It's that a few key data points can help you make a decision, provided that you have identified those data points through good research or you have enough experience to know what they are. And often the data points that really matter are not obvious. For example the coke/pepsi chapter shows that first-glance instincts tell a non-expert that Pepsi is better than Coke, because a non-expert doesn't understand that in the long run, sweetness will reduce enjoyability. The art experts are able to identify a fake on instinct only because they have a huge set of experience that gave them the ability to figure out what information actually matters, not because instincts matter more than logical analysis.The problem is that this point (find out what data points ACTUALLY matter and then you can make quick, good decisions) is not explicitly stated. I blame a lack of good editing, or sloppiness in a rush to publication, or a desire to being the book with a catchy story even though it misleads. It would have been much better to launch and frame the story around the heart attack data---experts thought that age, gender, smoking, etc. matter most in detecting a real heart attack when they didn't.",
            "Blink is a fine work by the highly engaging author, Malcolm Gladwell. The premise of the book is, might it be that we make better decisions in the first few seconds rather than after hours or days of thinking about it? Well, it depends, but Gladwell presents convincing evidence why many decisions can likely be made nearly instantly. His writing is always captivating and his examples are convincing to many. This is a good book to read so long as you step back and consider alternatives and that more thorough studies are needed to validate his claims. A light read.",
            "I enjoyed Blink quite a bit, but it could have been a little shorter. You pretty much get the point by the 150th page or so.So what is the point of the book? Well, basically it's about what our subconscious is able to process in the blink of an eye. Our subconscious is working constantly to pick up all kinds of signals from the world around us/people around us, and our conscious doesn't know that a lot of this is actually happening. The conscious can also complicate the signals that your subconscious is picking up-maybe that's why people always say go with your first guess on a multiple choice test??Gladwell uses a lot of social examples and clinical studies to back himself up. For example, there is this psychologist who has been studying marital relationships for years. He can tell in a single session whether or not a couple will stay together by reading their faces, inflections, and body language to see what's going on under the surface of their conversation.Psychology is so fascinating because it seems like whenever you learn new things about it, you already kind of knew them! I don't know if that makes sense, but psych sort of opens your eyes to things that you would probably otherwise ignore. I'd suggest reading the book if you haven't already.",
            "Having read Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point a few years back, I decided to read his followup Blink. The main premise behind Blink is that sometimes we don't need all the information in the world to make a correct, quick and informed decision. Our brain processes enough of the information it needs to make a snap decision which most of the time turns out to be a better idea then weighing out too much data. The old adage of \"go with your gut\" seems to be proven by much of Gladwell's writing and reporting on other studies completed.This does not always prove to be the case, however. The \"Pepsi Challenge\" from the 1980s is a good example of this. Whereas people might prefer the taste of Pepsi in a 2 oz cup in a blind taste test, it doesn't mean they will drop Coke altogether and switch to Pepsi. The New Coke disaster of the 80s is an a testament to this.Whereas Gladwell gives us both sides of the coin about whether to trust your gut or weigh out all available information before making a decision, he is inconclusive about which is better. There is no real right or wrong answer, which is disappointing. Nor anywhere in the book is it determined that there is a set of guidelines one should follow to say whether a first impression is the right impression. The Tipping Point gave us closure and a conclusion. Blink gives us ideas and beautifully presented studies which leaves us wanting more. This lake of a final answer takes the book down a peg in this reviewer's humble opinion.Blink is interesting and definitely worth a read. Unfortunately it's not perfect.4/5 stars.",
            "Interesting enough but to add any real depth and concrete info Mr. Gladwell should do further research into the conscious and unconscious minds. The entire book discussed the surface matter (Blink) but without any clue about the actual foundation (namely the conscious and unconscious minds). I was very disappointed with the book as there was no significant conclusion or something concrete I could take away that would have meant the time I used reading the book was worthwhile. The book is just story after story that backs up his blink theory...I got it after the first 2 and did not need to read another 20 all saying and proving the exact same thing. Meaningless and pointless and yes I'm disappointed because this was my first Gladwell book and it will definitely be my last.",
            "I read this book in a day and a half. I could't stop reading it. It was smooth as reading a novel, yet so full of information and concepts. Throughout the book the author Malcolm Gladwell is smarting moving gradually from concepts more easy to grasp and accept to more difficult ones as he touches issues we perhaps don't want to accept as easily.The book starts by making a very interesting point regarding the \"blink\" we are able to have, the intuition we have that something is either wrong or right, or one way or another, and how that may well be the better judgement we can ever make of something. The book then follows on and shows how this intuition, this understanding from the unconscious mind as he calls it is a quick unconscious interpretation of all the information we have stored in our heads, which we cannot correctly and quickly enough analyse with our conscious/thinking mind, but which we can with our unconscious mind. The author then goes further and shows how these unconscious decisions are either correct or wrong depending on the accumulated information we carry on our minds.The unconscious mind making a good decision: the tennis coach that could correctly predict when a player was going to double fault in a match with 90 to 100% precision, but could't understand how he was predicting it.The unconscious mind making a bad decision: the orchestra conductor systematically not hiring women specially in instruments traditionally considered man instruments because their ability to listen correctly and have a good judgement on whether the player was good or not was affected and influenced by their unconscious mind and all the stored prejudiced against women players.And just as I was finishing the book and thinking to myself: \"This is very nice information and sure explains a lot of the behaviour I see around me but how do we use it to our advantage? How do we go on implementing it, how do we fix the bias and use the intuition capacity of our mind to our advantage?\", the author dare us to think in our lives, to think in the processes we lead or participate in, what information is in excess and is confusing our mind to take the correct decision and filter that information so that we do not have access to it. He gives the example of the orchestras in the US which in 25 years of having behind the screen auditions increased the number of women players form 5 to 50%. The author suggests something similar is done in courts where people should not see the person being accused of a crime.I hope the book also get reads by physicians. The example the book gives of a doctor which was able through a mathematical and statistical approach identify the key parameters in confirming whether a person was indeed suffering a heart attach and draw an equation and a decision tree based on those parameters is nothing knew to science and engineering. I hope the medical community starts doing more of that. What an statistic and mathematical approach to the issue at hand is able to do is to put into an equation the knowledge otherwise acquired only through experience. By doing so, our mind is then free to grasp other principles which somehow we have not been able to put into equations (and perhaps we never will) and can only be gained through experiences and be processed in our unconscious mind.Different people will get a different perspective of the book depending on the circumstances they are living, to me the above is a summary of what I got most from the book.",
            "Interesting ideas, but I don't think I would have invested the time required to finish the book; whereas, with a CD I listened to it while I was doing routine day to day driving.",
            "In Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, Malcolm Gladwell explains that \"thin-slicing\", the ability to sum up a situation and make decisions and assumptions based on very little time and what seems like very little information, is sometimes as good or better than making decisions after lots of thought and research. He gives the reader lots of examples including salesmen, war tactics, firemen, hospitals, job hiring, science, museums, and relationships, among many others. I find that the examples are fascinating because it seems like there is a lot of truth in it all. People give the subconscious much less credit than it deserves. By \"thin-slicing\", one's subconscious makes decisions and choices all day long even when one does not feel like they are actually doing so. One's subconscious can pick up on little thoughts and indications that sometimes one does not even know they have.However, Gladwell also addresses the fact that sometimes one's subconscious can make the wrong decision based on biases that one may not even be aware of. Therefore, there is a time and a place for snap judgments, or \"thin-slicing\", but there is also a time and a place for careful and detailed research and analysis. His examples at the beginning are very strong but as the book goes on they get more and more vague and disconnected from what seemed like his main point originally. Overall though I enjoyed the book and found it very interesting because the stories and examples are engaging and amusing.",
            "Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell interestingly enough is a book that will make you think about thinking. The idea that most of our decisions are made in the blink of an eye and that we can't even explain the reasoning behind them is intriguing and sometimes a little scary. Readers may find themselves pausing while going about their everyday activities to question a decision they made without realizing they made it. Gladwell describes the concept in a way that leaves the reader wondering why they never thought of the points he makes. His examples give a deeper understanding of the idea of making a decision without knowing why even if the examples are sometimes experiments that make the reader squirm a little as they read. The section where Gladwell discusses a military exercise gives a moment's pause about the inflexibility of military thinking but could also be applied to any situation that pits two groups against one another. Gladwell also spends quite a bit of time talking about the results of testing that examine our preconceived and possibly subconscious thoughts about others. He explains the benefits and the pitfalls of thinking without thinking. Blink is a simple but powerful and fascinating look into the way our brain works often without our knowledge to make split-second decisions.",
            "Disappointment comes along when you get far less than what you'd expect. I am simply disappointed at this book. Read hundreds of pages to understand what the author tries to delivery to its readers. Here they are:- \"Subconscious part of human brain can be overwhelmed and eventually become dysfunctional if loaded with more information than the brain needs in order to make decisions.\" Well, this is called redundant info. This can, of course, paralyze your decision making process because your brain needs to factor this redundant data into decision making process even in the dark side (subconscious). So there is nothing new here.- \"The dark-side of our brain, people can have biased attitudes towards others on the basis of race, gender, weight, height. Nothing fancy here either.\" Even advertisers use various techniques to conquer a piece from this side of our brain to have us make biased decisions when we see their product on the shelf or TV. or simply switch to a news channel.- \"Our subconscious is so powerful that sometimes it helps us see something while others keep looking or make decisions that turn out to be good later down the road.\"- \"Rapid cognition and snap judgements are some good examples of how human subconscious works.\"It would be nice to read something about how this \"subconscious\" in human brain develops over time since we are born as the majority of the points in the book revolve around this \"subject\". Happy readings.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell seems to have made a career out of writing one-idea books and turning them into bestsellers! I liked this one better than the Tipping Point (some ideas have \"stickiness but we don't really know why) and Outliers (It takes ten thousand hours to become expert at something- perspiration instead of inspiration)Having said all that, Gladwell writes very well. It's smooth ride from start to finish and there are some moments that will yield genuine surprise. These books read like some sort of dissertation, a hypothesis with supporting arguments. But you always feel that the question was decided at the outset and Gladwell doesn't present or deal with much information to contradict his hypothesis. In that sense, perhaps it is (as one reviewed remarked) one part \"junk science\"",
            "Mr. Gladwell explores in detail the nuances of first impressions and the split-second decisions we make based on those first impressions. This his second book which was followed by Outliers - which focused on how those we consider excellent become excellent - this book focuses on how snap judgments can oftentimes be absolutely correct judgments. It also delves into how sometimes snap judgments can be horribly wrong and even at times deadly.My opinion:After reading Mr. Gladwell's third book Outliers and being extremely impressed Blink only goes on to solidify Mr. Gladwell's reputation for excellent research woven into intriguing storytelling. If you ever wondered if your \"hunch\" about someone was right...Gladwell shows proof that often times it is in fact correct. I enjoyed this book for the most part but at times the truth that Gladwell exposes raises concern; especially to someone whom, like Gladwell, shares ancestors from the African continent and thus is exposed to many snap judgments that are not helpful to the one being judged simply because of the color of one's skin. That being said, the book gives the reader many reasons to \"trust their gut\" while also giving situations when it might be a better idea to second-guess said \"gut\".",
            "I was assigned this book for my AP Econ class and was worried that it was going to be like an English summer reading assignment, where you dreaded picking up the book and beginning. But as I started the book, I could not put it down. Even while I was on vacation, I still had it in hand reading. Blink discusses the reasons why we do the things we do and it was very interesting. The writing was entertaining and easy to understand. Some may be skeptical about a book dealing with the economy, but this book deals with the pyschology behind it all. I recommend this book to anyone.",
            "Most of the so-so or negative reviews I've seen of this book base their opinions on the cohesiveness of the examples Gladwell uses. In doing so, I think they're missing the point, and worse - the overall message.Part of the reason for this is in the book's name and marketing. The name, \"Blink\" seems to suggest that every example in this book will showcase some amazing decision made in a split second. The Amazon review (which I suspect comes from the physical book's dust cover - I listened to the unabridged audiobook) supports this view, in the first sentence, which reads, \"Blink is about the first two seconds of looking -- the decisive glance that knows in an instant\". \"Blink\" makes a great book name, and the synopsis sounds intriguing, but does not accurately describe the goal of the book. In a bit of irony, considering the book's content, I feel that many readers are unsatisfied with the book because their expectations are different from what it delivers.I don't know if that is Gladwell's fault, or the Publisher's, but either way, you shouldn't let that get in the way of enjoying and learning from this book.This book is really about how we make decisions, and how focusing on a few important pieces of information is often more important than gathering as much data as possible and trying to organize it in a way that it helps us make a more informed decision. In a day and age where technology gives us instant access to more information than we've ever had at our fingertips, it is refreshing to see scientific proof that too much data can actually HARM the decision process, and result in worse decision-making. This doesn't always happen in the blink of an eye, as the book's marketing has you believe, but the concept of \"less is more\" when making decisions is consistent throughout the book, in each fascinating example.The breadth and variety of examples not only help make the book more interesting for the reader, but also helps us understand how this concept might help us view and weigh decisions differently. As a geek and technophile, I have a tendency to gather as much information as possible to weigh and analyze before making a decision. Reading this book has made me realize that all the best decisions I have made have focused on just a few important pieces of information. Though they seem simple and obvious in retrospect, this book highlights how easy it is to get lost in a forest of information. Even the very best experts and largest companies with enormous research budgets are capable of great successes or failures based on the smallest and most basic differences in decision-making.I don't know if this book makes decision-making harder or easier for me, but I think it is a more enjoyable read if you don't base your expectations on the name and synopsis. It isn't about the Warren Harding effect, thin-slicing, or weighing complex decisions in the blink of an eye, though all of these come up in the examples. It is an exploration of how a simpler approach to decisions can be more effective in many cases.",
            "I am a fan of Gladwell's work but his book \"Blink\" seemed a little light. Increasingly, when modern research is telling us that our brains are easily tricked, this book seems to go against this trend. I understand the concept of a gut check or gut instinct, but Galdwell seems to stress this above logic and sound reasoning. I was always a fan of before any hard decision - sleep on it. It is almost like he is saying that you can judge a book by its cover? Isn't this how con artist operate (or shady used car salesmen). They assume you will make snap decisions without really thinking it through. In the end the book felt a little like a series of articles or short stories. It never really felt whole. If you want one of Gladwell's better works, read \"Outliers\".",
            "I thought this book would teach me how to make decisions faster but really leaves you wondering when to make quick decision or not. It does not guide you it how to make quick decision as we often need to do.",
            "My brother had told me about this book and some of the social experiments that were talked about in it. I thought it sounded pretty interesting, so I bought it. Now, I'm not quite finished with it as of yet, but I'm really into it. It helps you think more about smaller things and pay more attention to things you normally wouldn't.I recommend it.",
            "This book is a fascinating treatise of how we use our intuitive mind to make snap judgements. The author takes us into situations where our mind can lead us to places we had no idea it inhabited. We get a graphic look at how unconsciously we are prejudiced and why we react the way we do to certain people, colors, tastes, animals & inanimate objects.You will see clearly how you are manipulated by the marketing industry all the way back to the original marketing concepts of \"Imperial Margarine\" & \"the Pepsi Challenge\". The material is surprsing and will help you gain insight into how marketing affects our everyday choices. You can clearly understand how marketing affects children who are exposed to hours & hours of TV ads from infancy to adulthood.You come to understand that it is possible to educate your mind (ie: hone your skills) so that you can enhance your power of snap judgements, intuitions, \"thin slicing\", face recognition etc. to react in a rational manner to situations.When I first began reading this book, I thought to myself that it would make it would make a perfect companion to Gavin de Becker's book, THE GIFT OF FEAR, & I was right because Mr. Gladwell, the author of this book, begins to quote examples from Mr. de Becker's book on page 230.The last chapter of this book lays bare the erroneous thought that we have the ability to judge based solely on what we see and hear. Rather that we are uncounsciously programmmed by subtle & not so subtle prejudices picked up from our families & the world around us. If we can educate ourselves to set these thoughts aside, we might just see how much we are missing.",
            "I bought this book all excited because various critics raved about it. I also love insights into human behavior. Was I ever disappointed? Mr Gladwell starts off well,his stories reporting seemingly unusual events are interesting and well written, his analysis highly flawed and his agenda pretty evident. I would suggest that Mr Gladwell stick to books telling amusing anecdotes , and leave the analysis of these anecdotes to psychologists because he doesn't have a clue. His conclusions on speed dating and the car salesman is stretching the truth so far that its quite amazing that a publisher would bother publishing this as anything other than fiction.",
            "I just heard Malcolm Gladwell on CNN. He actually said that as soon as he grew his hair into what was a mini-afro, which he was sporting during the interview with Anderson Cooper - he started getting speeding tickets all of a sudden, as well as being hassled at the airport on a regular basis. It was such a lie. If you ever see a picture of this man, you'll know he's lying. He ain't getting hrassed at the airport looking like that, that's for sure. So we know right off that he's a liar. Anderson Cooper laughed thinking it was a joke for a second and asked him if he was serious. Gladwell said that he was actually serious. I didn't buy it; I'm not sure about Anderson but if he didn't he wouldn't have shown it, anyway. Gladwell is an obvious fake. No need to elaborate any further.My problem with Gladwell is that he takes valid points outside the context of his arguments and then ties them to his own totally subjective conclusions. The IAD tests he mentions are a total joke. Most of the book is common sense stuff that sgould only surprise you if you're not that bright to begin with. His analysis on height biase is also just common sense extrapolated from some out of context example and then added to subjective conclucions.Most of the biase is actually from Gladwell himself, who is ONLY in favour of an analysis which shows height and race and other biases. An analysis that would explore an alternative interpretation isn't even explored by Gladwell. Why not? In the end, Gladwell succedes only in promoting paranoia by creating new target groups and unfairly exaggerating the disadvantages of others. Don't buy this book. He makes alot of money by giving naive people a lot of nothing to worry about. GLADWELL: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND A REAL THINKER IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEAR ABBY AND STEPHEN HAWKING.

I think this is a great book that is very insightful. Could be read by psychology buffs or practically anyone interested in thought processes. Would recommend this book and The Tipping Point!",
            "The book is an easy read and full of wonderful stories and vignettes that illustrate Malcolm's points. Essentially the book is about how people make rapid decisions, often before consciously processing the available data, and the good and bad consequences of this. We are all familiar with some of the negative consequences - racial stereotyping for instance - but Malcolm discuses some of the positive ways this impacts effective decision-making. Using a relatively small case of characters and some richly described stories he leads us through an understanding of how rapid cognition works, why it is different from how we analyze things and how it can be more or less effective that any approaches to problem solving.I particularly enjoyed the stores about people who had trained their snap judgments so that they could make quick and accurate assessments of situations while not being distracted by misplaced reactions and those about how hard it can be to describe a reaction, even if it is a good one.This book is highly recommended for anyone interested in how people make decisions.",
            "Even though this book starts off with a bang, I did not find the information conclusive. Based on anecdotes, the book lacks empirical data. Gladwell points out that once we have acquired a significant amount of information in a particular field, then related decisions tend to be more accurate. His \"thin slicing\" concept is worth a read. I recommend the author's previous book, The Tipping Point.",
            "A fantastic book, tells I like it is! Lives are guided by instant subconscious decisions, choices made - futures secured or lost in the flash of an eye.

            "I was enjoying the interesting concept of this book until, in the last half, Gladwell's agenda came out with clear force. I was set-up. Use real world cases and all sides of the case until you want to push the agenda and then tell only one side, and what only one side should have done to avoid snap judgements. It's incredibly irresponsible to have left out what was left out of the last half of this book.If there's 100 points of data that tell the whole story of \"blink\", Gladwell hand-picks the 20 that fit his desire to demonize police while laying no responsibility on individuals who act as criminals and completely disregards crime-to-race proportions. You must suspend reality to believe Gladwell's assumption that gun-related crime is totally unrelated to race in bad neighborhoods. Because clearly no one should assume based on real numbers and shady behavior in an out of the ordinary situation that anything out of the ordinary is occuring. Gladwell would have us assume, and control our reaction in a life or death situation in the \"blink of an eye\", that dangerously acting individuals in incredibly dangerous places and situations should be treated as if they were 80-year-old grandmothers in broad daylight.No mention is made of what the criminals could have done to avoid the confrontation. Perhaps he left it out since my 8 year-old nephew could spell it out. If police yell \"POLICE! DON'T MOVE!\" then you might want to stop moving. If you continue to move and dig in your pockets you are not only asking to be shot, you should be shot. Gladwell's one-sided agenda is sickening in this particular part of the book.It's a clearly picked-evidence piece that takes a conveniently limited, one-sided cross-section of the research to slide it's agenda onto the bestseller list under assumed pretenses. If you appreciate personal accountability, total fairness on all sides of a situation, and true responsibility, don't bother buying/reading this biased disappointing opinion.",
            "I liked his book on the tipping point. Sure, he didn't coin the term, but he surfaced some interesting points on how it happens. I got to page 50 on this one and gave up the ghost. I fell for the sequel syndrome. Don't you. A snore.",

He also informs the reader that snap judgments are not merely relegated to NFL quarterbacks.",
            "I really liked this book. Read the whole thing at a bookstore. Fascinating look at how we humans make up our minds much quicker and with much less data than we think we do. I believe Gladwell is bringing us closer to the truth about how humans really make decision.",
            "I took away a lot from this book through its anecdotes. The content of this book is stimulating and fresh. I was getting excited and sucked in with the potential of where this was going.Then some of the anecdotes went on a bit long but I could live with that.However the book suddenly ground to a halt without drawing it all together and looking at the implications for readers wanting to hone their own ability to use 'blink' intuition/gut-feel in their own lives.Right at the end he also added an anecdote that pretty much contradicted one presented earlier. He'd earlier spoken of a musician who was best evaluated when you could see his total presence. At the end he talks of better evaluating a musican performing behind a screen. While both were discussed in different contexts, it would have been good to integrate these disparate findings and fine-tuning the learning these offer as the outcomes had different implications.I must say that since I finished the book my mind has been buzzing around making connections from the content he presented and I've been much enriched by this. It would be nice to think this was the effect of an approach to writing he deliberately set up so that we'd have to make what we could of the book through our own Blink/intuition. Then again perhaps it needed more writing and careful editing!So the paradoxical - it disappointed yet I'm richer for it and glad I read it - and may lend it to friends!",

            "Malcolm Gladwell has a genius for synthesis; in \"Blink,\" he weds the research of experimental psychologists to big, pressing \"real world\" problems, such as preventing police brutality, or making employment standards sensitive to an applicant's true merit rather than to, say, gender or race. For example, he reviews Claude Steele's research on self-stereotyping to explain how individuals sensitive about gender, race, or even height may have difficulty behaving in a way inconsistent with those stereotypes. Or, he describes how how psychologist John Gottman has been able to predict with 95% accuracy whether a couple will remain married for another 15 years based only on their facial expressions observed over the course of an hour's argument.Here's a great example of what I mean by synthesis: he describes research on how decisions made in a very short time (split seconds) cause people to rely on hard-wired or stereotyped associations (say, between the race of a victim such as Amadou Diallou and the likelihood of the thing in his pocket being a gun). The effect is exacerbated when people make decisions in groups. Then, he carefully breaks down the events of the Diallou shooting - multiple decisions about Diallou's intent, threat, etc, followed by his shooting in a hail of 41 bullets-all of which took only 7 seconds total. He makes a compelling case that Diallou's death was in part due to the close quarters in which the decision was taken (leaving only a few yards and a second or two between cop and victim), as well as to the number of cops having to make the call. He even provides a tentative solution - police officers who patrol alone are less likely to get into this sort of trouble, because they are more cautious and give themselves more time to \"override\" these mistaken and stereotyped associations.For the \"layperson,\" Gladwell makes lively and relevant experiments that would, if we read them ourselves, might appear obscure and clinical. For the psychologist (among whom I include myself), it's a bit of a thrill to see that hours of toil in a lab can have some real impact on how important real-world decisions are made.I do have one very small beef with the book (it could hardly be smaller): I think the subtitle (\"The Power of Thinking without Thinking\") is misleading and undersells the book. It makes it sound like lightweight self-help that is universally positive about the power of instantaneous thought. In fact, the book is quite balanced on the subject of when and whether \"thin-sliced\" thought results in better or worse decisions.More than anything, though, I admire Gladwell's taste: he has a knack of identifying great illustrations, the great psychology that supports them, and making a crystal-clear connection between the two. Again and again I found myself thinking \"you know, a good experiment for him to illustrate this concept would be so-and-so's,\" only to find that specific example on the next page.I know of no journalist who commands the respect of social scientists to the extent Malcolm Gladwell does, and I expect this will be the average reader of \"Blink\" will feel the same respect for this fascinating book.",
            "This lighweight book is a surprise. You do expect some analysis and content when reading a book on the current state of thinking about brain activity. There is no substance here.There are lots of anecdotes about supposedly instant analysis of tennis swings, statues, and the like. The thing that is not credited is the time, effort, study and intellectual training it takes to erect the pattern recognition process that is behind these \"instant\" decisions. (As if an untrained individuals' instant conclusion about anything would be of any value whatsoever.) There are trained people in many professions who can arrive at a conclusion quickly -- especially on how to categorize a situation or an object which relates to their field. They have internalized the schema of that field, and it is this unconscious competance that makes them an expert. So --- what else is new here?Not a piece I would compare with Penrose, Dennett or any of the scholars of brain activity. Sadly, in my opinion, I wasted my time.",
            "\"Blink\" starts explosively, presenting a hypothesis which would probably come as a shock and a revelation to most people. Gladwell quickly makes a strong case for the equality of instantaneous decisions with detailed, analyzed decision-making, through a series of disparate but consistently powerful case studies.The book then moves onto explaining why the quick-fix decision making process works so often, the core of the explanation lying in the ability of the brain to \"thin slice\" i.e. recognize the few key pieces of information in any situation required to make sense of it, made possible by the human brain's ability to process efficiently and rapidly copious quantities of information stored in the human unconscious.It is here that the book begins to falter, for instead of delving deeper into the theory, Gladwell starts presenting related concepts and a never-ending string of case studies. While the case studies individually make for interesting reading, collectively, they become burdensome. The book's weakest part comes into light only after substantial passage, when one realizes that Gladwell is really not going to provide much insight into how one can begin to harness the power of \"blink\" decision-making and make it more effective for ourselves.To Gladwell's credit, however, the book is written in a lucid and interesting style, making complex concepts highly accessible for the layman. Finally, the book is genuinely thought-provoking, which in itself is a sufficient reason for adding this book to one's collection.",
            "I really liked this book. Much of it is plain old common sense. Trust your intuition. Your first instinct is often correct. But there are times that we can't trust our initial impressions because of inherent biases and Gladwell discusses these instances. Sometimes it's hard to get past the barrier of physical looks, race, age, etc. for us to make a sound decision.I do take issue with the idea that speed dating is just as effective as any other kind of dating. If that's the case, we certainly are falling in love based on some very superficial reactions! Speed dating seems crazy to me unless we want to find out whether or not we have an attraction or chemistry with another person. But how could we have any idea of what a person is really like or how we will click with them after talking to them for four minutes in a stressful situation?The book was interesting, illuminating and well-written; however, it was redundant. Gladwell continued to make the same point throughout the book and to hammer it home with various examples. Also, at the end, I was confused about whether or not I really could trust my intuition because of all of the different variables that come into play in certain situations. So, in many ways, I felt as though I was back to square one when I had finished reading it!Sigrid MacdonaldAuthor of D'Amour Road[...]",
            "A quick read, concise and clear, \"Blink\" gives us much-needed insight into the preconditioning and hidden clues our minds use to make decisions. Malcolm Gladwell obviously has the gift of rapport, which enables him to distill the essense from the life work of many psychologists and share these nuggets of knowledge with us. For instance, when Gladwell watches John Gottman observe married couples in his laboratory, videotaped interviews can reveal small signs of negative interactions between the spouses, such as fleeting indications of contempt. These signs can predict with great accuracy whether or not a marriage will survive, even though the couple is unaware of the problems they may be facing. Learning to read the hidden emotions that Paul Eckman has learned to identify by observing fleeting facial expressions provides the key to the real thoughts of someone with whom you're interacting. This is particularly important in law enforcement, and Gladwell emphasizes that this skill must be trained into police officers under stressful conditions to prevent such tragedies as the police shooting of the unarmed Amadou Diallo in the Bronx or the beating of Rodney King. \"Blink\" summarizes many areas of important research that bring us all a little closer to our basic interconnectedness.",
            "The premise presented in Blink is interesting, and Gladwell certainly spins the research to support his position that the \"gut\" decisions we make are often the most important. However, Gladwell does little to make his point through the examples he uses, as he uses illustrations of individuals making decisions in their respective fields who have years and years of experience. OF COURSE these people will tend to make better/on-the-fly decisions than someone with little or no experience.This book read like a lengthy case study, supported by chapters of research and examples; not to mention, repetition - to drive his point home. The concept of Blink may have been better presented a'la three-part article series in Time Magazine or another consumer-facing publication. As a book, it seems to drag on unnecessarily.",
            "I was interested in the premise of this book, that we can \"know without knowing why we know\" and can utilize this hunch in making decisions. Gladwell provides many interesting anecdotes (at times you feel like you're reading the good parts of an intro to psychology text), but that's really all he does. He doesn't leap to anything in the way of conclusions or exercises to further experience this phenomenon. Of course, once we become aware of our \"adaptive subconscious,\" we begin to tread on tenuous territory, muddling precisely on what we focus. So, you really can't fault him for that; he's doing all he can by providing what he does.Overall, I enjoyed \"Blink\" and would recommend it as a light read. It does make for good discussions and personal revelations. I myself wish I would have several times listened to that \"blink\" subconscious, intead of opening up the Pandora's box of other options. My only criticism is that Gladwell becomes a little repetitive at times and the book itself begins to drag. But not that big of a deal.",
            "At the outset, I feel obliged to point out that I am unqualified to comment on neurological material which Gladwell includes and discusses in this volume. For example, what Patrick Murray refers to in his own review: \"The fusiform gyrus is not a piece of brain software (page 219), the midbrain doesn't hijack the forebrain much less reach up to hijack it (page 225), and it is doubtful that rapid heart beats shut down the motor systems or any other brain component (pages 220-225).\" The comments which follow limit their attention to what I understand to be Gladwell's core concepts and key assertions with regard to the decision-making process. These are the ones which are of greatest interest to me:1. What Gladwell refers to as \"the adaptive unconscious\" has a much greater influence on our judgments as well as on our pre-judgments (or prejudices) than most of us realize. This explains why we often react with \"intuitive\" repulsion or attraction to another person...or to a given option, peril, suggestion, opportunity, request, etc.2. \"Paralysis by analysis\" can result in what Gladwell refers to as \"momentary autism\" (i.e. a non-decision) which may or may not prove beneficial.3. In certain crises (e.g. an ambush, a train wreck, a medical emergency), snap decisions must often be made without benefit of sufficient information. \"The power of knowing, in that first two seconds, is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few. It is an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves.\"For me this last is Gladwell's most important point, one which he really could have developed in much greater depth: It is not only possible but highly desirable to become so knowledgeable about a given subject that one can almost immediately complete an accurate diagnosis and then take or recommend appropriate action. I have personally observed this skill on numerous occasions in emergency rooms, automotive shops, and during appliance service calls. The physician, mechanic, or electrician quickly checks out the most revealing symptoms and then knows (if not \"in that first two seconds\") precisely what must be done. Theirs are really not \"snap\" decisions; rather, they are based on years of experience which have revealed the criteria by which to make the most appropriate judgments in a timely manner.I am intrigued by the possibility that when one develops the skill by which to make such judgments, each such judgment then becomes what Gladwell characterizes as a \"tipping point,\" after which there is an acceleration of subsequent events, results, consequences, etc. Perhaps in his next book, Gladwell will explore that possibility.",
            "I really enjoyed reading the book \"Blink\" by Malcolm Gladwell. It is an easy read yet very profound. I said to myself \"wow! How many times have I known in an instant that I was right about something but because it was inconvenient at the time to acknowledge it, I disregarded what I knew\". In the end my initial hunch was correct!I really enjoyed the chapter \"Seven Seconds in the Bronx: The Delicate Art of Mind reading\". It was about the NYPD's encounter with Amadou Diallo but it really hit home the concept of \"the judgments we make and the impressions we form of other people\". In the case of Amadou Diallo the policemen's \"mind reading\" was way off base. Many times people rely on past experiences to dictate how they should act NOW and ignore theinformation right in front of them. Simply put, they were not present.A book I really enjoyed about being present is Ariel & Shya Kanes, How To Create a Magical Relationship. One powerful chapter in the book was \"You are not the story of your life\". It reminded me of all the times that my expectations of how something should turn out caused it to turn out exactly as I had expected, as if it were a self-fulfilling prophecy. I realized it was my unconscious expectations that determined the outcome of something, rather than seeing what was truly in front of me and making the appropriate choices. I highly recommend both of these books.",
            "While it's not the same idea as The Tipping Point, it's a similarly interesting one, and leave it to Gladwell to pull together the most wide-ranging variety of examples to make his points come to life.Whether it's art fraud, the Coke/Pepsi taste test or a $250 million war game exercise where a rogue Arab state (played by a retired general) sank our Persian Gulf fleet using fishing boats and Cessnas, it makes for some damn fine reading.Of particular fascination was the opening segment about how researchers were able to observe couples interacting and based on watching just minutes of footage could tell you with amazing accuracy whether they would still be together seven years from now.It's an excellent book that takes aim at overly-cautious, committeed-to-death, CYA decision making. It's not advocating snap judgements (not the same thing)... you'll see if you read it.Definitely a pass-around book once you've finished it, as The Tipping Point was. Not too long, quick read... a few slower passages here and there but all in all it breezes by.",
            "I am reading blink for the 2nd time now due to the enjoyment I had when I first read it. It is a very animated and easy to read book that basically highlights several examples of our adaptive unconscious mind and how it works and comes up with decisions. He also dwells on the concept of thin slicing which is the predicting patterns and behaviors/trends by zooming in on the slices of experiences that matter the most and coming up with a rather unsconscious decision from it.. I really love the book and highly recommend it. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because it merely highlights how the process works but does not provide means and ways of improving our skills of the adaptive unsconciscous.. however the author points out to other works by authors like Paul Ekman and John Gotman and others that provide the next step...",

            "The first half of the book was an interesting read. The main idea and the meat of the book is unique and thought provoking. The latter half of the book felt like the author was trying to hit a word limit as it got redundant. He sold me his ideas in this first half of the book and lost me in the second half.",
            "I'd seen Mr. Gladwell's interviews on television about his book several months ago. So when I saw the title sitting on the shelf at the library my thinslicer nearly snapped my elbow in two to take it home.This is literally the most interesting book that I've read in years. Mr. Gladwell doesn't try to convince you that your brain is too sophisticated to ever be doubted. He doesn't try to tell you that it's so fallible that you ought to run a mathmatical diagram to back yourself up, either. He gives you a look at the different ways that the \"snap judgements\" work for us and against us.I had an instance several years ago, after my sister in law had died in a car accident, that made perfect sense after reading this book. I'd halfway thought I'd had some sort of \"psychic\" interlude or a \"God had touched my heart\" thing, which I'm in no way inclined towards. My brothers wife had died about 6 months before this. He and I were in our respective vehicles. I was driving towards him on the road that we live on. A two lane road that we passed each other on many times. As I passed him, keep in mind this was at 35-40 mph, there was something about the position of his head that it immeditately went through my mind that something was very wrong. I didn't get a look at his face. I was driving and just took a glance after recognizing his truck. I turned around in a parking lot and followed him home. He was so overwhelmed by grief that day that he was honestly a hairs breadth from a complete emotional nervous breakdown. This man is one of the strongest, most resilient man I know, but his wife's death was about to send him over the edge. I spent the rest of the afternoon with him. Letting him talk, and listening to him tell me about her. By the end of the day he had come down off of that terrible place and he's moved on in life.This book made me finally realize what that split second glance had been for me. Not that I'm an expert on my brother. Not that if I were to see that exact same situation in a rank stranger that I'd have the same reaction... just that my mind took the scene and broke it down and put it back together in a frame of time that is absolutely infinitesimal, and gave it back to me in a quick \"hunch\" to tell me that something was wrong with my brother.Mr. Gladwell isn't trying to sell you on this. Merely to highlight it and help you to look at why things happen in life and marvel over what a amazing machine we all have in our grasp.There's a quote that I believe is by Zig Ziggler? Which goes along the lines of... \"Information can circle the world in a second and take 20 years to penetrate that quarter inch of space between my ear and my brain\". Don't let that happen to you.",
            "The author feeds you some entertaining anecdotes about everyting from the fraud archelogical findings to cops in extreme circumstances to marketing research. Unfortunately, the point of the book is a very primitive one: sometimes we are right in our snap judgements and sometimes we are wrong. He even comes up with the a catchy new term: \"thin slicing\". In my opinon however, the only place where you can't go wrong with thin slicing is a deli. So, go spend your money on a nice sandwich and skip this book. If you must read it - get it from a library.",
            "You've probably been to a doctor who starts talking to you, but never really listens to what you have to say . . . if that be the case, then you'll probably find the doctor wanting . . . andyou should listen to your feelings because you've engaged in a practice known as \"thin-slicing,\" wherein you take what matters most from an overwhelming number of variables.Malcolm Gladwell (author of THE TIPPING POINT, a previous favorite of mind about how we understand the world around us) explains the aforementioned concept in BLINK, a dandy little book with a subtitle that says it all: THE POWER OF THINKING WITHOUT THINKING.He looks at how choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--aren't always as simple as they seem . . . yet some people seem to be able to make them successfully; e.g., the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact . . . by the same token, Gladwell examines why \"blink\" theory has led to such great failures as New Coke.I especially enjoyed reading about the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minuets of observing a couple . . . the key: If Gottman observes one or both partners in a marriage showing contempt toward the other, heconsiders it the single most important sign that the marriage is in trouble.There were several other memorable passages; among them:[analyzing people involved in speed dating] Kailynn stood to the side, by the bar that ran across one wall of the room. \"If you are enjoying the connection, time goes quickly. If you aren't, it's the longest six minutes of your life,\" she said as she watched the couplesnervously chatter. \"Sometimes strange things happen. I'll never forget, back in November, there was a guy from Queens who showed up with a dozen red roses, and he gave one to every girl he spoke to. He had a suit on.\" She gave a half smile. \"He was ready to go.\"[comparing sales of cars] The results were stunning. The white men received initial offers from the salesmen that were $725 above the dealer's invoice (that is, what the dealer paid for the car from the manufacturer). White women got initial offers of $935 above invoice. Black women were quoted a price, on average, of $1,195 above invoice. And black men? Their initial offer was $1,687 above invoice. Even after forty minutes of bargaining, the black men could get the price, on average, down to only $1,551 above invoice. After lengthy negotiations, Ayres's black men still ended up with a price that was nearly $800 higherthat Ayres's white men were offered without having to say a word.[explaining why there are more women now in orchestra] The fact that there are now women playing for symphony orchestras is not a trivial change. It matters because it has opened up a world of possibility for a group that had been locked out of opportunity. It also matters because by fixing the first impression at the heart of the audition--by judging purely on the basis of ability--orchestras now hire better musicians, and better musicians mean better music. And how did we get better music? Not by rethinking the entire classical music enterprise or building new concert halls or pumping in millions of new dollars, but by paying attention to the tiniest detail, the first two seconds of the audition.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell is one of my all-time favorite writers and I always rejoice when the latest New Yorker includes one of his articles. Tipping Point focused on the way critical mass influences everything from crime statistics to footwear choices. Blink directs our attention (paradoxically) to unconscious thought processes.As always, Gladwell relies on findings from mainstream research to make his points. He cites psychologists whose work belongs on syllabuses of graduate seminars. Unfortunately, that's where most of their work ends up, when in fact there are enormous implications for all parts of our lives.Blink begins by noting that often we need only small \"thin slices\" of information to make predictions about behavior and events. For instance, psychologist Gottman can predict whether a couple will divorce after listening to only a few minutes of dialogue. Researchers Levinson and Ambady found that they could predict a doctor's likelihood of being sued not from his technical skills, but from an analysis of his personality - based on a \"thin slice\" of videotape.Gladwell also addresses the \"dark side\" of thin slicing, namely stereotyping. Because President Warren G. Harding was elected because he looked handsomely presidential, Gladwell refers to the \"Harding effect,\" bad judgment associated with thin slices.On the other hand, sometimes a thin slice can be more accurate than a larger picture: judges of jam became less accurate when asked to describe why they favored one brand over another.And conversely, sometimes thin slices are inadequate to make judgments. Police officers, for instance, perform more responsibly if they're forced to slow down, so a one-officer car actually becomes safer: the officer has to wait for backup. A new music sound fails the market research test, but listeners love the sound when they hear a whole concert.Some reviews have been critical because Gladwell seems to be saying, \"Sometimes snap judgments work...and sometimes they don't. So what?\"However, what Gladwell does is identify specific situations when think slices predict behavior - although the behavior predicted may not be reasoned or even desirable. It's a little scary to think that students who observe ten minutes of a class will make predictions that correlate with student evaluations for an entire term or that ten minutes of observing a doctor will predict his liability for lawsuits.The real problem seems to be that the more thorough, reason-based evaluations may also derive from single cues - not thoughtful integration of multiple insights. In fact, we may not be capable to moving beyond thin slices.We read thin slices accurately when we have expertise. Thus Thomas Hoving and other art experts detected a fraud from the \"feel\" of a piece. A firefighter knows when it's time to clear out a building. As a career coach I find that clients with lots of corporate experience can read a job interview easily - but they can't trust their insights as they consider a new career field or a business.In fact, recent televised reports of trials show how jurors rely on cues that they interpret through the lens of \"common sense,\" not realizing that common sense often conflicts with scientific findings. One juror claimed, \"Scott Peterson didn't look sorrowful enough,\" yet in fact researchers find a wide variety of \"normal\" ways of expressing grief. In a trial of a doctor accused of poisoning his wife, a juror dismissed an expert's theory that the victim died of a heart attack because \"there was no history.\" Yet for many heart attack victims, the first symptom is a fatal heart attack. I can't help wondering if jurors interpret \"different\" as \"bad,\" just as ordinary people reject unfamiliar music.This book reads as entertainingly as any novel. Many of us will have \"aha\" moments, as we learn, for instance, why more women have been accepted into classical orchestras. But ultimately, it is easy to feel frustrated by the gap between scientific knowledge and the realms of marketing, justice, education and other systems.We know why Mary Tyler Moore and All in the Family came close to being denied an audience - yet a promising young musician faces the same system with a less happy outcome. We realize that people cannot predict how their own minds will function - yet judges routinely ask prospective jurors about bias.These beliefs are no different than those of orchestra conductors who say, \"Women don't have powerful lungs,\" yet we continue to confuse common sense - the Harding fallacy - with real knowledge.Blink is the kind of book that should be read, talked about, analyzed, and discussed widely. I wish I could be more hopeful about the ability of scientific findings to change the way we live and conduct the business of society.",
            "When you read this book, you will most certainly notice that Gladwell is not a linear thinker. It will come out in the way that he manages to link up a multitude of seemingly unrelated phenomena and events in pure genius fashion, but also in the way the book appears slightly disorganized. In anecdote after anecdote, Gladwell shows us how our first impressions are better than spending a lot of time with something trying to figure it out IF (and this is a big \"if\" that some of the people reviewing seem to have missed) we have some good, reliable experience with what it is we're forming a first impression of. The rule of thumb appears to be this: first impressions are better than too much thinking, but first impressions can also be wrong and fool us if we don't know much about what we're trying to form an opinion of or, more importantly, if we let our biases get in the way. And as he tells us, the more experience we have with something, the less our biases affect us during our first impressions.What this book does is bridge the gap between a lot of disciplines (without actually using the terminology of many of them) to make it readable and useable for the general public. The main problem with it, as I previously alluded to, is that sometimes it's difficult to remember where he's been or to tell where he's going next. At times he attempts to remind you, but there's never any overarching summary. The cardinal rule of speeches or books like this is: \"Tell people what you're going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them.\" Gladwell only does the second one. If you can keep in mind his main thesis, this book will absolutely change the way you see the world and yourself.",
            "BLINK is entertaining, illuminating and at times humorous. In a highly readable account, Gladwell gives a clear description of implicit cognition and explains the most up-to-date theories of neuroscience and psychology through a series of fun and accessible stories. The examples, drawn from a wide range of situations and fields of human endeavor, illustrate the complex thinking processes that support \"snap judgments.\" With case after case, Gladwell demonstrates how the depth of knowledge and expertise developed over years of observation informs the mind to \"thin slice\" - make quick decisions at the blink of the eye that seem instantaneous but are actually based on years of experience. Thought-provoking, entertaining and worth a read. I also recommend Understanding: Train of Thought.",
            "Ironically, my first instinct seeing this book was that it would probably be a collection of subjectitvely picked research to back some unconvincing hypothesis of overstated importance. Well of course part of that was true, after all Gladwell is a journalist and not a scientist. However, in general, he does a great job in describing the research and its relevance to our everday lives.Blink focuses on 2 seperate but related concepts. The first is that of \"time slicing\", which demonstrates how important information can be encoded in a very short period of time. Most of Gladwell's examples are socioloical, and the most striking of which was research which aimed to predict whether married couples would get divorced after analyzing a single conversation with them.The other concept is how the brain acts subconsciously to certain stimulus. Gladwell's proposal is that if we can recognize this power of the brain we'd make the world a much better place and all sorts of other grand things. So, although not perfect, this is a good and interesting book.",
            "This is an ideal book for the beach or an airplane ride. It reads quickly and covers an eclectically wide range of topics: a case of art forgery, the presidency of Warren G Harding, the world of food tasting, an online test for unconscious prejudices, the marketing of New Coke, the Aeron chair, the nature of autism, gender discrimination among classical musicians, the Battle of Chancellorsville and the complete categorization of facial expressions just to name a few that immediately come to mind.As to the supposed main topic there is not a whole lot to say. Gladwell starts with a case of art forgery and tells how experts could intuitively recognize it. You may suspect from this that the book would concentrate on the power of intuition. However, to the extent that the topic comes up, he dwells mainly on the negative aspects - how we can be led astray by unconscious prejudices and superficial impressions.",
            "I enjoy Gladwell's perspective and he does a good job of correlating the research to his observations. A good read but the book needs a little more depth.",
            "The author declares \"introspection destroys your ability to solve insight problems.\" He then builds a case for acknowledging the subtle influences that can bias our impressions or instinctive reactions and suggests that with insight we can train ourselves to shift our reactions (the results of our rapid decision making). Introspection or lack of it can both work toward positive goals in our own maturity and training. But then he contradicts his theory by showing how we make good decisions - and bad decisions - by relying on intuition. Oops - different kinds of intuition. One is well-trained and the other not. OK. So we can re-train our intuition with new input.The book is written more like a series of interesting and informative stories roughly related to a theme than a book on a topic. And there are some inconsistencies. Just be alert. The author wanders through various subjects that have some relationship to the theme. It's a pleasant journey, but I wasn't surprised to read at the end that he writes for a magazine. In retrospect the book reads more like a collection of themed articles than a cohesive whole.Still, it gave me a more concrete appreciation for the intuitive sense I've developed after years in my profession and more confidence to rely on it. It's also given me a bit more critical and sympathetic eye for evaluating the actions of others after the fact. Every juror should read about split second judgments and instinctive reactions that allow us to make instant decisions under pressure. You'll never look at police shootings or hospital emergency room mistakes in quite the same way.It gets bogged down in places. But don't let that or the flaws keep you from taking away some gems from this book.",
            "Gladwell did surprise us with a lot of hard facts about how certain people possess the ability to \"do the things right\" without even thinking. An interesting read, but unfortunately lacks of a central belief in his book. After reading, you just have this difficulty to conclude the lesson learned here!It reminds me of another book, \"From Lowbrow to Nobrow\" (Peter Swirski, 2006) which is with an enjoyable writing style and a strong point to support the writer's keen observations and insights to fulfill your apetitie of learning. It clearly depicts the unique phenomenon of the popular culture of today. I personally highly recommend you to take a look at this book as it is a book of thinking power!",
            "Mr. Gladwell's work is a similar to data that was introduced in \"Emotional Intellegence\" by Daniel Goleman and \"Wisdom of Crowds\" by James Surowiecki. Both books brought forward much of the data that is presented in this book.However Mr. Gladwell really makes you think about the power of snap judgments. It is a difficult subject. We are really good at somethings and really bad at other. The book \"Mean Genes\" was very good at looking at where we fall short on our snap judgments. They noted that in areas like number greater than a few dozen we get into trouble. We really can't understand that our chance at winning a lottery are virtually zero, etc. I wish Mr. Gladwell had added these areas.Overall I like the book. It made me think. It gave me idea, and that is why I read.",
            "Blink exposes the power of subconscious mind in make instanteous decisions. If \"Tipping Point\" explains forces causing trends than \"Wisdom of the Crowds\" explains how a group of independantly minded people can accurately make a prediction; so one should consider \"Blink\" an micro economic explanation of how an individual can instanteous and accurate decision.Student evaluations. A group of students were asked to make an evaluation of a group teachers, after being shown a 30 second clip; next, the clips were shorted to 10 seconds; and finally, too 2 seconds. The results were roughly the same suggesting the immediate and direct impulse remain consistent despite duration and amount of information. Interestingly, the same students were asked to evaluate the teachers after taking the course and the results were similar to the 2 second clip evaluations.Predicting divorce. A system of evaluation was devised to measure positive gestures against negative gestures using a numeric ranking system: defensiveness, inflexibility, hostileness, and anger. The researcher analyzed short segments of interaction and rate it then compiled the results into a mathematical graph. A trend line was next established. The trend line suggests that once a pattern line converged downward, the results predictable were divorce, 94% of the time. A micro glance immediately suggested divorce or long term relationship potential.Economics. A system of cards was devised where red cards caused loss and blue cards caused profit. Participants discovered the profit loss pattern usually within 50 to 80 cards. After connecting a machine to measure stress, participates stress measures suggests they knew within 10 cards, the profit loss pattern.Expert reaction. A forge statutue was immediately recognized as flawed even though scientific instrumentation suggested the statute was dated at 550 B.C. The expert response were immediately negative about the authentic celebration of possessing a rare prize. The impulse reaction was immediately vocalized as negative. The musuem eventual discovered the marble sculpture was a fake. The impulse reaction was right.Rationale. Blink claims the individual is perfectly rationale and this rationale is not necessarily a laborous and tendous process. The decision can be summoned by the collective experience, emotions, and feelings of the person making the decision.",
            "This book is interesting although it is short and sometimes difficult to grasp entirely. I am still skeptical as to the accuracy of the statistics in this book. It seems that Gladwell is arguing (for the first half of the book) that answers jump out at you and that it is usually the correct answer. Then he says that the answers that come to us so quickly are influenced by our prejudices. Did anybody not already notice this about themselves and/or others? Although most of us already grasp the basic message of the book, I would still recommend reading it. It's able to put things together to make this penomenon easier to understand. Just don't plan on spending over 2 or 3 hours reading it.",
            "Over 500 people have reviewed Blink, and still counting. The one thing most folks agree on is that Gladwell can write. His stories are engaging and blink reads fast.But when it comes to rating the book, people are pretty polarized. They tend to either love it or see it as a waste of time. Why? Those who love it think Gladwell's discussion of snap decisions in such areas as speed dating, consumer marketing, police work, and hospital admissions, is insightful and fascinating. His narrative weaves cool research with real examples and makes both come alive. On the other hand, Gladwell's critics get annoyed that he bounces around, draws questionable conclusions, and doesn't connect the dots very well.Both arguments have merit. Here's why. Early on in Blink, Gladwell promises to convince us of three things: (1) that quick decisions can sometimes be better than deliberate ones, (2) that there are times to trust our intuitions and times to question them, and (3) that snap judgments can be \"educated and controlled.\" He does fine with the first two but doesn't really deliver on the third. If anything, his examples seem to show just how difficult such education and control can be. All of the experts he profiles have spent years improving their snap successes in areas that are often very narrow in scope. For these and other reasons, Gladwell is least convincing when drawing conclusions and making generalizations about snap judgments.So liking or disliking the book seems to depend largely on reactions to how Gladwell handles the third promise. If you care deeply about understanding #3 or expect Gladwell to neatly tie up all the ideas in Blink, you will almost surely be disappointed. But if you're the kind of person who is interested in how people make decisions and likes to speculate, this book will probably get your juices flowing. I liked it. You decide.",
            "Classical music was once almost exclusively the preserve of white men. It was believed that women could simply not play as well as men, for they did not have the strength, attitude or resilience for many pieces of music. Over the past few decades, though, classical music has undergone a transformation. Musicians, rather than facing auditions held in the dressing room of a conductor, now audition in front of selection committees. Perhaps the greatest change, though, is that they now audition from behind a screen. Since these screens went up, thirty years ago now, a strange thing has happened: the number of women in the most celebrated American orchestras has increased fivefold. The world of classical music came to realize \"that what they had thought was a pure and powerful first impression--listening to someone play--was in fact hopelessly corrupted. 'Some people look like they sound better than they actually sound, because they look confident and have good posture...other people look awful when they play but sound great.\" The fact is that the first impression of seeing a person, even if for only a brief moment, colors how the mind enjoys and understands the music another person makes. A man only sounds better than a woman of equivalent talent when a person has first seen that the person playing is male. All of this is not to say that the world of classical music was terribly corrupt and chauvinistic. A woman playing the french horn really did sound worse than a man playing the same instrument. This was only true, though, because of the mind of the listener. Seeing a woman settling in to place to play a piece on the french horn would so color his perception that his mind would register an inferior performance.This brief example shows the power of the first impression. Blink is a book dedicated to that first impression--the first two seconds of looking at someone or something. Gladwell argues, quite convincingly, that we need to have greater confidence in our first instincts. Our society tells us that the best decision is one that is labored over. When faced with a medical condition, a doctor will order test after test after test. A patient will consult another physician and seek a second opinion. Only when we have gathered an immense amount of data do we feel confident in moving forward. Yet so often it was our instincts, those first two seconds, that were correct all along. \"The first task of Blink is to convince you of a simple fact: decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.\"But this \"blink,\" this first two seconds can also be deceptive, so Gladwell devotes some effort to understanding those moments when instincts betray us. The infamous New Coke provides just such an example. Dismayed to see that participants in blind taste tests were consistently choosing Pepsi over Coke, Coke executives decided to retire their product in favor of a new version that tasted much more like Pepsi. We all know how well it worked. Coke drinkers rebelled and immediately demanded the return of the former product. It was quickly reintroduced as Coca-Cola Classic. Where did Coke go wrong? They based too much on the \"blink.\" While Pepsi continues to be rated as tasting better in a single sip, this is not how people drink a can of soda--people drink it a can, glass or bottle at a time. Some find that Pepsi's sweeter taste becomes nauseating with a larger quantity. Some people simply prefer Coke because they have always enjoyed it. The fact that Pepsi may taste slightly better does not mean they will switch drinks. Coke was led astray by the blink.What Gladwell seeks to show is that those who have succeeded at becoming great decision makers are those who have mastered the art of \"thin-slicing.\" These people seek out and filter a very small number of important factors, ignoring a large quantity of other seemingly-important variables. He provides examples of firefighters and soldiers, doctors and marriage therapists, all of whom have found ways of cutting through the clutter and extracting only the most important information. This leaves us with a psychologist who can predict with great accuracy, based upon only a few minutes of observation, whether or not a marriage will last. It leaves us with a tennis coach who can predict almost perfectly whether a player will double-fault before the ball has even made contact with the racket.This decision-making ability is not necessarily inherent in a person. Thin-slicing, Gladwell tells us, can be educated and controlled. A person who is intimately acquainted with his particular area of expertise, whether it be commanding a squad of soldiers or selecting members of an orchestra, will be more able to make successful split-second decisions.While Blink is absolutely fascinating, the area where I would suggest Gladwell does not do so well is in forming a unified theory. He gathers a large amount of fascinating information and puts all of this within the two covers of a single book, but the reader may be left wondering how it all fits together. At times Gladwell presses forward with little proof. Too often he relies on a single study to create a theory that is wide-ranging in its scope and meaning. At one point he discusses an autistic man and from that theorizes that even people without mental handicaps can suffer temporary autism during moments of high stress. Yet this is not premised on hard evidence. So perhaps Gladwell stretches himself a little thin at times. Perhaps he attempts to take his theories just a little too far, venturing from what is factual into what is merely possible. The Tipping Point, Gladwell's previous book, was, in my view, more complete and reached a more satisfying, holistic conclusion.Despite this criticism, this is a very interesting book and one that, despite the complexity of the topic, is quite easy to read and understand.",
            "Well my first impression of this book was a little mixed, sometimes during the course of reading it, it was difficult to assimilate where the author was going or trying to go.Then there is the fact which this book discusses a lot of is, that generally elusive 6th sense which it tries to bring out with examples of how some people know about something in advance and basically benefit from it.In my Opinion it is okay for a one time read.",
            "What happens when you meet someone for the first time, or walk into a house you are thinking about buying, or read the first few sentences of a book? You mind is taking about two seconds to jump to a series of conclusions. And according to author Malcolm Gladwell, those instant conclusions we reach are really powerful and really important, and occasionally -- really good.Blink looks at rapid cognition, about what happens in the blink of an eye. According to Gladwell, what happens is perfectly rational.He states: \"It's thinking - its just thinking that moves a little faster and operates a little more mysteriously than the kind of deliberate, conscious decision making that we usually associate with \"thinking.'\"Gladwell analyses what is going on in our heads when we engage in rapid cognition. For example, when are snap judgments good and when are they not? What kinds of things can we do to make our powers of rapid cognition better?Gladwell compares rapid decision-making with the way most of us have been taught to make decisions as children. Often we were taught to gather as much information as possible before making a decision. Gladwell states that sometimes this process is useful, others times it is not.He gives a poignant example of this from the Emergency Room at Cook County Hospital in Chicago. A few years ago, Emergency Room doctors changed the way they diagnosed heart attacks. They were instructed to gather \"less\" information on their patients. They concentrated on just a few symptoms: chest pain, blood pressure and the ECG - while ignoring everything else, including age and weight and medical history. The results were shocking. Cook County Hospital is now one of the best places in the United States at diagnosing chest pain.Caldwell examines numerous fascinating stories like Cook County Hospital where the idea of gathering more information is not always the best way to make a decision. Some examples include: marriage, World War II code-breaking, ancient Greek sculpture, New Jersey's best car dealer, speed-dating, medical malpractice, how to hit a top-spin forehand, and what you can learn from someone by looking around their bedroom.Blink contains a lot of psychology that has not been written before for the general audience, but at the same time is a fascinating and enjoyable read.",
            "Heard an interview with Malcolm Gladwell, the author of BLINK, on NPR earlier this year. It was just after I had to make a critical spot decision in seconds... then wondered for hours whether it had been the right thing to do. As it turned out weeks later, it was the correct decision to make, and in those weeks I had taken the opportunity to read this book, an impromptu personal gift from someone very close.Had I read the book before, I would have felt more confident in my ability to make an intuitive snap decision that was right.We all have to make quick decisions in our daily lives, some mundane and some critical. We make quick decision as simple as to what we will eat for lunch. We may also have to make fast critical decisions, such as how to avoid an impending car accident: do we brake, swerve or accelerate. And it's just this \"rapid cognition\" that Gladwell writes about so well that can make the difference.One could easily assume that BLINK is about dealing with intuition, as a colleague of mine thought when I described the book. That's not what it's about, because intuition is more of a concept used to describe our \"gut feelings,\" our emotional reactions that aren't always very rational. BLINK deals with those rational first two second that are our rapid cognition.Gladwell points out that contrary to the way were raised from childhood, there are times of stress and high pressure when fast judgment calls and first impressions are a better choice than slow, deliberate thinking for making sense of the world around us.His examples are superb: code breaking during World War II, speed dating, marriage, medical malpractice (insightful - do read it twice). He even covers things as unusual as what you can discover about a person by being aware of what you see when looking around their bedroom, and interesting views about the best car dealer in New Jersey. You'll just have to read the book to understand where rapid cognition fits in.There is an entire chapter dealing with the power of \"thin slicing\" that deals with what some psychologists have recognized is our ability to make good judgement calls based on the \"thinnest slice of experience.\" The author delves into this subject quite well, and the examples that he offers are amazing.But can rapid cognition go wrong? It it always the right way to approach things? Just read about what Gladwell calls the \"Warren Harding Error\" for the answer. He makes a compelling case for the fact that we can and will make \"Warren Harding Errors\" in so many types of circumstances, especially when it comes to hiring personnel. His suggestions here will help one recognize the differences between good rapid cognition and bad rapid cognition. Split-second decisions can often be either more accurate than many months of project management or scientific planning, or they can become tragic disasters. In this book the author shows that you can educate and exercise your rapid cognition to avoid hazardous traps.We all recognize the importance of what happens in dating relationships at that instance when two people first meet. But it seems difficult to face the significance of what happens in the critical first seconds when we interview someone for a job, someone offers a new idea, or when a police officer has to make a critical quick decision at the moment a crime is being committed. Gladwell makes a compelling case to make us take rapid cognition as a part of our critical thinking process.BLINK deals with those small situations we all face in our daily lives, with assumptions that show up when we meet new people, make important personal and business decisions under stress, or when we are forced to meet complex situations head-on.This is one of those books that comes along and changes the way that you see the world around us. It's a fairly fast read, neither too light nor too heavy, and if you're anything like this reader, you'll want to read it a second time just to get a bit more out of it.Highly recommended, a keeper and easily worth a five-star rating. And now I have to get and read Gladwell's previous book, THE TIPPING POINT.Please also see my review of FREAKONOMICS, by Steven Levitt. Another reader emailed me, noting that Gladwell had said that Steven Levitt \"has the most interesting mind in America.\" I agree.",
            "I have to say that I believe Malcolm Gladwell has really done something here. I think BLINK is a great follow up (and better read) to The Tipping Point, and I didn't think he could outdo himself as I loved that book as well.BLINK gives so many great examples into unconscious decision making. I think it is extremely insightful as to why certain things happen the way they do. His fantastic examples of Doctor Patient lawsuit as it relates to the level of rapport has massive practicality to helping Medical Schools prepare doctors to be people-centered first rather than the somewhat obtuse and cold approach many doctors take today. When rapport is built, patients feel more comfortable to share \"real\" symptoms, real fears and doctors can anticipate their required course of care better when they are relating to the patient as a person, not a patient and his/her illness.The book is packed full of useful content that will have you thinking which I believe all books should make you do. I would recommend this book without a doubt!",
            "We live in a fastbreak society, and the ability to make quick judgements is critical. Gladwell lays out the case for discernment, courage, and action. Quick-thinking is increasingly a matter of survival and Gladwell gives the readers tools to speed up that decision-making process and to improve the accuracy of those decisions.Far from calling influencers to be shallow, he challenges the reader to become better informed and equipped so that when moments of crisis arise, a minimum of time is spent on hand-wringing, navel gazing, and palaver.It's a well done book that will have particular application to people in positions of leadership and influence, whatever the field. Lots of broad, practical applications here....",
            "I would recommend one borrow not purchase this book, and after the half-way point return it. I found the first half extremely interesting and captivating. The remainder loses the reader in a case with racial overtones and fails to establish a logical relationship with the first half. I read a comment by another that seemed apropos: describe a new method of building an office building by explaining briefly a new building method and what the building might look like when finished. And, then talk about some of the surrounding pavement, you'd have \"Blink,\" well--in a blink.",
            "In the small arena of unconscious thought, Gladwell explores two main areas that on first glance contradict each other. First he argues that our instinctual impressions can be trained to give us insight beyond what our intellect allows. Next he points out that those same instinctual impressions can easily lead us astray and exacerbate our prejudices and emotional biases. So which is it?Both--although the balance between the two approaches is mostly ignored. Gladwell lays out the principles of _Blink_ on pages 14-15: Snap judgments can be as good as deliberate decisions; you can learn when to listen to them and when to ignore them; and you can educate and control them for when you do listen. The first and third of the principles are explored in great depth, but the second doesn't get any attention. That's a shame, because all his examples hint at the possibility of codifying which decisions should be \"blinked\" and which should be thought out traditionally.The one main conclusion Gladwell draws is that if you do \"blink\" a decision, you'd better have experience. The stories consistently show that if you have practice making snap judgments, you make them better. You can learn traits of a field to improve just in that area (reading facial expressions is one such example), but nothing substitutes for experience. So build your own or hire someone who has it, and then you can \"blink\" well, your products can \"blink\" well, and you'll know to keep your eyes open when you're not \"blinking\".",
            "I just began reading this book.And with having past knowledge of decision making, I understand what this book will already be about.But to say that you expected a manual on how to refine your snap judgements; Maybe you should read the book twice. I understand it isnt a manual to do what you wanted it to do, but within the first two chapters i see hints on how to refine your snap judgements.For instance the example about the deck of cards, the subjects being tested got the idea of how it works after a while. Thus experience in a certain field can make you have better judgements.I was once told an example of a manager(i believe) and how he always forecasted the number of sales for a certain product, almost perfectly, without doing specific calculations. Granted it took him some time of pacing back and forth in a room mumbling to himself. But his intuitive thinking led him to make a decision that didnt take him hours of numbers, to figure out. It was all in his brain, juat as Gladwell described; \"and some part of their brain did a series of instant calculations...\"but when he moved into a marketing setting, his snap judgements didnt work. (assuming because of his lack of experience there)I believe in order to start making snap judgements, you must prepare yourself for \"lateral thinking\" and other methods of smart decision making. Just as the example of the statue. They had experts view this statue, and they thought it was real. But the thing they overlooked is, their bias. That they \"wanted\" it to be real.Im off to continue reading this book, but just as The Tipping Point, theres small details you might miss that are hidden beneath the surface of the words, that can help you/train you help you find the \"maven\".i hope this helped.",
            "I found this a rather typical self-help book, but Gladwell's insights into thinking and how we do it, why we make the decisions that we do, and how to \"look both ways first\" are still interesting. Worth a look, but don't expect to learn something truly earthshaking and groundbreaking.",
            "The main reason I bought this book was because of the promise of teaching you how to improve upon utilizing your gut instinct. As I progressed through the book, my gut instict was telling me that wasn't going to happen, and it was right. It was just a series of studies and examples of where instinct has worked and where it hasn't. I didn't read one paragraph where the author instructs on how to improve upon or develop your unconscious decision-making. The stories are interesting but the book was a big disappointment to me.",
            "It breaks my heart to write a negative review of a Malcolm Gladwell work. Tipping Point was incredibly easy to read and provided useful discussion and thinking points, however the lessons of Blink (if there are any) are difficult to apply and certainly impossible to substantiate, even after you plough through this work (which becomes tedious toward the end). Blink will not have anywhere near the impact that Tipping Point did (and, from here on in, comparisons to Tipping Point will for Gladwell be inevitable). The book is well-written and focused. I still ponder some of the examples give n in the book weeks later -- but a few of the stronger examples are painfully short on detail and their bond to the central theme (which, unfortunately, is obvious to anyone capable of having purchased the book) is fairly loose.Sadly, Blink reads as though Gladwell had less time, and less inspiration, in its composition. I have no doubt he'll make up for this on his next work.",
            "It's an interesting topic to ponder: how do we know things in an instant? In fact this topic has been pondered for millennia and studied extensively for the last fifty years. There are wonderful philosophical, religious, and scientific works on this topic. The knowledge and insights available are both broad and deep. This particular book, Blink, The Power of Thinking without Thinking, does not add anything new or insightful.While reading this book I felt as if I were at a business reception and found myself engaged in a one sided conversation with a nice fellow who went on way too long about how the mind works. My mind works. And what my mind told me was find a waiter, get another drink, and excuse myself. Never ending anecdotes, no matter how well intended, embellish a point, but do not prove it or provide a deeper understanding. That's the way Blink is. I cannot recommend it because it sheds no new light on an old subject and there are better works on the mind and cognition.",
            "Blink is worth the read, but only for the paper back price. It's very easy to follow and a quick page-turner. However, it's a bit shallow.Blink's basic premises is: intuition is real, it's been scientifically proven, and you too can learn to use it. Most people feel there is something more to the \"gut feel\" or the \"intuition\" a person has. This show's that's true. The proof's Gladwell outlines are fascinating but the point is made too many times. However, I was disappointed to finish the book and not learn anything about honing one's own Thin Slicing capabilities.Read Blink, but borrow it from a friend or buy the paperback used.",
            "I had occasion to drive to Austin from East Texas (4 hours, one way) and thought an audio book on CD might be a good way to break up what is a fairly monotonous drive. I thought I might like a science book, but after reading some reviews of the \"professor\" series and hearing that they were sleep inducing, I decided that may not be a good idea for a boring drive. I found \"Blink\" in audio at the bookstore and became intrigued. Like most scientists, I am a bit skeptical of pyschology in general, but I am also open minded. Gladwell's book proved to be perfect for the drive, almost like having an articulate and educated companion along for the ride--albeit the conversation is one-sided.I thoroughly enjoyed the book in this venue. I would not have had the same opinion of the written version. The only reason that I don't give him more stars is that the cover is slightly misleading--the power of thinking without thinking--made me hope that he was going to offer a way to empower the subconscious. Anyone who has ever taken a test thinks about that \"initial choice\". So why doesn't that always work? In other words, shouldn't you be able to walk in to an exam, read the question, let your subconscious work for a second or two, write the answer down and move to the next question? Gladwell doesn't offer us anything here and he can't, he is a science writer, not a scientist. He can only report what he has researched. Excellent reporting, but no meat other than that. Get the audio book and listen on a long trip--but don't bother buying the paper.",
            "Virtually every supposedly analytical utterance is just an assertion with little logical basis. One could easily have interpreted the presented facts in any of a dozen other ways, drawing some other type of lesson. Basically, the author lays out dozens of anecdotes and then makes highly dubious remarks about decisions that were made. But it simply doesn't hang together in any coherent way. This is way, way over-hyped.",
            "I read this book as an extra credit assignment for my Social Psychology class. As I was reading it, I did indeed find it to be well-written; the anecdotes were fascinating, and the basic overall idea about the value of intuition and \"gut-feeling\" sounded pretty interesting on paper. But, after I finished, and I had time for the ideas to sink in a bit more, I began to question the value of what was presented. I presented these concerns at the subsequent class discussion, and I'll present them again here.To start the criticisms off on a light note, I can't help but point out a certain amusing irony I noticed all throughout my reading of Gladwell's books. One of the fundamental ideas that Gladwell ends up presenting is that a lot of our information-deducing today is based off of information overload that gives too much attention to all sorts of potentially irrelevant details, at the expense of concentrating on a select few key factors. Sounds fair enough, right? Well, ironically enough, these ideas are often accompanied by very long-winded, hit-you-over-the-head-with-detail descriptions of the places he goes to and the people he meets in his examples/anecdotes (ex: \"the JFCOM building is situated in such and such place, and appears to be a regular nondescript building, but inside houses...\" or \"he had a runner's build and a peculiar accent...\"). As I was reading these, I found myself chuckling to myself and saying \"Okay, yeah, that's interesting and well-written. But didn't you just say that we shouldn't be drowning ourselves in details?\" Gladwell's a journalist by trade, so I guess it's to be expected that he writes so much, but it's still a little ironic, given the subject matter.Moving on, there are greater concerns to be addressed, one of the paramount ones being how and when, exactly, the seemingly ground-breaking ideas Gladwell presents can be practically applied. For example, the first couple of chapters discuss anecdotes where experts are able to use their \"gut feelings\" to their advantage (ex: expert art historians identify a statue as a fake as soon as they first see it), and essentially uses these anecdotes as an attempt to show just how cool and unique these new ideas of \"thin-slicing\" information are. However, he also goes on to show how snap judgments can be bad, such as in cases of racial prejudice. So snap judgments can be good, but they can also be bad. Okay, that's true enough. But that begs the question: HOW can you tell when they're good or bad? When the cops who shot Amadou Diallo ended up shooting an unarmed man who, at first glance and according to a select few details (someone standing around outside in the middle of the night in a rough NYC neighborhood), appeared to be a threat, how, exactly, was their snap judgment different or flawed? How can you differentiate between good and bad snap judgments? Unfortunately, Gladwell doesn't really elaborate on this, except to say in the prejudice chapter \"don't let prejudices get to you\" or \"associate minorities with something positive in your mind,\" which really isn't that big of a help. A bit more elaboration would have been very useful.The other main complaint has to do with Gladwell's reliance on experts and the successful judgments they make as examples of how intuition can be so helpful. I once read Richard Posner's negative review of \"Blink,\" and one of the things he came up with that I found to be a good point was: \"the contrast between intuitive and articulate thinking is overdrawn: it ignores the fact that deliberative procedures can become unconscious simply by becoming habitual, without thereby being intuitive in the sense of pre-verbal or emotional.\" In other words, experts are able to make such quick judgments because they have spent so many years making the same logical deductions over the years, that they eventually become second nature to them.Gladwell does go on, in one part, to laud the value of expertise and experience in improving an individual's ability to make good judgments. But that's just it: so many of the examples he gives deal with experts, people who have so much practical knowledge of their fields that they know how to do their jobs by heart. Which begs another question: how does the layperson know what to do? Most people aren't like the veteran police officer who knew not to shoot the teenage gang member, or like the food tasters who can specifically identify different aspects of taste. How, then, is the average person supposed to take advantage of all of these ideas of intuition and quick judments, when (by Gladwell's own admission, no less!) experience, gained gradually over time, counts for so much in making them successful?And finally, the key aspect that I found. So much has been said about the \"intuition vs. deliberate logic\" debate that this book supposedly inspires. And yet, when you think about it, do the examples Gladwell present really do much to promote \"intuition\" and fly in the face of cold hard logic? I think not. Consider, for example, the anecdote in the book about Lee Goldman's algorithm for detecting heart attacks, using only three or for symptoms. Is this really an example of intuition? Hardly. Goldman found these factors through a long process of research and observation. And applying these factors nevertheless still employs logical observation to detect these physical symptoms; the difference is, it's a more efficient form of observation that doesn't get bogged down in details. It's the same thing with the Millenium Challenge and Marine Corps general/military strategist Paul Van Riper. Did Van Riper defeat the behemoth opposing team in the war game using intuition? No. He employed commonsense, yet fundamentally logical, solutions. When the opposing team had satellites to intercept military messages, Van Riper used bike couriers to deliver messages that weren't detected by the technology. He used surprise attacks and blind-sides to work around the opposing team's bloated intelligence systems, and therefore scored a decisive victory.And yet it seems like Gladwell is trying to pass these examples off as examples of the triumph of gut feelings. In reality, I think that anecdotes like these do better to form a different conclusion: it is not logic that's the problem. It's the KIND of logic that is often employed; that which gets bloated by irrelevant details. Instead, Goldman and Van Riper's experiences seem to imply that what is needed is a more efficient form of logic, which uses common sense and remains focused on the key issues at hand, but which are nevertheless conscious and deliberate forms of reason. I think that's what the case is largely made for via these examples. For all I know, this could have been Gladwell's intention, but so much of the book is spent trying to sell the idea of \"intuition\" and \"quick judgments\" that this really isn't clear.And that, fundamentally, is the book's major problem. I think it's trying more to \"sell\" a seemingly ground-breaking idea of new ways to think smarter, not harder, rather than making sure that these arguments hold up under scrutiny. Personally, a few simple, critical questions (\"How can you tell when your instincts are right or wrong?\" \"How can the layperson do this?\" \"Is that really intuition, or is it still logic?\") were enough for me to think, \"huh. It's interesting on paper, but I don't know if it's really right.\" Like I said in my title, it's kind of lacking in overall substance. In the end, I suppose I would recommend that people borrow the book and see what they think from there, but I would at the same time advise them to approach it with a relatively quizzical eye, and not to accept everything at face value.",
            "I was very impressed with this book. I think the basic concept that comes through is that we as people have an innate ability to discern that goes beyond normal logic and analysis. The author presents some interesting studies that show how different people have honed that ability in specific areas to be able to make decisions in what may be called the Blink of an eye. It's that quick. The author often refers to this ability as thin-slicing.I think what many reviewers here may have missed because of there own expectations or what may even be an example that fits in with some of the studies discussed in the book is a psychological background that includes the understanding of the buffers and filters that are instilled in every individual as they grow up and are exposed to the stresses of life.The topic of the book isn't just about going with your gut feeling as I read one of the reviews here mention. Nor is it as simple as trusting your instincts. We all have polluted reading instruments that distort our perceptions. As the author explains in one study, gut reaction can lead to someone's death when we are psychologically distorted ourselves.The trick seems to be in cleansing our reading apparatus in such contexts where we may need this ability to operate on our behalf. Some of the studies where this ability was shown to manifest required people to train themselves by identifying what the actual pertinent data was in the given situation and after repeated exposure to the situations, discerning correctly became second nature. In other studies Gladwell shows that strangers can correctly discern many things about people they do not know by simply looking at the environment in which they live.It is discouraging to me to realize how messed up we are psychologically, how all the buffers, filters, programs we have built in ourselves psychologically stifles this ability to thin slice.It am encouraged to read about all the examples and studies that show we have this ability within us and the possibility that perhaps it can be regained and that we can once again listen to what we already know in some sense.",
            "I picked up this book after picking one of his articles \"The Naked Face\" from _The New Yorker_ for my Freshman Comp students to read, which he more or less cannibalized in one of the chapters in this book. Yup, he plagiarized himself. You bet I'm going to raise that issue with my students.Secondly, I didn't have a problem with his 'easy peasy' science as with the semi-socialist and contradictory conclusions about the whole 'thin slice' phenomenon. In the penultimate chapter, he discusses the case of one Abbie Conant, who had to fight a horrendous legal battle to keep her position in an orchestra, all because the evil musicians made 'snap judgments' about her ability to play based on her gender--associating musicality with masculinity. She got the job by auditioning from behind a screen. Wonderful. Yet, in the final chapter, where Gladwell is supposed to bring all of these disparate threads together, he suggests, I'm NOT kidding, that we have criminal defendants stand behind a screen as well, or be entirely removed from the courtroom, so that the judge can sentence them 'blind'. This is comparing apples to fish. When hiring a musician, one looks for musical ability. When sentencing, I submit it's not beyond the purview of the bench to take into account such matters as 'does the defendant appear remorseful?' 'does he or she have future prospects of improvement?' 'does he or she have a history of recidivist behavior?' and other factors (beyond skin color) that weigh into a judge's decision. Those factors *can* be assessed, as Gladwell himself argues, by 'thin slicing'. Why is observing how a defendant behaves in the courtroom during the trial NOT acceptable thin slicing, when you ARE judging his character and ability to socially interact? What he suggests is sentencing that a computer could do via a pretty simple algorithm. We've TRIED mandatory sentencing and 'three strikes' policies, which attempt to remove race or class bias from the hands of judges (whom we apparently don't trust), and they didn't work. Gladwell doesn't in the least suggest how his idea is really any different, or how it would be any more successful: perhaps, if race is the issue, the issue is NOT with the judges but with the cops or district attorneys who decide to arrest or prosecute in the first case? So, what? Everyone's supposed to walk around with a bag over their heads so the (racist) cops can't see what color they are? Crikey!Meanwhile, he doesn't address at all one of the more pressing, though smaller, perhaps, in scale, interests of the average reader: how can *I* use this in my life? Not just 'buy cars on impulse, but debate about breakfast cereals', but in interpersonal interactions? That's where most of his anecdotes focussed, but most of his prescriptions were not. That sort of disconnect between ambitious social reform and interpersonal evidence is always suspect, because it leaves out the intermediate step: the small group.That being said, it's an easy read, and Gladwell is an entertaining stylist. This is a book I'd recommend for plane trips or beach reading: enough to keep you interested, and intrigued, yet nothing that is going to significantly alter your paradigm.",
            "I like Malcolm Gladwell's prose style. It is elegant and smooth. It is a perfect balance to the seemingly ordinary cases he cites to pursue his thesis about how \"thinking\" is a lot more complicated than we believe, and how we can sharpen and control our powers of observation.Good examples in the book are the instant awareness of \"something wrong\" with an allegedly genuine Greek sculpture later revealed to be a fake. The ability to instantly sense deviation from norms through experience and training is critical. Another example, among several others, is the study of facial expression as the key to understanding the feelings within, and how the face, if studied carefully, reveals what the person may be trying to conceal. Again, it is based on empirical study, and very focused attention, rather than intuition in the classical sense.It is a mistake to hastily conclude that Gladwell is talking about \"intuition\" in the sense of arriving at conclusions based on inexplicable factors that are beyond the empirical, sensory way of gathering information. Some critics of Gladwell seem to miss this point and confuse one for the other. One who reads Blink will see he is talking about how the mind can instantaneously \"know\" the truth of a specific inquiry long before the rational processes of formal scientific method have a chance to confirm the rapid conclusion.Over the period of gathering a lot of experience through focused attention, one can develop the ability to very quickly, based on a \"thin slice\" of new information, arrive at a sound judgment about meanings, behavior patterns, and other insights. He gives examples of how the trained observer can almost instantly \"know\" the wider truths that many others could not discern through far more study of the same \"subject.\"Perhaps what Gladwell is talking about could be called \"holographic\" knowledge, in that it is based on the theory that, like a hologram, one can see the whole of it through examining only a small portion that is emblematic of the whole. It is an accelerated form of pattern recognition, available to all who are willing to learn the patterns in a focused manner.It is also not easy to explain how one knows what one knows in a \"blink\" of time. To rationally explain it can be confouding in itself. Still, it is part of who we are, how the human mind works.Gladwell also shows how we can have our awareness and ability to accurately perceive things as they are, distorted by attention to other factors that obscure, confirm prejudices, and lead to erroneous conclusions. His example at the end of the book of the female trombone player being chosen by a German \"traditional\" orchestra through a screened audition is very telling. It captures the essence of the book.I doubt that Gladwell was concerned with giving readers a comprehensive, academic study of the phenomena of learning, focused attention, and \"adaptive subconscious\" development. His endnotes are good for further study. By giving us this short, easy to read book, he introduces a new way of knowing to the general reader. In doing so, Gladwell has made a valuable contribution.",
            "Excellent analysis of the mind and how the unconscious plays a role in everyday life. Anyone looking to learn more about those things called intuitions or \"hunches\" should definetly check it out.",
            "Blind provided excellent examples of people making snap decisions -- when it works and when it doesn't. Based on that, you find things you can start or stop doing. For example, do you expect a leader to be a tall, thin man? Yet those qualities have nothing to do with leadership. Why do you let physical appearance drown out other information about the person? The book also gave examples of experts who are trained and have the vocabulary to verbalize what they sense. While the rest of us could only say we like or don't like something without being to explain why. Although we may be right, we don't give snap decisions credibility because we don't have facts to back it up (or the training/vocabulary to explain why). The only problem with this book was that it lacked a conclusion. It didn't provide steps on how you can \"think without thinking.\" You need to come to your own conclusions based on the stories.",
            "Perhaps I might take a shot a clarifying the disparity between some of the ratings this book has been getting. Gladwell is a highly regarded journalist for the New Yorker and Blink is pure journalism - a trusted observer reporting ideas and insights in a particular subject - in this case, the way we make decisions. Gladwell is reporting on the ideas of others, evaluating and making connections. Many reviewers have given the book poor marks for the obviousness of its ideas, but these are not really Gladwell's ideas per se, nor are they bleeding-edge new. Gladwell is doing essentially the same thing he does for the New Yorker, just in a longer format. I found it to be a highly entertaining and thought-provoking survey of the psychology of decision-making - though neither comprehensive nor revolutionary - so if you're looking for 'meat' on these bones or fancy yourself an expert, skip the book and use the notes at the end as your shopping list. I read through Blink in an afternoon and found it to be the most enjoyable and informative book I've read this year.",
            "There are many, many reviews of this book, so I expect mine isn't really needed, but I enjoyed this book so much I want to share my thoughts.My husband and I were on a road trip last week and spent several hours in the car. While I read \"Blink\", I kept reading passages to him because it was so interesting. He has a degree in psychology, so we would talk for miles and miles, based on what I was reading and sharing with him.The book progresses through its several topics and each builds on the one before it. He is a lively and interesting writer. You don''t need any sort of degrees or special knowledge to understand this book - my education is lit and business - not psych!I learned a lot from this book and am enjoying thinking about what I learned. I suspect I'll reread this book at some point to revisit some of his insights and stories as I live with what I've learned.Very good book. I recommend it highly.",
            "The point of the book was not that snap judgements are always correct. The author shows how more factors than just logic come into play when making decisions, and how if we rely soley on logic we can reach wrong conclusions.It was an easy read but very thought provoking. I liked this book much more than \"Freakonomics\" because the author is not using the book as a vehicle to impress the reader with how smart he is (although he clearly is, and is a good writer, but he lets his work speak for him).",
            "Malcolm Gladwell works in the area where he's trying to know the unknowable (at least at first glance). In \"The Tipping Point\" he examined how small and apparently inconsequential incidents ensure the success or failure of campaigns to influence the public. In \"Blink,\" he shows how, on the basis of minimal evidence, skilled people can make correct decisions.Since both these ideas fly in the face of common sense, he has his detractors. However, in \"Blink\" he has many examples where his theories hold water. Perhaps the most important is the one about military games where one team was given huge amounts of information and proceeded to work from this database. However, the team suffered heavy losses from unexpected attacks, even though they had the means in place to find traces of the the preparations of attacks. In fact, the leader of the opposing team did not behave in the way the \"rule book\" said he would and thus deluded the other side, even with all their knowledge.It is one of the things that we pride ourselves on - the ability to make correct decisions using all the evidence - yet sometimes the gut reaction is correct over the best person to hire, and sometimes also the supporting evidence turns out to be false.Gladwell makes it clear that this method of arriving at decisions is not necessarily true for most people or for most of the time, yet he manages to have numerous examples of, for instance, cops not shooting a suspect who appears to be reaching for a gun. What appears to be a hostile act may or may not be accompanied by other signs that make the cop more likely to believe he's in danger.The most fascinating chapter in the book for me - \"Seven Seconds in the Bronx\" - cover a police shooting of a man reaching for his wallet, but interspersed with that is the method used by Paul Ekman, who looks for fleeting facial expressions and can also teach this to others. This would be worth a book on its own, but careful examination of slow-motion film shows people revealing their feelings for a split-second at a time - the signs that experienced people look for.I think that \"Blink\" will make you never view the world in the same way again. Read it and see.",
            "Ok so at the end of the book you are given the full belief that what you work out in your mind in the first couple of seconds of any situation you are right and just go with your \"gut\" instinct. Unless of course you are doing the cola challenge or rolling in a car with 3 other cops and are carrying weapons.The book is nice fast read but is hard to use for any practical application.",
            "BlinkIs there a certain standard that keeps a very interesting essay / article from turning into a book? You see, the number of bloated books that I have been reading has triggered this question. A book like Blink, which discusses an interesting concept, could have been a great article in the NYT Magazine. A well developed article with enough evidence to convince the sceptic of the author's argument. However, to go for, what it seems like 1,000 evidence of the same concept is a waste of time and gives the book a highly 'commercial' feel.Picking on \"Blink\" again, I would have paid the same $9 had it been a 50 page book. Take a cue from Ben Hogan's \"Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf \" an absolute classic for every golfer in less than 120 pages written some 50 years ago!There are many examples of these books that go on and on about one single subject and prove it with 1,000 examples.

As you learn to apply these \"rapid fire thought\" techniques to your everyday life, you will be suprised. I'm now the ass-man (assistant manager) in my office and now I'm looking at another raise.",

            "Gladwell's other books 'The Tipping Point' and 'Outliers' both were great to read and had some really interesting, important insights. 'Blink' is likewise, a great read but not with quite the same validity in the insights. Cognitive science is a deep and little understood domain so it is perhaps a little beyond a journalist such as Gladwell to be making any groundbreaking claims.But what he does do well, without fail, is provide interesting examples and find insights that a mere mortal would never even consider. He is at the very least, thought-provoking, and what more could you ask of a book than to make you really THINK about things?",

            "This book is captivating and a quick read, but the ideas contained in it are quite deep. This book is actually a lot more nuanced than many of the other reviewers suggest: instead of making broad generalizations, the author describes different types of situations involving decisionmaking and discusses their differences.I especially like the way the author explores both situations in which snap judgments can be extraordinarily accurate, and those in which they are less so. I also like the contrast the author draws by introducing the use of data to make systematic decisions. This discussion may be of particular use to people in operations research, management, people who run small businesses, other organizations, or political campaigns.I think that most people would not only benefit from reading this book, but would enjoy it as well. It's fun, but deep.",
            "The basic idea behind Blink seems to be that subconscious analysis can be exponentially clearer and more accurate than conscious reasoned procedure in evaluating skills in other people and decisions we are faced with. Gladwell has ample evidence, much of it compelling, to back up his hypothesis, and yet his work still does far less than it could have.The reason for this, I have concluded, is that Gladwell largely refuses to dig into the characteristics that allow us to pick up signals in other people. In one anecdote, Gladwell explains that people can observe a mere few seconds of video of college professors -- with limited audio that disables word recognition -- and accurately rate the quality of each professor measured against the ratings of students who have completed one of the professor's courses. This is a fascinating discovery, and yet Gladwell refuses to say what is being \"thin sliced\" in the professor. Is it something as abstract as passion, or could it involve something more easily quantified, such as IQ? Gladwell doesn't know, and because of his \"locked door\" theory, he assumes those doing the rating do not have access to any of the information motivating their choices, either.In fact, Gladwell sidesteps IQ altogether. Perhaps because of his populist aspirations (though perhaps not), he demonstrates a lack of willingness to confront our ability to pick up cognitive function in other people or groups of people. This ability to accurately \"size up\" other people would seem to have far-reaching implications in explaining how society is economically and socially structured, and yet he refuses to look the issue in the eye. The impact of his work could be far greater if he worried a bit less about New Coke and tennis serves, and more about the broad implications of intuitive perceptual skill.",
            "I listened to the audio book version of Blink. The Amazon reviews here that try to pry out the book's shortcomings are missing the point entirely - you can read this book and personally understand a lot more about how you, as a modern, civilized, human being actually function in real life, not in between the covers of some peer-reviewed science or psychology journal.For example, I could never understand why, even after years away, I could perfectly navigate my way around San Francisco, until my wife started to question if I knew where I was going! The author, in relating his understanding of how the mind functions in split-second decisions, explains that right-brain (visual) functionality, becomes impeded when left-brain (verbal) functionality (answering questions) is forced to kick in. No wonder I don't like it when people talk 'at me' when I am trying to think - I think visually!I can't wait to read Gladwell's Tipping Point!",

            "It puzzles me how some could not find any practical use for this information. It was pretty clear that snap thinking works, as long as you have fed your sub-conscious more complete data, and if you don't allow yourself to panic. I think it helps clarify what I have seen in successful decision-makers, both in business and the military. It is therefore no surprise that floor traders and professional soldiers can have a surprising amount of common ground.The book is well worth reading.",
            "I came to Blink after being so caught up by the Tipping Point that I expected the same level of greatness.This is a good book, and its central theme is intriguing. I think he raises great points for readers to use the knowledge in bits and pieces - thin slices - if you'll indulge me with the terminology. I find myself better able to understand what drives decisions. And even better, how to improve them. However, this took effort, and time away from the book to see the concepts in actions.The first part of the book is better than the latter parts. And i believe the parts focused on human beings under stress particularly intriguing.I also think the ability to focus, with laser sharpness on what we know, and begin to remove the artificialities is a concept I wish Mr. Gladwell would have explored more deeply - especially at the end - sort of a mechanism for putting this into practice more deeply (of course then someone might wrongly place it in the self help category).However, Blink is a fascinating study in understanding why you think you know what you - and fast you know it.",
            "I find the authors book to be very interesting. Thin slicing is something we all do everyday and do not realize it. I would recommend this book to everyone.The one suggestion I have would be to not go into so much detail with the examples provided. The story about the war and it's methods was way to long.",
            "Malcolm calls into question a certain notion of thinking most commonly used by \"experts\" of all stripes, decision makers in business, in marketing, in the military or in academia. He draws out the limits of reducing thinking to just another form of technology, in which experts will substitute technology, i.e. reason, for other forms of experience, i.e. feeling, experience, passion. The results are comic, especially in the first chapter concerning the forged Khourous, where technology supports wishful thinking.The implications are wide-ranging, i.e. poor military decisions supported by complex software, consumar marketing decisions supported by useless focus groups, prejudices supported by media influence, etc.Malcolm doesn't develop any normative rules for dealing with this zen-like moment of \"thinking without thinking,\" so don't look for many. I suggest reading the book without \"thinking\" and accept the absurdity of never being certain about anything.",

At the end of the book though I was left wondering, \"Okay...so what is the conclusion?\" The book came to a rather abrupt ending and I couldn't tell if the author was for or against snap judgments.My biggest disappointment is that there was no warning regarding explicit language. I was listening to this work on CD with my young daughters in the car when all of a sudden he starts using profane words in an effort to quote others. Was it necessary to include such language?",

Enjoy!\"It's ironic that a book praising intuition would arise and become popular just when many organisations are relying heavily on analytics, but then perhaps that's part of its romantic appeal. It is fun and persuasive, but it doesnt make clear that intuition is only appropriate under what circumstances. The author is undoubtedly correct, for example, that human beings evolved a capability to make accurate and quick decisions about each other's personality and intentions, and it's rare for formal analysis to do that as well. Yet even the author argues that intuitions is a good guide to action only when it's backed by many years of expertise. Any many of the author's examples of intuition are only possible because of years of analytical research in the background, such as Dr. John Gottsman's rapid and seemingly intutitive judgements of whether a married couple he observes will stay together. He's only able to make such assessment because he observed and statistically analyzed thousands of hours of videotaped intactions by couples. It's also clear that decision makers have to use intuition when they have no data and must make a very rapid decision - as in the author's example of police officers deciding whether to shot a suspect.\" pg13-14",
            "With roughly 260 pages and seven chapters (including the conclusion), \"Blink\" is a well-written and insightful book on the subject of accurate \"snap judgment\" or two-second of \"looking.\" This book gives us, the reader, a great deal of information about our \"moment\" to see things accurately, either in quick reaction, warnings, reading strangers, as it is very much like \"gut\" feelings or first impressions.I personally found this book to be quite fascinating and insightful to which I enjoyed both Gladwell's flowing writing style and his clear organization. It took me a good few hours to read it as I could not put the book down. To understand our \"snap\" judgment is to reach an understanding of how basic a human being really is. Today's world, with all the media and overwhelming information, we tend to lose this kind of sense in ourselves.I would very much recommend this book.",
            "Blink is one of those books that has a profound effect on how you view the world. It involves a paradigm shift. Gladwell starts with three main tasks- to that snap judgments can be as good as well thought-out judgments, show when our instincts fail us and teach us that these snap judgments can be controlled.The stories that Gladwell uses to illustrate his points are fascinating and extremely well researched. You feel like you being lead along in a gripping novel instead of reading psychological paper.The most profound lesson that too much information can be overwhelming and severely disrupt our instinctive judgments is profound in a world where we have e-mail, cell phones, blackberries, 24-hour news, online forums - hundreds of sources of information on every conceivable topic. The most effective methods for controlling our instinctive reactions have profound and insightful ideas on how to effectively deal with the subconscious racism that lingers in our society and expresses itself in everything from criminal convictions to choosing chief executives.",
            "Blink ponders the concept of snap decision making utilizing several examples in order to prove its point...Some of the examples begin to be a little redundant, but I do recommend this read",
            "The book is a page-turner, sprinkled with several anecdotes and contextual stories. Though I normally post my reviews of books on Amazon and not on this blog, ideas in the book resonated with the theme in my earlier blog entry. It pertains to Gladwell's analysis of \"The Warren Harding Error: Whey we fall for tall, dark, and handsome men.\"In the chapter, while analyzing an experiment at Chicago area car dealers, he points to how \"Even after forty minutes of bargaining, the black men could get the price, on average, down to only $2,551 above invoice. After lengthy negotiations, Ayers's black men still ended up with a price that was nearly $800 higher than Ayeres's white men were offered without having to say a word.\"With my distinctly South Asian features and accent, I am no Warren Harding but I got to experience and observe the reversal of the `error' that Gladwell points to. In the early nineties, when I first landed in the US, and was looking for a car at the local auto dealership in the heart of the Midwest - Kentucky - the salesman wouldn't give me the time of the day. I was distinctly `foreign,' probably without a credit history, with questionable finances. The salesman literally told me that to my face (something the dealership later apologized for when I wrote to the manager, but that's a different story).Fast forward to present day. It is interesting to observe how younger South Asian and Indian expat `kids' on offshore engagements, walking into a Honda, Toyota or other auto dealerships get kid-glove treatments (pun intended). It is probably because in the blink of an eye, the sales-men/women now equate them to the `white male' in Gladwell's narrative: seen as knowledgeable, internet savvy and possibly with a high-tech job that pays well. This `thin slicing' happens subconsciously even while the kid walks into a dealership, thanks in part to the hype over the flattening world (apologies Tom Friedman) and buzz in the media over offshoring. A phenomenon, one could call the reverse of Gladwell's description of spotting the sucker: spotting the buyer!",
            "This book is conversational and easy to read. This book has a few amazing points. More so, I would read this book again to refresh the idea of \"mind reading\" by thin slicing microexpressions with the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). I would buy a follow-on from this author to learn how to control my facial expressions which unknowingly give other people the edge in \"reading my mind\".",
            "Blink is about the subconscious computer we all use to think intuitively. It explores the thought pattern that gives a leader a \"hunch\" about making the correct decision, or that vibe we get from first impressions.The book starts out with ideas on how our subconscious can be used as a powerful tool to discern a tremendous amount of information from just a few details. What I did not expect, was that the remainder of the book focuses on how this tool can just as easily become a handicap leading to incorrect interpretations and poor snap judgments. Blink is not about honing our subconscious computer to make better and quicker decisions, but taking a second look and avoiding the obvious mistake.I think marketing is the most practical application of the material. One chapter discusses how product packaging can affect the way a consumer interprets the actual product. For example, consumers drinking 7-UP out of a yellow can tasted more lime than drinking from a green can, despite both cans containing the same ingredients. The author also analyzes the Pepsi Challenge of the 80s and his opinion on why Coke was never in any danger of losing the marketing battle.Another subconscious phenomenon examined is how one can make disastrously poor decisions under momentary pressure. The author hypothesizes why racial police beatings like Rodney King occur. A lot of the examples provided are about what the author considers subconscious racial discrimination, which he thinks is caused by the conditioning of living in a dominantly white society.Overall I think Blink was entertaining, but I don't consider most of the material very practical. I think it would be most appealing to readers of the Freakonomics type books. If you are deciding whether this would be a good read... I say go with your gut instinct.",
            "Great read that explains in detail a phenomenon that most of us encounter on a daily basis - thin slicing - making split decisions based on limited or no analysis. The book has numerous practical applications and should be read by anyone in a decision making role - executives, marketers, traders, etc. Definitely liked Blink more than Tipping Point. Looking forward to Gladwell's next book.",
            "An engaging and easily read essay on the way we think, and how \"shooting from the hip\" isn't always such a bad thing...when it's backed up by experience. Gladwell's research into an area completely removed from his own arena of expertise is detailed and thorough. He approaches the subject with enough humility and honest curiosity that the reader feels he is more along for the ride than being lectured from the podium as are most tomes on psychology and sociology. Especially noteworthy are his many references to specific studies and the occasional invitation to participate in a few prove to be...illuminating to say the least (I swore I wasn't bigoted, until...).",
            "Snap judgments are arrived at by a ruthless pruning of information, which our brains process without our being aware of it. A good snap judgment occurs when the information which has been discarded is irrelevant to the matter in hand; a bad one when it is not. An overload of information leads to a paralysis of judgment, which is why information-gathering bureaucracies are often not merely inefficient but grotesquely error-prone.Gladwell's book, which starts well enough, meanders and begins to go off the point about halfway through. This is probably because the subject cannot sustain a full-length study without digression. His style is conversational and easy to read but (for me at least) too colloquial.",
            "Blink by Malcolm Gladwell has a lot of interesting and unusual observations, mixed in with research and life stories that all tie together neatly. Some of it is fun, you get to take tests. You also have to figure out what people are saying to each other, when you suspect the words of the conversation have nothing whatever to do with what they are actually trying to tell each other. Thinking while talking and listening is a skill and this book helps develop that skill by teaching you to hear between the lines.What's really great about this book is it is not boring and there are plenty clever tips you can add to your communications skill set. It also has some fascinating things to say about decision making and personal motives.Though none of the information is really provocative, some of it very unusual. I thought the military decision making was especially interesting. All and all it was solid information delivered in an easy to read style that kept it interesting and entertaining as well as educational.",
            "How do individuals in critical roles such as firemen, airline pilots and process plant operators make split-second decisions that happen to be correct most of the time? And what causes them to make the wrong decision from time to time? This book is filled with examples of what appear to be \"gut feel\" decisions that upon detailed examination prove to be the result of calculated situational assessments and analyses, all in a fraction of a second. Gladwell attributes this phenomenon to the \"unconscious\" mind and its ability to process lots of input data rapidly to arrive at the right decision.This is a must read for every engineer, designer, consultant and manager who is concerned with human performance. It is a fun/fast read.We in the processing industries operate on the belief that ALL accidents are preventable. Given that all accidents - minor and catastrophic - can ultimately be traced back to human error at one point or another - either by neglecting to take action when necessary or taking the wrong action - it is imperative that professionals in the field of HUMAN PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT understand how critical decisions are made in an instant. Particularly in the filed of process plant operations, where every year we still see accidents take lives and maim individuals, it is crucial that proper systems be put in place to support operators in their critical decision making process. Two factors lead to making the correct decision during moments of chaos - the competency of the operator and the quality of the data presented to him.The only criticism of this book (and why it did not get the 5 stars) is that it is very heavy on examples to prove its point and too light on measures to improve chances for better decision-making.",
            "(Helpful? Not? Please vote, so I know someone is reading these :^) I have now enjoyed both of Gladwell's books. Blink is quite a bit better annotated and organized than the first, IMHO, and though the last couple of chapters seemed a bit disjunct, he managed to tie it all back together (though a bit abruptly). I'd say, it's not a treatise on instantaneous perceptions, but is a good all around view of several issues surrounding the snap judgments we all make every day. \"Blink\" dissected what I'd call subconscious cognition (if that's not a nonsense term), and started me thinking about the more minute details or sub-sections of the phenomenon. A nice example of this was his discussion of professional food tasters. Who'd have thought there would be a 10-pt scale for a dozen different measures of food texture, all contributing to the final texture rating?!? Slipperiness ... Crispiness ... and so on. This only to illustrate that experts have a different view into things than you and I. This is loosely true of each of thousands of professions, so it gets one to thinking about all that specialized knowledge out there that leads one person to make a different snap decision than another.I think that this might be a good jumping off point for several areas of continued reading. I was particularly intrigued by the sections about facial expressions, and how cops \"remember\" a shooting incident. How parts of our mental abilities can shut down, and how others can heighten involuntarily. I can't say \"Blink\" is the kind of treatment of the subject that would be called exhaustive, or overly scientific, but Gladwell includes plenty of statistics, correlating facts and annotations for further exploration. As I said, it's a fun read, and also a good jumping off point as well. You can consume this book easily in a couple of sittings, and I think you'll enjoy it.",
            "As with \"The Tipping Point,\" Malcolm Gladwell manages to be both insightful and entertaining with \"Blink.\" A very easy and fast read, and yet there is a lot of thoughtful information presented on difficult topics such as racism and sexism. It reveals the problems of trying our best not to be prejudiced, even toward ourselves. If we slice responses thin enough, our intent is replaced with how we actually see the world - and we might not like it.",
            "I like Malcolm Gladwell. He's criticized by some for a lack of academic rigor. While I agree that his work tends to focus more on witticisms, I consider that fact to be mostly positive. Even though I enjoy intellectual people, I have a distaste for some aspects of academia. Academics argue that information is lost when technical ideas are distilled into common language. But even if that's partially true, I think it's more important for an idea to be widely understood by the general populous--because that's when an idea really takes on power.For an idea to really take on that power, you have to feel it. There's a possibility for danger in that sentiment, because it's possible to feel something that's not true. But if something's true, AND you can feel it--that's a powerful idea with ability to spread.Malcolm Gladwell does an excellent job of spreading ideas. Most of them are great. Those that aren't great aren't a big deal, because they can be refined and corrected in the robust discussion that his books promote.",
            "The first chapter was the hook, but as it went on it began to get a little repetitive. It wasn't really adding anything new and the topics began to feel scattered. It was as if the author had a bunch of really cool stories and facts that kinda-sorta all fit together, so he slapped them in.That said, I found most of it very interesting. It was also pretty easy to read - despite feeling scattered. If you're interested in a collection of psychological research in a fun, easy to read and understand format, pick up a copy of Blink. I enjoyed reading it.Also Recommended Understanding: Train of Thought.",
            "If you're interested in learning more about the psychology of consciousness, \"Blink\" is a good place to start. Filled with entertaining and insightful anecdotes which illustrate the workings of the unconscious mind, this book will definitely get you thinking about the psychological (and, to a lesser degree, the philosophical) issues surrounding how we think.However, I'm afraid that some readers may conclude that mere insight into the unconscious mind will change behavior for the better - this isn't always the case. Don't read this as a how-to book for changing your unconsciousness mind, but rather just as a general over-view of one branch of cognitive psychology. If you're feeling adventurous after reading this, check out Jayne's \"Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind\" or Wegner's \"The Illusion of Conscious Will\".",
            "I was riveted from start to finish. Gladwell reveals how we can become superior decision makers, in our homes, our workplaces, and in our daily lives. It's remarkable to realize that this book represents the life work of many brilliant researchers, most of whom we would never know except for this book. Gladwell has taken decades and volumes of highly technical research and made these concepts accessible to the average reader and anyone can see almost instantly how it applies to everyday situations we all encounter.I also recommend Understanding: Train of Thought.",
            "As with his breakthrough surprise best-sellerThe Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference, Malcolm Gladwell's follow up offering is stuffed stem to stern with fascinating anecdote, and presented in the same breezy manner. And while, I suppose, there's a consistent argument buried somewhere in there, I'm blowed if I know what it is.Gladwell apparently can't make up his mind whether snap judgments are good things (as they seem to be for the purpose of spotting art forgeries and waging guerilla warfare) or bad things (as they seem to be when manifesting themselves in a form of temporary cop autism which causes innocent bystanders to get shot). What one is left with is a collection of anecdotes about the subconscious and immediate, each fascinating in its own right, make no mistake, and each of which undoubtedly carries its own situation-specific lesson, but which together sum up to precisely nothing at all. Sometimes Blink-style judgments are good; sometimes they proceed from our innate primordial racism. Great. Kind of.The story I found most interesting though, on reflection, perhaps the least genuinely on point (assuming the point is \"how snap judgments shape the world we live in\"), was the importance of a physician's bedside manner in assessing his (or her) likelihood of being the subject of a medical negligence suit. Gladwell would say this has everything to do with \"thin-slicing\" - but it is difficult to see the similarity between this sort of thin-slicing and the thin-slicing encapsuated in cop shootings or on-the-fly military strategics. But there is definitely a lesson in there for those following the professional services calling: If your clients think you're nice, you are less likely to get sued, no matter how useless you might really be - and vice versa! That's a banker.That observation might equally apply to this book itself: it doesn't uncover any single great insight about our mental lives, but Gladwell gets away with it because he's such an affable chap, and he writes in such an appealing way, that it seems churlish to hold this against him. We don't begrudge him what really is a fairly poorly knitted cardigan of fireside yarns - since ugly old jumpers are perfect for loafing about in on holiday, and on holiday is certainly where I read this book: as a kind of extended weekend paper feature it seemed just fine.Olly Buxton",
            "The book \"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\" by Malcolm Gladwell covers the unconscious ability to make correct answers or reactions by trusting in instinct. He wrote this book on the theory that a snap decision from a person can become a more accurate response compared to a well thought out conclusion. Gladwell tries to prove his idea in an interesting way by presenting different occurrences in stories that involve the use of a gut-decision becoming more reliable in relation to evidence and thought. He wants to demonstrate to us that we have the aptitude to use this sense in many situations but we just don't notice it yet. Gladwell also clearly refutes his idea by saying that your unconscious decisions can most commonly be wrong when becoming sidetracked using emotions or facts to consider your final answer.Overall he wrote a good book by incorporating interesting stories with a well-written description of each to establish proof that his theory of unconscious judgments are correct. I read through this book becoming more and more interested after each anecdote Gladwell described. However, I may not be fully convinced that what he is trying to validate is true. There were some problems that went through my head that were not very clear when reading Gladwell's book. For example one of his goals for writing this book was to teach the reader how to notice these unconscious signs. On the other hand, all he wrote about was different cases where people were correct when using snap judgments. He never went into showing us how to recognize the signs ourselves. Also with many of his stories he never went into excessive detail that could have otherwise been major factors proving why a person was instinctively right. All together, Gladwell's book was an enjoyable read and I would definitely recommend this to others!",
            "Gladwell has done what the rest of us did not think of doing - thats his 'tipping point' - he states the obvious. Everything in this book is basically stating the obvious. It is not new - just taking the pbvious and writing it up in a really nice way. Would I recommend it? - NOT REALLY",
            "Gladwell has a lot of great points but for me they get lost in long drawn out stories. The stories themselves are good, but if you goal is to get to the meaty part then you have to wade through pages of stories to get to what is often a one sentence point. A cliff notes version of this book would be recommended.",
            "The first half of the book was definately worth the read and i would suggest you buy it just for the ladder half, however about halfway through he gets entirely off subject and starts talking about Coke-cola and Pepsi in taste tests vs entire drink tests etc... How things are advertised etc...I can see how it fits into the subject, about Thin slicing, but he got so far off subject that i was no longer able to hold an interest in the book and stopped about 3/4 the way through.The first half of the book talks about Thin slicing; the process in which your mind relates the information it is receiving to past events in order to gain an understanding of it. He gives numerous examples of this and it is rich in detail. Definately a good read until he gets off subject. Two stars.",
            "Well I think books like these are easy to read, easy to grasp, easy to relate to and somewhat easy to digest. This probably explains its massive popularity. However as some of the other reviewers have rightly mentioned that there's not much of an insight or new findings presented. It's just anecdotes, events, encounters and happenings of rather random nature but presented in a way that really invokes interest.",
            "I genuinely could not put down this book. If you have any personal insight, you should enjoy this book. A fascinating look at how much our subconscious influences everything we do everyday. I'm shocked at the other reviews. I think perhaps it's a bit of the whole \"inconvenient truth\" thing; maybe it's not that they don't like the book but they don't like to face what it's trying to tell them - that we do not have complete conscious control over everything. Scary, maybe, but this book can help teach us how to harness that. I'm an actor and director and for someone who has to look at what makes people tick, it's a brill book. My husband got bored of me telling everyone we meet every piecce of research in it!",
            "The number one, rated 'most helpful' review of this book is flawed. It starts out wanting to prove Gladwell wrong, like SO MANY 'ARMCHAIR' intellectuals.There is a study in this book about college students. Their friends rated what kind of people they were, and then strangers looked through their room, and filled out a report on what kind of people they thought they were.The point of contention is that -Gladwell- never explains in the book how the study was conducted. The 'most helpful' review acts as though this was Gladwell's study and that Gladwell had the burden in 'Blink' of explaining the scientific controls for it. That is MORONIC and CHILDISH.This is a book citing DOZENS if not HUNDREDS of scientific studies. If you are the kind of person who wants to prove Gladwell wrong because he is successful, PLEASE READ THE STUDIES HE IS REFERRING TO. They are complete, explain the experimental method, and are interesting of their own right.I am SICK TO DEATH of people who think they are SO SMART who think they have 'proved Gladwell wrong' all because they are DEATHLY AFRAID of primary source technical documents. If you don't even understand what I just said, guess what - you aren't the sad lonely person who is going to prove Gladwell wrong.He does this for a job and its not because everybody isn't as smart as you that they like him, reviewers.If you don't know how to look up reports and studies, and the idea never even occurred to you that this isn't a book of experimental data, please just read 'Clifford the Big Red Dog' instead of trying to prove you are a genius. You're probably not.",
            "Isn't it good to know about the things we know but don't realize how we know them? This book will give you insight on your reactions and some situations where we are not making good decisions. Fast and enjoyable read.",
            "The subtitle `The power of thinking without thinking' nicely captures the essence of this fascinating book.Malcolm Gladwell, author of The Tipping Point, here sets out to explore why it is that sometimes the thinking in the blink of an eye provides greater understanding and insight than that which follows a mountain of analysis. He asserts that our subconscious is continuously collecting and processing information, much of it directing our actions but in ways totally unseen by our conscious mind.The book begins with an introduction to some intriguing examples to illustrate this power of insight and introduces the idea of `thin slicing', the ability we all have to evaluate a situation very quickly, capturing core information on which to base a decision.Having introduced the concept Malcolm is at pains to explain that he is not simply advocating the abandonment of analysis in favour of gut reaction. Our instinctive judgements sometimes prove correct but at other times can lead us astray. His key message is that they offer different approaches to creating understanding, and both analysis and intuition may be performed well or badly. However in some instances, particularly in a rapidly changing world, there is simply not the time for the laboured analysis required in an attempt to understand everything, and the only viable course of action is to thin slice.The good news is that thin slicing skills can be learned and honed. We all collect this information, all of the time, the subtle skill is in being able to use it effectively.This is a fascinating book with ideas of relevance to everyone dealing with change. What makes it particularly engaging is the breadth of examples used to illustrate the ideas. Many of these may have you rethinking not only what you think, but how you think.For example there is a study made by insurance companies of the risk doctors face of being sued. The study identified that the risk had little if anything to do with the quality of the doctor, or even the number of mistakes they made. Rather the level of risk was a direct result of how much the doctor was liked by their patients. The risk was not a function of what the doctor was doing, but how they were being.Another example brings into question the confidence we may have in conducting any kind of customer testing. There's a fascinating account of the testing of types of brandy which deduced that the stated taste preference of customers had nothing to do with the brandy at all. Subconsciously and unbeknown to them it was the shape of the bottle that made the brandy taste better.Once we become aware of this priming of our subconscious, we can use it to our advantage. For example studies have shown that test scores can be dramatically influenced simply be priming our minds with thoughts of success. Students answering questions from the Trivial Pursuit board game scored 55.6% after they had spent five minutes thinking what it would be like to be a professor. In contrast when they spent five minutes thinking about football hooligans they scored 42.6%. Just thinking about professors, primed them to achieve more.Profoundly disturbing is the example of what can happen when we are pressured to rely on our subconscious when it has been miss-primed. The case of Amadou Diallo who was shot by four police officers is used to illustrate the effect similar to autism that is created when our intuition is inappropriately primed.This is an engagingly written account that had me hooked as I read it cover to cover. It develops an interesting idea using examples that will set your thinking running in new directions. An enjoyable and stimulating read. It leaves you at one and the same time seeing things as far less and yet far more simple than they've ever been before.",
            "It was an interesting read, and anecdote laden at that. It has given me food for thought on how I rapidly view my world on a minute to minute basis, all on a subconscious level. Basically, 'thin-slicing' is a tremendous skill set a person can have in navigating the minefield we call Ordinary Life, i.e., our jobs, our family, our friends, our connections to the world. I am also appreciative of the fact that the author has also highlighted hidden dangers and negative costs for thin-slicing, such as 'temporary autism'. Sometimes, there's just no substitute for experienced judgement that only builds in a person after decades of wisdom, expertise, and just plain creative savvy. Overall, a recommended read.",
            "It is a really interesting book with good ideas in it about snap shot judgements and making decisions quickly. The only thing that I feel that it lacks is the application. There are different examples of how other people made decisions but it lacks information when it comes to how we can use these types of techniques in our every day lives. Good book though",
            "This book is a great read! Gladwell has a great gift for being able to tie things together and come up with general principles that make sense based on the evidence. The examples given in the book are great. Some of the conclusions are counter-intuitive to begin with, but make a lot of sense once you have had some time to think about them. A great book with good lessons.",
            "I was absolutely fascinated by this book. I got bogged down in a few places, but overall, the studies, observations, and anecdotes that Gladwell combines in his trademark readable style were absorbing. My edition had an Afterword which I highly commend--conclusions he's come to from feedback since the book's first publication.I was particularly interested in the studies on facial expressions and their significance. I'd always heard that you should smile when you're talking on the telephone, but studies indicate an even more powerful connection between facial expression and emotion. When researchers intentionally mimicked facial expression identified with negative, sad, or evil emotions, they literally started feeling bad!Another fascinating conclusion the Gladwell comes to -- and of particularly significance in this age of information overload -- is that there is a \"sweet spot\" of optimal decision making where we make the best decision, and after that, more information actually deteriorates the quality of decision making. Interesting stuff!",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's Blink is about how unconscious thought, maybe can referred as instinct, affects human behavior and decision making.For example, professionals do what they do without thinking because they have conditioned themselves on the basics so much so that they no longer have to think about it - they just do it. It is like chewing gum and walking at the same time. Two of those things are so basic that most people can do it without thinking about it and moreover while thinking about something else. It is these unthinking thoughts is what Blink describes.Blink also describes about gut feelings. Gut feelings compel people to do or not to do things. Because of the nature of gut feelings, people cannot really describe why they have them. Blink discusses these undescribable gut feelings and how they help us and harm us.Also, Blink talks about situations of TMI (Too Much Information) and how sometimes people who rely on gut and experience can survive and outsmart those who are armed with TMI. I thought the part about TMI was pretty good. Sort of makes me wonder if people who try to integrate TMI really know what they are doing.I have read Outliers, The Tipping Point, and What the Dog Saw. To me, the story about panic and choking from the What The Dog Saw was an extension from Blink. Blink ranks about 2nd best from his books, Outliers being the best. From reading this book, it sort of makes me wonder how how he thinks and how he notices common subtleties of human life. Blink was a different book - it relates more to thought than behavior or effort.Blink was a good book. I was left still thinking about the unconscious thoughts that Blink describes.",
            "\"Blink,\" one in a series of excellent books by Malcolm Gladwell, is one of those rare publications that actually makes you think about how you think. This concept, covered in an engaging and entertaining voice by Gladwell, may seem confusing, strange, boring, or all of the above at first glance. Rest assured -- this book is anything but boring, strange, or confusing -- it is a wonderful publication that entertains and teaches in equal measure.With a rhetorical style akin to that conveyed by Michael Pollen inIn Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto, Gladwell presents readers with data and hypotheses. He carefully and logically supports his conclusion(s), but does not force his perspective on his readers. Gladwell's style, rather, is one of engaging and involving the reader on a journey of learning.For the interested reader, Gladwell offers stories and characters that engage, and ideas and perspectives that stimulate thought. This is a wonderful book that is well worth a read.",
            "This book is a great read. Very engaging and thoughtful. The author provides some wonderful new insights into how we make decisions from the gut or at the blink of an eye. From this insight you can start making more intelligent decisions on how you take advantage of your instincts.My only complaint and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that the author doesn't give enough definitive advice about what we can do to better ourselves with the knowledge he provides. There are suggestions and hints but any conclusion is a little weak. Regardless, I have read this book twice and will read it again so I can continue to understand my own gut instincts and make better decisions in the blink of an eye.If you enjoy this book, check out Emotional Intelligence. Although a little dry, Emotional Intelligence reflects some of the points made by Malcolm Gladwell in Blink.",
            "Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking is Gladwell's book of accurate decisions made rapidly. Gladwell uses examples throughout the book to support his thesis of something he calls \"thin-slicing.\" This term is the snap judgement that crosses a person's mind at a spontaneous moment. The book is laced with interesting and unusual topics of rapid cognition.Although the topics are unusual, they reflect every day life situations for the reader. This gives his audience a connection to the examples that he uses. In the first few hundred pages of the book he uses first impressions in the eyes of an art connoisseur, a car dealer, politicians, and doctors. Each example the person is forced to make a snap judgement. Gladwell's examples make these snap judgements based off years of experience and knowledge. These examples link to the thesis that Blink is based upon.Gladwell gives interesting examples that focus on the unconscious. In the priming experiment a student was given a group of tangled sentences that all give the state of being old. After the student was done reading the sentences, he walked more slowly like an elderly person. This experiment goes behind what Gladwell calls it as the \"locked door\" in your unconscious. This example in the book was unpredictable, unlike some of the other examples that Gladwell gives.After getting further into the book, the examples become less relevant to the thesis. In the beginning, the stories appeared more interesting, but the book sidetracked to other irrelevant topics. One example in particular made me want to skip the section entirely. The topics ranged from a blind taste test of Pepsi product verse Coca-Cola to a singing artist named Kenna who was cheated out of making it big.While reading, I had this feeling that if I were to just randomly pick up this book and start in the middle, I would already have a sense of what the book is primarily about. Although Gladwell is a very good storyteller, his stories didn't seem to have any sort of structure. The book began to lose it's interesting connotation by being repetitive. Gladwell took the \"thin-slicing\" theory and traveled off on a tangent.At the end of the book, there wasn't much of an ending. It ended with another story. If thats the case, then the book could have ended after the first chapter of thin-slicing. Toward the end of the book the people in certain examples are sketched with less experience. For instance, the taste testing challenge and the song artist wouldn't have as much experience as the two women who were professionally taste testers. They have had years of experience and knowledge of understanding their tongue pallet.Overall, the book had a very good point. The author was saying that the more education and experience a person has, the more likely they are to make a better snap judgement. It seems like the author wanted people to be able to slow down the thinking process to control their responses to the event that is taking place.",
            "This book is a real eye opener. It isn't quite like a how to book as the sub title suggests. It is more of a book that explains the brain works. The title suggests is is about how to think. It really focuses on how the brain makes decisions.The points are very interesting but nothing revolutionary. He goes back several times to the point how the brain needs just enough information. To much information overloads the brains and slows the process. These principles are things you already know and experience but didn't quite realize. After reading the book you will find out why those things happen. Through reading the book your mind will start to work. I am sure the average person will think of things where they could apply the principles. I am sure some people will reap huge rewards from the principles in the book. Most will just be enlightened. Overall it is a real good read.",
            "I feel this book provides insights from real world examples which make the book much more tangible for me. As a professional working for a large corporation as well as a citizen in the U.S. the amount of red tape is startling. That said, as with all information one must read it understand how it applies and remember not all situations will ever be the same. Taking the concepts from this book into my job has been very useful. It provokes thought and is very entertaining.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell continues to deliver good reading material which makes the reader think and - if you'll pardon the lame joke - blink in surprise more than once. Gladwell's style is that of the pop intellectual or pop psychologist, but the anecdotes and academic studies he discusses are legitimate and not easily dismissed.Much of the book centers on innate biases, hard-wired perceptive abilities, and the often-surprising strengths and weaknesses of the human ability to make split-second decisions. For readers who are not familiar with heuristics, \"priming\" (the vulnerability of the human brain to the power of suggestion), and basic psychology, this book opens a fascinating realm of discovery and will leave the reader wanting more. Even for readers with a fairly high level of knowledge on such topics, there is certain to be some unfamiliar territory in this book, making it fascinating and fun reading. Just remember: it is a popular book and not an academic treatise. I recommend, whatever the reader's level of familiarity with the topics Gladwell discusses, treating it not as an endpoint but as a launching pad for further investigation.Overall, this is a great and fun read.",
            "This is one of those books you read through with mild pleasure, only to realize at the end that the author's entire point could have been summed up quite well with one simple sentence. In this case, the sentence is: Trust your intuition, because it offers insights that logic can't.That's certainly true. And the anecdotes and research Gladwell uses to support his thesis are entertaining, even if not all of them are as conclusive as he seems to think they are. But basically, this book is an somewhat belabored series of articles connected by the theme \"Trust your intuition.\" If you already believe in the power of intuition and trust your ability to sometimes make snap judgements based on gut feelings seemingly without reason or research, then this book will be a fun little read, but you won't really learn anything new. If you believe intuition is a poor tool in decision-making, and you prefer to research everything into the ground and ignore gut feelings, then I doubt this book will convince you otherwise (but who knows?)I bought this book because I'm studying improv, and my teacher recommended it. Improv requires snap decisions made without deliberation, and I was hoping this book would examine the transcendent state of suspension of deliberation that so many improv students have trouble achieving. How do you turn off your logical brain and react wisely without thinking? Sadly, Gladwell can't tell us how; I don't know whether anyone could. However, if you're interested in a more thorough and in-depth study of a closely related topic (how people can turn off the chattering parts of their brain and get into a groove where decisions come easily and without \"thinking\"), I very highly recommend Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's \"Flow,\" one of the definitive works in the field.Either way, buy \"Blink\" if you'd like some light airport reading. Don't expect anything very meaty, and don't expect any revelations.",
            "How can we decide something and how fast? This book explores this topic.The best thing about this book for me is in revealing how our prejudice miscolours the accuracy of the decisions we make. Gladwel provides some telling examples from associative thinking type questionaires that expose our subconscious assumptions about skin colour or gender that threaten making better choices than those we would make burdened with false assumptions.Blink overall is a fascinating book. Decisions made in a hurry can obviously be ace compared to compiling piles of data and analysing them in non-intuitive, statistical formats. The major buzzword in this book is \"Thin slicing\". Rather than having a whole cake of info on something as a basis on which to make a hopefully correct decision, how thin a slice would you need to arrive at the same conclusion. The answer is surprisingly very thin indeed.Things like a tone of voice can, according to this book prove just as decisive if not more than the content of any speech.Vast and exciting examples of decision making are explored: Simulated wars; police shooting the wrong man/men; judging art work for authenticity; assessing couples breaking up on the basis of their conversations; looking at facial expressions and even the \"Pepsi challenge\" and selling cars. The themes are explored in an exciting fashion.Gladwell reveals a lot about himself and illuminates many areas - helping us to focus on how we can train our faculties to make snap judgements weareas at the same time being wary of making decisions under stress or with wrongful assumptions about people in general.Gladwell conveys the problems inherent in making snap judgements that can be plain wrong. He does not expand too much on this - I suppose this is why many of us are reluctant to make too many snap judgements (on important matters), because this could be just too risky. However this book does help you to avoid any risks, especially if you like a small gamble.I read this book so fast and think it will be helpful and boost the confidence of any interested reader. It is not a long book to read. Please be warned that you should not make blink decisions and think of it as a virtue - it would be nice if you can spot your perfect partner in a blink, but would he/she agree? The fact of the matter is we continuously make snap decisions that are not especially consequential or even when we do make momentuous decisions that are good, it may rely on a good deal of subconscious input. As an example, I looked at this book for less than 10 seconds before buying it, and I'm glad I did.",
            "If you're line of work involves evaluating people in any way shape or form, this is a must read. You won't view your job or how you assess what people bring to the table the same way ever again.The book is a highly entertaining read. The central theme revolves around \"thin slicing\" or how people intuit what they're hearing or seeing. We all recognize that in most every decision making process we undertake, there is a \"gut feel\" that we have about which direction we should take. Why? Where does it come from and do we act upon it or not? Or, do we consciously reason our way to an alternative solution and if so-does that decision wind up being a good one?The author uses a variety of examples to demonstrate why this process of \"thin slicing\" is so powerful. There are a number of intriguing studies woven throughout the book that will have you hungry to learn more. The implicit versus explicit views that we all possess, many of them conflicting, are discussed and analyzed via a number of intriguing case studies.Yes the concepts introduced in Blink tend not to \"fit\" perfectly. The book doesn't satisfy some peoples need to have everything neatly summarized and laid out. But the book is extremely enlightening, thought provoking and leaves you hungry to learn more about the thought processes we all employ to make \"people\" decisions in life. I highly recommend it. You won't be the same after reading it.",
            "I enjoyed \"Blink\" a great deal. I greatly appreciated the discussions of \"thin slicing\" and unconscious thinking, reasoning, and judgments, and found them to be in congruence with other works I have read by psychologists, notably the brilliant Paul Ekman who is able to accurately predict the potential for divorce in marriages after only a brief observation. Interestingly, all of us are able to reach conclusions in much the same way that Ekman does, though we are not cognitively aware of it; this frequently accounts for initial impressions or rapid decisions that, while unexplainable on a conscious level, are actually deeply and quickly processed reactions to our perceptions of events. For more on this subject (mostly from a personal protection standpoint) I also recommend \"The Gift of Fear\" by Gavin De Becker.I am very enthused with Gladwell's critiques of micromanagement, and believe that not only is he correct that the time and energy diverted from workers by over-attentive supervisors is detrimental to workplace performance, but motivation and creativity as well. Upper level administrators should read this book with an eye to problems in their organizations.This is a very thought-provoking book about how we rapidly process information with a high degree of accuracy in our subconscious. As such, I found it informative in understanding hunches, suspicions, and initial impressions that we all make, though we aren't quite certain how or why. I was planning on giving the book five stars up until the very end, when the book just closed. The book really seems like an unfinished work: one page there are interesting, valid arguments being made, and the next page it's over. Were it not for the abruptness of the conclusion, I would easily give the book five stars: it is brilliantly conceived, and generally well executed; it is highly readable and utterly absorbing. I recommend this book without reservations.",
            "Maybe 3 stars is too low, the book had a really great premise, that our subconcious intervenes way more than we realize. Maybe it's mainly because I'm usually a fiction reader but I felt like I had to push to finish the book, and the only reason I kept going to the end was because it was the choice of my book club. Like I said, the premise was good and I did take away much food for thought. At first I felt that I should trust my inner-judgemental mind as one who would cut through the minutia to the truth. But, as the book went on, I realized that he was telling us we also needed to be very careful as that \"truth\" is very much influenced by our outlook on life -- in otherwords a snap decision can be very prejudiced and therefore wrong. I guess my reason for only giving it 3 stars is that I felt that Gladwell used many, many, many examples to get across the same idea, again and again and again. Each of the examples were good, but I think it could have easily been about half as long with his point well expressed.",
            "I rather enjoyed all the stories in this book; it definitely is food for thought, especially, I think, concerning the \"love lab\" experiments where observers can tell if a marriage is healthy or not by observing them conversing about a controversial subject. It is also absolutely fascinating to read about doctors and their decision making, and the study of facial expressions. However, a collection of stories do not make up a definitive discourse on how we make decisions. I thought it interesting that sleep was not even discussed. We all know that lack of sleep can impair our judgement drastically, and as a sleep-deprived parent at times, I can tell it affects my emotions and snap decisions way more than many other factors. That is why I say it makes the brain seem too simplistic; there are just too many variables to be covered. However, I would recommend reading it because it is a pleasure to read and is very quick; and I found it interesting how it caused me to pause and observe my son's pediatrician this morning more carefully. That makes it fun.",
            "Humans make snap decisions about people and things. That's a great concept to understand. But is that one concept worth an entire book?The problem with Blink is that once you agree with the author's initial concept, he never makes a value judgment about whether this phenomenon is a good thing or a band thing. In fact, he makes both arguments ...The first half of the book makes the argument that our \"gut\" instinct is usually correct - in fact - it's more accurate than using logic and reasoning.The second half debunks that theory by implying our biases skew the accuracy of our blink response.Both arguments are buttressed by interesting stories. Either could be true. But in the end, you don't really know which argument to believe. Should we trust our gut instinct? The book never answers that question.Additionally, the book misses the chance to teach readers how to influence a persons \"blink\" reaction. Marketers and salesmen who are reading this book to find out how to influence consumers had better look elsewhere.In short, this is a great title and an interesting book, but it's like a movie that starts off with a great concept, but leaves you disappointed when the lights come back on.",
            "Blink is an enjoyable and light read. With the title Blink: The Power of Thinking without Thinking, one might imagine that the book provides some insight how to be amazingly brilliant without trying.Not at all. The author is essentially making a case for instincts and the \"adaptive unconscious.\" The case is made by providing anecdotal (but enjoyable) stories for 250 pages.The book could have very easily and effectively been condensed into a decent-sized article in Psychology Today. In short, the concept behind the book was \"done/got it/move on\" in a few pages. However, the testimonial/example stories themselves and the author's references to items that I now plan to read (such as Sources of Power by Gary Klein) made the book worth my time.Again, this is not a book with \"ah-ha\" insights or \"put an encyclopedia under your pillow and you'll be brilliant the next morning\" solutions - it's a treatise on not ignoring feelings/instincts simply because you can't put your finger on WHY you know what you know.",
            "This book is full of many little stories that augment the author's point that many judgements are made as split second decisions. When I first started it, I was hoping that it would have more of a scientific understanding of how any why this works. After reading it, it seems as though all I've seen is a large collection of examples that support the point that decisions and judgements are made quickly, and that with practice this can be somewhat controlled.Overall, I don't think that it was a bad book; It just feels like there are a lot of examples that work to lead you to your own conclusions. To borrow a theme from the book, \"something just didn't seem that exciting about it, but it is difficult to put it into words.\"",
            "I wasn't sure exactly what I was in for with this book but because I enjoyed Gladwell's the Tipping Point so much I thought I'd give it a try and I'm glad I did. Here is a book which focuses on thinking without thinking...in other words the point being that using intuition, hunches, or just plain old gut feelings is often better than using logical, deliberate thinking. Interesting concept...going with your gut feeling, right?Malcolm Gladwell shares the results of recent research in psychology and related disciplines, such as neuroscience, which not only confirm the importance of intuitive cognition in human beings but also offer a qualified vindication of it. He argues that intuition is often superior to articulate thinking.Gladwell shares a number of anecdotal examples of where intuition both triumphed and failed, leading him to the conclusion that while both intuitive thinking and cognitive thinking both have their benefits and pratfalls, going with one's gut feeling is often going to be the better choice of the two as long as one is aware of any lurking bear traps, so to speak.The problem with the book is that for all its pseudo-technical terminology of using phrases like \"mind-blindness\" and \"thin-slicing\", the bottom line is that there really is no concrete scientific evidence to support his beliefs. In essence, he is using his own gut feelings and beliefs to support his theories. And how's that for logic! Still, whether you believe Gladwell or not, the fact remains that the book is a very entertaining read. The many examples Gladwell submits will put a smile on your face at least until you start shooting holes in them.",
            "Anyone that enjoyed tipping point needs to get this. I skipped over it a couple of times in the bookstore until I finally decided to spend my giftcard on it. It is a great hub of ideas that deal with how we can develop & depend on our instincts. I've already found myself using the ideas in this book at work to justify some of my approaches. I've also photocopied a chapter & distributed it amongst like-minded coworkers to convince them to read it. If you need a free mindmap of this book or 'tipping point' please email me at kharsakk2000@yahoo.com",
            "This is a book about using your intuition to understand situations and how to read people. As with books about intuition, it takes using your intuition or imagination and having facts that makes this book make sense.Simply put, each story shows us how intuition is used in trying situations or in critical situations where a judgement must be made. How the experts just seem to 'do what they do' without explaining it, or how sometimes we interpret what we see, ignore what is obvious and look back and wonder why we did not pick up on the clues.If you wonder 'how do they do that?' when you observe an expert, Blink can answer that question some of the time. An expert can make a decision using a flash of insight, or as with war, use their overall resources to make a decision in the heat of battle.In the introduction he says he wants us to find the value of 'a blink of an eye' and see that it sometimes is as valuable as deep rational analysis. Then, we see the anecdotes for what they are, rational analysis in the blink of an eye at times.There seems to be subjects here for everyone, an eclectic look into decision making, not scientific completely, maybe even a stretch, but the book is such a quick read as to really keep your interest. I liked his analysis of sports figures, Ted William for one. Williams said he watched the ball hit the bat when would hit. The book reveals that in reality, that is just not humanly possible. It was something else, Williams, an expert, doing what he did best, could not fully explain how he did it.Interesting too is Gladwell's review of the science of reading faces. I was fascinated that the human face has so many expressions that, according to research, may reveal what someone is thinking. My only concern with that, may be that a flash of expression, may be an initial thought, followed by reality. However, if someone is continually flashing an expression, it may reveal some deep seated feelings. One case he uses is in a court room where someone flashes an expression of discust. It is brief and we are not sure where that evaluation is leading, so, was the person discusted at the question or the facts behind it? How can we know?Blink will open up some very interesting perspectives for you who read it. I think it was worth my time and money spent. I believe that we cannot judge (condemn)others from expressions, but awareness of the world around us is really something we all need.",
            "In the 'blink' of an eye, I knew this book would be a waste of my time, yet I continued to read it because I wanted to give it a chance. After all, everyone and their mom was raving about what an 'enlightening' experience this book was. Gladwell does little more than give new examples to old ideas, and I'm not really sure if he thinks split-second decisions are a good thing or a bad thing. I quit reading after the chapter about Van Riper's big victory, so maybe all the interesting stuff is in the end of the book (I wouldn't know because I kept falling asleep by this time). This book was overrated. If you want to hear a bunch of mindless psychobable, just watch the Dr. Phil show (cbs 4et,3ct)",

            "I was assigned this book for a graduate diversity course and was initially excited. In fact, it was on my must read list. With an open mind, I began reading. However, I struggled to finish this book and became increasingly troubled. Why? From a diversity framework, I agree that we do \"blink\" however, we should do so based on educated, seasoned experiences which could help us think/decide with fewer personal biases, prejudices, and negative encounters. Honestly, most people live very busy, complicated lives and most don't have the opportunity/time to think and decide from this conceptual base. In addition, the theorists quoted seemed to brush aside or negate the value of thinking based on popular and accepted theories in sciences, math, philosophy, and anthropology. From a business and political perspective, I wondered if \"blinking\" was the methodology used by Bush administration officials--thinking (deciding} w/out rational analysis/reasoning rooted in sound, reliable, tested and re-tested data? I think this book encourages some to rush to judgement--to think without thinking.Overall, I do appreciate having read it and respond in an academic community full of opportunities for a robust debate. But, I am troubled because I can see evidences of blink being used and causing harmful outcomes.",
            "Most of the best-selling business books are used to offer readers with different tactics on how to make decision on the basis of detailed information and rational thinking. Any decision that is made within a flurry of moment may easily lead to inadvertent slip or more seriously, disastrous consequence.Contrary to other magnum opus pertaining to the subject of decision making, Malcom Gladwell suggests that adaptive unconscious is a powerful decision-making apparatus that is different with the conscious strategy and it is capable of making quick judgements based on scanty information. It does an excellent job of judging people, setting goals, developing new products and initiating action under stressful conditions. The decision quality is as good as decisions made in months of rational analysis. According to him, the ability to use adaptive unconscious can be educated and controlled.This book provides readers with full understanding of the power of adpotive unconscious. It is incontrovertible that we are now living in the business world which is more uncertain and turbulent than what we encountered during the last century. Gladwell guides readers to understand something in the first two seconds of looking in a sophisticated and efficient manner.",
            "I spent my life wandering the Matrix of religion and vague spiritualism. People are said to be born with talents, and these talents are said to come from a higher place beyond ourselves. My grandmother is a published writer whom says she lets the hand of God pass through her to pen. My mother was a high caliber artist and like her, I am a successful designer with my own business as well. One could say artistry runs three generations in my family. A gift from God, or something else?Blink, by the cleverly eloquent Mr. Gladwell, led me astray from the Matrix and into a world of explanation. The most horrible thing about this book is that it not only made sense, it was cleverly woven with intersecting plot lines. This is Christopher Nolan on paper. Its title sexy. It's narrative seductive. From the first sentence you are drawn into a world of \"thin-slicing\", the science behind the power of the single glance and its implications on our intuition.Gut feelings, instinct, and vibes are all carefully explained, from subjects ranging from gambling to speed dating, and even predicting divorce. How many times have you ever KNOWN something, only to rationally explain it away. Or you were in a situation where it felt so right to do something, but logically that decision made no sense. This book is your answer.Forget The Secret. This isn't wishful thinking. When I say this book will change your life, it's because you will finally understand why talent runs in your family. Why you were a natural at whatever it is you do. And why something is off about that stranger you just met. Take control.If you have a feeling to pick up this book, it's not because the spirits are guiding you. It's because you already know the answer subconsciously.

            "Once again, Malcolm Gladwell has published a winner. Blink refers to the ability to make valuable decisions and judgements in just \"the blink of an eye.\" He talks about what makes these instant judgements accurate as well as the pitfalls of snap decisions and gives several examples of each.After reading his prior book, \"Tipping Point\"The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big DifferenceI've become a big fan of Gladwell's. I think every CEO, political leader, etc. should read these books. After watching the business world and recent political events, I've come to the conclusion that leaders \"Act without thinking\"",

Malcom gives us a wake-up call. Our mind is a pattern machine that is capable of making quick jumps and accurate conclusions with very little information. The book's premise and assertions are its strength. The writing is engaging but the packaging a bit too commercial and in some spots faulty. If you have to make a quick decision - I say buy the book and read it - just use it as a starting point to conduct your own observations of how to make quick decisions and be more intuitive.",

            "I read mysteries for the pleasure of reading, non-fiction to learn.But, Blink is one of those rare books that combines high momentum engagement and reading pleasure with information of great importance to just about everyone--especially the citizens of a country facing post-9/11 challenges.Blink addresses crucially important issues of our day--police brutality, bureaucratic intransigence in NASA, Pentagon plans for future war--as well as the millions of times a day citizens make decisions on the basis of invalid assumptions.Blink's message is simple: learn to trust your \"thin slicing\" which permits you to make ACCURATE split-second decisions, but slow down enough to make sure that your split-second decisions are not being biased by previous experience.Rapid cognition--split-second decisions--can be both more accurate than 14-months of scientific scrutiny, or they can be tragically misinformed. But, as Gladwell shows, you can educate and exercise your rapid cognition to avoid critical traps.As someone interested in psychology, I read Blink with great interest: I learned from it and will definitely strive to \"slow down\" when decision-making under pressure.But, at the same time, I'm sorry I just finished reading the book. It was that good. Now I have to go back to the CSI videotapes recorded while I abandoned TV for the greater pleasure of reading Blink.",
            "The beginning of the book is interesting, but after that the Author begins flailing around trying to make his points. Ultimately on the very last page of the book you learn that apparently the whole purpose of his book is to promote his idea that people on trial should be behind a closed door, and communicate to the Judge and jury through \"...e-mail or the use of an intermediary.\" The Author repeatedly demonstrates that he is simply trying to use his influence to push a globalist agenda.",
            "I found this a tremendously interesting read: during two days or so it took me to read it, I really couldn't put it down. (A teacher, I put my students to work doing a bunch of soul-crushing busy work so I could finish reading it during classtime.)It's full of great anecdotes, and Gladwell has a lucid and engaging style.The problem is this: as far as what Gladwell's actually saying, his observations don't sum to much.The basic thesis -- as I'm sure you know -- is that people in certain walks of life are frequently found to exhibit eerily reliable snap judgments, whereby they can arrive at the core of (what seem to us) monstrously complex problems in only a second or two.Fair enough. The phenomenon certainly exists. Gladwell documents it well and you find yourself convinced that he's not making this up.Alas. The book attempts to go further than that, and that's where it falls flat.Gladwell never successfully articulates exactly how it is that his various \"thin-slicers\" actually work their magic. Further, he fails to give proper weight to the counter-evidence: loads of cases where snap judgments fail. Offhand, I would imagine that judging situations based on one's initial impression is, on average, a dumb way to go most of the time (even perilous in some contexts).But so enthusiastic is Gladwell about the laundry-list of exceptions he has collected that it's almost to the point where he's implying that preternatural snap judgments are USUALLY reliable, rather than OCCASIONALLY reliable. Which is quite the daring claim.Finally, Gladwell fails to provide any guidance on the question of how one could systematically learn to hone such a skill, assuming that it can even exist in one's discipline (I remain to be convinced that snap judgments have a role to play in all walks of life).The end result of these shortcomings is that the only thing \"Blink\" does effectively is point out that the phenomenon exists. By itself this is not terribly useful.",
            "Let me start by saying that each chapter in the book is very interesting, easy to read and engaging. A real page turner from this point of view.Now, having said that, as a whole I couldn't see what was the author getting at through the book. The book starts with the premise that some people can make a snap decision about something and be right, which is interesting. But then, the book goes into chapter after chapter of examples on exemptions to this. Which at the end feels like the original premise is completely false. The only conclusion I could get is that some expert in something might be able to make a quick decision and be right, which is mostly chance alone.So in essence I found this book to be mostly unimportant.",

I recommend Blink to anyone remotely interesting in the field of psychology, or even if you just have an interest in the workings of your brain.",
            "Blink was a fascinating and intriguing read. This book presented detailed examples of various situations where people either went with their instinct or against it.

This book makes you think.",

For me, it was like someone finally articulated what I inherently knew about my own mind and thinking --but couldn't describe.

I am fascinated with the ideas he presents --so much so that I am buying the book (again) for my library after having left my copy on an airplane.",
            "Blink is a fun read, full of interesting anecdotes presented in Gladwell's typical writing style--threaded together from one to the next, like one big dinner party discussion. And if this is all one expects, it is enough. But Blink also tries to make an argument, and the weakness of that argument ultimately spoils the book.For anyone who's read Gladwell's writings in The New Yorker, Blink will be familiar in its off-beat focus on, well, whatever. Having previously written on such diverse subjects as the appeal of ketchup and job interviewing, Gladwell seems to be merely presenting a collection of stories about \"thin slicing\", as he calls it--the ability of people to make snap judgements. But in fact, Gladwell tries to convince the reader of the latent power of the brain's \"thin slicer\", to show that deliberation, logic, and carefully conscious thinking can, in fact, be drawbacks. It is here that Blink falls apart.First, Gladwell is never really clear on what his definition of \"thin slicing\" is--some vague form of intuition, of course, but past that he focuses very little on what, neurologically, he actually believes is going on. Instead, he sticks to these anecdotes, which, in fact, frequently don't really help his case.In fact, Blink could be forgiven for a little bit of vagueness--as a pop author, Gladwell knows his readers don't want heavy science and dry evidence collecting. But the skewed, unconvincing, often contradictory evidence presented by his anecdotes is sometimes unforgivable. For example, he presents, at one point, the story of a professor so skilled at reading facial expressions that, just by looking at a few frames of video, he could identify the members of a peaceful South American tribe as easy going, while he picked out members of a warrior tribe with a tradition of homosexuality as violent people with \"much evidence to suggest homosexuality.\" Are we really expected to take this story as proof that one can identify violent traits, not to mention sexual habits, merely from facial expressions?Gladwell sticks to his pop-science in many of his other anecdotes, eschewing unbaised accounts and empirical evidence in favor of interesting stories and, even, interpreting each account to uniformly support his hypothesis (careful readers of the Cook County Hospital story can be forgiven for wondering if this doesn't in fact disprove the power of intuition).Understandably, Gladwell doesn't want to author a dry book of psychology that will sit on shelves in university libraries, but he owes it to the reader to get his facts straight and hold himself to the same standards as, well, real scientists. Read this book if you need to pick up some conversation starters. Don't bother if you want to learn anything concrete.",
            "Blink is a shifting, slippery, difficult book. This is rather a strange thing to say about the book as a general statement because it's written in very, very plain language, is aimed clearly at a mass (though literate) audience, and is a very brisk read in a very svelte book. Many readers will describe it as eminently \"readable.\"Yet, we have a problem. Blink lacks a kind of focus. Good, academic non-fiction will have a point, or a statement of purpose, or a principle to prove. It will have something to say. Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond is an excellent example of this. The Mind's Sky by Timothy Ferris is another.Blink really does not. It is a book that has a very interesting subject and has some very interesting things to say about that subject but lacks the academic courage to declare anything about the subject that might be ultimately useful to the reader or testable by a researcher (this despite many anecdotal stories regarding researchers delving in to this topic).The subject at hand is snap-judgments--or, as the book has it, \"the power of thinking without thinking.\" It is the instinctive sense that our conscious mind makes decisions based upon innumerable and subtle details our subconscious is picking up or, in some cases, where certain training and expertise makes the perceiver unusually sensitive to subtle details others might miss. These conscious decisions come to us instantaneously, overwhelmingly, and ineffably. The author describes this as \"thin-slicing.\" These details coalesce within the subconscious ways that enable the conscious mind to make a very quick, often very accurate decision. The opening section of the book lively describes the process with the story of an art museum acquiring a statue (kouros) and how they went about trying to verify its authenticity. It's an interesting topic that will grab the attention of everyone from the curious dilettante in psychology to the hard-nosed salesman in the business world.But Blink then lapses in to a pattern that ultimately leads nowhere. It firstTells us how very, very accurate \"thin-slicing\" can be, thenHow experts can use thin-slicing to make even better, cooler decisions, thenHow awfully misleading thin-slicing can be--particularly in inexpert hands--along with a discussion of prejudice, then finallyA summation of how people should find a balance between accurate and inaccurate thin-slicing.What is lacking in this book is any kind of scientific rigor. It is replete with stories--many of them amusing--and very interesting concepts. But there are no control groups, laboratory experiments, testable circumstances, or even corollaries speculating on the use or mis-use of thin-slicing. There is nothing ultimately useful about the book. The best that can be said about it, in the end, is that we now have a label and a term for what would customarily be regarded as first impressions.There is a worse and ancillary effect of this book as well. People who read it cover-to-cover will find it wanting due to a lack of rigor. To them, it will at best provide some interesting casual conversation topics. But for the business community--a group of readers notorious for reading bullet points instead of paragraphs, executive summaries instead of full reports, and opening chapters instead of entire books--they will take this book, read the first few sections learning how exciting and accurate thin-slicing can be. Then, they will begin to apply that knowledge to the business world far out of proportion for what is wise to do. You see, they will never make it to the more cautionary sections at the end. If Blink becomes a popular business book, it will wreak incalculable damage on the business community as it teaches the struggling middle-manager new terms by which poor decision-making based upon first impressions are made.That is a scary thing.READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM",
            "Substantively not as good as \"The Tipping Point\", but delivered with the same easy prose. Especially in the beginning, there are some interesting recounts of real life situations. Throughout the book the author draws some conclusions that are tenuous at best and thus the book is probably better if read with a critical eye. The number of copies sold may be misleading in regards to the real world, business knowledge that can be drawn from the book. All in all, I recommend this book as simple, leisure read that should be approached critically.",
            "An entire book that provides nothing more than a problem with no solution. How this book made it onto the front marketing tables at my bookstore, I have no idea other than Gladwell's hair. It's certainly not his propensity for choosing interesting topics. You could get this information, along with informative insight and possible solutions to the problems he presents, by watching some kid show on PBS. Don't waste your time.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's obviously done his research. He writes clearly and articulately. But, I found Blink wanting.While the book starts strong, and presents a compelling argument, in my opinion I thought it kind of fizzled out. I would have enjoyed greater substantiation of the Blink theory.But, this is a pop psychology book. I'm sure the author was advised against inundating readers with too many facts. Still, when reading such a work, more supporting facts would have proven beneficial.It's certainly worth reading (and a fast read), but not necessarily justifiable hard cover material.",
            "Starts off very interesting as if there was some grand scheme that was about to be revealed. However, as the book progressed I was left wondering where all these examples were leading. I finished the book and hadn't learned anything new and was thoroughly disappointed. Don't waste your time or money.",
            "After reading this book, I'm left with a whole lot of cool little stories, but no real point. What was the thesis? What was the conclusion? I'm still confused.It did hold my attention, though.",
            "The two stars are for the interesting subject matter of the book only...the 'adaptive unconscious'. Unfortunately the author is not a subject matter expert. He relates a handful of anecdotes he's obtained from others and tells them over and over throughout the book. This book was in desperate need of another editor. The author should stick to shorter format periodical writing. You won't get anything more out the book than what you can find in the reviews below. Save yourself the money and look for another read.",
            "A mis-mash of other peoples findings, not even pulled together into a cohesive whole. Thought the book might have some original ideas about how to change our snap judgements - NOT SO.",
            "This book starts off well enough. The stuff about Gottman and Eckman was fascinating. Then he gets into the car salesman, and the Warren G. Harding chapter, and the book goes nowhere. By the end of the book, I felt totally ripped off. This was like a short essay expanded into a boring book. If you really want to know about thin-slicing, read Arny Mindell - he can tell you how to do it effectively. Get this book out of the library and read the first sixty to eighty pages. Don't waste your money on this book.",
            "With this book, Gladwell is out to do three things: (1) demonstrate that decisions made quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately, (2) show when we should trust our instincts and when we should be wary of them, and (3) tell us how our snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled. To carry out these tasks, he uses examples that grab your attention. He tells about a psychologist who worked out a method of accurately predicting whether a marriage will last by watching a couple converse for fifteen minutes. It is done through the recognition of patterns. Another example is how an employer could tell whether to hire a potential employee by examining his/her bedroom. He tells how a doctor need not fear malpractice suits if he/she does two things: spends more time with patients and treats them with respect. He looks at speed dating and notes that people tend to make better decisions about potential dates when they don't analyze why they like or don't like someone and just go with their instincts. He tells about how more women and people of color have been hired for professional orchestras when the auditioners are behind a screen. Gladwell's book is fascinating reading and will cause you to rethink the way you understand the decisions you make",
            "Malcolm Gladwell is an essayist who made his bones working for the New Yorker. His first book, THE TIPPING POINT, proved to be a pretty nice commercial and critical success. BLINK, the follow up, seems to stray away from the quality of his debut. BLINK: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking is a pop-psychology book whose main argument is that human judgment is best when its immediate. Gladwell's assertion is that our immediate reaction to events are often the most appropriate. The opposite claim is made as well -- we seem to make our worst judgments when we dwell on them and think about them critically.Gladwell always has an engaging and captivating voice. In his essays, he has the ability to take some of the most seemingly mundane subjects and make them a fascinating topic to think about. BLINK is no buck from this trend; it is very well written, and there's a lot here to think about. The biggest problem with this book is the biggest problem with many of his essays, and in particular, his third book OUTLIERS; he works to prove his hypotheses rather than disprove other possible alternatives. Gladwell uses an assortment of experiments to \"prove\" that our snap judgments are more valuable than otherwise, but he never really gives much credence to the myriad of evidence that suggests otherwise. He gives a few examples, a few anecdotes, a few interesting stories, and that's all the evidence the reader should be expected to want, right?Unfortunately, BLINK proved to not be very convincing. It did, however, prove to be a very fun and engaging book. Even though I was not quite convinced, the ideas presented here are fun to think about. I'd recommend BLINK to other fans of Gladwell's work (or popular science in general), but as always, take it with a grain of salt.",
            "I'm taking the time to write this review only to add to the numbers of 1-star reviews, and therefore hopefully give potential buyers pause before purchasing. I don't know when I've been so disappointed by a book. The reason why I was so disappointed is because the introduction to the book, and the cover of the book stating it's about \"the power of thinking without thinking,\" leads one to believe you're going to get some solid information about how to harness the power of thinking without thinking. Psych! Instead the book is (as the majority of reviews 2-stars and below point out) just a bunch of random anecdotes which teach the reader nothing about how to harness the power of thinking without thinking. The book cover and introduction are slick marketing which wrongfully lead the buyer to believe he or she will be getting some valuable information about how to begin effectively making snap decisions, and instead spend their time reading myriad stories about people who have made snap decisions. Super helpful. It's like booking a hotel online which promises an \"ocean view,\" then getting to the hotel and realizing it's nowhere near the beach.I will say that I relied on my gut feeling and started skimming through the book about 1/3 of the way through to see if he was ever going to actually provide any useful tools relating to making split decisions. After skimming to about 2/3's of the way through, I decided to move to Amazon reviews, which confirmed my impression that the book was never going to get anywhere. So there's an anecdote he can put in a future, revised edition of the book. My gut feeling saved me from experiencing the even greater annoyance I would have had by spending my time finishing a book that was already getting on my nerves.",
            "I didn't read this book in one shot, but many different segments during the course of a couple of months - A book has to be at least interesting to keep me going like this.I like the many stories in this book. They always offer me some insights, which not necessarily agree with the author's points. It's funny to see how the author himself contradict himself in the book - but understandably so, because we live in such a paradoxical world.Paradoxical especially when the unconscious mind is involved. Kudos to Malcolm to make a bestseller out of the subject of the unconscious mind, so the word does not only belong to the psychotherapists' arena.Are we going to trust our unconscious mind? The book gives many examples to do so, and many examples not to. It may not be because Malcolm Gladwell likes to contradict himself, but that there are layers of our unconscious mind. Some layers are innate, those we call \"instinct\". They are unknown to us until the snap judgment is made, in another word, we \"figure it out before we realize we have figured it out\". In those cases, it's a good idea to listen to the barameter of the body. But some unconscious layers are programed, like how to drive, like how we have unconscious prejudice towards a certain group of people.Another big insight I've got out of this book's stories is that those who have \"made it\" may not necessarily know how they made it, therefore they may not make good teachers. There is a fact that they've made it, and there is their own understanding of how they made it. There may be a huge gap between the two. So shall we trust what they teach and follow, or shall we learn from what they have done and follow it, which is to trust our own inner knowing? My answer would be obvious, as I'm a hypnotherapist and my business tagline is \"Access Your Inner Wisdom\".Another very useful question that you have to ask while reading this book is: Is it true that the more we know, the better we think?Or sometimes the best for us to do is to blink?",
            "I was looking for a book to help me remember to blink. \"Breathe\" (the book) worked so well for me, I figured I could supplement more of my autonomic functions this way. Beyond that, this book comes in audio format! Now I can use my Ipod to play it and avoid forgetting at all. I am still waiting on that for \"Breathe\", it would be nice to not scare the people on the bus by passing out again. All in all this is a wonderful product and a good means to self improvement.",
            "In \"Blink,\" renowned author of \"The Tipping Point,\" Malcolm Gladwell, explores the science of split-second decisions and their ramifications on our everyday judgments. Do we as humans really know how or why we make the decisions we do? How can we make better decisions without devastating repercussions? Gladwell explores these ideas using many stories and examples, and argues that we can come to very excellent yet lightning fast conclusions because of all the information already stored in our brains, and surmises that the first two seconds in our decision-making process is the most vital. With this in mind, Gladwell demonstrates that split-second decisions can be just as reliable as those made after much longer intellectual digesting. Every story in the book will leave you wanting to learn more about the subject, which is always a good thing. All in all the book's another triumph for Gladwell, and his ideas about \"thin-slicing\" will get you wondering, too. But in that there's a beauty, because he lets you come to your own conclusions, simply laying the foundation for his mind-bending theories, and opening up his interpretations for discussion.",
            "Gladwell introduces the reader to the concept of \"thin slicing\", which is our intuitive responses to a situation are often correct. This is interesting as we were raised to believe that our snap judgments are often misled. Gladwell, who is a journalist for the \"The New Yorker\", uses his journalistic skills to organize this book which highlights cases of research studies, discussions, interviews, and real world examples about the concept of thin slicing. His journalistic writing style allows the book to be a quick read, and Gladwell does not drown the reader in scientific mumbo jumbo. Gladwell provides solid evidence that our intuitions are often correct, however these intuitions may mislead us due to our inner prejudice. In order to fully grasp the power of thin slicing we have to calm our inner prejudice. \"Blink\" is a quick read that informs the reader of a concept that we use on an everyday basis, yet we are not conscious of it.",
            "Malcom Gladwell of course took the world by storm with Tipping Point and had a tremendous effort in Outliers about what makes great people great. In my opinion, BLINK is only a so-so effort from someone that could produce something much better.Blink discusses how we make snap judgements more than we think we do and how to harness the power of those, but also to beware of those as well. It discusses the number of different examples of how we do this, but it seems repetitive and redundant. I didn't really learn anything new in the 2nd half of the book that wasn't presented in the first portion other than that I should beware of these instincts. So what I am unclear on is, should I trust the instincts or beware of them? Both? Depends on the situation? I guess that can be left up to interpretation. There are tons of anecdotes which is what Gladwell does well. Some are very interesting such as New Coke vs. Pepsi and snap judgements we make when we meet different people, etc. Some are not so interesting such as that when he speaks of military snipers-his point being how it is interesting that in a sequence that is 2.5 seconds, you can describe it for several minutes or more what was going through your head-which I believe is true.There is value with this book-which is essentially in understanding those philosophies above. I will consistently think of my BLINK instincts and be aware of them whereas before I was not. I will also remember not to judge things on those BLINK instincts and \"Thin Slicing\"-which is easy for all of us to do. I'm glad I read it-which is why it gets 3 stars-but I can't say it will change your life, but then again Gladwell probably would not say that either. Was this review too long? I guess if it was longer than a BLINK maybe I lost you? Or maybe I didn't?",
            "I read the entire book (nearly 300 pages) and not once does he tell you how to utilize/hone/refine/implement any of the thin-slicing skills that the book is about. It's just a collection of short stories to prove the point that thin-slicing is as effective as exhaustive scientific research. This would be an excellent book for an undergrad Intro to Psychology class, but for someone looking to learn how to apply those skills in the real world, it is awful. What makes it so bad is that he implies that readers are going to come away with some sense of how to utlize their thin-slicing skills. I am actually upset that I read this entire book. I wish I could get my Sunday back.",
            "This book does nothing more than skims the surface on the subject of snap judgments and general psychology. Gladwell does nothing more than report on the subject matter, offering no depth, no analysis, no digging deeper into associated concepts to help the reader better understand the context and material in the book; not to mention that the more cognitive types will find it - quite literally - an empty read.Read it like a news story if you must, because in my opinion it's just one long-winded, repetitive news article.Cheers.",

Unfortunately, there was absolutely nothing new that I took away from this book.

            "According to Gladwell, we think without thinking by using limited information to come to our conclusion. This is an approach we use in the time of information overload, probably do reduce the intelectual stress of the overload.Rapid cognition is a different name for hunch or intuition and several of the examples Gladwell discusses are interesting: the discovery of a Greek statue that fooled one group of art experts, but was later shown to be a fake by another group. Based on this example, the book analyzes alternative uses of thinslicing and gives a wide range of example from speed dating, tennis, war games, malpractice suits, popular music, and predicting divorce. The stories are interesting and Gladwell expertly weaves these examples with accounts of scientific studies. He points out an important fact: science partially, but seldom full, explains the largely unconscious phenomenon that we have all experienced at one time or another in our lives.I agree with many reviewers that thinslicing reflects our experiences, training, knowledge and prejudices.This book is probably one of the more thoughtprovoking books that I have read.

With his second book, Gladwell has crafted a book every bit as addicting as \"The Tipping Point.\" Having used \"The Tipping Point\" as a book for students in high school business programs, I wish I taught psychology, as \"Blink\" would give me plenty to chew on. Students would thrill to the part about observing the couples for a few minutes to figure out if they will stay together! More importantly, the account of the failed war games can make one pause at the way our military is preparing for war around the world. Just like his previous book, Gladwell gives us plenty to chew on here, which means its effects will linger long after you've read it in a four hour session. Can't wait to see what Gladwell tackles next!",
            "Once in a while, a book comes along that changes the way you see the world. Blink is one of those books.Psychologist Malcolm Gladwell explores the decision-making process of the sub conscious mind. Almost as fast as the speed of light, the brain processes information, evaluates input, sorts and prioritizes data and responds with a judgment, all in the blink of an eye. As humans, we are constantly, unknowingly, making snap decisions every minute we are awake.If we could slow down time to its smallest elements and study ourselves in the process, we might understand more clearly how and why we make the decisions we do. In the knowing of how that works, might come a better understanding of how to make more informed, more thoughtful, right decisions.Gladwell looks at married couples, police officers in the line of fire, combat troops, autistic people, and many others to grasp the complexities and simplicities of the decision-making process. Learning how we \"think without thinking\" may teach us how to see more clearly and critically and to make better choices along the way.Blink is a fascinating work.",
            "I like reading Gladwell's material--his articles in the NewYorker are first class--because of his passion for finding the esoteric and distilling it into something that an everyday person can understand. In Blink, Gladwell is nonpareil in amalgamating seemingly unrelated subjects and weaves them into a compelling argument, which goes as follows: our conclusions are often made at a speed faster than the blink of an eye, and we must be aware of this tendency, and check it in situations when it is a disservice. Gladwell, for instance, cautions against this when life or death situations are involved.The irony is that whereas Blink is about first-conclusion-bias and how it can cause egregious consequences, Gladwell is himself a victim of first conclusion bias, and this has compromised what would have otherwise been a superb book. For instance, we are presented with an unusual study that concerns the heights of the Fortune 500 C.E.O. According to Gladwell, there is causa justificio to believe that since most C.E.Os are over 6'-tall the Warren Harding error is at play. (Gladwell goes at length to explain what the Warren Harding error is.) I fear that by just looking at patterns and forming conclusions based on those patterns, Gladwell has himself been a victim of \"thin-slicing.\"Nonetheless, the writing style is first rate; William Strunk is smiling in his grave.Gladwell covers the Amadou Diallo case extensively, but relies almost entirely on the testimony of the officers as his source. I wonder what Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would have thought about such a methodology.The helpful anecdotes in the book were the Getty Museum Kouros Scandal, the study on the car dealerships in IL, the Munchen Philharmonic and trombonist saga, the story on Paul Ekman, and the Love-Connector.If it weren't for Gladwell's propensity to draw conclusions based on apocryphal situations or data, I would have rated it 5 stars. Nonetheless, a fascinating insight into the arcane field of cognitive psychology.",
            "This book was thoroughly enjoyable. I must confess that until now I didn't realize how much thin-slicing I do in my life fortunately most of it in a positive way and the few negative misuses are not significant, whew!Mr Gladwell carefully and simply elucidates the essence of thin slicing and when and how to apply it judiciousily. It really does make you question your dearly held preconceptions.I frind most touching chapters six and seven dealing with Diallo to be highly enlightening as well as saddening, as these scenarios will undoubtledly continue to be played out in major cities.Once again thanks a great and fun read.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell is not a typical business writer. He doesn't package common sense bromides into check lists for success. Instead, he observes, ties together disparate anecdotes, and he comments. He expects the reader to think, not just passively accept wisdom from on high. Like a good coach or teacher, he doesn't provide answers, he offers insights and suggestions.Blink asks us to consider whether -- and if so, when -- intuitive analysis trumps data-driven analysis. I found the book refreshing and even encouraging. Again, it doesn't offer a checklist for success, but it might make a discerning readers wonder how often they hide behind spreadsheets and presentations instead of trusting their gut and taking action.Those expecting a sequel to the Tipping Point will be disappointed. This is a new work with new questions and observations. However, like the Tipping Point, Gladwell makes the inquiry interesting and very readable. Highly recommended for businesses large or small.",
            "A review by Dr. Joseph SugliaMalcolm Gladwell's BLINK (2005) is not a meticulously researched book. Nearly all of its 'research' was derived from studies in THE JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY. In the book's Notes (a mere seven pages in length), you will count fifteen references to that journal and a few references to other sources.It seems appropriate that Gladwell's research is so slipshod. After all, BLINK is like a war machine pitted against research in all forms. There simply isn't time to investigate and deliberate, after all. And the more you research, the less you will know.The more you think, the less you will know.BLINK celebrates and affirms pre-knowledge, the uncritical reflex, the snap judgment, the spur-of-the-moment decision.Our initial perception of things is always correct, according to Gladwell, unless our minds are led astray by some extraneous matter. And all of us would come to the same conclusions, as long as we refine our \"thin-slicing\" skills. \"To thin-slice,\" in this context, means to extract the salient meaning from an initial impression. All of us are afforded an immediate and direct insight into the atemporal essences of things.All of this is 'argued' anecdotally. As I mentioned in the opening of the review, nearly all of the anecdotes were stolen from a single source. And in many cases, misappropriated. Gladwell tells us that students can instantly judge a teacher's effectiveness as soon as s/he walks into the classroom. What Gladwell doesn't tell us is that the article from which he derived this `truth' concerns the impact of a teacher's perceived sex-appeal on course evaluations.How the 'glimpse' actually works is never explained; we are told, in several places, that instantaneous intuition \"bubbles up\" unbidden from the recesses of the \"adaptive unconscious.\" \"The\" adaptive unconscious, mind you, as if there could only be one. This is, of course, monism, and Gladwell believes in absolutes.Of course, one's initial impressions may yield profitable results. But to say that one's immediate intuition of the world is inherently superior to slow and careful thinking is madness. One should beware of any mysticism, and Gladwell's blank intuitionism could easily be put in the service of a fascistic Wille zur Macht.BLINK's target audience is composed of Hollywood producers, literary agents, advertisers, and military strategists. You will learn in this book that films that exhibit Tom Hanks are superior to those that do not, that margarine tastes better when packaged in foil, that music sounds better when marketed the right way to the right people, that military strikes should be carried out without discipline or forethought. The surface impression is everything. Submit to your impulses!BLINK is American pop-culture's defense of its own stupidity.Dr. Joseph Suglia",
            "This book is a series of trivial little stores with vast conclusions drawn to fit the authors needs. In short, we often make decisions( quick or not). Some correct and some incorrect. I just can't express my disappointment with this book. I cannot find any conclusions in this book that are not contradicted later. This is not a self help or an improvement book, just stories how decisions affects our lives. The stories are interesting but drawn out so much that you can skip chapters and not miss anything.",
            "I guess the thinner the slice the better the decision, so I should make decisions on no information and select leaders with the least experience. Should have talked more about knowing when enough info is sufficient and how to identify the risks involved with making decisions rather than pushing the line that less really is more.

            "Blink: The Power of Thinking Without ThinkingI am 63 years old and an avid reader. If I had a 10 Best Books list, \"Blink\" would be on the list. It is that good. The author does a superb job of explaining how the subconscious works, a subject that I and most people know very little about. Yet, as the book illustrates, with example after example, our subconscious plays an extremely important role in our lives. For those who want facts, this book has facts. For those who are easily bored with this sort of thing, don't worry, you will be thoroughly entertained. The blend is delicious.",
            "This well-written book shows several studies that have been conducted on how we can, in a 'blink', make an accurate assessment of any situation. The catch, however, is that one must be knowledgeable about the situation at hand.It also shows how we can be programmed into biases by those who know how to do such things.This book is very insightful on just how our brains are wired to work. A very interesting subject.",
            "It took a long while for him to reference the author of one of my favorite books, but Gladwell does an excellent job (unintentionally?) on expanding Gavin Debeckers must read work, The Gift of Fear. The idea that intuition is not mystery but science and that first impressions should (at times) be trusted above careful analysis is the bold margin notes I have written in both books. There is a very good reason to trust your gut feelings. Gladwell explores why we have them in the first place and how they can help us, get in our way, and most importantly how to tell the difference.Like DeBecker, Gladwell explains that intuition can be informed. Out \"guts\" can be taught. Buying this book and spending some time in it would be a very good idea.",
            "Very interesting read. I would suggest reading this book if you enjoy psychology and studies in human behavior. I read it in 3 days and couldn't put it down. I read Freakonomics and Superfreakonomics and Amazon suggested I might like this book. Good job Amazon.",

If you stick with the techniques that you learn, you can read at speeds exponentially faster than what you're currently at. Second, with regards to this book, I'd say it's pretty good. The material is very interesting, it really gets you thinking a different way. Malcolm Gladwell sure knows how to write books. He is an excellent author, and I think that this book should be on your to-do list for the next year. There is a little too much fluff in the book surrounding the juicy details, but nothing's stopping you from skimming past that.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell does it again. The mind is an amazingly complex thing. This book is about the first 2 seconds you look at something and come to a conclusion. With attention-grabbing stories to get the concepts across, I found myself making notes b/c they were so many things I'd like to share with others.",

            "One of the best books i have read in a while, \"Blink: The power of Thinking without THinking\" takes the complicated processes of the mind and translates them into plain english. The book starts off with an interesting story about how snap judgment works and explains what it is an how it works. The simple explanation of the brain process', and the interesting stories make this book an easy 5 stars, recommended reading for anyone and everyone.",
            "Mr. Gladwell's subject is important, and he explores a number of thought provoking issues. However, like so many pop \"science lite\" tomes, Blink works awfully hard (and without much success) to provide a unifying theme for a scattershot collection of admittedly interesting examples. His bottomline observation: humans often make snap judgements; sometimes, that's good. Sometimes, that's bad. Got it. I'll make a snap judgment and say that Malcolm's bank account is in pretty good shape.",

This makes his books very readable and enjoyable.The trouble here comes when you wish to apply his theories. The Tipping Point was filled with practical applications. This book is a bit more of a stretch.The concept of the book is great. The question is what can you do about it? Companies such as ehuddle.com and others have been promoting tools to speed up the deceision-making process for some time now. I wish the book would have had more real examples I can apply to my life.Overall - a great summer read!",
            "Gladwell without doubt understands the workings of the subject he explores in this monograph. From the moment I read its introduction, which described the curious case of some art experts identifying a fake kouroi (type of ancient Greek statue) at first glance, I \"knew\" (or \"thin-sliced,\" as Gladwell puts it) the book would be fascinating.As is well publicized, the book is a collection of stories of how first impressions knowingly or not dictates our decision-making. Each chapter consists of a major case study, adorned with smaller cases that support the major one. In its insightfulness in pointing out details of everyday behaviors that easily go neglected the book resembles Atul Gawande's recent Complications (a reflection on everyday practices of surgeons). In its structure and in its roundabout way in implicating the human condition the book is reminiscent of Oliver Sacks' clinical tales.Such similarity notwithstanding there is a difference between Blink and Gawande's or Sacks' books that shouldn't be overlooked. The subjects for each chapter of the essays of latter two were more or less independent; for Blink, the entire book is about rapid cognition. As such readers are subject to ask for more than a compendium of interesting tales. Examples of questions one might ask are: What percentage of our everyday decisions is based on rapid cognition? Are there particular fields/professions in which decisions are more prone to be dictated by first impressions? If so, why? What is a good criterion that can be used in determining whether to make the most of our brain's thin-slicing capability or to be wary of it?It was indeed interesting to learn about our brain's capabilities and the advances in psychological science that studies this capability. But it was Gladwell's mastery in story telling that was the most impressive.",
            "I enjoyed the first few chapters immensely, as well as the conclusion. The author uses descriptive stories to make his case, and honestly I was not sure why he was telling some of the stories. Until the end of the book. I would suggest hanging in until the end if you make this purchase. Just commit to read the whole book or do not waste your money to buy it. Mr Gladwell has some cool ideas in this book, it just takes some time to pull them together with a unified theme.",
            "This book follows many others describing the hidden realities of how we tick. But there's good self-discovery offered in the insight of &#34;the-how&#34; our mental functions actually appear to operate.It is evident that we are almost all naturally outfitted to be many times more mentally powerful and efficient in our existences, yet almost none of us recognizes this capacity. Forget the self help, self actuation, self motivation books and lecturers - use this book and others like it to truly begin to understand how we really work. So many things will begin to make sense from direct experience - instinct, seeming extra sensory recognitions, gut awareness, hunches - all that sensory input that each of us absorbs day to day gets analyzed, strained and assigned a level of recognition, long before we are consciously aware of why we do or think what we do.This book is an excellent addendum to the Human Animal Operating Manual.",

            "This book was recommended from a friend who enjoys reading sociology books. Since we have that in common, I looked into borrowing this from the library. The library only had an audiobook so I just rented it. The book has very curious scenarios and focuses on the fact that American's overvalue logic & undervalue the subconscious, but possibly more reliable judgements that we make. It had great examples with research that sparked the curiousity: why Coke's sip test fails though people do prefer it to Pepsi, why U2's music took so long to be played on the radio (phone tallies said it didn't have what it should, but that method gives the wrong impression of a song). My problem with it was actually the author's voice. His inflection was good, but his tone was dull. He didn't sound like a boring college professor, but his voice is one without much variance and it could fade into the background easily or sooth you to sleep. I wish I could have gotten my hands on the book... (but I don't have money in the budget for purchasing the numerous books I'd like to read right now). Maybe I will someday.",

If people headed their predictions, the countries divorce rate would be at like 10%. Imagine that!

            "I read this for a book club and it's stimulating, fascinating and interesting! It is also a fast read with lots of examples to prove his point of snap judgements ~~ of why we make instant decisions the way we do. This is not a teaching tool by any means, but just a series of examples provided to show that there is more that meets the eye than what we see on the surface. From thin slicing to Listening with your eyes, this book skims over the first two seconds of first impressions. And that is fascinating!!If you're interested in why things work out the way they do, this book is it. Remember the New Coke campaign? It goes into details here about first impressions and other group studies about the campaign that flopped. Gladwell even writes of Kenna, a semi-famous but very talented singer who just doesn't quite make it on the radio waves. There's the statue story of where just about everyone believed they had the real thing on their hands, but to find out it was a forgery long after they've spent millions of dollars on this \"find.\" Gladwell takes these stories and dissect them bit by bit and talks about the unconcious. He explains why some of these people have a nagging feeling that something isn't \"quite right\" and how they've stumbled onto the answers that eventually proved their points.This book also explains how economics and marketing come into play as well, why some campaigns fail and why others succeed. It even attempts to explain why some athletes are more successful than others. There's even a chapter on why people pick people to be their CEOs or even their president (Warren Harding is used as an example). It is just purely fascinating and interesting!

            "Had to pick this up for a class, and as with most examples of Gladwell's work, all you get are sloppy examples that may or may not loosely apply to the word he has chosen for a title. All he does is provide shaky examples of what he want's to \"prove\" without giving any kind of nod to a counter example. To make matters worse the topic of the book is a dangerous one for people who believe that Malcom Gladwell has anything good to say. Please, for the sake of mankind do not read this book.",

            "Malcolm Gladwell ties his stories well together - he is a master at making things previously unnoticed incredibly interesting.His books are very fast and easy reads and yet very applicable to your everyday life and outlook.",
            "I loved the first few chapters of the book.The story of the artists' judgement over the piece in the museum in a few seconds as against the thorough analysis of the scientists' and lawyers' was a great example of how sometimes decisions based on intuition are more accurate.I love the way Gladwell describes the storytelling problem of people wherein we try and justify things not because they have a justification but because a story makes it more believable. The examples of subjects exhibiting a racial attitude even when they thought otherwise and the explanation of racial attitude coming in two levels: conscious and unconscious was very provoking as well. Another wonderful theory was that of music auditions becoming fairer when a screen was brought in between the panel and the participant. Shutting off too much information by removing one of the senses really does make the other sense better. However, there were some examples in the latter half that seemed somewhat less convincing to me such as the war commander, the Pepsi challenge and the Warren Harding Error. When I read 'The Power of thinking without thinking' on the cover, I was hoping to read about some great instances of this power that throw more light into the art and make the reader more equipped with the decision making process.I was a little disappointed here. The booked lacked a conclusive and convincing end but it was still an enjoyable read with all its research and stories.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's Blink is an otherwise very interesting book with a very serious flaw: what he calls the Warren Harding Mistake. Gladwell makes the point that appearances can be deceiving, which most of us have experienced. But this example of Warren Harding is not a good one. Underlying his argument is an implied assumption that Harding was campaigning for President in the post 1960 television age. In 1920, most Americans still lived on farms and got their news delivered through the mail. There was no radio or television. Harding campaigned from his front porch like a Gilded Age candidate. It's doubtful that most voters even knew what he looked like.Harding was elected President in 1920 by 60 per cent of the electorate. It was one of the largest vote majorities in American history. His predecessor, Woodrow Wilson, had been elected and reelected by narrow pluralities and helped by a divided Republican party in 1912. After being reelected in 1916, Wilson led the country into World War I that began with a burst of patriotism but ended in dubious European diplomatic machinations and in anger and disillusionment.Gladwell mentions polls of historians that rank Harding as among the worst Presidents in American History. The poll of historians Gladwell is probably referring to is the 1962 poll commissioned by Arthur Schlesinger, Sr. President Kennedy was invited to participate because he was a published author of history, Kennedy declined, because after one year in office, he said he understood the role events played in making or breaking a presidency. Kennedy did comment, after seeing the results, he thought the poll had overrated Woodrow Wilson.What makes Harding's presidency the worst? Well, no doubt his was the one where a foreign army invaded the United States and burned down the Capitol and the White House? Wait a minute that was another President.The upshot of Harding's presidency was this: Harding died of congestive heart failure two years and five months into his Presidency, just as the Teapot Dome scandal boiled over. Coolidge assumed the Presidency upon Harding's death. Coolidge appointed a bipartisan team of special prosecutors. They indicted two cabinet officers. One was convicted, the other acquitted. The acquitted cabinet officer was forced to resign by Coolidge. Then he wrote a book blaming Harding for everything. Harding was unavailable for comment. Coolidge was elected to his own Presidency by 54 per cent of the vote in 1924.Where the historians saw idealism and nobility in Wilson, the electorate came to see megalomania and delusions of grandeur. Where historians saw Harding as a small town, corrupt Babbitt (referring to the character in the eponymous Sinclair Lewis novel), the electorate saw a familiar gilded age politician who was probably corrupt but wasn't a threat to their life and limb.The real Warren G. Harding mistake here is in assuming that expertise is without bias. I just don't agree that Harding is an example of looks deceiving the voters. I think the voters knew exactly who Harding was and that was what they wanted.But Malcolm Gladwell is a very original thinker and the rest of Blink is well worth your time.",
            "I was initially drawn toward Blink: the Power of Thinking Without Thinking, by Malcolm Gladwell, because of my interest in how people think, and why we choose to believe certain things or take certain actions. The subtitle leapt out at me, filling me with high expectations for Gladwell's book. Thankfully, Gladwell exceeded these expectations with his developed thesis and absorbing writing style. In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell explains how to predict the quality of a relationship in just a few minutes, how George Sorros made his billions, how to read a person's face, why speed dating is successful, and many other topics you'll wonder why you never wondered about. Blink is rightfully a \"#1 National Bestseller,\" as stated on the cover.Gladwell begins by explaining that our unconscious mind often helps us make decisions (called \"thin-slicing,\" \"snap judging\" or \"mind reading\"). However, we often misuse our intuition by stereotyping unknowingly, so we should make a deliberate effort to not judge by appearances. Then, Gladwell states that if we overanalyze a situation, we will probably make the wrong decision. We can improve \"mind reading\" with practice, as expert psychologists and food critics have done. Then, in the afterword, Gladwell tells us that his main purpose is to reduce racism and prejudice, whether it is unconscious or conscious.Gladwell masterfully adds layer upon layer to his thesis throughout each chapter. Each chapter contributed a new idea to the main idea, while staying on track, and not branching out into seemingly random topics, as some of his other books do, specifically What the Dog Saw. Gladwell proves his point with personal experiences, stories, statistics, and even a test that you can take online ([...])! I also appreciated Gladwell's straightforward writing style, which was especially helpful when explaining how people think - a very complicated topic!For me, the chapter that was the most attention-grabbing, and was the most aptly connected to all of Gladwell's points, was Chapter 6, titled \"Seven Seconds in the Bronx: The Delicate Art of Mind Reading.\" In Chapter 6, Gladwell vividly describes a shooting in the Bronx, in which the police, using intuition based on stereotypes, shot Amadou Diallo, because they assumed he was going to shoot them. Because of incorrect snap judgments, these police officers presupposed that Diallo, who was standing idly outside, was a burglar. They assumed that he had a gun, that he was pulling it out, and that he was going to shoot them, when, in fact, Diallo was just getting his wallet from his pocket, because he thought the officers would stop bothering him if they saw his ID. This tragic story demonstrates the pitfalls of amateur thin-slicing. Additionally, Chapter 6 was my favorite chapter because it allowed Gladwell's captivating writing style to shine. I found myself absorbed by Gladwell's play-by-play of the seven seconds that determined life or death for Amadou Diallo. This chapter encapsulated Gladwell's \"real lesson of Blink: It is not enough simply to explore the hidden recesses of our unconscious. Once we all know about how the mind works- and about the strengths and weaknesses of human judgment- it is our responsibility to act.\"Although, overall, I rated Blink as a five-star book, I felt that Gladwell could have shortened some of his stories. His constant summaries were very helpful, but they were excessive. (I find it odd that Gladwell first wrote Blink, and over-summarized, and then wrote What the Dog Saw, and couldn't manage to stay on the topic he said he would talk about.)Overall, I immensely enjoyed reading Blink, because it was a stimulating, smooth read. Gladwell successfully supported his thesis: we make split-second decisions, which we should ensure are well-made. In an interview with Malcolm Gladwell, he sums up Blink by saying we should pay attention to \"the smallest components of our everyday lives...when we meet a new person or have to make a decision under conditions of stress. I think it's time we paid more attention to those fleeting moments. I think that if we did, it would change the way wars are fought...the way couples are counseled...and on and on. And if you combine all those little changes together, you end up with a different and happier world.\"",
            "This book tells you two points: 1. Blink is possible 2. It takes practice. That's it. I don't think I've learned a lot from this book.",
            "I'll do what Gladwell suggests inside the first chapters, \"Thin-Slicing,\" where one brings all one's experience and intuition to bear in the first impressions of the book. It's a nice book for the safe discussion of what clever scientific observation would say normally goes on inside our skins. That's it. Unless you're in a field where you want to determine how people make decisions in popular culture, get this book from a lending library and save the shekels. This is a book I've read to find out why it sold well.And I'll offer this: it's a pleasant read with very interesting anecdotes. It could give more courage to your convictions that skill isn't always backed by decades of experience. But this is not a book to provide pointers on how to develop your skills in thinking without thinking. You already know how to do that. Those skills are called intuition and instinct.Maybe I'll change this review after I finish the book ;)",

            "Having taken sociology as a minor in college, I personally found this book to be quite intriguing as Malcom Gladwell did an outstanding job in explaining and providing examples of how people react with one another or find themselves in certain situations from the perspective of utilizing the unconscious portion of one's mind. Simply put, the title of his book, says it all! His scientific approach to rapid cognition, along with other studies such as the race IAT, will leave you dumbfounded as you try to attempt to either shape, confirm, or deny your own opinion of how your perceive people of different races when you associate them with different words. I have always loved learning about people, social groups, and knowing why people behave or respond they way they do with other people and/or other cultures. This book just takes it a step further by explaining how people's rapid intuitiveness and instant judgment often provides a more accurate conclusion than what they would have otherwise spent large amounts of time thinking about only to surface with poor judgment aka the wrong answer/solution (in some cases....not all). If anything, this book will make you a bit more life smart/people smart/street smart in being more mindful and understanding of how people behave and make judgments...especially when judgments occur in the BLINK of an eye!",
            "In this well-written and easy-to-read book, Malcolm Gladwell explores the ways our first impressions and judgments are formed. It approaches this theme from both the positive and negative points of view, showing how oftentimes our first instinct can be the correct one even when the evidence seems to show something different, while at other times our snap judgments can be based on faulty physiological and socially-conditioned mechanisms. Gladwell includes examples from a variety of disiplines, from science and war to marketing and the arts. Some reviewers have criticized the author for not providing more of science to validify his theory. However, Gladwell is not a scientist, and he is not attempting to posit a new and wide-ranging theory for the world to accept. Gladwell's strength is in making the science of everyday concepts accessible and applicable for readers who may not otherwise read about such a topic. The book succeeds in making the reader question and think about the conclusions we reach - both in the heat in the moment and after conscious deliberation. He also offers potential guidelines for deciding when each is preferrable. Some of the issues he probes are of vital importance in how individuals and institutions make decisions in a variety of fields, which makes his book of great importance as well as of great interest.On a personal note, I found this book to intersect very nicely with some of my own research into the role of technique and structure in creativity, improvisation, and flow. The real-life examples Gladwell provides definitely make the topic engaging and alive, which I believe is very necessary in getting important messages across in a way that is accessible to people from a variety of backgrounds and education levels. So as a researcher and as a writer, I found Gladwell's book to be very valuable.",
            "The book was interesting and I enjoy learning about common things on a deeper level. But I thought the book was a little contradictary. In some stories he talked about those first 2 seconds, the results of \"thin slicing\", and the appropriate response from it and other times the inappropriate response occurred. It had me a little confused. After reading the book (well really I listened to it on CD) I had to go and read what the book was about again. Then I realized more that it's about the \"thin slicing\" the right information in those first few seconds. Interesting information but I thought by the end of the book I would have learned how better to think without thinking and I don't think I did. I WOULD be interested in doing some of the facial expression recognition training videos he talked about though!",
            "I am still on my Malcolm Gladwell kick. What I enjoy about his books is that he finds the most interesting and quirky research to educate me about. You will learn things from this book that you aren't likely to learn in any other way. that being said, there are whole paragraphs that are redundant and extraneous and you can just skip over. I was fascinated by the research on race and instant recognition. I was also interested by what he learned about the Millennium Challenge and about New Coke. Very interesting stories and the idea of thin slicing is definitely something to consider. This book is worth your time.",
            "For certain decisions, such as determining how likable Tom Hanks is and determining a person's personality by looking in their rooms, our intuition is quite accurate. For other decisions, such as predicting the success of a musician and falling for the good looks of a presidential candidate, our intuition often fails us. Also, our preferences and why we do what we do often can not be articulated well and/or are rationalized in ways that don't make any sense. For example, our verbally expressed preferences for a partner often don't jive with the actual partners we choose and our food product preferences are subject to marketing schemes but we are unaware of it.In essence, the book mentions that our decisions are subject to prejudices, past experiences, ignorance, psycho-biology, preferences, expertise, and a whole slew of other variables. In the beginning of the book, Gladwell states the premise that haste doesn't make waste and that sometimes quick decisions are better than decisions that have analyzed every angle. But later in the book, Gladwell mentions how prejudices can cloud our judgment and how stepping back and analyzing the situation allowing time to be our friend is a better approach to making decisions, for example when a cop is faced with a potential criminal. Also, he mentions how the body guards protecting former US president Reagan, didn't have enough time to react to the shooter who attempted to assassinate Reagan. So the efficacy of our decisions are either benefited or hurt by snap decisions and benefited or hurt by longer more deliberated decision; the quality of our decisions depend on the context of the situation.Essence of the essence: Decisions are based on a crapload of stuff.",
            "\"The Notion of intuitive Repulsion\" You have got to educate your unconscious. Become good at pattern recognition. The author states you can develop this ability. The notion of intuitive repulsion is quite an interesting notion. The part about the mores code interception team developing an uncanny skill for pattern recognition was very interesting. Find out what \"thin-slicking\" is. Why people stay married why they get divorced.",
            "I haven't read the rest of Gladwell's library yet, however, if the rest of his books meet the quality of this one, I'll pick them up. I was fascinated by the case studies used to prove his point of snap judgments- it really went a long way to explain how we can 'know' something without any empirical evidence.",
            "If you read the first chapter of this book, you'll get the point he's trying to make. It's an interesting point, but it should be summed up in a 10 page article, not a 200 page book.(I've also read that the results of the studies he cites in his first chapter are exaggerated)",
            "When an insightful friend started to refer to me as \"Blink\", I decided to sit down and explore the reason behind my new nickname. \"Blink\" paints a picture for those of us who speak or act without careful consideration. I liken the word blink to \"gut feeling.\" It's the phrase we use as justification when whatever we have said or done is over. For instance, after I have taken an exhausting exam, I look back at answers I may have changed because I started to reason out why it might be a different answer. But Gladwell confirms that when we think about an unconscious decision we made, the conscious and the unconscious don't match up. Hence the reason why you should always go with your gut on an exam. However, Gladwell also points out that when we act on something driven by an unconscious mind, or if put on immense pressure or stress, if we aren't practiced in that area of expertise, we might find ourselves acting on false pretenses.Not only was I able to relate his findings to my own personal life, but I found his various pieces of research and historical events riveting. As a graduate student, I can better appreciate his theories due to the careful examination of data and real world occurrences. His suggestions regarding discrimination could provide new opportunities for those often burdened by aspects of our social system. If it doesn't provide opportunities, it at least allows readers to understand how we often associate negative thoughts to individuals different or historically discriminated against, without even meaning to! It seems when most of us make quick judgments, we aren't making them based on logical reasoning, but on appearances and superficial ques--Gladwell backs these statements by detailed and astounding examples. I also found his findings on relationships interesting; although, I would only trust the most highly acclaimed to predict one's marital success from listening to a short conversation and then thin slicing based on tone, facial expressions, and words used.Often our gut can get us into trouble, but \"Blink\" offers a case by case description of how being referred to as \"Blink\" may not be such a bad nickname after-all.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell, adored by the masses and mocked by the academy, has set out to explore human cognition and decision making in his book \"Blink,\" despite the fact that he is a historian by training and a journalist by trade. The premise of this book is that we humans have two speeds when it comes to decision making: \"really fast\" and \"regular.\" We are all familiar with regular- pause and think, employ logic, maybe even write stuff down on paper, and eventually come to a rational conclusion. Really fast, or as Gladwell calls it, blinking or 'thin-slicing', happens in much shorter times, ranging from milliseconds to know if a tennis serve will go awry, to mere minutes to know if a marriage will survive the next 20 years. The ability to accurately use the faster method is discussed by Gladwell, who provides several very entertaining and well-written stories detailing the split-second decisions that can be made, such as telling that a piece of art is a fake by just a quick glimpse, rather than expensive and lengthy laboratory tests. There is also a dark side to this method of decision-making, and in several very entertaining and well-written stories, Gladwell shows how white men turn into evil misogynistic racists when making split-second decisions. Take it or leave it, but Gladwell is an extremely talented and engaging storyteller. There is a lot of redundancy within and across chapters, and I estimate the book could be maybe 100 pages lighter.The individual stories lack scientific rigor, and the book lacks an overall conclusion (what is given is just another story). Yes yes, this book is classified as \"popular science,\" but that does not excuse the fact that no attempt is made to construct a cogent and complete argument, including acknowledging competing ideas. The burden of proof is on he who makes the claim- while Gladwell may think he is being \"deeply intellectual\" and forcing the message of his book upon the readers by not having a solid conclusion, thus forcing us to blink for ourselves, instead he left the roof off of the house he just built, and I'm clearly not alone in this opinion. Another thing noticeably lacking is advice on how to do the fast thinking for yourself- Gladwell never explicitly says it, but the key it seems, is to study your field for years and years- and by then, you will have built in your brain the equivalent of muscle memory for thought processes, and you will be able to trust your gut a lot more....go figure.I'm ambivalent about recommending this one. This is possibly the worst place to start if you want to learn in depth the science of human thought and decision making, but it is a wonderful place to start if you know nothing on the topic and would like to get a feel for what it is all about. Either way, if you read \"Blink\" for entertainment value, you won't be too disappointed (though as I said, the stories do drag on a bit).",
            "Very intriguing book. Examines not what we typically call first impressions, but the first moment or so of that first impression. Provides numerous examples of how people's opinions are unconsciously formed in those first few seconds and how we should be aware of, and occasionally control those formations. The only real downside is the book occasionally lacks a cohesiveness. It is a collection of studies and events that the author attempts to pull together, and is somewhat tenuous at times. But, overall, I really enjoyed the read. One of the few books I've been able to sit down and really get into for hours on end. I wouldn't surprised if there are others out there who finished the book in just a few sittings as I did.",
            "Based around the concept of thin-slicing, this book promotes the idea that your initial thoughts / gut feeling are often the right way to proceed (but not always). There are many case studies to hammer in the point and look at it from different perspectives. I feel the concept was a bit oversold, confused, and not pulled together nicely at the end.In terms of the fundamental concept that we can learn to make better and faster decisions when we filter out excess data, I agree. This particularly holds if you are experienced in the field (i.e. with experience comes intuition).As for the \"Compelling\", \"Astonishing\" and \"Brilliant\" words being used to describe this book, I think that maybe \"Thought Provoking with Interesting Stories\" might be a better way to describe it.",
            "Gladwell writes interestingly and clearly about some interesting research. But it doesn't stick together for me; seems more a compilation of essays than a cohesive book. Nor do I believe the main simplistic conclusion people tend to draw from it is justified or helpful.More specifically, Blink doesn't at all justify the general simplification so many seem to be taking that it's ALWAYS (or even nearly always) best to go with immediate intuition/gut feel rather than more deliberate decision-making. Rather, one of the key aspects of judgement and decision-making is knowing when to go with a quick intuitive assessment and when a systematic approach is needed. Blink doesn't help me much with that at all; rather it seems to obscure the issue in my view.Hence I see the first chapters of 'Nudge' as a better popular introduction to decision-making. The first author of Nudge (Thaler) has the depth of experience in decision-making research that Gladwell lacks.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell is an entertaining writer. His book The Tipping Point almost made my Top Ten list last year, not only for the thoroughly enjoyable read (which it was), but also for the intriguing analysis into human behavior and consumerism that Gladwell offers.Blink carries on The Tipping Point's tradition of great illustrations and fascinating data. This is a book about \"the power of thinking without thinking.\" In summary, Gladwell shows us how our snap judgments are often more accurate than our deliberate decisions that we take months to make. Gladwell peppers the book with examples that prove his thesis, providing church leaders with plenty of stories that beg to be used as sermon illustrations.Gladwell also writes about the \"dark side of blink,\" when our snap judgments are wrong. He writes of police mistakes, voter shallowness, and the fact that Coke still outsells Pepsi, even when Pepsi wins hands-down in a taste contest.This book is entertaining, educating, and provocative, and it challenges some of our presuppositions about how the mind works.",
            "First, let me say that this is a good book. It's well worth your time to read. I don't think that it's as good as the Tipping Point though. This one seems to go a little longer than what is necessary maybe. It seems to be like Mr. Gladwell is trying to stretch it out a bit. The good thing about all of it though, is that it is a very quick read, and you won't have a lot of time invested into it. So definitely pick this one up, you won't regret it!",
            "The Book on the Nightstand - July 08The book falling off the nightstand this month isBlink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking. The take-away from this text is why and how we make snap decisions, and to what degree these decisions should be trusted. I walked away with a solid understanding of the why and how, but less so on the trust and accuracy of snap decisions. Statistically you should go with your first \"gut decision\", except when you shouldn't. The text left me feeling vague in that area.The Art of Digital Brandingcontrasts the Margaret Thatcher quote \"I make my mind up about someone within the first ten seconds and I very seldom change it\" with the research of psychologist Alexander Todorov, that \"most people actually make a judgment about someone based on his facial appearance within one-tenth of a second\", (page 27).How is this used in design? A study by the Human-Oriented Technology Lab at Carleton University shows that \"people can make an instinctive decision as to whether a web site is good or bad in 1/20th of a second\", (page 34). An on-line consumer has made a decision to purchase within the first 40 seconds of entering a web site.The design and balance of the first or home page of a site is critical, one of the primary metrics of Google Analytics is the \"bounce rate\". Bounce Rate is the percentage of single-page visits (i.e. visits in which the person left your site from the entrance page). Bounce Rate is a measure of visit quality and a high Bounce Rate generally indicates that site entrance (landing) pages aren't relevant to your visitors. A high bounce rate from the main page reflects that people fled your site after a fraction of a second that your material was unsuitable for them. Like the Prime Minister, they probably won't be back.",
            "Like the reviewer who posted just before me, I also thought the book could have made an excellent article. You can certainly skip around in this book and get the point of it. I forced myself to read the whole book even though I lost interest maybe halfway or 2/3 of the way through because the author seemed to be just supporting his main idea with more and more examples. I thought I should force myself to read the whole book in case I missed some amazing new insights, but there was nothing new in it. I enjoyed the examples though, which is why I give this book 3 stars. All in all it was truly mediocre at best.",
            "For me, this book was a good collection of stories, that hold some useful idea in them. And that is really exciting. But, unfortunately, as it was said above, Gladwell fails to bring the general idea (at least until the few paragraphs at the end of the book) and usually whiffle between those short stories. What's good - he gives you some ideas of what you might want to explore more seriously later.",
            "Sometimes decisions need to be made quickly. All of our knowledge, education, experience, reasoning, intuition, common sense and confidence must come together rapidly.Malcolm Gladwell calls quick decision making thin slicing in his book: Blink. Thin slicing is the ability to focus on a small set of critical variables to make a quick decision rather than consciously considering every possible variable.Many decisions are time dependent. Weighing the amount of information needed before making a decision, against the time available is a challenge.Examples of when thin slicing is needed: combat, avoiding a car accident, or anything requiring an immediate decision. Another common name for thin slicing is thinking on your feet.Gladwell does an excellent job of explaining what happens in these situations. For example:\"...in interviews with police officers who have been involved with shootings, these same details appear again and again: extreme visual clarity, tunnel vision, diminished sound, and the sense that time is slowing down. This is how the human body reacts to extreme stress...\"Besides the excellent examples given in the book, here is a classic example of using thin slicing.Thin slicing was used on multiple occasions during the US space program. Gene Kranz (a flight controller on the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo space programs) writes about the need for quick accurate decisions in his book: Failure is not an Option.Endless intensive simulations were run with the controllers, flight crew and others before every launch. Everyone's skills had to be razor sharp during the actual missions. Decisions had to be accurate and made in real time. There was little, and sometimes no room for error. Lives were at stake. Risk was part of their business.Gene Kranz sums up how he gained his skills to be a top flight director when he said:\"The flight director's ultimate training comes at the console, working real problems, facing the risks, making irrevocable decisions.\"Although we may not be faced with life and death decisions, we will (on occasions) have to make quick decisions. The better our skills and Critical Thinking are, coupled with training and quickness, the more prepared we will be to make sound decisions in the blink of an eye!The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking",
            "\"Blink\" reads more like a review of studies of the consequences of making snap decisions. Guess what? Sometimes you're right and sometimes you're not. How enlightening.Nevertheless, the experiments that are discussed are fascinating, and will give you insight into when to trust your intuition.",
            "\"Blink\" is a book about our cognitive abilities. Malcolm Gadwell considers the ability of the human mind to make split second decisions and judgments, which are usually accurate. He delves into the idea that our instincts are usually correct, even though there are no fundamental reasons why then goes onto convince readers that snap judgement and first impressions can be controlled and educated. He writes about the term \"thin slicing\" to describe the ability to find patterns in events based only on narrow windows of experience.Overall \"Blink\" provides a new sort of perception that first impressions and judgments are actually true. From childhood, we are all taught that first impressions are key. Malcolm Gadwell provides evidence of split second Decisions and judgement ranging from a retired tennis player, to Medical Doctors. Gadwell does however, explain that prejudices can impair our thoughts. Gadwell even describes how the outcome of a relationship (Divorce or Married) in 10 years, can be quantitatively measured.The overall theme is \"Thinking without Thinking,\" which describes that ones mind can subconsciously understand and analyze a situation before one's conscious takes place. The mind can conceive the details through a situation due to the associates made through society. Gadwell jumps between stories as a describes different topics such as priming, selective processing and expertise, but always relates back to the topic of thin slicing. His writing style leaves the reader curious as to why and how something happens, subconsciously urging them to read on till he abruptly explains the relationship.The overall book was a pleasure to read, yet I still remain skeptical about some of the ideas and presented. He present's ideas that have many different outcomes, such as how an artists who should have made it big didn't and how a commander beat his opponents in a war-game exercise. The book hits individuals with facts and then goes on to describe the relationships found within those statements and facts. I remain skeptical about some of the ideas because they simply seem implausible and rather controversial. Since the earliest days of our birth, we are taught never to make judgments or to judge a book by its cover. Blink teaches us something different, describing how it is alright to judge a book by its cover, and how those judgments actually save us a tremendous amount of time.Gadwell relies mainly on anecdotal evidence. Each section tells a story about someone who illustrates his theory of snap judgments. The first story presented was about a Greek statue the J. Paul Getty Museum had agreed to purchase. Just before the transaction was about to take place, two art experts immediately knew it was a fake. They had no idea why, or how they just \"knew.\" Eventually it was found out that the statue was a fake and when a scientist tested a sample of the stuate, Gadwell explains that \"In the first two seconds of looking--in a single glance--they [the critics] were able to understand more about the essence of the statue than the team at the Getty was able to understand after fourteen months.\" As the book progresses, much more of this intuitive knowledge is proven to be true.The main problem in the book is that some of the information is presented in a falsify way. The readers are not given completely background of all the other possibilities. In one example, Gadwell explains how artist by the name of Kenna, is loved by artists, managers, and talent scouts but fails to make it in the big run because radio stations dislike him because he didn't market himself properly to them. Individual people thin sliced Kenna and realized he was good, but radio stations waited some time to make a rational judgment which in turn led them denying him. Gadwell explains that Kenna could either have been promoted, or the radio stations are wrong, but never does he touch on the fact that Kenna might have been a bad artist.I would highly recommend this book to other readers, simply because of the way it makes you think about your judgments. I was able to finish this book within a day because of the intriguing logic Gadwell uses to prove his point. This book made me step back and think \"Wow. Can that be true.\" It truly made me think of the decisions I make on a daily basis, and how some of those decisions are already determined. While I do remain skeptical about some of the idea's presented in the book, the overall book was a pleasure to read; keeping me entertained and curious enough to finish the entire book. I enjoyed the book enough to go and purchase Malcolm Gadwell's other book \"The Tipping Point.\"Overall, read it and enjoy how much it makes you think. One should not however take everything said in the book to be the truth.",
            "When I was a young man there was late-night disc jockey in Chicago by the name of Sid McCoy who played a lot of Frank Sinatra recordings. He often referred to Sinatra as The Master Story Teller, because Frank's respect for the lyrics and his phrasing were so exquisite that he made you really feel the emotions the songwriter was attempting to convey.In my opinion, when it comes to non-fiction books, Malcolm Gladwell is The Master Story Teller. In \"Blink\" he uses his talent for conveying stories, studies, and arguments to help us understand a magical, mysterious thing called judgment. And he asserts that judgment is important because it is what separates winners from losers.Early in the book Gladwell explains that \"Blink\" is concerned with the very smallest components of our everyday lives - the content and origin of those instantaneous impressions and conclusions that spontaneously arise whenever we meet a new person or confront a complex situation or have to make a decision under conditions of stress.He uses a phrase in psychology, thin-slicing, to explain that human beings are often capable of making sense of situations based on the thinnest slice of experience.Gladwell's primary goal for \"Blink\" is to accomplish three tasks: 1] To convince us that decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as those made cautiously and deliberately. 2] Assist us in knowing when we should trust our instincts, and when we should be wary of them. 3] Convince us that our snap judgements and first impressions can be educated and controlled.The book is replete with fascinating stories and studies that help Gladwell accomplish these tasks. One that I found particularly enlightening, and should be read by every medical doctor, is a revelation about why some doctors are sued for malpractice and others aren't. The answer has nothing to do with the medical skill or training of the physician, but everything to do with the doctor/patient relationships.It seems that patients don't sue doctors whom they like. In fact, one patient cited chose to sue her internest, even after being informed that it was the radiologist who was potentially at fault. Why? Because she liked the radiologist, and didn't like the internist. I can relate to this because my wife could have sued a doctor for malpractice but chose not to because she liked him.Related to this is a study described in this book that utilized a mere 40 seconds of recorded conversations of surgeons talking with patients. In these recordings the exact words spoken were filtered out, leaving just the intonation, pitch, and rhythm of the doctors voice but not the content of the conversation. From this judges rated slices of the remaining garble for such qualities as warmth, hostility, dominance, and anxiousness. From that alone it could be determined which surgeons got sued and which ones didn't. Stunning.There is much more I'd like to share about \"Blink\" than space allows. If this review captured your interest, by all means read the book.One last item: Sid McCoy, who also gave the great singer Nancy Wilson the nickname, \"The Baby\" went on to become the executive producer of the hugely successful TV show, \"Soul Train.\"",
            "In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell outlines numerous stories to illustrate how our brain can reach conclusions without our conscious mind realizing how we came to that answer. Demonstrating instances of experts detecting forgeries, psychologists determining whose marriages will last, and how we can learn to read people's faces, Gladwell weaves these stories together to show why our first judgement may be our best, and how detrimental it can be to try figuring out why or how we \"just know\". It was interesting to learn the key to good improvisational comedy, what makes a good car salesman, and how people perceive to what degree they will like a food based on the packaging. If textbooks were this interesting and well written, kids would be chomping at the bit to do their homework!",
            "Unlike The Tipping Point, which gave us terms like Influencer and Mavens, and spawned a tiresome new set of buzzwords and \"influencer\" marketing companies, Blink may not have that handy instantly-applicable nugget that transforms your business or spiffs up your next presentation. And yet, like everything I've read from Gladwell, it is well worth reading. Why? Because it will make you think, and if you apply its lessons, become a better, more thoughtful and aware human being. (And ok, there are a few things that might help you do better in job interviews, for example--see p. 56, for example.)As usual, Gladwell's writing strikes that perfect balance between research and analysis, anecdotes and conclusions. The scholarly backbone of the book is strong, yet the academic studies and statistics are never trotted out for their own sakes, but to contribute to the larger argument of the chapter and the book. These arguments or lessons are often deceptively simple--so simple that we may have overlooked or forgotten them (as in the introduction, about trusting one's hunches if one is an expert in a given area, or that we subconsciously judge people by their appearance, in chapter three)--but the academic studies used to prove the point are the sort of thing regular folks would never bother looking up. Some of the other lessons, however, are quite unexpected: contempt as the most damaging emotion for spouses to use on one another; doctors' tone of voice with patients being a key determining factor in whether they got sued.All in all, a well-documented, smoothly-written, and tightly-constructed book, whose lessons--from my numerous pages of notes and quotations--I will attempt to apply. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that unlike with the best works of fiction, one thorough reading is probably sufficient.)",
            "Headed to the library's checkout counter, I intuitively grabbed, \"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,\" on display and added the hardcover book to the top of my pile.\" I'm glad that I relied on my gut instead of my intellect. Otherwise, I would have left the book behind, feeling that it would bore me with useless psychobabble. This was far from the case. I delved into the 250-plus pages chockfull of psychological studies and theories; the esoteric synthesis of information was just too good to put down. After all, who gets eight hours of sleep these days anyway?As the title suggests, the book examines the unconscious brain processes, particularly concerning how the brain can make a snap judgment--in the blink of an eye. Through exhaustive research, Malcolm Gladwell illustrates that people, to put it bluntly (but accurately), can be rather stupid some of the time. In essence, many of his case studies prove that, yes, too much knowledge is not necessarily a good thing. He shows that sometimes it is best to surrender the credentials and expertise, and operate under the rule of intuition. On the other hand, he also substantiates, intuition, and things like first impressions, may not steer you on the correct path either. So, go figure. I suppose, as humans, we must accept our imperfections.Overall, however, the author's case studies, though plentiful, fall in an illogical, random order. Obviously, Gladwell did not have a prior chronological skeleton before he filled the page marrow with prose. If the author had utilized an outline, he did not follow it.Nonetheless, the studies, whether portraying the petty, biased mind of a person or the plain no-nothingness of a person, are fascinating. Take, for instance, the notion of \"sensation transference\" which, Gladwell says, was coined by Louis Cheskin, a man born in Ukraine at the turn of the century and a U.S. immigrant child, who later became as Gladwell dubs \"one of the greatest figures in twentieth-century marketing.\" Gladwell cites Cheskin's promotional effort of margarine, which back in the late 1940s, was the unpopular contender on the American table. After Cheskin dyed margarine yellow, wrapped it in foil imprinted with a crown and the name, \"Imperial Margarine,\" consumers ended up raving. Why? Because a pretty package is just that. Who needs to go below the surface? Shallow, but true. Stupidity always is.Gladwell also draws a picture of autism and cites an example of one of the country's leading experts on autism, a teacher at Yale University's Child Life Center, Ami Klin. Klin tested the eye movement of an autistic adult while he watched the 1966 film version of Edward Albee's \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" When the scene involved two of the main characters kissing, the autistic man fixated on a light switch in the scene. Klin sums up the premise as follows: \"....It's like if you were a Matisse connoisseur, and you look at a lot of pictures, and then you'd go, ahhh, there is the Matisse. So he goes, there is the light switch. He's seeking meaning, organization. He doesn't like confusion. All of us gravitate toward things that mean something to us, and for most of us, that's people. But if people don't anchor meaning for you, then you seek something that does.\" Interesting stuff!Despite the book's lack of overall organization, \"Blink: The Power of Thinking without Thinking\" packs a powerful punch from beginning to end without losing a blink of an eye's worth of force.",
            "I was drawn to this book after becoming inspired to investigate more about how the mind works. In fact, I was reading this book at the same time as I was reading similar books on the topic, just to compare ideas.What I Enjoyed:I thoroughly enjoy Gladwell's writing style. He uses stories to illustrate points that kept me engaged. I found the book easily accessible and not packed with technical jargon that I found in more technical books on the subject matter. It was interesting to read his description of \"thin-slices\" and how experts are often able to come to quick, powerful decisions and conclusions based on limited information and clues.The But...:However, I do not think he emphasizes enough the fact that operating off of thin-slices is a very limited way of going about our lives. One of the reasons I was drawn to this book was because I was recently readingThe Power of Thinking Differently: An imaginative guide to creativity, change, and the discovery of new ideas.. In that book, I discovered that I operated most of my life through quick decisions that the author calls \"habitual pattern recognition.\" While this is a useful survival tool when time is at a premium, and is the mechanism that allows experts to make a quick diagnosis, it inherently limits the scope of our perception. As a result, we perceive ourselves as having less choices in life than we really do.I think the Gladwell book is a great read to feel empowered by our ability to make snap judgments, but I think the real power of our brain is its ability to go beyond snap judgments. By doing this we can provide ourselves with the space to explore different possible solutions, different possible perceptions, and different ideas.Summary:With all that said, I still think Blink is a worthwhile read. I would simply caution readers to think of it as a \"thin-slice\" of human cognitive capacities.",
            "This is the kind of deep, intelligent, witty discussion that must go on at dinner parties in New York. Or at least the kinds of parties that I think Dorothy Parker would have been in attendance. It is fascinating reading and I enjoyed every new insight that Gladwell describes.Blink is written in a style best described as, \"I am about to tell you something so amazing and so wonderful, that it will forever change the world!\" And truly there are a million things that need to be changed in this world; however, a thought lingers and troubles me. What, exactly, are we supposed to take from this? Is this the kind of thoughtful work that we enjoy with a glass of wine and congratulate ourselves for being so smart and enlightened or can we use Gladwell's ideas to make the world a better place? Not that there's anything wrong with a little wine and stimulating conversation, but I suspect Gladwell wants his work to taken more seriously than that. I feel the one weak element of the book is in the absence of details on how we can and when we should use our instinct or our intuition to help us make decisions and how can we take action with all this great theory he has given us.Gladwell describes a \"technique\" of \"thin slicing\" which can be understood to mean your \"gut reaction\" or your \"intuition\" about a person, thing, or situation. He provides overwhelming evidence through a multitude of examples to tell us that although we often mistrust our instinct because of things we've been taught, such as \"don't judge a book by it's cover,\" it is these instincts which we should use to make meaningful decisions. At this point in the book, I was sold on the theory and ready to start trusting my intuition to make better decisions when - Whoop! He pulled the proverbial rug out from under my newfound brilliance and his own theory by gaving examples of when thin slicing does not work, such when we vote in handsome, magnanimous, yet unqualified politicians like Warren Harding or when a city's police make a snap judgment about his afro and question him as a criminal suspect.I do not want to be a spoiler, so you know some spoiling is about to begin, but the book deserves, nay, yearns for a unifying theory and here it is: you, insightful one, have sought to stymie your gut feelings for too long, relying instead on your years of academia, and, seeking to over analyze every nugget of minutia before coming to a decision you are often deciding wrong. Rise forth, intelligent one and know that the super computer lying in your subconscious is ready to do great things. Or, \"Use the Force, Luke!\"This coin has two sides and the dark side of the theory is this: you, oh wicked one, you have sought to judge quickly and decisively, but you have failed miserably as you have let prejudice, greed, malice, fear, and inexperience direct your soul and as such you will make grave mistakes and errors and perhaps, be judged quite harshly by society. You may be strong and smart Darth, but when we peel back the layer of evil and remove your robotic head, we see you for the pathetic, sick person your are.Less sarcastically stated: use your instinct when you have the facts and reasoning to back it up; be cautious about your quick judgments when you are in a panic or uneducated about a person or topic.I did like Blink. Did, but I felt a tad let down. Gladwell has taken much research by psychologists and researchers and tried to bring it into a form those who are not professional psychologists can understand and be entertained by. He does not however, give us an action plan or any tools to use his ideas, so, enjoy Blink, dear reader, and devise your own theory about how to apply Gladwell's ideas. Perhaps, that is what Gladwell wants us to do with Blink - think - but then that would not be using your instinct...",
            "Blink is one of those books that just draw you in the first few pages. I never wanted to put the book down! His interpretation of the human psyche is unparalleled. I truly view person to person interaction in a whole new light. First impressions play a larger role than we might think and oftentimes dictate the final result. Mr. Malcolm Gladwell breaks down snap judgments and reveals how powerful a tool they can be in decision making. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially our representatives in government.",
            "We are at a point in time when the interaction period between two people is shortening and information passes between two people at an increasingly rapid rate. The global reach of individuals is now extensive and continues to grow with technology. Due to these advancement in interaction between people, first impressions are imperative.In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell, composes an astounding analysis and study of first impressions. Referred to as \"thin-slicing\", Gladwell cites dozens of examples of situations that, for better or worse, were greatly changed due to thin-slicing and first impressions.This book is a must-read. It flows very smoothly. Gladwell has the ability to extend profound knowledge while keeping a conversational vocabulary. This makes it interesting and educational to everyone, which is quite important because an underlying theme to this book is that thin-slicing is something everybody should consider. Gladwell also keeps the analysis flowing smoothly by using dozens of everyday examples to which everyone can relate.My understanding of the conclusion in Blink is that there are two types of quick decision-making that should be used in two different ways. First, there is instinctive decision making. This is often done subconsciously. Gladwell argues that this should be used in very large, quick-decision matters, such as choosing a mate, deciding on a job, or even life-and-death decisions. These also work best in areas where you have been trained and tested extensively. If you are a policeman and have been shot at many times, when you are shot at again, you are better off trusting your instincts rather than thinking through the situation.On the other hand, if you are not trained and tested to make an important decision (such as shooting back at someone shooting at you), you may be better off trying to think it through correctly. Thinking it through carefully is the second type of first-reaction decision making. Gladwells argument as I understand it is that if the decision is fairly simple and straightforward, then it can be of greater reward to think it through. A decision such as what attire to wear to a job interview is probably best done after a bit of thought or even testing (what does your roommate think of your outfit).While these two conclusions are important to understand, I do not give them the justice they deserve. His book is written to explain every part of these decisions. Most importantly, he dives into facial expression first impressions and social recognition, which is extremely interesting. He even explains how most of us hold a racial bias, whether we think we are racist or not. He studies the subconscious from a very broad, simple, research-proven stance.This book will improve your life. Although it may only be for breif periods of realized decision-making, it is worth understanding when those decisions are life-changing.",
            "This book started with a bang and got me hooked. It is a very interesting premise and the accounts that Gladwell started with were relevant and powerful in illustrating his thesis. Halfway through the book, the different stories Gladwell included become less and less pertinent to his central thesis. The point becomes really diffuse in the second half of the book and he almost lost my interest. One of the stars in my rating is from the fact that it is a decent effort and an interesting premise, but could be executed better to maintain readers' interest.",
            "Amazed at how highly (star) rated this book is, I felt I had to bring it down a notch......The book has been well appraised by most of the negative reviewers already so I'll just reiterate:1) Utterly confused, tenuous and contradictory hypothesis.2) Reminds me of English Lit. essays I'd write at high school, where I had no real point, but had to fill 1000 words.2) Tipping Point was a great book. What a shame this wasn't.",
            "An absolute waste of money. Not a single mention of how to develop and hone the skills he is touting.",
            "I usually don't write reviews, but after buying this book a year back and being very disapointed I came upon it agtain today as a result in another search. I took it as a sign that a review was needed.I buy books like this to learn How to Do Something; to improve a talent, not to tell me that a something I know to exist, really exists.I, and most adults, already know that sometimes snap judgements, gut instincts or feelings, are more accurate than some exhaustive study... and sometimes they are not.I suspect that most people bought this book to learn how to improve/hone that instinctive/gut talent so that more often than not \"our gut feeling ids right\".This book provides nothing in that area, it seems to be content to demonstrate what we already knew/Of roughly 1300 reviews roughly 500 are 3 or less and 800 are 4 or better.I suggest you save your time and money.Good luck",
            "No wonder this is a best seller. The author explains in an easy to follow way, the power of snap decisions and how they work. It shows how powerful and accurate instantaneous decisions can be, that we often are at odds to explain how we arrived at. Gladwell explains how these decisions are arrived at by the meticulous gathering of information by our unconscious.However they are not always accurate and this is largely due to bias, such as stereotyping and prejudices. No doubt hormones play a role in that bias too, such as when people 'fall' in love and go on to marry that person. Gladwell here sites a number of studies by psychologist John Gottman, who discovered after studying thousands of interviews with married couples that he was able to tell with 95% accuracy whether a couple would remain together after 15 years from just observing an interview with a couple for 15 minutes.An interesting book that makes one think about the powerful working of the unconscious and how to use it in beneficial ways.",
            "A wonderful journey though a great idea. Helps you understand what people base opinion, expert ideas, and knowledge on. great for understanding consumer mindsets and applying to general marketing ideas.",
            "This book was so captivating that I don't even feel like I even blinked once while reading it! I'm still digesting all the thought-altering information, but my \"thin slicing\" of the book would be that our amazing, innate, and instantaneous gift of \"knowing\" rewards us with lightning speed insights, whose explanations can leave us at a loss for words. This book does an excellent job at explaining not only the process behind this split-second thinking, but also how we can train ourselves to maximize the usefulness and minimize the dangers of our uncanny cerebral powers. I think my thinking will never be the same!",
            "Malcolm Gladwell, the introduction is great and it sets a huge expectation on snap judgement - an unknown territory atleast to me! Initial chapters talks about how thin slicing works and why it always yield results. But in the later chapters, Gladwell starts talking about how the snap judgment could be wrong and I felt the both the stories are not well connected and conclusion left me confused.",
            "The intention of this book was never to teach the reader a new way of thinking or to revolutionize the way decisions are made, but rather to teach us about something most of us do everyday without realizing it.The analysis he offers through the perspectives of research experts, recent current events, and even our perceptions on our most popular beverages/food is eye opening! There are simple decisions being made by our mind far in advance of the rest of our consciousness, yet it shapes how we think food tastes, whether we will like a person or not, or even our thoughts on racism.I reccomend this book to anyone willing to read a simplified analysis of a very complicated decision making machine (the mind). Even with no prior interest in psychology or social sciences I was intrigued the entire way through, and have been made an instant fan of Malcolm Gladwell!",
            "I will keep my review brief as others have covered my critiques fairly well. Malcolm Gladwell presents a series of interesting topics, but there isn't a strong theme tying them together. Inconsistencies of interpretation between the stories is one of the most frustrating aspects of this book. Gladwell will make a claim to support his conclusions on one topic, but assume its contradiction in support of his claim in another topic.The most frustrating aspect of this book is its lack of a thesis, though. Gladwell sets out a thesis consisting of three points in his introduction, but you would never come up with those theses simply by reading the book; I was left unconvinced he tried to make a case for them even though I actively looked for supporting evidence while reading.",
            "I read this book because I heard it was such a good book but I was very disappointed. I have to accept this book is a compilation of good articles and everyday examples but a lot of what he explains is common sense.Blink is about trusting the instant impressions you get in the blink of an eye, but this is not necessarily true all the times. For example, how many of us have dislike someone we meet but after a while we become excellent friends?I think he is right in some things but his theory warns you against ovethinking, and that not always works.Like I said some of Gladwell's points are ambiguous. I also think this book lacks a satisfying conclusion.But I recommend it anyway, just so you get your own opinion about it. But if you can, just get it from the library, don't buy it please.",
            "Blink! what seemed like a fascinating subject pulled me in and then after 100 pages I put it down. Just like that, in a flash of a moment or a blink, I decided I can't finish this book. Might have made a fascinating magazine article in New Yorker magazine but like that magazine this book just started boring me. Blink.",
            "This book was extremely well written and the overall premise was quite interesting.However, the author gets mired down in his own thoughts at times, lacks a cohesive centralized point, and the end result is a bunch of scattered writings that are well-written but unnecessarily verbose and leave you wondering whether you should continue reading.I forced myself to continue reading this book simply because I enjoyed the author's writing style. Plus, I thought his individual articles about the possiblities of the mind making rational/irrational decisions was quite fascinating. In essence, the subject matter was great, but the book really lacked in conveying a centralized meaning. It did whet my appetite to learn more about this subject, so I suppose that is a good thing.I give this book 2 stars simply because Gladwell is an excellent writer and his theory, in general, is great. My recommendation is to skim through the book's chapters and not invest a great deal of time reading (unless you enjoy feeling like you are trapped in a verbose nightmare.)",

            "This book reinforces what I knew intuitively already; some decisions are best made based on hunches. I enjoyed it a lot.",
            "Blink follows in the footsteps of The Tipping Point. Once again, Malcolm Gladwell gathers up a collection of fascinating tales, linking them together to help illustrate an idea. In Blink, that idea is that our subconscious, in only a few seconds, can make extremely accurate decisions. It's not intuition - Malcolm deliberately does not use the word intuition and explains this at the end of the book. Intuition is about gut, emotional reactions. Instead, Malcolm explains that the blink factor is when our extremely well trained subconscious zips through a decision for us.He gives many examples of how this works. Trained experts looking at a statue can tell immediately it's a forgery. Food experts can nibble an Oreo and tell which factory it was made in. Marriage experts can listen to a couple talk for only a few minutes and predict - with extremely high accuracy - if the pair will survive long term. It's not an emotional response. It's a lightning-fact summary of the training that the individuals have undergone.What then follows is to look at situations which don't involve specific training - i.e. human relationships. Every human, from the time they are born, are immersed in a 24-hour-a-day learning lab of how to get along with others. They learn facial movements, tone of voice, and much more to figure out how to relate to others. Malcolm specifically mentions autism and how individuals with this syndrome lack that skill - and how it affects their daily functioning. So each of us is educated from birth on how to act and react to others - and that becomes a subconscious talent.But is it a good thing? Because we learn and encapsulate all of this without any real conscious thought, we also bring into our brain all the prejudices and slants that are around us. Early in the 1900s, many people were POSITIVE that women could not play instruments as well as men could. Most orchestras were primarily male (with perhaps a female harpist). Even when women auditioned, they were judged to be not as good. Then, for a fluke reason, a set of candidates were auditioned behind a screen, and a female won. Simply by bringing in screens to shield the player's identity during the testing period, many orchestras are now 50% female. No quotas to fill, no arguing with maestros over \"be more fair\". They set up the testing so only the music could be evaluated - and suddenly it was.This was a very encouraging message for me. It has to be taken along with the many other depressing messages here. Studies where they sent men and women, black and white, into car dealerships - with the individuals dressed almost identically and presenting the exact same educational background and home street - had the car salesmen treating the white men MUCH better than the black men in terms of price quoted. Even when the sales reps felt they were being fair. It was innate in the rep's \"sizing up\" of the person before them, how gullible they were. Other studies with words and photos show that even people who feel they are extremely fair in racial situations still have a built in bias. The studies are in the book, so you can take the tests yourself and see how you do.Still, the first step in overcoming an issue is to know it is out there. If your subconscious is having you make a snap decision about someone you meet, it's good to be aware that is going on and to take steps to fix it. I really wish the book had gone more into that phase. It's fine to list example after example of snap judgements and how they can be bad and good. But if you lay them out and say \"these exist and it's important to understand and guide them\" - the logical next step would be to talk about HOW to do those things. The book leaves you hanging.Maybe Malcolm has plans for a third book, and figures everyone who read book 2 would then be required to get book 3 ...",

Many studies referenced in the book lack some important pieces to be convincing (e.g. showing that experiments constructed based on the negative theory yield consistently different results), while others prove much less than what Malcolm claims they prove.",

Of particular relevance to those in law and policing are the sections implying how deeply imbedded prejudice is.

            "Malcolm Gladwell's BLINK: THE POWER OF THINKING WITHOUT THINKING offers a smorgasbourd of short essays in this extremely short book. The main premise of the book emphasizes on the power of intuition and snap judgments when making decisions, and especially first impressions which may not always achieve successful results depending on a particular situation and experience one has had in the past. In two examples, Gladwell uses Warren G. Harding, and the extremely unfortunate case of Amadou Diallo in determining that one cannot be judged by his appearance --race or good looks. In the end, these two examples led to uncalculated failure as a result of inexperience.Gladwell does not present ground breaking new hypotheses, but rather allows readers to think, \"what if...\" He reevaluates the evidence that each case study has previously concluded with, and shows in a reader friendly analysis that any person, regardless of their educational or social background, will either understand or gain new insight on a particular subject, such as assessing validity and authenticity of an ancient artifact, or picking the next \"big thing\" in the music business. If at all, BLINK may cause readers to reevaluate their own way of thinking.Overall, BLINK will enlighten any reader that attempts to read it. It's an exceptional book that only takes a couple of hours to complete. Most likely, the book will allow those who read it to engage in further discussion or to probe each issue with a critical eye.",

Where Tipping point focused on the group dynamics of how things change, this book looks more at the personal realm. How people make \"unconscious\" decisions and judgments - very interesting stuff.Gladwell clearly has a wonderful intuition about how people operate, either in a group or individually. This book doesn't seem as much his passion as TP did, but it's still interesting.This would be a great airplane read.",
            "At the time of a blink, I know this book has a very misleading title but it fits today's Americans' need. It suggests that you don't need to think but you can make right decisions.

The result will be disasterous. Blink should not be a substitute of years of experiences and hard work.",
            "Jameson Luke Thottam: Discussion of BlinkMalcolm Gladwell had a runaway success with The Tipping Point a few years back - telling the story of how small changes in perception, marketing and even speech could make a significant impact upon outcomes. Kind of like a series of small causes cascading into a big effect. I really enjoyed his first book, so when Blink! was released and I was given it for free as part of a leadership training course I eagerly blazed through it the very next day on the way home. Big disappointment, rather like going to watch the Orchestra and all the musicians do is warm up and never play anything.Premise of Book...Jameson L. ThottamThe premise of the book is that we observe the world, or rather the events and people/things it contains, using a concept called thin-slicing. Meaning the process of snap, or gut-feel, decisions based upon very thin slices of data which we piece together into a whole by heuristically filling in the gaps. What you get out of this book is a better understanding of why your brain (and gut) process data in this manner when you are data or information deprived.Entertainment Value...Jameson ThottamThe book itself is mildly entertaining, and focuses around a dozen anecdotes - several of which are repeated ad nauseam throughout the book as self-proving facts. There is very little hard evidence or scientific fact to support Gladwell's conclusions - to the point where I felt some simple research could come up with a dozen counter-stories about bad decisions made due to \"thin-slicing\". However, that said, you cannot disprove or write-off his conclusions either - so keeping an open mind about the whole issue (or waiting for fatter slices of research?) is probably the best mindset to have after finishing the book.Most Interesting: Jameson L. ThottamThe most interesting snippet for me, not even a story, revolves around how in 1977 Dick Morris met the 31 year-old governor of Arkansas - a young fella named Bill Clinton. Morris explained how you could use peoples instantaneous gut reactions towards media to manipulate polls and change positions. And we all know where that got us.Final Summary: Jameson Luke ThottamThe interesting philosophical question is how often we unwittingly allow our gut reactions, thin-sliced or not, to influence how we react to people and events. Primal caveman had to decide pretty quickly whether it was fight or flight. In my job I can tell within 30 seconds whether one of our product demonstrations is going to hit the mark. At home I size up my teenage daughters boyfriend in less than 15 seconds. As a soccer coach I can watch a player from 80 yards and predict whether he/she will make or miss a penalty kick just by how they approach the ball.Blink will make you more conscious of when you are doing this, but not necessarily why.Jameson Thottam",
            "In \"Blink,\" author Malcolm Gladwell explores \"post-modern\" decision-making. In modernism, we decided based upon logic: the analysis of factual data, as much of it as we could gather. In post-modernism, we decide based upon the synthesis of sensed experience, as small a slice as we can focus upon.Fortunately, Gladwell does not lean exclusively toward an either/or approach. That is, he recognizes the necessity of facts, while emphasizing the way the brain works to process information.What Gladwell writes in pithy narrative, psychologists have discussed for decades in what is known as HIPT: Human Information Processing Theory. Their model overlaps with Gladwell's main focus: to make wise decision we need the ability to think holistically-to envision seemingly disconnected puzzle pieces as a beautiful mosaic.I've applied his thinking to areas as diverse as a fantasy baseball auction draft, to a counseling session. In fantasy baseball, I've always been the most informed participant in our group of 14 grown-men who spend a day in April acting like boys. However, Gladwell helped me to detect my \"information overload.\" I had all the facts, ALL the facts, but not enough of the feel. Not enough of the intuitive sense that gathered the data, related it to our group, and adjusted quickly to changing scenarios.As a professional counselor and counselor educator, I've always practiced and taught that we must add relational competence to our theoretical understanding. We must skillfully intuit what is happening in me, in my counselee, and in our relationship. In essence, this is counseling by \"blink.\"For those who desire more (and in some cases more accurate) information on how the brain functions and how we can discipline our minds and emotions so that we relate well and think with discernment, I would recommend Daniel Goleman's now classic work, \"Emotional Intelligence.\" Use it hand-in-hand with \"Blink\" and you just might win your fantasy baseball league!Reviewer: Dr. Bob Kellemen, author of \"Soul Physicians: A Theology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction\" and \"Spiritual Friends: A Methodology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction.\"",
            "There are some interesting narratives in the book- strung together with useless chatter and fill. (Too much about Kenna and Coke, for example.)

            "This book was a great read into understanding human perceptions and judgements. The key points for me were:*The mind uses 2 strategies to make sense of a situation: 1. conscious strategy, thinking about what we learn, it's the logical strategy. 2. Knowing something without knowing, before it hits our consciousness.*We have an adaptive unconscious, an efficient action initiator, causing humans to take action immediately.*Quick decisions are as good as cautious decisions - our unconscious mind is powerful.*Snap judgements and first impressions can be educated and controlled.*We can learn to make better snap judgements.*We have a rapid cognition ability called \"thin-slicing\" - where the unconscious mind engages in automatic tasks.*Wen we see 2 people perhaps having an argument, we can recognize a pattern that arises: A distinctive signature rises naturally and automatically.*People are in 2 states in a relationship: 1. Positive sentiment over-ride: positive emotions over-ride irritability. 2. Negative sentiment over-ride: neural things are perceived negative.*Defensiveness, stone-walling, criticism and contempt, are signs of marriage or relationship fail.*Thin-slicing is better than deliberate and exhausting thinking.*You can learn as much or more from one glance at a bedroom than hours of exposure to public face.*If you talk to a doctor who is not listening, talking you down - try to listen to that feeling.*Snap judgements are quick and unconscious. We need to accept snap judgements.*The priming technique: Example; If you prime \"cooperation\" into people, people will cooperate. However, prime \"old\", and people will feel old.*How we think and act, and how well we think and act, is susceptible to outside influence.*We are often too quick to come up with explanations for things we don't have an explanation for.*We can know more about someone or something in the blink of an eye than months of study.*If you're selling something - never judge people on appearance. Treat everyone equal.*People make sophisticated decisions without a script or plot.*Successful decision making relies on balance between deliberate and instinctively thinking.*Fragility matters: snap judgements and rapid cognition.*We can learn alot about how people think just by observing: body language, facial expressions, even looking at their book shelves.*The face is a rich source of information about emotions.*The information on our faces demonstrates what is going in inside our heads.*Our facial expressions have an effect on our nervous system.And closing up to finish the book... the lessons of blink are:First lesson: Recognize the characteristic signs of judgement's fragility.Second lesson: Understand instinctive decision making.Third lesson: Said to be the most important lesson; Knowing less about things/people. The key to good decision is not knowledge, it's understanding.A question is asked on when should one use the \"blink\", thing-slicing methods and what not. The author says there are no answers, we all have different situations and circumstances. However we need to combine rational analysis (conscious thinking) with instinctive judgement (unconscious thinking).",
            "Thin slicing works, except when it doesn't.The premise is interesting, but Gladwell fails to actually draw any meaningful conclusion from his anecdotes. In fact, you could draw completely opposite conclusions from the same \"data\". This is popular science writing at its worst. Just plain dumb.",
            "Blink is a well written thesis on the merits and pitfalls of both snap judgments and lengthy decision making process.As always Malcom Gladwell not only presents advanced social cognition concepts in easy to understand plain-speak, the author also provides interesting examples to augment their argument.Of particular interest in Gladwell's description of Prof. Ekman, the academic that the popular TV series Lie to Me is based upon. Also illuminating but mildly frightening is the section on police pursuits and the effect of high adrenaline situations on police judgment.Gladwell shows a remarkable ability not only to translate complicated concepts into fascinating easy-to-read prose. He also has a strange ability to address and calm controversy, a skill that seems absent from many non-fiction writiers.While Gladwell does ramble occasionally, its still a worthwhile read particularly for anyone interested in psychology.",
            "Blink was my first experience with popular author Malcolm Gladwell. As I initially began reading this book, I felt for sure that I was going to love it. In the Introduction, Gladwell explains how various experts turned out to be wrong after spending months of research attempting to verify the authenticity of a marble statue, whereas several other experts called out the statue as fake after a mere cursory glance. Therefore, in Blink, Gladwell focuses on the many rapid, often unconscious--but usually correct--decisions, that we make, almost always without knowing exactly why we are doing so.Thus, this book seemed like a perfect fit for me. As a psychologist, I've always called my own use of rapid cognition \"intuition,\" but the term Gladwell uses is \"thin-slicing,\" referring to the way in which we utilize just a small piece of the available information. To make his points, Gladwell presents many different fascinating examples and anecdotes, from psychologist John Gottman's studies of marital relationships to our inherent appearance/racial biases to the tragic police shooting of Amadou Diallo in 1999. Although I enjoyed reading all of these illustrations, I generally felt that Gladwell drew them out too long--i.e., he seemed to overplay his hand, to the extent that I often wanted to say \"enough already; get to the point!\"Overall, however, I found Blink to be a worthwhile read. I particularly liked the Afterward, where Gladwell suggested some ideas for determining when we should rely on our instincts and when we should take time for more substantial analysis; I actually wished this section had been lengthier. I would not hesitate to recommend this book, and I certainly may go on to read more of Gladwell's work.",
            "I've never been quite as disappointed with such a page-turner. I give this book 4 stars on pacing, style, and level of interest, but 1.5 stars on synthesis. The author has a remarkable ability to captivate the reader with a series of stories that are at times quite technical, but he fails on his promise in the introduction to show us when to trust our first impressions, and when they lead us astray. What was it about the kouros-statue experts that made their first impressions right, but made the NYPD officers who shot an innocent man 41 times wrong? The author never really tells us. In the end, the author seems to imply that our intuitions are to be trusted when they produce good results--a wholly unsatisfying conclusion that gives us no guidance going forward.",
            "I purchased the book because of all the hype and was not very impressed. I suppose if you desire to overanalyze life you may enjoy it. I came away from the book with very little and was quite disappointed.",
            "After my first \"blink\", I should have gone with my first instinct....and put this book down.",
            "I bought this book after seeing an interesting piece on CBS Sunday Morning. It is highly accessable read that delves into the nature of \"first impressions\" and \"gut instincts\". It leaves you with much to think about.",
            "What Gladwell is describing in his book \"blink\" has been concisely described in the Marvel comic book series \"Spider-Man.\" It is called the \"spidey sense,\" as in: My Spidey Sense is tingling.It's a fun read, nonetheless.",
            "When I first saw this book on the shelf, it caught my attention. Blink!... So I check it out, \"thinking, without thinking.\" Making split second decisions with great results, etc... I look at the back, and I see this guy with a big poofy head of hair and a lame suit, that has wrote a book about making great decisions in a split second. My first thought, and I should have listened to it was... DON'T BUY THIS BOOK, waste of time. But, I the thought, ah, what the hek, it can't be that bad, and I may find something useful in it. Anyway, I'm about half-way through the book and today, as I was exercising on a lifestride and reading through his generalization based theories, without any supporting evidence, I seriously contemplated throwing the book down on the ground and letting my sweat saturate it and let it rot, but, I remembered something, someone told me once, you have to take the good with the bad, and seemings how I'm half way through, I might as well finish, and take it as a learning experience. One thing I have learned from this is, yes, I was a sucker, yes they are born everyday, and yes, anyone can write a freakin book and people will buy it. I can't believe this piece of garbage was published. And by the way... This is my first on-line review, that I have ever written, about a book, a movie, or anything. The fact that I am posting here is a testament to how much this book pissed me off with it's ignorance. This may sound somewhat harsh, but it really annoys me when I spend good money on something and it turns out to be trash - as I'm sure most folks feel the same.I seriously contemplated writing another book, just to contradict his empty theories and make him look like an idiot, but I'm sure after you read this, that will not be necessary for anyone with half a brain cell. I guess in the end though, he made some bucks off it, so he probably could care less.GOOD LUCK!PS.. I just read over more reviews of this book, to see what other folks thought (main reason I came here) and Gil Rosenburg's review was one I wish I read prior to reading this book. If you want to read a good book, look elsewhere. I just finished The Rule of Four and it was very good - albeit a different genre.",
            "This book is magnificent; don't buy it through Amazon though since I never received it but was charged for it.",
            "Still reading the book but find it very interesting and informative. Explains many thoughts, behavors that I've had in the past.",
            "I bought this book just because of all the noise surrounding it as being one of the best sellers, etc. Well, all what this book is saying is that you should trust your subconscious because your first impression or decision is basically your best . Although this whole idea is arguable, yet it is very old and everybody knows about it, so buy the book???",
            "I read it and I enjoyed it :)I think anyone who picks up this book shall enjoy it!",
            "This book has excellent insights and I have my graduate students read this book as part of their assignment.",
            "I was fortunate to get an advanced copy. Wow... you'll find yourself staying up late to finish this one - and when you reach the last page - you simply don't want it to end. Take your time and enjoy.Great work by Gladwell - I can't wait for his next one.",
            "Real life examples (that in this book are long, repetitve and often not conclusive) should usually back up a certain theory (snap judgment, in this case) not totaly replace it, as the author did.",
            "I am one of those that absolutely loved \"The Tipping Point\". However, \"Blink\" seems more to be a series of anecdotes in search of theme instead of, as in Tipping, a new insight into how things work, supported by a series of examples. The cover \"looks like Blink\" but the text is a far different creature. Wish I would have spent the time rereading Blink....",
            "Way to long for the content delivered. Essentially one big idea; experience, and I guess a little personality typing, makes for solid \"gut\" decision making. So much for the old saying \"don't judge a book by its cover\". If these ideas are implemented in the business world (I am an executive in the computer software industry) I guess it could lead to some real decision making efficiencies. On the other hand I can see the \"shoot from the hip types\" using Blink to justify their ongoing lack of elbow grease! By the way, the Tipping Point by the same author is a 5 star read....can't win them all.",
            "You may agree or disagree with the author, but it is a fun to read book, his examples are varied, and coming from many different backgrounds.",
            "Mr. Gladwell provides a very entertaining overview of gut feel decision making, and the efficacy of first impressions. His analysis of a N.Y.C. shooting tragedy is fairly gripping and is a clear cautionary tale for those whose occupations require split second decisions, and of course particularly those of the life and death nature.Mr. Gladwell also explains the work of scientists who have studied the myriad of human facial expressions. I found this to be the most interesting segment of the book. If you know anyone who is a superb communicator, touched on also in The Tipping Point, this work takes thinking about that talent to another level. The amount of painstaking work required of those scientists who assembled the catalog/study of human facial expressions must have been daunting.Those who dislike the book need to take it a bit less seriously. While Gladwell treats very serious subjects, in the end, 'Blink' is really just good fun.",
            "I read this book several months ago and thoroughly enjoyed it -- both at the time and on numerous occasions since, when for one reason or another, parts of it came back to mind.The poor reviews baffle me; I can only guess that a number of readers expected it to be a how-to or self-improvement book, with clearly articulated steps about how to get from Point A to Point B. What it is, instead, is the exposition of a theory, complete with a wide variety of supporting evidence.I suppose some of the evidence could seem tangential if you were looking for a quick read that solved all your problems (or at least made you *think* all your problems would be solved), but for someone who is able to see the world in shades of gray, rather than in black and white, Gladwell offers an expansive look at how influential \"gut feelings\" can be -- and why.",
            "It starts out very nicely, it makes you to read more and more in the beginning. However, as I was turning pages after pages, I lost the main point. When I reached the conclusion part, I said to myself... so what was the point of this book? This book had too many examples and yes it's fun to read results of those psychological experiments and real life examples but they were just too much, I coudln't connect the dot at the end.",
            "This is an incredible concept: the idea that your gut instinct is better than your most thoroughly researched decisions. The idea may have specific business applications, but more importantly, the stories that Mr. Gladwell weaves into to prove his theory make the book very entertaining.",
            "the logical extension of the author's contradictory thesis is essentially that prejudice and thoughtlessness are better tools for judgment than deliberation and evidence. what would gladwell make of racial profiling? isn't that blink? and aren't most the examples he gives the results of EXPERTS' informed judgment and NOT blink? the only reason this book got published is Gladwell's connections.",

            "I really love how he writes. I have read all but one of his books and I would suggest his books to everyone who is studding sociology, or economics. He puts things together that are interconnected, but that I didn't realize were so connected. His books really opened my eyes to several things in this world. In other words... GOOD BOOK!",
            "I always get my books from Amazon on time, and usually earlier than expected. I was way excited to get this book because I've already read snippets and really wanted to read the rest. Any way I can learn more about how my mind works, I'll take it.",
            "The book made me smile as many times as it made me shrink my forehead, but I enjoyed it a lot. It is almost as good as Tipping point",
            "I am a huge fan of Gladwell's work. Both Blink and Tipping Point are fantastically entertaining yet highly informative - a combination that, as a writer, I aspire to and one Gladwell has clearly mastered.",

            "Overall, loved it. Gladwell uses real life examples to support the basis of the book, which is essentially about the power of our subconscience. It discusses how we have been conditioned via all the elements in our lives (media, education, etc.) to react quickly - and sometimes with extreme prejudice - in any situation. The book illustrates how our minds can be a wonderfully useful tool, or by contrast, a dangerous liability.",
            "I am a physician and I have had the privilege of being trained by Dr Reilly at the Cook County Hospital (the chest pain evaluation part of the book).I just want to impress upon the point that Dr Reilly did not teach us that too much information is misleading. What he taught us is to assess the quality of the information and then to use only that information which is of good quality.In simple terms, there are some parts of the history, the physical exam, EKG and labs which strongly rule things in or rule things out. It is that kind of information which is useful. Other pieces of information which do not lead you strongly one way or the other are merely distractions.",
            "This is probably the best book (rather I listened to the unabridged audio version) on RC I have come across.I am regularly talking to clients about rapid cognition or rather gut feelings because they are so important and so many people reject their own and live to regret it. Malcolm Gladwell takes a laymans approach to a technical subject and hits bulls eye after bulls eye.If you want to know why you sometimes make brilliant snap decisions and how valuable that ability can be, read this book.",
            "One of the main reasons, I think, that Gladwell is such a popular author in a field like business psychology is that he's a terrific storyteller. This study of the way our minds create first impressions, the way we \"thin-slice\" in just a few seconds, or even fractions of a second, to draw conclusions about people and situations, especially in times of stress, is thoroughly fascinating, largely because of the case studies he describes in making his point. For instance, a thoroughly trained, deeply experienced art historian can look at a painting or statue and know almost instantly whether it's a fake or not -- even if he can't describe *how* he knows. It's this ability that has enabled the species to survive. But it also sometimes gets in the way of rational, preferred behavior. An autistic, for another example, lacks this ability to \"read minds\" from instant, authomatic analysis of facial expressions, a skill learned in infancy, and is dependent on explanations by others. Gladwell also gives us the real history behind the Pepsi Challenge and how the Coca Cola Company managed to fail so badly with New Coke. (It was confusion between the \"sip test\" vs. the \"drink the whole can test.\") And he examines the reasons for the killing of Amadou Diallo by a car full of New York City cops. (Not innate racism so much as complete failure of the cops' training.) And, finally, he describes in considerable detail \"Millenium Challenge,\" the vastly expensive war game conducted in 2002, how and why the Blue Team (representing the U.S.) was savaged by a retired Marine Corps general heading the Red Team -- and how the results were were then refused and perverted by the Bush Pentagon for its own ends in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq. This is the author's second book and he continues to both fascinate and educate.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's \"Blink\" is an enjoyable read - I breezed right through it and found it to be a book that I would look forward to opening up. Gladwell does a masterful job of weaving together 3 or more points at the same time without losing the reader and frequently leaving me amazed at his organizational skills.That being said, does Blink get the job done? Does he prove his thesis about \"The power of thinking without thinking\"? Yes and no. He starts out with a great example of a supposed piece of Greek art that may or may not be a real piece of ancient art. His thesis plays out well there, with his comments on why certain musicians make it and others don't and his comments on police and the need to think quickly are all strong.His arguments about Paul Van Riper and the war game he won, however, were more about the power of de-centralized decision-making versus centralized planning, in my opinion. Nonetheless, it's a good read and well worth your time.",
            "I think this is a must read, especially for those that enjoy psychology and understanding human behavior, human interaction and the reason we do many of the things the way we do. I think it is also a great self improvement tool.This book really makes you think. I loved the different examples that are provided from situations in the lives of people, from various walks of life, ranging from an Army commander to a food taster!The author does a great job of evaluating all sides of the topic and provides frequent reference to earlier instances.Overall, a very nice read, that I hope to keep doing time and again",
            "Blink has changed the way I think about decision-making. From an early age we are discouraged from making \"snap\" decisions, we are not taught to develop our natural instincts. While some snap decisions can be mistakes, if we tune up our \"gut\" feelings, it may be possible to make excellent decisions based on limited information and time constraints. Gladwell calls this \"thin-slicing\" and make no mistake about it - it is a SKILL that must be cultivated.In a nutshell, thin-slicing is defined as \"the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behaviors based on very narrow slices of experience.\" The most fascinating part to me is just that - as a human being, we do have this capability. If you're like me, you do a significant amount of second-guessing, and that is where the trouble starts. We have the instincts inside of us, our brains are powerful tools - more powerful than the most sophisticated computer, they tell us, right? So why do we not trust ourselves?To be honest, the book started out great with some fascinating examples of thin-slicing and adaptive unconscious (the part of the brain that leaps to conclusions and is capable of making very quick decisions based on very little information). Towards the end I felt like it was just the same information over and over again. I got the gist of it all in the first couple of chapters. Many reviewers here indicated that it could have been an article instead of a book, but I understand why it is a book: Books are taken seriously, are reviewed, are cited, and are easy to find after publication.Blink is worth the read, even if you only skim a few parts, if only to get you thinking differently about the way we make decisions.",
            "Gladwell is a writer for the New Yorker so it's not surprising that this entire book could have been summed up in an article. Gladwell basically says we should follow our instinct and concludes at the end that we shouldn't be judgemental at the same time. Wow, what insight! He gives some interesting examples which are what I enjoyed. It's a quick read though so you won't waste too much time even though the book is a little drawn out.",
            "Gladwell's \"Blink\", a fantastic follow up to \"the Tipping Point\", reveals what most of us have known since the dawn of Creation, but ignore none the less. Trust your gut. We can all know, in the blink of an eye, what's \"really going on\" in a situation or circumstance - if we'll take the time to be receptive to what's happening around us. This isn't New Age drivel, this is using your brain. He would have gotten 5 stars out of me, but the one missing component was the \"how to blink for dummies\" manual at the end of the book. Malcolm defines the problem with conviction and shares the solution with wit, but never really puts a finger on exactly how you can put it to work in your life. Then again, that's the beauty of it - it's there for you to find, you just need to use your brain a little more to get it. Great for business and for life, Blink is worth the read.",
            "Gladwell does great in 1st and 2nd gears, however his premise never really gets rolling. He fails to bring the whole idea together of any formula for the idea of thin slicing. He merely says it exists, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. In another place, he says with rare profundity that it tends to work more with monumental decisions and less with incidental decisions, but even then he's rather vague about it.The whole concept is highly fascinating, though all we get from this book are bits and pieces. A book needs a measure of coagulation.One example of fuzzy reasoning in the book was the part about how a man's height makes people treat them differently to a significant degree. Gladwell cites a survey of CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, indicating that 58% of them are six feet or taller, while among the general U.S. population, only 14% are six feet or taller. He concludes that boards of directors are biased toward the tall. One problem here that Gladwell overlooks is that a more likely explanation for the phenomenon is that tall people feel more confident about themselves and assert themselves more, as well as other genetic considerations. But Gladwell's answer to everything is discrimination, which is a short-sighted approach.I did gain valuable insight from the incidents and studies mentioned. It's just that there's a critical chapter missing, namely a conclusive conclusion. So now how do we apply these ideas, Mr. Gladwell? I sincerely hope this is not a cliffhanger for the next book.In a study this promising, I want a discussion that gets past 2nd gear. This reminds me of a classroom lecture where the instructor leaves out significant parts and gives the class an assignment to figure out the answers for themselves. Not having the luxury of raising our hands and having things clarified, it's incumbent upon Mr. Gladwell to give a more specified and in-depth outline for us to follow. I came away feeling very incomplete.",
            "Some interesting observations: but Gladwell could have been clearer about highlighting the fact that what he is talking about is really trained intuition. That is, experts trained by years of study - or even scientifically determined heuristics - can make snap decisions, not just anyone.",
            "Gladwell offers an intriguing look at how the subconscious or intuition of a person works in different situations, as well as how it can be trained and the importance of sometimes taking a step back before acting on a situation. This is a relatively quick read with some intriguing ideas offered in it. If you like this book, you may find it useful to track down some of the writings by people he references as they go into more depth than Gladwell does.",
            "Blink by Malcolm Gladwell is subtitled The Power of Thinking Without Thinking. Because that pretty much summarizes my life, I decided to read it even though it's an \"intellectual\" book and I usually steer away from too much heavy reading. I'm glad I made an exception.Blink had my attention from the beginning. Gladwell has assembled interesting vignettes from normal worldly life and used them to illustrate his point about the value and dangers of making snap judgments. He doesn't advise us to discard all cognitive reasoning or experience as background for coming to a decision, but he points to many past decisions that could have been better if reams of information, scientific facts, and expert opinions had been ignored. Thin slices of experience, as opposed to lengthy studies or long periods of familiarization, often produce more satisfying and productive decisions.Gladwell presents many examples of better decisions through snap judgments. A quick analysis of couples by observers produced a higher accuracy rating in the chances of their marriages making it as opposed to lengthy studies of their compatibility, small talk patterns, and body language. A singer's music CD inadvertently fell into the hands of the co-president of a large record company who loved it and passed it around. The singer's success was almost immediate because he was thin-sliced by top executives who knew and liked good music and knew how to promote it. But then market research firms published opinions by mainstream listeners from around the country who found him lacking and unlikely to find a core audience or to gain significant radio air-play. People who had never seen him, and only listened to a couple of his songs, completely stalled his career.Large symphony orchestras, traditionally mostly male, have improved their performance by hiring females who audition from behind screens, masking their sex. Innovative military commanders who rely on experience and seat-of-the-pants decisions have regularly trounced better prepared forces with superior equipment and manpower.Gladwell points out that all is not good with this technique if some fundamental safeguards are not applied. Four police officers in the dark entrance of a Bronx tenement pumped 41 shots into a scared and unarmed Guinea immigrant. When heart rates go up, cognitive reasoning goes down, according to Gladwell. Only seven seconds passed from the time the officers first saw the victim, called out to him, thought they saw a gun, pulled their guns and fired 41 shots into him. Quick decisions were made with fatal results. Mind-reading abilities were probably impaired by elevated heart rates causing a series of misjudgments to be made.I highly recommend this book for a look into the world of decisions. We have to make them every day and we have to live with those made by others. Gladwell presents a well-researched study that is fascinating.",
            "This book is excellent on the discovery of how the subconcious works, and can work for you. It is an interesting exploration. It also compares \"intuition\" with more obvious forms of over-analyzation, which our culture is taken over by. A real heads-up to what is going on around you.",
            "A fascinating book, but as others have pointed out too many of the ideas here rely on anecdotal information. I got the feeling after a while that the author cherry-picked the stories he wanted to tell in order to bolster his thesis, and that another researcher could just as easily have formed a different thesis about decision making by selecting different stories.Another thing about this book that struck me, as odd, was the author's obsession with a person's appearance, particularly whether the person was short or tall. Some of the descriptions are as follows.P22, 'he is short and very charming'P49, `he is a small and irrepressible man'P61, `a tall, striking woman'P73, `his bigness of frame'P87, `who is both on the short side - five foot nine - and black'P99, `is tall and lean with a gleaming bald dome'P132, `is a tall man with a runner's slender build'P148, `is very tall and strikingly handsome'P190, `He was short and unassuming'P197, `He was short and thick'P202, `although he is of medium build, he seems much larger'P251, `is tiny'Seldom does the person's size matter to the thesis about decision making that the author presents. Even in the last example where a woman musician is described as `tiny', Gladwell admits that her size ought not to determine whether she is hired to play the French horn. Yet throughout the book he includes a person size as though it has some importance to his argument. This just struck me as perverse, and I wondered at his 'decision' for including this mostly useless information.",
            "Like someone allready said, it's a bunch of stories with no conclusion to it (and yes there even is a conclusion chapter.. but guess what.. it's another story)",
            "This review will be brief, but decisive. Like the \"blink\" - the book's namesake.blink - refers to the first few seconds (really two seconds) or less - moments really - in which split-second decisions are made. Often life and death decisions. Often decisions which are - by their nature - most often based on preconceptions, prejudice, prejudgment, or ingrained - evolved - subconscious beliefs, stereotypes, and conditioning.The book, through several cases or examples, explores split-second decision making. Decision making when you are pressed. Decision making under great uncertainty - where all the facts are not known and you don't have time to get to know them. Decision making when you don't have time to reason - or to consciously really thinks out.It is about how time constraints impact decisions. How they impact the quality of the decisions.Where all you really have is your \"intuition\". Which is often right, but is also often wrong.Through a case study-type analysis, Malcolm Gladwell, a brilliant thinker and writer - an original and ground breaking thinker - explores the issues related to these split-second or less than split-second decisions.If are interested in learning about the brain, decisions, and human psychology and sociology, then I highly recommend this book. If you are not interested in any of the foregoing, but want to see a brilliant thinker and writer in action (Malcolm Gladwell), then I urge you to buy and read \"blink\".",
            "Here the author of the groundbreaking, \"The Tipping Point,\" has again \"tapped into\" an underlying human ability of the mind to do amazing things, that upon first impressions appears all but impossible -- or at the very least, highly improbable. This book is filled with anecdotes (from the arts, psychology, statistics, business, and everyday life) of \"analyses at a glimpse\" (that the author refers to as \"thin slicing\"), which turn out to be almost as good as detailed, longer-term, more in depth analyses.This human ability to perform instantaneous \"background mental processing\" is presented here as if it is not just special, but also uncanny and even mysterious, and indeed it is. More appropriately, it is human pattern recognition analysis, an acutely human ability which has evolved in man over eons and in parallel with his ability to reason and to become conscious of his own actions, and thus to be able \"to preview\" things in his conscious environment before they happen. As a result of \"being conscious\", the human brain has had to learn to process prodigious amounts of information at the subconscious level in the background.One of the most obvious of these abilities (of these formidable background calculations) is the ability of humans to recognize each other by facial characteristics, which although we humans take it for granted, as a formal scientific process, is exceedingly difficult. Scientists have discovered, for instance, that babies as young as only a few days old can distinguish between their parents and others. So, clearly, this ability must have tremendous survival value.But also, if one remembers some of Picasso's \"minimalist sketches,\" of Shakespeare, (and there are equally famous computer-generated ones of Einstein and Abe Lincoln, and Marilyn Monroe, in addition to the famous bard) traced out of no more than five or six disconnected lines, the image of these famous icons emerge with unexpected but unmistakable clarity. Picasso, obviously is using the brain of a highly sensitive master artist; in the latter case, the computers are using \"computer generated algorithms,\" which by all calculations, is a crude approximation to what Picasso does. Those who have studied pattern recognition analysis and are already familiar with these minimalist iconic images know that they are the result of sophisticated data compression techniques (mostly complexly manipulated Fourier Transforms coupled with other information reduction algorithms). They also know how difficult it is to create algorithms to reproduce these precise images as a formal scientific process.In my own work many years ago at the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), among other problems, I used similar data compression techniques to distinguish between the seismic signatures of earthquakes and nuclear explosions. The objective of course was to develop an algorithm (or a set of algorithms) that preserved the maximum amount of discriminatory information that could be used to separate the signatures of the two phenomena with a high degree of reliability, and of course using the minimum amount of information. In most cases, algorithms that even approach the skill of humans at recognizing such patterns, to the extent they exist at all, are very, very complex indeed.Thus, as was the case with \"The Tipping Point\" (in which non-linear processes having points of discontinuities readily explained by Rene Thom's Calculus of Catastrophe Theory), again it seems that the mystery here, can also be explained thorough the formal scientific process of \"Pattern Recognition Analysis.\"But this revelation of the mystery makes this book no less interesting or less important. Again, Gladwell is on to something. Five Stars",
            "I read this book aloud to my friend while he did the driving on one of our road trips. It not only was a great read; the words were absolutely glorious when read aloud. Mr. Gladwell has cleverly combined a necessarily impressionistic study with some hard \"research\" of a sort.I frequently evaluate books by their transformative power. After reading Blink, I'll never think the same way about ciminal due process or belittle my own (if unconscious) prejudices.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell did a great job explaining thin-slicing. His examples were very memorable and easy to connect with for the most part. I couldn't put this book down! I am going into education and find this book really interesting on how we can set up schema's and think so quickly. In this book I found out just how important our unconsciousness is. This book is great if you want to learn about how we have a reason for something but can't really explain it. It is also great if you are one of those people with a gut feeling and have no real reason for it. I would recommend this book to anyone. I want to read the tipping point I hope that it will be just as entertaining as blink!",

I, however, have not only read it, but I have been pushing the ideas in Blink on my Advanced Placement students for several years now. The main principle is directed toward having students believe that they know the answers better than their neighbor on tests. They have to believe that and then prove it to themselves. Many have reported amazing progress in taking tests and knowing that they know answers. I am grateful every day for Malcolm Gladwell. I wish I could get him to come to my high school and listen to my AP Art History students rave about him. P.S. every AP Psych student is required to read Blink.",

            "Malcolm Gladwell clearly loves knowledge for knowledge's sake. Each piece of his proof has excessive details that are so interesting and compelling that I thoroughly enjoyed this audio book. There are many mini-lessons buried in his explanation of how we make decisions in the blink of an eye and how race can be a part of that. I highly recommend this book.",
            "Blink is about making an inital judgement and going with it. The author uses many different historical examples to illustrate his theory. I found a lot of the material to be very intuitive, but it was interesting to read a good sound philosphy and basis behind what most of us do as habit.Basically this book looks at the reason why we make our decisions, and I enjoyed it. I would have liked for him to have delved into the subject a little more and gotten into the deeper psychology of the matter.Overall, a good read.",
            "Blink's main idea is that with limited information people are able to make good decisions. That being said I found it both ironic and irritating that the author was so long winded in convincing the reader of this insight. In fact this insight isn't original psychologists have known for awhile that intuition is nothing more than really fast thinking. The more expertise one has in an area the quicker they are to make a good decision. Consider the x-ray technician takes one look at an x-ray and knows exactly what is broken and how bad. The patient has been staring at the x-ray and doesn't understand what to look for. The x-ray technican has looked at thousands and knows exactly what to look for.This book isn't worth the time it takes to read it. An article is about all it takes to present the information contained. It promises to be groundbreaking but instead the book should be buried.",
            "This book was, by far, the most redundant thing I have ever read. It would have made for an interesting article in a newspaper or magazine; however, the book itself is way too long and repetitious for its topic. I am very disappointed that I spent money on this item. Too bad my \"thin slicing\" is apparently terrible and could not help me on this purchase.",
            "Blink is a very long look at rapid cognition, the science of intuition. The problem with this book is it's about 200 pages too long and I felt like I was reading a magazine article that wouldn't stop - every chapter was a reiteration of the preceding chapter. This book in a nutshell is as follows:1. We each have an innate, rapid, largely unconscious sense of reasoning; i.e., intuition.2. We could greatly benefit by listening to this intuition.3. This intuition can also hold our unconscious prejudices.4. Our rapid cognition can often be wrong and get us in trouble.Personally I found this all very interesting - just not 320 pages worth of interesting.",
            "I'd like to echo the thoughts of other reviewers who've said Blink is merely a collection of anecdotes on how snap judgments can help us or harm us. Though interesting reads, these stories don't teach us anything we don't know already about intuition - Sometimes your instincts hit the bullseye and sometimes they fall completely off target. How do we know which instincts to trust? I was hoping Gladwell would provide an answer to this question, but found he really didn't.",
            "Challenges many of the accepted mantras of the professional world (\"More data leads to better decisions\"). An edgy and entertaining book.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell investigates the art and science of intuititive thinking. He does enough to give the reader an insight into all the facets of life that \"blink\" influences: society, organization, business; and how those influences can impact the world positively or negatively relative to the desired consequences. However, he fails to explore the questions of how thin-slicing works, how it can be developed, how it can be proliferated, and how it can inter-work with analytical thinking.The author gives in to the temptation of following the formula for making non-fiction books successful in the mainstream: catchy title + idiot-proof tagline + simplicity of message (no more than one concept) + repetitive use of phrases to make the message stick + ... And in the process, the book becomes more of a collection of essays and news reports compiled into a unifying theme of the powerful concept of \"blink\". Gladwell's first bookThe Tipping Pointsuffered the same symptom and now Blink. the book has lost its value due to the bastardization and this good book could have been great, had it not. Forgive me for agonizing about what could have been.I was skeptical when picking this book but I should say that the book exceeded my expectations. To Gladwell's credit, this book does not seem to be an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Tipping Point. The author's arguments and opinions are passionate. It's a good read and convinces the reader about the integral role of \"blink\" in human decision making, social behavior, opinions & biases, and psychology. A good way to spend your 4 hours.",
            "Blink is a very well-written collection of studies, stories and observations that helps readers begin to understand the power of our unconscious minds.Every day we make thousands of unconscious judgments and decisions that shape our present and future lives, and affect our relationships -- both personal and professional. The more insight we gain into our deeply-ingrained beliefs and impressions, and the more we learn to gauge and respond to our physiological cues (to which we are largely estranged as a culture), the better-equipped we will be to steer our lives in a direction that brings us true individual success, happiness and spiritual fufillment.Some of the later chapters in the book lost me a bit (possibly just because it was about military matters that are a bit over my head), but overall, reading this book was well worth my time.I highly recommend Blink to anyone who desires to better understand human nature and the power of the multi-faceted human brain. This book reminds me why I was a Psychology major and, more importantly, reminds me how much there is to know and see and do in this life. Immerse yourself and enjoy it.",
            "The book is part of a new genre - the short \"sum of articles\" around a concept. (Think Freakonomics for the most successful of the genre) In these essays, Malcom Gladwell covers why we make decisions so quickly, why they're frequently right, and how to work around the poor decisions we can find ourselves in.It's definitely not high science or a textbook, but it's good pop science. It'll only take a night or two to learn about our mind's ability to short-circuit our supposedly rational decisions.",
            "For a book essentially about good intuition and snap decisions, \"Blink\" is a little full of itself. The self-importance starts right on the cover: \"Blink\" bills itself as an illustration of the \"power of thinking without thinking.\" Although it provides some insights for understanding how, in only a glance, certain professionals (art curators, military strategists, gourmet food tasters, etc.) develop a \"gut feeling\" before weighing every conceivable strand of evidence, \"Blink\" offers nothing to improve your own intuition and decision making skills.One of the concepts Gladwell explores is \"thin-slicing,\" the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behavior based on very narrow slices of experience. You might not conceive that a 15-minute videotape of a mundane conversation with your spouse has anything particularly relevant to say about your love life. According to Gladwell and his narration about psychologist John Gottman, however, you'd be wrong. Gottman videotaped hundreds of volunteer couples discussing a point of contention in their marriage: money, sex, pets, etc. Then he broke down behavioral responses to these discussions into groups and represented them in a mathematical form, leading to...boom!...a prediction as to whether that marriage would last.Sounds like a stretch? Gottman followed up to see whether his calculations had made the right prediction. They sure had--with an astonishing 90 percent success rate. As a result of his experiments, Gottman reputedly could predict the future of a couple only by overhearing snippets of their conversation at a restaurant. The take-away lesson from this story may sound pedestrian, but practice makes perfect. The author is to be credited for at least drumming up some off-the-beaten-track examples to buttress his message.Additionally, Gottman's story highlights another idea in \"Blink\": that less is more and overloading decision-makers with information may often hamper their reasoning. If the scientist had asked his subjects about the state of their marriage, they might lie or feel awkward or--more importantly--they may be unaware of the truth. Instead, the author claims that by thin-slicing, Gottman found a much quicker path to the truth.Similarly, the example of Chicago's Cook County ER reinforces this idea in another context: the importance of a snap diagnosis of heart attacks to save lives. There, a doctor identified three major risk factors based on which a recommended treatment was to be followed. His algorithm, although more simplified than experts in the medical community felt comfortable with, guessed right more than 95 percent of the time compared to 75-89 percent when more laborious testing was conducted. This time out, Gladwell concludes that truly successful decision making lies in the balance between deliberate and instinctive thinking: while deliberate thinking and extensive experiments work well when we have the luxury of time, rapid cognition and the ability to thin-slice are called for when frugality matters.Next, there is the story of a man gifted at reading facial expressions who made a fortune at horse races just by getting a good look at horses' faces before races. The ability to absorb and detect minute changes in facial expressions, Gladwell suggests, allows us to essentially \"read minds.\" There are several chapters on how reliable we can be in predicting behavior with very little information.Then there is the tale of Amado Diallo, an immigrant, who was shot 41 times by policemen wrongfully suspecting him of criminal behavior on the doorsteps of his own house in the Bronx. Given that the police failed to read Diallo's facial expressions and body language, the case study appears to confirm the theory that people are guided by stereotypes and prejudices when making split-second decisions. Moreover, Gladwell goes further to suggest that stressful situations lead to a temporary condition of autism that hinders our ability to interpret others' actions and intentions.Such tales are entertaining--and certainly make for a fast read--but they come across as mere anecdotes, cherry-picked to bring a little liveliness to what might otherwise be humdrum common sense. The book teems with references to scientific studies, as if we need science to understand the importance of reading faces to understand people's true motivations and feelings.The numerous--and seemingly incoherent--illustrations discussed by Gladwell all relate to snap decision-making skills - the kind that help managers react swiftly in high-pressure situations and anticipate people's actions by carefully observing their faces. At the end of the book, the author devotes a chapter to the problem of stereotypes, which, he implies, may deprive us from controlling what surfaces from our unconscious. But do they? Gladwell maintains that we do have control over the environment in which rapid cognition takes place and thus we can steer our decisions away from preconceived notions. Thus, the power of thin-slicing works only in combination with a cognitive realization of all the stereotypes we have grown up with - which contradicts his thesis in the very subtitle of \"Blink\".",
            "Gladwell has a nice writing style and has created a simple analysis. Many of the examples and theories resonate with me -- you usually make an initial/gut decision that is correct but you overanalyze it with the desire for more information. I can apply his theory to my life. I've started to make quick decisions and not dug into deeper analysis tools. It has also been beneficial in creating peacefulness when making decisions, taking tests or being involved in stressful situations. My results have improved and I've created a sense of peace with my decisions.The book is simple and short. I read it over a few days but would not consider this a \"keeper\" to put on my bookshelf. I borrowed it from the library and promptly returned it after completion. It would be a good $10 softback purchase but not worth the hardback price.",
            "\"Man's most tragic folly is his need to find himself starting from a rational basis\"\"You can only organize the masses of people around that which can be made obvious to alot of people\"Blink is a thoroughly enjoyable and informative read which reveals astounding insights about the human perceptive process.The two above quotes, however, embody1) Why it is an extremely important book and2) Why it will likely go unappreciated or underappreciated by many who come across it.Contrary to our first impressions and some of Malcolm Gladwell's own claims, \"Blink\" is mainly about what we DON\"T know.The book deals with very complex and very easily misunderstood subject matter. In dissecting rapid cognition (he prefers this term to intuition), and perception, Gladwell uses his typically engaging and eclectic style. He employs seemingly disparate studies, anectodes, and reasoning in the service of deconstructing common ways of thinking about first impressions. For those who disapprove of the eclectic tendency of this book, I challenge you to read and think more carefully about HOW the various characters and stories in the book are connected. There is much to be gleaned from this approach.While Blink does arrive at some general and soft conclusions, Gladwell resists coming to simplistic conclusions just to satisfy academia, corporate america, or lazy readers. (The former two of whom celebrated the tipping point). I find the book most helpful as a paradigm shifter that introduces the reader to ideas about perception and rapid cognition and identifies related areas of study. As I mentioned before, corporate America will not find applications for this book as easily as with The Tipping Point. Academia will not find succinct declarations of new truths to show off with. While these are not problems for me, I'm sure there will be consequences to face from both of these.In the interest of balance, I did have some problems with Gladwell's usage of the term \"thin slicing\" He describes this highly complex mathematical process early in the book and then uses it so liberally throughout that it leads the reader to over generalize and consequently misunderstand the term. I also had mixed feelings about his treatment of the Diallo murder. The chapter entitled \"Seven Seconds in the Bronx\" was powerful, but I felt like there was some forced closure as he attempted to apply his theories here.Neither of these issues hampered my enjoyment of this book, however, and I highly recommend it. I'm also interested in discussion of it with critics and fans alike.- Chenjerai Kumanyika",
            "When I am falling asleep, my eyes start to blink rapidly... then I am out! While I admit, that that book does have some interesting information, all of the tangeable thoughts could have been written into a magazine article. There are too many repititions of the same story - seemingly just to fill the 288 pages with very little new information added. I remember writing similar essays in school; you kow, repeat information just to fill up the 10 page requirement.I am amazed that the editor and publisher of this book though it was well written enough to print.",
            "The first one-third of this book had me recommending it to others because it confirmed my own belief in the importance of acting upon our first impressions and relying on our subconsicous to help us make good decisions. The second third started to lose me, however, as the author got bogged down in examples of how those snap or \"blink\" decisions may be incorrect due to prejudices and biased information stored in our subconsicous minds, or because we lack sufficient knowledge and experience to make reliable snap decisions. The final third of the book left me wondering what was the author's fundamental premise for writing the book since he seemed to contradict much of what came before. He gave examples of \"thin slicing\" decisions but failed to mention how this may relate to the 80/20 Principle or Rule. In fact, much of the book seems to be about pushing the 80/20 rule to an extreme, yet there is no reference to the rule at all. Nevertheless, I found many of the numerous examples that were presented to be entertaining,interesting and worth remembering. There are several examples and statistics that I will probably refer to in some of the courses that I teach. And the bottom line is that although the author lost me in the details, the book encouraged me to trust my instincts and to apply thin slicing decision making even more than I already do. For a more coherent presentation of the concept and power of thin slicing decisions I recommend \"The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Success by Achieving More with Less\" by Richard Koch.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell is now a household name, thanks to \"The Tipping Point,\" his smash bestseller about how ideas spread. His new book, \"Blink,\" already a bestseller, is about \"the power of thinking without thinking.\" Are you the type of person who analyzes situations every which way before coming to a decision? Or do you tend to make up your mind based on your intuition and instincts? Gladwell addresses both of these tendencies and explains why careful analysis sometimes helps us succeed but, in other circumstances, may cause us to fall flat on our faces.As he did in \"The Tipping Point,\" Gladwell brings a host of real life examples to illustrate his ideas. He discusses a variety of subjects, such as speed dating, the art of military strategy, cola tasting, and police behavior. The author's strength lies in his ability to tell engrossing anecdotes and relate them to the themes that he wants to impart to the reader. If you observe a married couple bickering, can you make an accurate prediction about whether or not they will eventually divorce? Can a doctor's bedside manner affect the number of malpractice suits brought against him? Gladwell addresses these and other questions using clear and compelling prose, humor, and thought-provoking psychological insight.How can this book help the average person navigate his life more effectively? \"Blink\" may help us prevent our subconscious biases from adversely affecting our judgment. In addition, it may educate us about the advantages and the pitfalls of making decisions based on first impressions. This is an entertaining study of problem solving, and that's an area in which everyone can learn something valuable.",
            "After his bestseller [...]The Tipping Point what has [...]Malcolm Gladwell done for an encore? Written another blend of captivating stories and easy doses of social psychology, that - like its predecessor - will no doubt become a favourite topic at middle class dinner parties over coming months.His new book is called [...]Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, and it's the subtitle that explains his latest thesis. It is about \"the power of knowing ...in the first two seconds...\" In short, first impressions count. But often they can also mislead.Gladwell dubs the ability in \"those fleeting moments\" to make rapid judgements based on limited information `thin slicing', and some people are remarkably good at it. He maintains it should be taken seriously; it is not a magical gift but \"an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves\". Of course this is not really `thinking without thinking'. It's the kind of thinking that observant people can form after years, sometimes decades, of experience and study in a specific field (greek antiquities, say, or food tasting). A more accurate subtitle would have been `the power of observation and accumulated experience', but I guess that didn't test well in the focus groups.Gladwell is always a good read, so I doubt too many readers will mind when they realise his latest book lacks a strong, original thesis like [...]The Tipping Point. The weaker central argument does, however, expose a mechanistic style that can grate. For example chapter four opens with the following sentence: \"Paul Van Riper is tall and lean with a gleaming dome and wire-rimmed glasses.\" We soon learn he served as a marine in Vietnam, was nicknamed `Rip' by his troops, had \"a crisp voice, low to middle tones\", was confident, strict, fair, a student of war, was \"always very aggressive\" - but in a nice way - and he lead \"from the front\". I guess the author never read [...]Strunk & White and its famous dictum.Most readers will forgive the occasional overripe paragraph because the stories are apt and well told. Like his first book, this one provides readers with fascinating office or dinner party titbits. And for those in the United States, you may still have time to catch up on the tail end of his [...]book tour.",
            "If you are looking for a self-help book to give you an \"edge\", don't buy Blink.If you are looking for a Grand Unified Theory of \"thin-slicing\", don't buy \"Blink\"If you are expecting some sort of simple, linear, single-facted description of subconscious human cognition, don't buy \"Blink\"However, if you are interested in a readable (or listenable, I own the audiobook version) introduction to the concepts surrounding rapid cognition (i.e. sometimes less data and quicker decision-making is better than more data and exhaustive analysis), then I believe you'll enjoy this book and learn much from it.Just for fun, I decided to look over the reviews starting with the lowest ratings. The complaints about this book seem to fall into a few main categories:1) It doesn't provide an overarching theory to tie together all of the examples......This is a true statement. However, the field that Gladwell is trying to cover ranges from face-reading to margarine marketing to military strategy to inner-city hospital triage to picking out good strawberry jam. While they all share commonalities, it's probably fair to say that there currently is NO grand theory that ties it all together.2) Gladwell contradicts himself.....Yes, because rapid cognition doesn't always yield superior results. He goes into some of the reasons why this is so. Again, the topic is too multi-faceted to come up with a statement like \"Use rapid cognition except in circumstance X\". It just isn't that cut-and-dried.3) Gladwell doesn't explain how to get better at rapid cognition....No he doesn't, because the solutions for improving rapid cognition are highly dependent upon the individual situation. It can be as complex as spending years watching videotape or tasting food. Or, it can be as simple as basing a heart attack diagnosis on only 4 symptoms. Or closing your eyes when listening to a leader trying to persuade you, so that you don't fall victim to \"Tall Person Bias\".4) This stuff is common sense.....NO IT ISN'T. If this stuff was common sense, we would all use rapid cognition appropriately and not fall victim to its shortcomings. Then, fake Kouri would not fool museum curators, the average height of Fortune 500 CEOs would match the population average, and people would buy competing brandies based on taste, not on packaging. There are numerous examples in the book of our \"common sense\" being at odds with reality. One could say that fact is one of the main themes of the book.5) Gladwell's work is not academically rigorous.....No, it isn't. The book is not aimed at people with PhDs in neuroscience. It's aimed at a general audience and I believe Gladwell's intent is to spur interest in the topic so that readers will investigate further on their own.6) Gladwell's examples/anecdotes are repetitive....I have to concede that critics have a point. I think Gladwell repeats too much because he's trying to illustrate commonalities between different situations, even if he doesn't have a unifying explanation for those commonalities.7) Gladwell cover's too much ground/doesn't give enough detail for each example....Again, the critics have a point. Perhaps Gladwell should have focused on fewer examples. In his defense, I think part of his enthusiasm for the topic is that rapid cognition appears in so many areas of decision -making. In his attempt to demonstrate its breadth, he fails to get enough depth. Given that Gladwell was writing for a general audience, he probably couldn't do both.In summary, the content of the book is worthy of 5 stars. Take off a half-star each for Gladwell's repetitiveness and questionable choice on the breadth/depth balance.",
            "the power of thinking without thinking... we always regret when our snap decisions went wrong. so basically i'm buying this book in hope to improve my ability to make right decisions within a very short period of time therefore reduce errors. the book tells you how your snap decisions are made, a lot of fun stories related to blink. but disappointly, after you finish all of those interesting-at-first-annoying-after-a-while stories, the book is over, done, no more... so if you are looking for a fun read, buy this book; if you wanna improve your snap decison making skills like i did, reading this book is just waste of time.",
            "As some other reviewers mentioned before, this book doesn't really explain how to \"train\" your brain for intuition-based \"thinking without thinking\". In my opinion the reason for this is that the author is so entrench in his believe that intuition always tramps statistical analysis that he does not realize that the only way your brain can use intuition productively is by collecting enormous amount of statistical data. You will never develop right \"hunches\" by looking at the chess board for 5 seconds like grand masters do UNLESS you play as many games as an average grand master. And then you would have trained your brain for hunches in chess, but it will not help you to have intuition about authenticity of greek statues. I belive book's premise that somehow you can \"train\" your brain to be intuitive in general and not in a specific field is false.Also the book fails to mention that while some types of problems lend themselves to hunch-based solutions (simple and static like chess or whether to cross a busy street) others do not (stock market or insurance).Much more comprehensive (AND consize) analysis of this subject can be found in Michael Mauboussin's \"Mauboussin on strategy\" letters that he publishes for free on the web on the regular basis.",
            "If are hoping to gain insight about \"rapid cognition,\" how we arrive at snap judgements or gut feelings you'll be disappointed. The book is almost entirely devoted to describing instances of snap judgements that either assisted or led people astray in their decision making. No great theories on how the mind does this or why.The startling conclusions in the book are that we make snap judgements and that sometimes they help us and other times they hurt us. I was expecting something more like Steven Pinker's work in \"How the Mind Works\" or his other books. This is nothing like those.Don't waste your time and money. Don't even bother checking it out at the library.",
            "As he did in The Tipping Point, Gladwell masterfully condenses social science research into prose that is readable and even dramatic. It's almost as if he confides in the reader and chats with him or her across the dining room table.The problem with the book is that while Gladwell does well to emphasize the power of intuitive, unguided, unplanned thinking in human endeavor, he never really reconciles the contradictions that he finds. On the one hand, intuitive reasoning is a remarkable tool for distinguishing real art from a forgery or for negotiating the \"fog of war.\" On the other hand, it involves snap judgments about people that are nothing short of racial or gender prejudice. Although Gladwell acknowledges the contradictions, his solution -- to \"train\" the subconscious mind -- is not very convincing.",
            "`Blink' is about the mysterious two seconds it takes to develop a first impression and how surprising the impression often is, given our known preferences and tendencies. Malcolm Gladwell got the idea for this book after he had let his hair grow long on a whim, and found he was getting speeding tickets for the first time in his life. He wondered why the cops all of a sudden had an impression of him that wasn't there before. He became curious: where do first impressions come from anyway?Gladwell does some interesting investigative work to try to get some answers to that intriguing question. He suggests that `rapid cognition' is behind a `closed door' in our minds and follows certain unwritten rules. It is a logical process that he feels is not instinctual, but, surprisingly, can be more accurate than deliberate, rational thought, and follows certain rules that we are not even aware of. (Even improvisational comedians follow certain rules, though what they do often seems so random.) One must be careful though, since stereotyping and the immediate environment at the moment can influence the impression. All of this mental background action is going on without our even knowing it! The `closed door', it turns out, can only be peaked into.There are lots of very good examples of `blink'. There is the case of the statue that didn't look right to experts at first glance. Fourteen months later, after much testing, it was discovered by other experts that the statue was a forgery. Then there was the case of the supervisory fireman who yelled to his men to leave the building immediately minutes before it collapsed; he sensed something was wrong when it was not at all obvious what it was. Another example has to do with internationally known and respected tennis instructor who can almost invariably tell when a pro will double-fault just before the serve is hit, and he doesn't know how he does it! Speed dating often shows people being attracted others that do not fit their criteria of what they are looking for, for reasons they are fuzzy about. All of this is very mysterious, to say the least.Information and understanding are not the same things and sometimes less information is better. He gives very good examples of this in the medical and military fields. He talks about the `power of the glance', the ability of a great general to look at a battle field, weed through all the information, and make a rapid decision; he gives a great example of this in Lee's improbable victory at Chancellorsville. \"Sometimes, we have to edit\" our information down to something manageable, and make a decision on that. This was very counter-intuitive to me, and I'm sure, something to approach with caution. But I can't argue against results and he gives good evidence that it works.Be aware that first impressions can be misleading. Spontaneous decision making is shown to be not infallible, and can even be dangerous at times; stereotyping can supplant logical decision-making in a time-crunch. He goes into some detail about this with an instructive example of a police action in the Bronx that went awry. Gladwell said in the interview at the end of the book that he tried very hard to make this point. Rapid cognition can be your enemy as well as your friend. Use it with caution.It is tricky knowing how to measure the value of a product or a performer. Packaging can count too much, a great example of which is what he calls the `Warren Harding Error', a fascinating section of the book. Also, when surveying the response to a product, an opinion can't always be comfortably expressed in words (except by the experts), and as a result, some people will tend to look for a plausible reason, and give an incorrect opinion. The mystery of why someone likes something can't always be codified.This was a fascinating book that does not pretend to give all the answers but does raise some really good questions about a mysterious and important subject. The so-called `locked door' is finally getting its due.",
            "This is a book about the split decisions we make--our first impression, our gut reaction, our instinct--within the first two seconds of encountering a problem. Gladwell sets up in his introduction that we too often disregard that gut feeling and eventually over-think, over-analyze, and over-rationalize our decisions. Like in THE TIPPING POINT, Gladwell makes his point through varied and interesting case studies in unexpected fields of study. And although I found some of the case studies fascinating, I was under-whelmed by Gladwell's point overall. Maybe I expected the evidence for making snap judgments to be more compelling. From the title of the book, I expected Gladwell's point to be more about the advantages of snap decisions, but he also provides plenty of examples of when snap judgments can be disastrous. While this is all interesting, I was left feeling like Gladwell's point was a bit muddied. As opposed to a book FOR the advantages of that snap decisions, it seems like a book just about snap decisions, with the theme being that sometimes they are good and sometimes they are bad. Which, for all the interest of the case studies, is a fairly pedestrian thesis.",
            "The author makes a very good case on the ecology of the mind. The various situations in which a selective set of data is applied as alternate strategy to enable adequate response for survival are analyzed. However, the style is sometimes too personal and lacking in empirical data. Overall, it confirms a lay person's observations, but offers no framework on which to pursue further study.",
            "On the surface Malcolm Gladwell's Blink is not explicitly about leadership-educational or otherwise-but upon further examination, the application of Gladwell's work can be invaluable to anyone in need of making an important decision.The bulk of Blink is an exploration of how the mind works during the decision making process. Gladwell posits that one of the greatest mistakes that humans make when making decisions is that they fail recognize the significance of their unconscious mind. It is a commonly held belief that a \"good\" decision is one that comes out of a long and thorough decision making process made by the conscious mind. Gladwell openly challenges this conventional wisdom with the three major principles he sets out to prove in Blink.The first is to convince the reader that \"decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.\" This principle is explored at length through the discussion rapid cognition which is also known as the theory of \"thin slicing.\" Thin slicing is \"the ability of our unconscious mind to find patterns in situations and behavior based on very narrow slices of experience.\" The second principle is that while in many cases it is recommended to trust one's instincts, these same instincts have the ability to betray us. In other words, when making rapid decisions, human beings cannot ignore the fact that certain aspects of physical appearance-a person's size, color, or sex-can trigger some very powerful associations which have the potential to lead to prejudice and discrimination. The third and perhaps most interesting concept explored in the book is the idea that decisions and reactions made by the unconscious mind can be influenced and controlled by our conscious mind. In other words, the conscious mind can be \"primed\" though suggestive words and images to affect the unconscious decision. This concept is one that is continually relied upon by advertisers and spin doctors to sway the public to subscribe to whatever \"product\" is being peddled.Gladwell explores these intriguing concepts using scientific research and anecdotal evidence from a wide and diverse series culturally relevant subjects including: speed dating in Manhattan, the presidential campaign of Warren G. Harding, the potentially embarrassing war games that preceded the current war in Iraq, the musical career of the up and coming artist Kenna, the famous early 1980's \"Pepsi Challenge,\" diagnosing heart attacks at Cook County hospital, and the tragic shooting of Amadou Diallo by four New York police officers in 1999. Gladwell's previous experience as a writer for The New Yorker serves him well here because whether he is discussing the various muscles that are used to make a specific facial expression or the rules of comedic improvisation, he writes at a level and tone that is inherently readable. A lesser writer would not be able to bring all of these disparate examples together without sounding merely coincidental. Gladwell succeeds because at the outset of the chapter he establishes the fundamental concept that he wants to prove and then goes about the business of convincing the reader through an series of interrelated anecdotes that circle back repeatedly to the brain function or decision making trait that is being examined. Gladwell manages to simultaneously entertain and instruct which makes this a book that I would highly recommend.",
            "Blink is an extremely interesting read, no more and no less. It is not a textbook, nor is it a self-help book. Do not expect any solutions or unified theory here. The basic premise is that the unconscious mind can and often does make critical decisions that are difficult to rationally parse on first analysis and that can often be superior to logical and reasoned decisions based on a plethora of information. Gladwell starts off with gusto, making the reader think he is going to tie-in all the various threads into a coherent theory and prescription shortly. Somewhere along the way however, he seems to realise just how insurmountable an objective this is and from then on, the book just coasts along. As a review of human behavior however, Blink is excellent. Gladwell is particularly good at describing in clear and engaging terms a situation or experiment, telling us the story in an interest-arousing manner, and then identifying the lessons to be learned. A reader can gain some very good insights into human behavior, yet be left somewhat unsure exactly how to apply these insights. Sure, some of the stuff appears in hindsight to be plain common sense; except that most people miss the common sense on first read. The statistics he quotes (e.g. height as a factor in CEOs, cardiac triage) are excellent food for thought. And the various anecdotes Gladwell cites are both entertaining as well as instructive. I have to admire Gladwell's ability to transform dry research into terms of human interest. A short, entertaining and informative read, which earns it 3 stars.",
            "Gladwell has the rare ability to articulate complicated concepts into easily understand catch phrases. No wonder The Tipping Point was so good. That book took a theory and provided many substantial examples to underscore his point.His latest release is no different! Slightly different in format, in that it culls material from previously published items, Gladwell takes us on a tour of the power of instant impressions.More than just another take on 'making a good first impression,' Gladwell examines how much we take in and process instantly. Probably more now than ever in this fast-paced world we live in.A terrific read for the single man out there, trying to round out some of the rough edges he may be unaware of, to those of us seeking some deeper levels of understanding.- GiddyupGuy",
            "I blinked and did not see any empirical evidence that Gladwell's assertions hold ground. I was somewhat confused by the various ambiguities and the author's \"thin slicing\" theory and his leap of faith conclusions. In all fairness, this book is entertaining and is filled with fascinating anecdotes.",
            "This is a strange book. There are some flashes of brilliance, of \"Wow! I had not thought about it\", but there are also many moments in which it becomes really hard to understand what Gladwell wants to communicate.The author's main point seems to be that we have the ability to make quick judgements and analyses of people/ artifacts/ situations. This is an argument \"against\" the typical idea of a complete, thorough, time-consuming analyses. It's an interesting proposal and its based on psychological studies of people's behavior.But, beware!, he asserts that we should notice that this quick judgements and analyses must be somehow based on \"looking at the right items\" (a sort of Pareto -80/20- rule) in each situation. Being quick does not mean being right.So, his point is that, carefully trained (thus with the ability to distinguish what is truly relevant), people can make snap assessements with a good level of accuracy.On the positive side, I will say that:- The author's main point is worthy of a book- As in \"The Tipping Point\", he provides many interesting examples and anecdotes, from many sources (by example: military exercises, autist experiments, art, food tasting, etc.).- In general, his writing is \"smart\" and in some moments in makes you reflect upon your own life and situations you face in it where you could apply his theoryOn the negative side:- The structure of this book is terrible. I think I got the point of the book now, when I'm writing this note. But it moves you back and forth between different \"dilemmas\" and you never are really sure what we wants to say. Not even at the end. Terrible structure.- Well, his argument is not rocket science. If you're looking for ground-breaking thougths, this will not amuse you.In short, this is a nice book with some interesting thoughts, backed with many anecdotes and results from psychological tests. Read it if you have time, if you just want to enjoy the stories behind the argument, and if you do not mind the confusion in its structure. Otherwise, skipt it. Time is short. There are other better sources of information and entertainment.P.S.:1 - I have the sense this book could be the source for a nice documentary. Many of the experiments and situations (for example, face reading) are very well suited for the screen.2 - Due to the hype surrounding Gladwell's work and to the fact that the Tipping Point was really a cool and ground-breaking book, I have rated this book a 3. Had it been his first book, it could have been a 4.",
            "Having grown with this feeling that my 'first impression' is most of the times the one that counts, I've pushed the '1 click order' button before I could blink an eye (maybe it was the wonderful cover... yes, I know, don't judge a book...). I didn't take any nap while reading it, but I must confess reading sometimes slows down a bit, almost across an umberable point. If I was the editor, I'd do two things: make it 100 page long at the most (98 is a nice number) and I'd reshuffle the text in order to improve the reading speed.",
            "Started out really liking it, but it suddenly started feeling suspiciously like a self-help book. I'm not crazy into that.",
            "The book is interesting but not too awakening. It makes you think about your subconscious and instincts when making decisions. If a book is really good, I find it hard to put down. That was not the case with this book.",
            "Really liked this book...it opened my eyes as to how we as a society can make assumptions about things very quickly and not really know why. This explains the WHY. Malcolm Gladwell is an excellent writer and I also read his book \"The Tipping Point\" which is equally an excellent read. Great discussion book for a book club (nice change from chick lit!)",
            "Wow! Finally I get to read a book that shows the other side of this coin. M. Gladwell makes a superb work at giving a different idea of how we make judgements and therefore, how we can manage under certain circumstances those belly messages (according to his book, perhaps, only perhaps, we should give more credit to them than we do...). Each reader can make his / her own interpretation of the cases presented and then, understand and apply to every particular experience. Every case presented in this book is (to say the least) fascinating... one of those books you can't stop reading once you opened it!",

            "Amazing and insightful information written in a very engaging style. This book can help you be more objective, evaluate opinions of others, avoid prejudice, even help relationships including marriage. Very astute insights to help decision making. I highly recommend it.",

            "A very interesting novel. A combination of first thoughts, wisdom, and experience brings us to the title \"Blink\". I have always enjoyed the reading on the whys and wherefores of actions of the human race. Always being surprised this book brought the fact to me that somewhere along the line I had learned quite a bit. I hightly recommend the book.",
            "Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking is a book you can't put down. A very inspiring and easy read. Malcolm Gladwell's writing style is smooth and delicious without being too complicated. This book is for anyone interested in those little things you \"know\" but can't explain....Also read the Tippimg Point by Gladwell...you'll feel like you've learned something!",
            "Malcolm Gladwell has written a thought provoking series of essays about cognition. He uses interesting real life stories to illuminate the workings of the human mind. I found them thought provoking and informative.As a physician, I was particularly interested by his description of Goldman's algorithm, which is a simple tool for doctors to determine if someone is having a heart attack. Many writers stumble when they write about medicine, but Gladwell is spot on.Some reviewers have criticized this book as a series of articles rather than a coherent whole. That may be true, but the writing is so good that it doesn't matter. Gladwell is a first rate intellect and a fine writer. You won't go wrong with this read.",
            "A quick easy read with big ideas and great concepts. This and Gladwell's Tipping Point should be on all the high school reading lists. Together, these books would make great graduation gifts.Provides alot of useful insight and forethought.",
            "This book was an easy and fun read. But, more importantly, it gave me new insight on split-second decision making, the pros and the cons, when it works and when it doesn't. I think Mr. Gladwell's next book should be a \"how to\" manual on how to train oneself to make better decisions!",
            "I would love to sit and have a conversation over lunch with Malcolm Gladwell - what an absolutely fascinating fellow. Gladwell's book is full of pointed epigrams that exemplify his theories on decision-making, as he's laid them all out in his book. I quite enjoy his method of telling these stories rather then simply outlining the theories themselves. Blink is a fascinating study in how one makes decisions using intuition and it's certainly quite thought provoking. Though the author does offer several conclusions at the end of his book, I do hope a sequel is in the works, as more of a \"how-to.\" I enjoyed Blink immensely; though I was left at the end wanting a bit more on how one might actually sharpen these skills, being now more aware of them. Absolutely worthwhile reading.",
            "BLINK delves into what many may call intuition and has encouraged me to trust my gut--but not in a blind, I'm-always-right-kind of way. In areas where I have previous experience and know myself well, then my initial reaction may prove to be the most valid one. BLINK's concept of \"thin slicing\" stays with you. If at the end of a good read you can walk away remembering something, just one thing that will influence your future decisions, then I'd say the book and the author did its/his job.",
            "So I read this book on everybody in the world's recommendation and I have to say I was far from impressed. I think most people like this book because it's like sitting back in a bar and shooting the breeze with some buddies. Gladwell, in basically every case he brings up, writes about some case of a successful person and talks about how \"everyone loved him from the first second\" or some other anecdote like that. They're all interesting stories, but the conclusions you can take from this book are little if any. Every single one of these cases involve post-hoc hypotheses, something that is a deal breaker in any scientific community.But he's a good writer. So a fun read. Just take it with a grain of salt.",
            "Next time Malcolm Gladwell writes a book, I will buy it without blinking. I have read his Tipping point and this is his second book I read. I truly respect this author for the way he presents his ideas. Coginitive science is presented in the form of a story book. He debates throughout the book if we should follow our gut-feeling or not. There are times when this have proven right and sometimes it has proven wrong. There are some good examples of how instincts may not be always right : as in sipping Pepsi and deciding if it is better than Coke, listening to one song by an artist and deciding if he is good or bad. There are no conclusions drawn whatsoever. If you are looking at core Cognitive science as in \"science\", then this is not the book for you. This book has more examples than explanation of human behavior.All in all, it is a very light read. I agree with a reviewer who says it leaves you hungry, looking for more than what you read and an explanation of why we do what we do.",
            "This simple book, provides more understanding and insight into why we think the way we do than most \"heavier\" books on such subjects. If you have ever wondered why you \"just know\" something but could never figure out how, then this book will help demystify such things for you.In business, we should do more to recognize and apply the principles of \"Blink\" and we should be less quick to judge those who appear to make snap judgements themselves. Assuming that they have read, researched or worked for long periods in a given field then it is quite likely not as much a snap judgement as you think.This is a great read, accessible and well written with many powerful stories to support the well constructed arguments.",
            "This book is a reflection on \"the blink\" a peculiar survival mechanism humans beings have honed generation by generation from the distant past to this present age. Blink (the book) validates what many of us already knew, and that is we often fare better by trusting our instincts (our proverbial gut feeling) than by trying to arrive at a decision after long deliberation. Of course there are times in life when you want to carefully reflect, but just as often, our instincts---our \"blink reaction\" this almost superconscious distillation of a lifetime's worth of past input, decisions, and outcomes---takes care of us even better. We've all experienced this, I suppose, and can relate to times we've let our reactions to a circumstance guide us, but to read about it here is mentally awakening. Citing real life examples of when fire fighters, pilots, soldiers, doctors, salespeople and others relied on their capacity to instantly sum-up a person or situation and then act on that summation to best advantage, author Malcolm Gladwell crafts a colorful argument that celebrates the existence of this tool. The 1999 Amadou Diallo case, wherein a man was gunned down by New York City Police in what turned out to be a tragic mistake, illustrates that the blink can also be dead wrong and have tragic consequences, and Gladwell cites the matter of the election of President Harding in 1920 as being a time when a huge portion of the nation \"blinked\" the wrong way, after letting outward impressions cloud more latent judgments on Harding's personal capability. The blink is a capacity, Gladwell says, that can be heightened, trained, and lost altogether. He also suggests that just as some people are more musically talented, well, so some people are hardwired to be more intuitive than others. Is this a carte-blanche to lay aside logic and flit through life relying on first impressions? I sure hope readers don't come off seeing it that way, but as an exercise in advocating a hypothesis, Blink is one of the more original reads to come off the presses in quite some time.(Thanks, Diana, for lending me your copy.)",
            "As hard as it has been to think about some of the limits to my attitudes Blink has created a new awareness in me of areas where my judgements have been too quick and based on prejudices. It helped me see areas where I have been influenced and not really thought about how I think. A great read.",
            "Gladwell is an entertaining writer, I'll give him that. I did enjoy reading this book. However, it's not about the substance for him. He is basically reaching for something we all sorta kinda know about, but is not at all scientific or expository. The best book on doing without doing, thinking without thinking, intuition, the sense of self, self-knowledge, and the mecahnics behind all of this, is, by far, God Without Religion by Sankara Saranam. Not only does it deliver what readers likely expect from a book like Gladwell's, but it does in the context of world-shaking issues. If you want to know what thought is, not to mention supermental knowledge, look elsewhere.",
            "\"Blink : The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\" by Malcolm Gladwell is an interesting book that explores the mechanics of thinking without thinking. The author calls it thin-slicing, to refer to the small size of the sample data when compared to the population from which it is drawn, especially in terms of the extremely small time window for decision making.The book is a good introduction to Psychology since Malcolm explores the science behind the process of thinking and intuition. He brings out, with the help of several examples, the positive and negative aspects of this thin-slicing. The positive aspects are of course very important when one needs to decide quickly and correctly. The negative aspects bring out the situations when prejudices and biases, prior conditioning etc., play an important role. As brought out by the author, negative first impressions can be and should be countered and tempered by prior practice to reduce the chance of error.I picked up the book to browse through as is my habit. I found it so interesting that I had to read it through in the course of a few days (because I am employed full time and so can read only in the evenings and nights). I was very much impressed by the indepth analysis of the dynamics of our thinking process. I liked most of the examples that the author picked up to put his point across. The examples are many and are interesting. Except for the highly technical words used in describing the anatomy of facial expressions, the writing is easy to read and to follow. The concepts come through very clearly and the author makes a convincing case for his hypothesis.Whether you need to make the sort of snap judgements that Malcolm describes or not, reading the book will certainly increase the clarity of the dynamics of thinking.I would certainly recommend this book if you are interested in the mecahnics of thinking.The book is printed well and the editing is quite good. The errors are very few. A good value for the money.",
            "Gladwell's latest is a breezy, enjoyable read that unfortunately left me wondering about the whole point of the book.The discussions of the way we intuit, or thin-slice things, can be fascinating. However, he makes it clear at other times that this can be a poor approach. I've got no problem with contradiction, but a little further explanation would have been nice.This felt like a book that could have been much longer, and one that could have gone deeper, instead of providing plenty of light, anecdotal incidents to prove a point. While it's one that you'll probably enjoy, it just doesn't leave you with much in the end.",
            "The reviews are mixed regarding this book. I liked it. I found it similar to MIND WIDE OPEN and THE TIPPING POINT. It is a book about first impressions and how much accurate or inaccurate information can be relayed in the blink of an eye. Unfortunately, I don't know how much we really understand first impressions and that \"blink\" moment. Therefore, the author is left discussing research and impressions on what first impressions are all about. There is little concrete information on the process itself. In other words, I felt like I had a series of descriptions of what it was like but no complete image (much like the blind men describing the elephant).",
            "I am slightly disappointed with this book. As a reader who really enjoyed Gladwell's previous book 'The Tipping Point' I had looked forward to his new book. In some respects the book is like I hoped it would be: the topic choice is very interesting, the writing style is smooth and entertaining, the many anecdotes are very enjoyable and there are some interesting descriptions of experiments. Anyone should be able to pick up some interesting stories, points, facts and views from this book.What disappoints me though is that the book does not really deliver what it promises. In the introduction chapter the author promises to answer three questions: 1) Can Blink-descisions be as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately? 2) When should we trust our instincts and when should we be wary of them? 3) (how) can our snap judgments and first impressions be educated and controlled? Although the many stories in the book certainly imply clues to answers to these questions, explicit answers to these three questions are not clearly given. In fact, when I finished reading I felt like the author had forgotten to include a concluding and integrating chapter in which he would explicitly answer these questions and summarize and conclude. But that chapter is really missing. Due to that the book really lacks clarity.Although this book is disappointing I won't stop following Gladwell's writings. His previous book was better than this one and I'll bet his next one will be better too.",
            "In Blink, Gladwell reveals how we can become superior decision makers, in our homes, our workplaces, and in daily life. Delving into revolutionary discoveries in neurology and psychology, he reveals how we craft decisions, and why some individuals are so profoundly better at it than most of us. His thesis, which he fully supports with facts, not speculation, is that distinction between good decision-making and bad has little to do with how much information we can process rapidly, but on the particular minutiae on which we focus. The \"blink\" in the title is comes from Gladwell's surprising conclusion that what we think of as decisions made in the blink of an eye are much more intricate than we usually presuppose. After reading this, you will never again \"think about thinking\" in the same old way.",
            "Gladwell is an outstanding writer and storyteller and his new book offers interesting stories and food for thought. However, it falls far short of his blockbuster The Tipping Point.Blink is about the intuitive response, the pattern recognition that happens almost instantaneously, and allows us to recognize faces and complex, non-verbal communication. Gladwell seldom uses the term intuition, referring to this phenomenon as the adaptive unconscious. He offers a series of fascinating stories focusing on the process he calls \"thin-slicing,\" the process of recognizing and making a decision based on incredibly small amounts of data. One example shows people accurately predicting which married couples will stay together based on only two seconds of videotape.He offers the premise that decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately. However, he acknowledges that this same process can often result in bad decisions and offers little guidance on how to make the process more reliable.",
            "This book has become widely popular, even to the point where stores were selling out of copies before the holidays. People have been flocking to this title with anxious anticipation. My pre-read mentality was slightly different because of what I thought about Gladwell's other book, The Tipping Point, but I will go into more depth on that later.I cannot explain why my expectations were what they were, but whatever the reason(s) behind them, they were not met. I happened to believe that this book, as different from the author's other, might actually be about skills and techniques to practice in an effort to better one's self in the art of making snap decisions. That is the premise of the book; ideas around making educated decisions quickly rather than after exhaustive research efforts.As I began the book I became increasingly afraid it would simply be a collection of anecdotes about people who are able to make smart decisions in the blink of an eye. You have to figure that no one would buy a book that was just stories about people who are better at what they do than you are at what you do, right? ...Right? Or maybe such a book would fly off the shelves. Weird.Where I looked to find examples of what other people have done in their lives to better prepare themselves to make decisions I found story after story about experts in respective fields. These people have not trained in some strange Zen custom to be able to focus their mind on the correct decision; they have simply spent countless hours at their craft. The only reason these people can make snap decisions and eliminate the time otherwise spent on researching the situation is because they devoted the earlier portion of their lives to that research.The idea of the book, from how I interpreted it may be summed up as this: If you want to be able to decrease the amount of time it takes you to make a decision, whether it be in your business life, your personal life, or your spiritual life, all you need to do is know your product. Take time with each and every aspect. With time you will by default become so experienced with most situations that making decisions will be relatively routine.The subjects of Gladwell's examples are the tops in their industries because they have become experts in what they do...over time. And there is the key point. You, too, can make snap decisions if you become knowledgeable on the topic. But that takes time.The issue from The Tipping Point that I found had reincarnated itself in Blink was depth. Malcolm Gladwell writes, in both books, about what I consider to be good ideas. He has my attention. I desire to read what he has to say on the subjects. The level of his research is never questioned. I can tell that he is very thorough as he gathers the information for his books. He falls short, however, in analysis. The ideas are great, and the information is there, but at the end of both books I felt wanting for more expansion. Maybe it was a flaw in my reading that I felt some topics could have used more elaboration, but then again maybe you will agree.I sound as if I am down on the book, and for how it contrasted with my expectations of it, I am. I am not, however, completely dissatisfied with it in its entirety. I found the details of how people have carved out their particular niche very fascinating. The research done by the author was impressive. The variety of examples he brought together under the umbrella of decision making was what interested me most. If only knowing the many different categories that food experts use to rate mayonnaise could help me in my life's pursuit...As a short book that can be read rather quickly, even by slow readers such as myself, I still think Blink is worth reading if only from the perspective of the curious. I believe the book has more to offer than that, but it is a good starting point in your motivation to read.",
            "While reading this book, I was explaining some of Gladwell's ideas to a friend, and he made a joke. He said, \"If first impressions are so important, why not just read the first page?\" The joke more or less ruined the rest of the book for me, because, in essence, that's really what Gladwell is suggesting; that there is little importance in giving things a thorough examination.We live in a country where we just had a national election in which not one critical issue was discussed, where reality tv shows sweep the ratings, where book sales plummet yearly and technology makes immediacy ever more marketable, even while our children's learning is outpaced by the educational systems in third world nations, and I can't help the feeling that a book that encourages more shallowness is exactly what we don't need.Most of the support for his argument about the value of snap decisions is pretty obvious. Who doesn't put a lot of faith in their own intuition? On the other hand, Gladwell's descriptions of where snap decisions went wrong, specifically his study of Warren Harding, makes for great reading. But the fact that Gladwell included it more or less disproved his own thesis. I wish that had been the subject of the book, but I'm sure that wouldn't have been as marketable.All in all, a well-written and polished work that was too vague to make a powerful impression.",
            "Having spent a reasonable portion of my career trying to teach people to take a more objective view of things, I was a bit concerned this very-popular book was going to clash with -- and undermine -- all that work. In reality, Blink seems to make a much stronger case for MORE deliberation (except in cases where instant reaction is required) than less.The story of the inability of doctors to accurately \"triage\" potential heart attack victims is perhaps the best case. In an example of anti-thin-slicing, the primary warning factors were identified only through exhaustive research and correlation analysis. So much for \"gut feel\"!The opening case of the statue scam just shows that people need to learn to better \"understand\" their own instant analyses--why these supposedly insightful art people (who recognized the scam) could not more definitively explain that the object was \"too perfect\" just shows they need to be less enamoured with their intuitive judgment and more connected with facts. (Sorry if this gives some of the book away).Anyway, I can see why people enjoy Blink. There are some interesting stories. But I cynically wonder if Mr. Gladwell is hoping people blink as they read the book, because if they look too carefully they'll see it never really makes a point.",
            "What I love most about all these reviews available in Amazon is that many diverge from the book appraised and those diversion have led me to some wonderful books: \"The Bamboo Chest\"! Thank you to \"Tome\" for your other recommendation. It's a great accompaniament to \"Blink\"! While \"The Bamboo Chest\" is more backed up by declassified documents from the Defense Intelligence Agency and the State Department and excellent writing style(catch some of those gems!), \"Blink\" is carried along by the strength of the vignettes and the author's clear understanding of a very innate (and important!) ability: interesting how even on this review list how much those belief patterns we all have, whether in favour or against, have defined the direction of the review. Such is the controversy of books like \"Blink\" and \"The Bamboo Chest\": I say get the book, read it and if you don't like it, as I've experienced with other books purchased from Amazon, resell it. But for this book, for what it delivers I say get it and keep it, refer to it as your life experience changes!",
            "Gladwell begins with a story about a supposed Greek statue that some experts, using scientific testing, could not detect as a fruad, while others were immediately suspicious. (So, some people look at the forest for immediate clues, before examining the trees in detail.)Another example involved a single tennis expert with an uncanny knack of foretelling when someone was about to double-fault. (The bad news is that he could not relate how this was done. Thus, what this proves is beyound me.)Still another revolved around an officer playing a \"rogue MidEast commander\" vs. the regular Army. Anyone who has been in government knows that it moves at glacial speed, and can easily be outdone by much smaller groups with a modicum of intelligence and speed (eg. Lockheed's \"Skunk Works,\" and Burt Rutan's \"space ship.\"). So the rogue officer's success is hardly suprising.To say that quick decisions - based on a few KEY VARIABLES - is better than studied analyses that include a multitude of minor issues is hardly surprising either. (And then there's the chapter on \"Action Without Thought\" - the Reality of Executive Behavior\" within \"Executive Intelligence\" by Justin Menkes providing examples that demoan the lack of thinking by business leaders.)Finally, readers need to keep in mind that there will always be statistical abberations - eg. someone who correctly predicts the flip of a coin 50 times in a row. However, that does not prove that they have any special talent, and they are just as likely to be wrong as right on the next toss.Similarly, finding snap judgements superior to supposedly sophisticated statistical models does not necessarily support a conclusion supporting snap judgements - many statistical models are poorly specified and have embarrasingly large errors.Not worth reading.",
            "I really wanted to like this book. I was excited when I bought it. But the book doesn't deliver.The stories are interesting in the sense you could use them as material for small talk. Yet, I finished the book with no idea of what was the point. And that's not good. The book goes on and on with examples and explanations but not once gives you an idea on how to improve your snap judgments. If you are looking for that kind of info don't buy this book. Maybe the author is planning to teach that in his next book? I'd never buy it *blink*",
            "Since reading the Tipping Point couple of months ago I became a big fan of Malcom Gladwell and have sent the book as a birthday gift to at least 5 people. I mention this just to worn you that I am a little biased.Gladwell is extremely good at simplifying common phenomena, which is usually known by many but is usually too complex to describe. He is also a master in gluing you to his books. He does this through the number of case studies each of which is a mini course in its field.The part that liked most was the case study about the pentagon's war game. It is a crash course in leadership and team management which is very very informative and entertaining at the same time.",
            "Blink is a great book. This book talks about how we make snap judgments about people and the things that surrounds us. He proposes an idea and supports it with many peer-reviewed research. He does raise questions and provoke the reader to ponder on the issues raised and come up with his or her own conclusion. What amazes me the most about him is that all the ideas in this book is about finding ways to improve our society as a whole. I strongly believe that he is a another version of President Obama that wants to help and improve society as a whole. There is more to this book that will make you step back and think about some of the issues affecting our society today. You must read this book!",

If the first section doesn't intrigue or remind you of some related experience in your own life, then this book probably won't make sense. It's comprised of case studies that are mercifully light on scientific jargon and relate well to experiences we all know.I've interacted with and worked under people who consistently misunderstood the power of intuitive decision making. It's easy and intellectually lazy to point to a chart, a graph, a spreadsheet, or an equation and say, \"This is why we should go this way.\" It takes guts and willpower to rely equally on your own life experience too. You won't always be right, but I believe, as this book does, that you'll be right much more often than you think.",

            "The subject is good, not new. Many times experts can thin slice the available information can decide in a blink of a second . What qualities make them so good? or the other way around-what they missed?I think the experience that counts when thin slicing, making decisions in split seconds. But what about when the timing of the decision is not crucial? Law enforcement officers on patrol vs. Getty's KourosDoes the first impressions e.g. first decision, has impact when reconsidering the case again? How much bias do we have? Can the 'gut feeling' be changed?",
            "Blink by Malcolm Gladwell is a fresh and innovative way at looking at how people across a number of disciplines make decisions intuitively. Decisions that are made quickly are often looked at negatively because they lack the depth and research necessary to make what is perceived to be a well-informed decision. Gladwell makes the case that human intuition is a real and valuable tool that may be used along with other information gathering processes when finalizing decisions. Gladwell coins the term `thin slicing' and works to convince the reader that snap decisions are an effective decision making tool, that rapid cognition is at times faulty, and outlines how rapid cognition can be used effectively. The secret to `thin slicing' is in developing the ability to separate what information to pay attention to and what information to discard. The author points out that we are inundated with information and learning to filter that information is key to `thin slicing' successfully.Blink is an entertaining and easy to read book that is worth the short amount of time it will take to read. A little bit of knowledge may go a long way.",

            "This book is terrific and has opened my eyes to so many things I never even knew before about the way the mind works and the subconscious. The stories that are told are like non-other. I recommend this book to all.",
            "No, though how we make decisions is still not fully understood. This book compares decisions made in an instant, with those made in a more deliberate fashion. Since much of our thinking is done unconciously, even experts in a given field cannot fully understand how they can determine something in an instant, though they can generally tell when a gut decision is preferable to a well-thought out one. Instant decisions are improved when the number of factors to be considered can be narrowed down. There are caveats, as instant decisions are prone to grave errors due to prejudices or paralyzing fear; but training and practice can help overcome this problem.Many interesting examples are given, though they are loosely organized and there's no overall conclusion. Some of the examples given, discussing the perils of determining public taste in the arts or in foods, or decision making during a war exercise, don't really seem to prove any point at all. And the opening example, determining whather a marble statue was a forgery, seems to prove the power of both a momentary and non-momentary decision. The gut sense that it was a forgery was correct but ultimately proven only after further exhaustive testing.My take-home message is that where the stakes are high, take the time to clarify (in advance) how the decision should be made. This book would be strengthened by more examination of this point as opposed to trying to justify decisions in a blink.",

You can go read them. This added so much value to the book for me, I have hours and hours of reading to do in followup to this wonderful gem.Without this book I don't know when I would've heard the fascinating story of the Millennium WarGames and General Van Riper.

            "Blink is a very interesting book. It makes you realize how little we really understand how our choices and judgments are made. It's well written and Gladwell, as usual, keeps your interest through out the book.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell has already proved with best-sellers such as `The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference' and `Outliers: The Story of Success' that he can write a page-turner on a popular psychological subject, and `Blink', published in 2005, is no different in this respect. His potential public is large as the subject matter could interest de facto everybody: how come that snap judgements, taken intuitively, often seem to render better results than decisions based on more-informed and very rational reflections?Gladwell is a gifted speaker and this is reflected in his writing style whereby the reader is directly addressed, questions are posed and the attention is grabbed by revealing examples: E.g. it can be disconcerting to know that an experienced observer can predict with an uncanny high probability if a marriage will last or end in a divorce and this by simply overhearing (and analysing) a short conversation between both partners; `priming experiments' show that the mere use of words associated with old age made the participants in the test walk slower...These are only two of the examples given, the book provides quite a lot of very interesting anecdotes to surprise people on boring cocktail parties.The book has undoubtedly entertainment value and Gladwell keeps the readers interested, but more seriously now, what message does he want to transmit?Gladwell illustrates that conscious decisions made on basis of a lot of information are oftentimes not better than `snap decisions' which are taken fast and unconsciously. Most people do find it hard to accept that these snap judgements, this `rapid recognition' based on mysterious, unknown rules, do have value.More problematic is that these snap judgements can be prone to error as well and this due to the fact that in certain circumstances the use of stereotypes and implicit associations does lead to wrong conclusions. People can be manipulated, first impressions (e.g. judging somebody purely on appearance) can be thwarted. People are not always aware of this. Especially in cases where people are confronted with something completely new, first impressions are not that helpful, but rather confounding. However experience can help, the intelligent user of this unconscious decision-making process is aware of all these drawbacks and can use snap judgements in a controlled, efficient way.Gladwell knows how to tell his story, however what I did not like that much is his use of a very specific `technical vocabulary' whereby he wants to make a compromise between scientific concepts and popular terminology resulting in words such as `thin-slicing', `the mystery of the locked door' and titles and subtitles tending to hyperbole (e.g. the subtitle of the book: The Power of Thinking without Thinking).Calling Gladwell `one of the world's most original thinkers' (mentioned on the cover of my paperback-edition) is of course a gross exaggeration, however `Blink' is a fascinating read on an interesting subject and it offers quite some startling examples. The most important lesson that I have drawn from this book is that intuition is something which can be helpful, can be trained (the protestant work-ethic which one can also find in other books of Gladwell, e.g. in `Outliers') and adds a valid approach to solve problems, supplementing a purely logical, conventional method. The lesson is that we are not always better off by gathering more information.What lingers on as well, by the myriad of sometimes very intriguing examples - and this probably less intended by the writer - is the observation how fascinating and manipulation-prone beings we are.",
            "If you've ever wondered why first impressions are so powerful, or how unconscious cues are perpetually influencing conscious perception, \"Blink\" is your book. \"Blink\" explores the neurological science behind snap-judgments, intuition and our brain's ability to filter and evaluate massive amounts of information in a split-second. But Gladwell expertly puts the science into layman's terms, using everyday examples to explain how we all \"think without thinking.\" I read \"Blink\" over two years ago, and still find myself regularly noticing and reflecting on the phenomena it discusses in my daily life. \"Blink\" is definitely a book you won't soon forget.",

You'll learn when it is appropriate to trust your gut and instincts and when it is appropriate to use other tools help raise your situational awareness.This book also goes in depth as to why experience plays such an important role in decision making at the last minute. Gladwell uses some pretty compelling case studies like Chicago's Cook County Hospital and how Orchestra choose brass players.

            "Malcolm Gladwell knows how to tell a story. He captures the little details about people and events that give them meaning and make them interesting, something he used to good advantage in 'The Tipping Point,' and almost as well in this book, 'Blink.''Blink' is a book about snap judgments, first impressions, and thin-slicing experiences. It challenges the conventional wisdom of distrusting our first impressions, and brings up several examples where first impressions are actually the right ones. It shows real-world situations in which having all the information at one's fingertips was actually less useful than working from limited information.From examples of military trials to art forgeries, from police procedures to music performance, Gladwell brings example after example about how our reaction in the first two seconds of encountering something new can tell us as much as our reaction after knowing everything there is to know...and sometimes more.There are times in 'Blink' when the point is overstated and the generalization doesn't work - but Gladwell tells his stories so well that it doesn't matter. And what matters in 'Blink' isn't really the conclusions Gladwell makes...what matter is the stories of the people he talked to and the things they experienced. In Gladwell's hands these experiences feel real and tangible, and for the most part they work.Exaggerated claims or not, the stories in 'Blink' made me think about experiences in my own life. Among other things, I remembered a time when I was a teenager, spending time on my uncle's farm, and I ran out of books to read. We went to the bookstore and I didn't see anything new from my favorite standbys - but there was this book I'd never seen before, by an author I'd never heard of. I had no idea what story was in store between its pages, but I loved the cover. LOVED it. I bought it and discovered a new favorite author, one who I still read today, after more than twenty years and through a dozen books.We're told that judging a book by its cover is a bad idea. But if that's the case, would I ever have discovered one of my favorite writers? If that's the case, how are we meant to judge a book we've never read at all?'Blink' reinforces for us something we already knew - sometimes it's OK to judge a book by its cover.",

            "Malcolm Gladwell's \"Blink\" is an engaging collection of miscellaneous sociocultural and psychological studies, observations, and research that establishes the unconscious brain's focal role in making instinctive, comprehensive and rapid judgments about external stimuli in interactions with others and in everyday to emergency situations. Gladwell brings up an interesting and innovative theory that as human beings, our instincts are one of the most essential and powerful driving forces in our lives, and that our intuition is nevertheless often neglected and manipulated by our outside environment through prejudice, misleading information, first impressions, and superficial appearances. \"Blink\" is fascinating as a whole, even though certain articles are a bit too lengthy and meticulous in detail, and appeals to a wide range of people, as almost anybody can relate with the experience of feeling an emotion so strongly that you can't begin to explain or rationally justify. I would definitely recommend this book; Gladwell explains much of the often ignored impulses that human beings naturally experience and furthermore guides the reader to be more confident in their instincts, whether in making business decisions or in getting involved with other people at work or in personal relationships.",
            "It really does dawn on you somewhere in the middle of the book that Gladwell's intelligence is somehow borrowed, his examples redundant...He IS pushing his brand, his intellectuality, never quite making a solid point. The book is full of \"deep\" hmmm moments that never really amount to anything substantial. I'm glad I had the library copy (it would be a sorry waste of money).The moment I read about the involuntary subconscious association with the DOMINANT race, I knew Gladwell can't be taken seriously.",

There is such a thing as too much information (especially when not interpreted correctly), and likewise, snap judgments are often wrong. How to find a balance? No answer in this book.I did find some of the stories and information entertaining, insightful, and perhaps slightly useful; but overall, I was glad it was a short book--I would not have finished it had it been any longer.",

            "While Malcolm Gladwell's first book-length offering \"The Tipping Point,\" offered a few redeeming qualities from it's spectacularly non-groundbreaking ideas, \"Blink\" has nothing to offer people who have at least taken a high school psychology class.In one respect, Mr. Gladwell has performed a great public service: he has exposed the media as being full of dupes, willing to glorify anything in the field of non-fiction that presents a psychological theory, even an amazingly unoriginal one. As in Gladwell's first tome, \"Blink\" is a promoter of Freudian concepts -- an unconscious mind that has a greater influence over us than we're aware of, etc. \"Blink\" is a 280 page voyage through anecdotes that do absolutely nothing to bolster his claim.Let's take a public example. On Wikipedia, there is a summary of a story from Blink posted: \"A researcher tells the story of a firefighter in Cleveland who answered a routine call with his men. It was in the back of a one-and-a-half story house in a residential neighborhood in the kitchen. The firefighters broke down the door, laid down their hose, and began dousing the fire with water. It should have abated, but it didn't. As the fire lieutenant recalls, he suddenly thought to himself, 'There's something wrong here,' and he immediately ordered his men out. Moments after they fled, the floor they had been standing on collapsed. The fire had been in the basement, not the kitchen as it appeared. When asked how he knew to get out, the fireman thought it was ESP, which of course it wasn't. What is interesting to Gladwell is that the fireman could not immediately explain how he knew to get out. From what Gladwell calls 'the locked box' in our brains, our fireman just 'blinked' and made the right decision. In fact, if the fireman had deliberated on the facts he was seeing, he would have likely lost his life and the lives of his men.\"Perhaps the fireman knew that there was something wrong because normally the fire should have abated? Perhaps the fireman was so frazzled by the incident that he couldn't put all of his thoughts together at once? And maybe his gut reaction could have been wrong, too -- but it wasn't, so that's a non-story, and Gladwell wouldn't have material for this book that way. Day after day, gut reactions and first impressions are wrong, which could also fill up a book, but that doesn't make for an interesting read. I don't feel as if I can make this point as strongly as it deserves -- the floor might not have fallen through. His first impression might have been wrong. First impressions are wrong all the time. That, however, is a boring concept, and wouldn't make a best-seller. It would also require Gladwell to do some real research.Another anecdote that sticks out in my mind: Gladwell claims that if I were sitting in his office, and he read words such as Florida, denchers, Bingo, etc., to me, I would have walked out of his office slower than I came in because my \"unconscious mind\" equated those words with being elderly, so I would have assumed the role of an elderly person, whether I was aware of it or not. Oh, would I have? \"Malcolm said so. That's enough evidence for me,\" said the gulliable Gladwell fan. Even assuming I were to walk out slower, there are more factors than a few words that he said to me throughout the course of our conversation, which would have to carefully controlled, by his theory, to make sure he didn't say things such as \"high school\" \"teenager\" or \"rock music\" because then I would have assumed the role of a teenager, walking out of the room faster, whether I knew it or not, neutralizing the elderly feeling.This is so ridiculous that I feel stupid even trying to debunk Gladwell's claims. This should be obvious even to the most uneducated reader -- there is more than one factor involved in everything. (I'm trying not to impart my own cognitive psychological bias into this -- I'm willing to read serious works about psychoanalysis. Gladwell's book is not serious! No one who ignores factors that may diminish their argument should be taken seriously.)Theory is fact to Gladwell, the King of Pop Psychology, two books in a row. Maybe he \"unconsciously\" knows that it's wrong.",
            "A big waste of time... he could have told the story in about 5 pages...",
            "Gladwell deftly squeezes about 100 pages of content into almost 300 pages of book. It goes from pretty good to tedious to boring. He draws conclusions which are not based on any \"facts\" in the book, but he states his ideas as if they were absolute truths. I gave him 2 stars because the first part of the book was OK.Don't waste your time and your money.",
            "This is a page turner. The book consists of several exciting stories on very interesting material (fake art, police brutality, marriage counseling, etc). The author shows a bunch of scientific trickery and experiements designed to demonstrate the power of _blink_ - split-second.However, there is hardly a moral to the story, or a coherent message in the book. The book isn't about \"thinking\" of any kind, and it certainly does not teach the reader how to think.",
            "The greatest weakness of this book, in my opinion, is how useless it is in daily living for non-experts.Gladwell offers numerous examples of how expert make decisions based on thin-slicing, but unlike the experts that Gladwell mentions, I have not spent 20 years analyzing behavior like some tennis expert, military expert or social psychologist. I suppose it does tell me that if I did spend those 20 years studying a field, I'd be good at making decisions.Nonetheless, it is a fun read and a quick read and it's a good place to start thinking about the psychology of decision making.The Main Point: The human unconscious tries very hard to find patterns. Sometimes these patterns result in wonderful success. Sometimes they result in miserable failure. However, if we find a good pattern, our mind can do amazing things.People criticize him for arguing with himself. They also criticize him for presenting an unbalanced presentation. In my opinion, it seems like he's arguing with himself because he's presenting both sides of the issue. He seems like he's offering an unbalanced picture because he's sensationalist with the benefits of thin-slicing and consiliatory with the weaknesses of thin-slicing.He's really more of a story teller than a theorist. Buy this if you want a series of good and interesting stories. Don't buy it expecting a good presentation of a psychological theory.",
            "Much like The Tipping Point, Gladwell does well as a cocktail guest relating interesting stories and anecdotes. Many of these are insightful and fun, but altogether, they do not serve to back up any points layed out in the beginning of the book. Worse yet, several examples/chapters contradict the points made in others. For example, he states that there is great power in 'thin slicing', and that it can serve to come to logical conclusions automatically without thinking, then demonstrates how police officers mistakenly gun down innocent people because of the same process.He says that thin slicing should be done without prejudice, like the symphony auditions conducted behind a sheet for anonymity... but his early favorite example of thin slicing is of art experts who 'instantly' knew a statue was a fake, but they only knew this in the context of a gathering to determine authenticity, so suspicion was already in the air. Then he sites a musician who is only appreciated for his 'true' genius when listened to in the right context of praise by trusted reviewers/musicians... effectively requireing prejudice.The book then dives into a study on sensation transferrence, which would imply that genuine 'thin slicing' of telling whether food, products, or people would be impossible for anyone but a person specifically trained or genetically predispositioned for the task at hand.I'm almost afraid to think what people might try to take away from the book. If you dig deep into it, he's saying that if you are trained extensively for years on some specialized thing, that your brain can automatically pick up on the few key things to classify a situation one way or another. This is not thinking without thinking... this is thinking backed by exhaustive and comprehensive training. The person who knew with 95% accuracy when a tennis player would double-fault was a tennis coach who spent his life analyzing the scenarios. The book jacket seems to imply that people can just trust their first snap judgements about anything.",

He reports on some off the wall \"food taster\" mind reader and other liberial junk. What a waste of some very fine trees to print this rag.",
            "Gladwell probably doesn't know it, but his book could be a hit on Oprah's bookclub - at least the chapter on the Warren Harding Problem. This problem consists of the bad, misguided blink - to be distinguished from the insightful, intuitively on-point blink. Warren, you see, looked like a president, sounded like a president, and undoubtedly had a presidential swagger (though it hardly could have compared to WBush's peacocking under the Mission Accomplished banner or under the lights in New Orleans). But Warren was a superficial \"skirt-chaser,\" an idiot and a truly horrible president.But back to Oprah. The Warren Harding Problem, you see, extends not just to picking really bad presidents and CEO's, but to Boyfriends. Yep, that's what makes this Oprah-hot. We pick `em `cause they look like boyfriends, sound like boyfriends and even walk like boyfriends. But we fail to avoid the Warren Harding Problem and blink badly and our Warren-boyfriend turns out to be the worst boyfriend possible - actually, not a boyfriend at all.Note to Gladwell's agent: Forward this to Oprah.",

            "I get this underlining impression that \"Blink\" is designed to help decrease discrimination against black people in America. It seems to be the author's focal point. Since Obama, this ideal is very popular, and Malcolm is coming in at right time. Sure, it get's into \"thin slicing theory\" but it is heavily armed for negative notions against African Americans from White (Caucasian) people.But then again, the author Malcolm Gladwell is half Black and half White, so this makes sense.It's an easy read, not a trivial subject, and racism is a great starting point to get his ideas across!Peace",
            "I enjoyed the book and found the ideas about rapid cognition fascinating and mostly convincing. However, Gladwell makes a serious misstatement of fact in the \"First Back Bay trade paperback edition, April 2007\", on pages 274 and 275 of the Afterword. Here Gladwell writes about the greater rate at which blacks in the US are arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for crimes than whites. He says \"I'm not talking here about racial differences in overall crime rates. What I am talking about is this: if, for example, a white man and a black man are charged with the identical drug related crime, the black man is far more likely than the white man to go to jail.\" But he then goes on to quote statistics that he says come from an unnamed report from Human Rights Watch: \"In ten states black men are sent to state prison on drug charges at rates that are 26 to 57 times greater than those of white men in the same state.\" (no reference was provided). Appalled by this huge disparity I went on line to Human Rights Watch and found a report dating from 2008 that contains much of the same data, and seems to be a later version of the document Gladwell quotes (Targeting Blacks, Drug Law Enforcement and Race in the US, 2008 Human Rights Watch). The report only claims that the rate of imprisonment for blacks, as compared for whites, when charged with the same crime is about 3 times higher. HRW reports that the \"26 to 57 times\" figures that Gladwell gives actually is mostly a result of \"racial differences in overall crime rates\". The higher rates of imprisonment and are so much because blacks are arrested and charged at much higher rates than whites. For these statistics, see FBI crime statistics [...]. These statistics show that a similar number of crimes are committed by black and white Americans. But since the number of white Americans is around 4 times that of black Americans, this means that the crime rate for blacks must be higher, to yield the same number of crimes. Since there appear to be more whites than blacks that use drugs, The Human Rights Watch document speculates that the higher arrest rate for blacks is due to several factors: that law enforcement is more focused in cities, where blacks are concentrated (due HRW says, to racial bias), and more blacks who sell drugs do so in open air markets where they are more likely to get arrested than whites (who may sell among themselves, but in more private settings). Although the Human Rights Watch provides ample evidence of racial bias, it is not anywhere near the \"26 to 57 times\" rate of bias that Gladwell misuses. He should fix this error.Let me add here that I think the Human Rights Watch is mostly right in its assertion that the focus on imprisoning people for drug law violations has a hugely racially disparate effect and is unjustly and wastefully consigning large proportions of African Americans to ruined lives since they have to waste time in prison, then go through life with the stigma of having a prison record. Of all the arrests of black Americans, only about 16 % are for drug law violations however, so fixing the drug war problem will not fix the incarceration problem I think the war on drugs is more of a war on the poor, and especially a war on poor blacks. But Gladwell should still get his facts straight.",
            "Most of the times I sit down to read books that are supposed to be holding a breakthrough idea or concept, I come away extremely disappointed and frustrated. Again, Blink was one of those books. It started with an interesting few pages and a plausible sequence of events that might equate to something new and original, but the book quickly fell into the trap of most of these types of concepts. It expanded into areas that didn't meet the criterion of the initial premise and then attempted to stretch the concept to include these additional storylines.Blink is an attempt to show that humans have conscious and unconscious trains of thought. And that some people have such a strong ability to make correct decisions without really thinking about it, that this unconscious decision making is a completely separate line of reasoning done by the brain in lightning fashion. Gladwell starts with a statue that the Getty museum purchased. Only a handful of people had misgivings about the authenticity of the statue. And these people made the decision based on a \"hunch\". Now that is interesting. However, what we never find out is whether these people always are negative on a purchase like this knowing that it is unlikely to be authentic. Or, that these people made this type of quick decision 10 times and were wrong 9 other times. Instead, they are placed on a pedestal and a new concept is arranged around this theory.He then uses an example of a tennis coach that can quickly point out when a player is going to hit into a double fault. Whoa!! Could it be as simple as this: a tennis coach that seen a double fault eighteen gazillion times and by watching someone perform in a certain way, it triggers his normal memory decisioning tree? But since he has it basically imprinted on this brain, he can do the inner calculations in nanoseconds? Now the big disclaimer by Gladwell is that this coach can't really describe why he knows. Is that really important?But then Gladwell moves to showing how using this \"Blink-like\" decisioning process can lead to bad decisions; especially when it comes to prejudices that we might have picked up over the years. Gladwell never shows how to distinguish good from bad \"blink\" reasoning, so this reader is confused as to what this part of the book had to do with the first chapter.And then there is a chapter that includes a singer that should have made it based on the early thoughts of experts, but the singer didn't make it. What is that supposed to prove? That the recording house didn't do their job?And where does Pepsi's \"taste test\" come into the equation? This is a ridiculous example of cognitive or even subconscious decisioning - this is purely a reflex response based on tongue taste receptors.Again, we have an author that wrote one best seller and is now trying to pawn off an additional \"new\" concept on the public without any evidence at all. Any author attempting to show something new would use real scientific method and would attempt to level the other parameters and hold them constant. This author does none of that. He just attempts to fit the round plug into the square hole and hope that no one is really watching too closely. Don't waste your money.",
            "I am not sure why this is a book. Anecdotes, anecdots, anecdotes.... Is there anything here that is actually researched and studied? A hundred stories does not a coherent theory make. This is typical Gladwell, big statements, good stories, poorly thought through thesis, bold assertions with no proof, keep cheerily going on, one book to the next. Good for killing time on a beach, but why would I pay for this advice?",
            "As the 976th reviewer of this book, there is not much new to add here. I will say it was an enjoyable read. My perception was that I really didn't know what Gladwell was attempting to say. Is \"thinking without thinking\" good or bad? More to the point, he presents information that supports both sides of the argument but no conclusions. Use it, don't use it, useful characteristic not useful? Answer: sometimes, but when is not evident. Additionally, Gladwell throws a lot of white noise into the mix. Things that don't seem to have relevance to what he is presenting. For example, how too much information can sometimes interfere with decision making or how stressful situations make you \"mind blind\". Though the anecdotes were interesting, neither is about \"thinking without thinking\". Gladwell implies that \"thinking without thinking\" has characteristics of being instinctual, then says instincts can be cultivated through experiences, then provides information that instincts are frequently wrong, then provides examples of how critical thinking can be wrong; so I am left with the same question? What was the intent of the book? I don't necessarily need a roadmap, but it would have been nice to know the destination.",
            "From what I have read of negative reviews here- most people who don't like the book don't like it because they disagree with it. The idea itself is quite controversial, and I'm not sure I fully agree with Gladwell, but the manner in which he presents it is entertaining and enjoyable to read. His anecdotes do show some examples where \"thin slicing\" can come quite in handy, but he doesn't say this should overrule thought out processes- his point is that sometimes we can \"thin slice\" and be right, when overanalyzing leads to the wrong conclusion.The book is very well written and great for anyone who likes to have something to talk about. I also recommend this book to anyone who likes the book \"Freakonomics\" because Gladwell uses a similar anecdotal writing stye to Levitt and Dubner.You shouldn't let your doubts keep you from reading this book- you don't have to agree with Gladwell just because you read it. It's fun read even if you disagree.",
            "Blink is a collection of amazing stories centered around \"the power to think without thinking.\" Your unconscious mind has come up with a decision quickly, perhaps in seconds, but you may not recognize it consciously for hours or even years later. It's somehwat relatable to a gut feeling; you know something is what it is in your gut but cannot explain why you feel that way. It is a quick and easy book to read. The true stories are written in a well thought out cohesive flow and tend to be inspiring.Why 3 Stars? Stories is all this book is, nothing more, nothing less. If you expect this prior to purchasing the book, it will probably rate higher than 3 stars in your mind. For some reason I was expecting this book to give pointers or guidance on how someone can \"think without thinking\" or, at least, more insight on to how the people in the stories accomplished this. Although the stories are great, I did not feel left with a greater ability to \"think without thinking.\" The book left me further aware that this phenomena can and does happen, but I was already aware of this prior to reading the book.",
            "Malcom Gladwell, a staff writer for the New Yorker magazine, has written a fun little book that attempts to answer the following question: \"Are we capable of making quick, accurate decisions based on very little information by harnessing the power of the subconscious mind?\"When I first picked up this book, I was extremely skeptical. After all, the last thing we need is another dumb pop psychology screed that claims to reveal some shocking new \"secret\" about human nature. However, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.Gladwell's essay-length book is actually quite convincing -- even if you don't buy the whole argument for \"adaptive subconscious reasoning\" and \"thin slicing.\" Fun to read, too. Gladwell illustrates his case with some fascinating anecdotes from the worlds of fine art, pro sports, marriage, medicine, marketing, law enforcement and politics. He underpins his argument with research studies from academic and professional psychology. (Another Dr. Phil he ain't...)So why does this book make certain people so angry? The level of contempt and ridicule for Gladwell on these pages is amazing to me. He's not advocating shallowness or some metaphysical \"eeny meeny chili beenie\" approach to decision making. Rather, he's raising some legitimate points about our ability to reason in a hurry based on very limited information. Works wonders in some situations, and not so well in others.Is \"Blink\" the ultimate cosmic insight into the human psyche? Nope. But it sure is thought-provoking and innovative. Don't miss it.",
            "I'm reading this book now, and I have to say I'm a bit disappointed. Gladwell's a good author, but he has little authority. I suppose I might really buy into this if it were, say, written by an expert in some field... but Gladwell isn't. He's a journalist. It's sort of like- he's not an expert, but he plays one on TV.I looked at the blurb about the author at the end of the book, expecting to see that Gladwell is professor emeritus of (insert esoteric field of expertise here) at (insert over-glorified university here), and on and on and on for the rest of the page and then the name of his golden retriever. But there's only a sentence about him, saying only something like that he writes about science for the New Yorker. The New Yorker's a great magazine, don't get me wrong, but I was hoping for something a little more. Oh well, I guess he doesn't have a golden retriever.Am I just a little bitter that it was his idea to gather up all these other peoples' loosely associated experiences and ideas, package them neatly in a book and get rich off of it before I could? Yeah, okay, I can admit that. I am slightly embittered.But I'll tell you what really gets me. I keep getting fed the same 4-5 sentences and catch phrases over and over and over again, as he tries to pound it in my head that his themes are something more than loosely associated. I'm already very tired of hearing about how much smarter the world's art afficianados are than the stupid scientists that the Getty hired to examine the Greek kouros statue.That's probably more criticism than the book really deserves. It's actually pretty good, and a very fast read. It's not exactly life changing, and it's not exactly coherent. The connections aren't really all there, but it's still something that you are better off having read.",
            "In writing \"Blink\", Malcolm Gladwell writes another masterpiece as a follow-up to his prior book, \"the Tipping Point.\" In brief, \"Blink\" is a book about our decision making processes and what informs them. Gladwell's basic contention is that immediate reactions are often more accurate than those deliberated on for too long, perhaps the origin of the expression TMI, or too much information.At the beginning of the book Gladwell introduces the reader to the concept of \"thin slicing\", a method of profiling that rovides particular effectiveness to those with lots of experience in their field. Without that experience, thin slicing is less useful, and in fact can be quite harmful.Of particular fascination are the pieces on John Gottman's love lab where Gottman can tell, after looking at every frame of an hour of film of married couples talking to one another, whether they'll stay together, and this with 95% accuracy? Wowzer! He also covers a piece on perception and art fraud, one on listening to doctors as a way to predict their potential for being sued, one on the \"power of the glance\" which is an affectation of the alpha-chimp, and a great one on \"speed-dating\" which explores male-female instant attractions. He also gets into one of my favorite subjects, one that explores the inate genetic ability to excel at making sound judgements, on-the-fly, without undergoing emotional crisis if wrong (IMO the mark of a leader around whom others coalesce.)On another level \"Blink\" addresses the decision making difficulties brought on by \"the fog of war\", the stressful conditions under which cops and soldiers are supposed to make calm and insightful choices while undergoing cognitive overload, not to mention the extremes of cognitive dissonance.He proceeds to develop the idea of the \"Warren Harding error', something he calls FAE or the \"fundamental attribution error\" in his previous book, \"the tipping point.\" I immediately thought of Bill Clinton and any number of other charismatic leaders in history who, like Harding, did not emerge with the best historical reputation after being heralded as the next best great new thing.Thin-slicing is all about simplifying complex problems or profiling as it were. It's about finding patterns in chaos. It's about game theory, neuroscience, and snap judgements,...... and the efficay of blind auditions for classical musicians.Gladwell says he wrote the book after the experience of being pulled over by the cops because of his hairdoo. I suspect that his book is borne more of his quest to understand racial discrimination and how to mitigate it as much as is possible in a world of thin-slicing decision makers.As a post-script, this book makes me think of the phrase \"paralysis by analysis\", one that describes the inability of beauracracies to respond less effectively to societal problems. Although never mentioned by Gladwell, the book is an argument for the efficacies of a free market pricing system as a way to run an economy (see \"the road to serfdom\" by Hayek) rather than the top down, command and control methods promulgated by those who advocate bigger government. A terrific read and a thought provoking book. Don't miss it!",
            "Like The Tipping Point, Blink has a very simple point which it elaborates from a variety of perspectives. In this case, the point is that our subconscious mind can integrate small, subtle clues to very quickly make great decisions . . . as long as we have been trained to know what clues to focus on.In developing that simple idea, Mr. Gladwell makes the case for \"going with your gut\" in many instances . . . especially when time is of the essence (such as during emergencies and in combat). He also rescues analysis to show how analysis can train people to know what to look for so they can use their instincts more effectively.But instincts have a downside. Based on conditioning, we make associations that are harmful to ourselves and to others. He recounts how an innocent man became a victim of under trained, over stimulated police officers and how even African-Americans display prejudice against African-Americans.Most of the book is devoted to looking at prejudice and how to overcome it. For those who are interested in that subject, this book will be much more interesting than for those who want to understand how to improve their decision-making.I thought that the book failed to reach the average mark as a book about how to improve decision-making. There's no real guidance for what we can each do to improve our important decisions. We are just left with hope that we can do better. I graded the book up a bit because I liked the insights into racism.I thought the material on branded products was much too long and didn't add anything to what I knew already.Mr. Gladwell writes well, though, so it's mostly a pleasant trip in the book. He makes science more interesting, but leaves a bit too much of the science out to make the results satisfying. He's writing for a dumbed-down audience with science backgrounds at the 8th grade level.The book's opening made me feel like I was really going to learn something. As the book continued, I found myself disappointed compared to the high expectations that the opening set for learning better decision-making practices. As a result, all I got from the book was to pay attention to external clues and my own physiological cues as I react to a situation. I already do that, so I felt that the book didn't really deliver a solid benefit to me beyond teaching me a few new stories about decision makers.",
            "This book is packed full of interesting stories, most of which adhere to the central theme - we have a second mode of thinking. Mr. Gladwell forecefully argues for the relevance of recognising this \"thin-slicing\" mode, showing that it acts whether we choose to recognise it or not. By the end of the book, you most likely will agree with him, and come away with a new understanding of what Oz is doing behind your own personal curtain.That said, some of the stories seem only somewhat relevant to the topic at hand and make the book seem more tangential, taking away focus from the central tenet. Also, we're left at the end with an understanding that we have this new way of thinking, but little idea of what it implies to the larger world. In the end, the book is a collection of compelling anecdotes, a few mind-jarring insights, and some boundless entheusiasm. I recommend it - it'll make you think, in more ways than one.",
            "The premise here is how we make quick decisions with little data; some of these decisions are suprisingly accurate,some, not suprisingly, quite inaccurate. As to the former, there are examples of art historians who can spot well executed frauds at a quick glance and pshycologists who can watch small snippets of spousal conversations and very accurately predict who will or won't be married fifteen years forward. As to the latter, there are examples of how people make bad decisions based on the unconscious use of racial and sexual data. One of the final chapters on how some specialists have learned to read facial gestures using a scientific method by analyzing specific muscle movements is, as I recall, adapted from a more extensive and more interesting article which appeared in the New Yorker several years ago. I would recommend the article over the entire book. When I finished this book after a few hours, I realized there was a lot of filler--some of the stories seemd interesting but not connected to the overall theme. As an example, there is a chapter on a talented singer who, for some reason has not been able to catch on. As I read this, I thought the chapter had little bearing on the subject matter and it seemed to me that Gladwell was using his book to see if he could ignite this singer's career --that is using his audience to see if it could generate a tipping point, the theme of his last book.In all the book has some superficial appeal; it moves around to a range of stories which are not well connected. Some chapters are very interesting without regard to their connection to the overall theme and there is very little information explaining how the \"blink\" phenomenon operates.",
            "In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell suggests that first impressions significantly affect our actions and attitudes in business, dating, and even shopping. He describes the deeply complex concept of implicit cognition in an understandable and applicable way, and while Blink is not the foremost authority on this subject, Gladwell does an excellent job explaining how and why first impressions occur. I would suggest Blink to anyone who is interested in better understanding first impressions and the influence that \"thin-slicing\" has upon how we interact with the world around us.",
            "I was about to buy the book, since the subject and the assumed hypothesis look appealing and interesting. Then my Amazon friend Conan wrote a rather lukewarm review and I delayed the purchase. Then I found the book on my daughter's shelf. Thanks to Conan for saving my money.I borrowed the book and read it. In a blink I thought it was as interesting as it had promised. It took me more than a blink to find out, that it does not deliver: you learn some interesting anecdotes about marriage predictions and about malpractice suits (my other Amazon friend Joe Neuschatz will be interested) and such things, but you never really get nearer to understanding what the alleged special rapid intelligence process really is.The book reminds me a bit of the style of articles in Der Spiegel: journalism well short of science. Sometimes entertaining, but mostly disappointing.",
            "the basic thesis of the book is as follows: intuitive decision making (snap, blink, or unconscious) can be more effective than scientific/analytical decision making IF we train them to be less biased. it's an interesting point, especially in our culture of scientific determinism, but did he have to take 260 pages of anecdotes to argue that? and isn't scientific knowledge/study exists to remove those inherent biases which he so vehemently argues against?it reads like many of the self-help/business strategy books - pseudo-psychology/pseudo-sociology, which has pseudo-valid point(s).more interesting than the theis of the book are the various anecdotes ranging from vic braden being able to predict double faults in professional tennis players to police accident in brooklyn, which are much more entertaining and educational than the premise and the argument of the book. buy it read it if your blink decision tells you to, which probably tells you that you have a very flawed and biased subconscious: like me. but i have a copy for sell if you do.",
            "In a blink...\"BLINK: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\" is a rip-off! Malcome Gladwell's \"BLINK\" had a great review in the New York Times and was (is?) a top seller. However, I was so under whelmed after reading it that I passed the book on, without comment, to a couple of friends, (possibly ex-friends now) for their reactions. It could be that I was missing something. One of my pals later told, me in describing his thoughts on \"BLINK\", that this tome was exactly what the philosopher Harry Franfurt was describing in his book, \"On Bull....\". The author of \"BLINK\" has scraped together some university \"studies\" to give credence to his dissertation. By puffing out the studies and inserting some personal observations he managed to fill some two-hundred odd pages with pap. I had been scammed. Here, in my opinion, is the encapsulated wisdom to be gleaned from \"BLINK\" and what you should know before starting the read: If you carefully observe what you are doing while repeating the same process over, and over, and over, you will one day be able to repeat the process without a lot thinking...sort of an intuitive thing. It's kinda like shooting a basketball.It's Pavlov, basic 101 Pavlov. The implied benefit to you will be an ability to recognize these processes within, let's say, maybe, two seconds or a \"BLINK\" of the eye. Oh yeah, the writer also throws in some personal grievances about an entertainer friend(?) of his who gets panned by critics and trys to lead you into concluding that they must be some kind of music bigots. The only benefit in reading this rip-off is that I should be on my way to recognizing literary nothingness within a \"blink\".",
            "Highly readable, and I definitely recommend, as it is a very enjoyable collection of stories about \"gut feeling\" decision making. But, I ended the book not being sure what the author wanted me to take away by reading it. It is common knowledge that experts in any field develop an inner guide that allows them to make quick decisions and quickly see what others do not see (and there are plenty of examples of this in the book); it is also common knowledge that sometimes those instant judgements are not necesarily right (and there are also examples of this in the book). I was expecting a theory out of that book and there is none. Read it anyhow, you will likely enjoy it.",
            "I read a brief review of this book and it sounded like an interesting read. I tend to always look for an author's previous work before buying the current bestseller. To my surprise Gladwell's other work was also a bestseller...still!!!So I read Tipping Point, it was a very quick read and very entertaining to me. However, that being said it still was getting very bad reviews here on Amazon. I kept thinking that maybe I'd put off Blink until it comes down in price and/or came out in paperback. All of that was about 2 months ago. In the meantime, I've read three other books and found myself in a Amazon dry spell (Waiting for 4 new books to be delivered). So I went over to my local price club and picked up Blink for $17 dollars. I liked Tipping Point, I thought it was engaging up until the end where it dragged slightly but I suspect it was the rehashing that caused that. Anyway, Blink is a little different in that it starts to become bogged down halfway through, not because of the rehashing (Which it does plenty of) but because Gladwell chooses to insert a message into the book. I'm not against it and I don't want to turn others off because I think the book is still a good product. It was very obvious to me that the tone of the book changes and vears from an exploration into a dissertation on certain unfortunate facts of life that effect everyone. But the tone and message do make the argument very one sided and doesn't even begin to consider the other point of view. Both books are good reads and will not hurt you or make you feel like a lemming, unless of course you let yourself feel that way. I believe that's why so many people have left very terrible reviews here. They feel betrayed by themselves because they expected to get a better read. The venom is unneccasary... Move on. I do suspect though that Gladwell will make a trilogy and will tie all together. Hence Gladwell's Journey.",
            "The premise of the book is that \"instinct\" or hunches can be formed by a first glance (thin slices) of information inputs; this data sometimes is enough as our subconscience focuses on what is really important in that decision long before we can clearly articulate our analysis of the data inputs. On that note, the key thin slice of information you need to know is: don't buy the book as that is the entire message. The remainder of the book is a host of wonderful examples, but no concrete further pertinent information is offered.Early in the book, the author suggests that sometimes the hunches can go awry, but \"for a very specific and consistent set reasons, and those reasons can be identified and understood. It is possible to learn when to listen to that powerful onboard computer and when to be wary of it.\"If the purpose of the book was to highlight and divulge in a clear and precise manner \"when to listen... and when to be wary of it\", it would be a very useful tool to enhance decision making. Having failed to offer this, the book fails to give the reader any real value beyond what we instintively already know.Ironic, isn't it? We have enough information about the book very rapidly: it is entertaining but lacking value.",
            "-----It is interesting to look at all the Amazon reviews of this book. They are so divergent. Some reviewer love it, others hate it. Why? My own response may be suggestive. I liked his writing. He has a talent to take abstract academic psychological concepts and turn them into interesting ideas and examples the lay reader can easily read and understand. In this way, he is similar to Antonio Damasio who popularized neurology (Descartes' Error) and Carl Sagan who did this for astronomy. But there is a problem. Unlike these authors, he is not an expert in the field. They were accepted by their professions--an outstanding neurologist or an exceptional astronomer. He is accepted only as an outstanding writer.-----His knowledge of the subject matter comes from interviews with some experts in the field or reading some books. But he doesn't have the years of experience examining scientific journals, considering counter evidence, or applying the scientific method to test his hypothesis. As a result, his book reaches some basic conclusions that are not only erroneous, but many professionals consider being the exact opposite of what they should be.-----True, our brains do quickly organize data into patterns; he calls them \"blinks or \"thin-slicing,\" others call them schematas or gestaltens. True, these blinks may prove to be correct. But equally true they may be false. The question is, how do we determine which ones are true and which ones are false? We can't tell from the blinks themselves. The false ones feel just as strong, just as certain, as the true ones. The only way we can tell is by collecting data and analyzing how accurate our past blinks have been.-----Accepting our blinks uncritically can cause mountains of problems. The vast majority of patients I have treated accepted a phony intuition uncritically: the four-time divorced woman who kept marrying alcoholics because her intuition told her he was Mr. Right; the panicked adolescent who intuited that there was great danger whenever he left his house, the suspicious business man who \"blinked\" that people who talked in whispers were plotting against him. The first step for all these people was to challenge their instant perceptions. It would be helpful if this book clearly said, \"Don't trust your blinks,\" instead of hinting at the opposite.",
            "The book Blink is nothing more than a collection of anecdotes about snap judgements and decision making without thinking. The problem is that there is very little science or other supporting evidence to back up or explain the phenomena that are the subject of this book. The book is more pop science than a work of serious study.God forbid if more people think without thinking. We have enough of that as it is in business, government, and other areas where real thinking and leadership are required.",
            "Here's a glimpse from the recent NYT article: The Gladwell Effect. \"For all their resonance and success, Gladwell's books have also been criticized, most often for demonstrating, or encouraging, lazy thinking. In a scathing review in The New Republic, the judge and author Richard Posner found \"Blink\" full of banalities and contradictions, \"written like a book intended for people who do not read books.\" Some social scientists have also been unimpressed. \"I think what he leaves people with is not that scientists are doing some interesting work, but that Malcolm Gladwell has a couple of good ideas,\" said Thomas Schelling, who shared last year's Nobel in economic science and did pioneering research on the \"tipping point,\" a formulation that originally referred to the point at which white families would leave a neighborhood after black families began moving in.\"The introduction points out that college students know in the first second how well they will like a teacher. And this is a good thing?! Someone is writing an apt take off: Blank: The Power of Not Thinking at All...",
            "This is a great book for anyone intersted in the mind, thinking, and decision making. It is not exhaustive in these areas, but entertaining and thought provoking. It is filled with interesting studies and info. that make you think and consider your ability to \"blink.\" If I were to rename this book, I'd call it \"Instinct and Behavior: A Few Case Examples.\"I really did like the book. It made me think about my own instincts and unconscious thought and how real the hypothesis forwarded in this book may be. I am still considering it.I did not like two particular things about the book: 1) It never really tells us how to get a hold of our unconscious thinking, i.e. to be better at it; 2) A few of the case studies seemed... not on target (i.e. they required insightful discoveries to see their applicability).So, if you want some fun information about the mind (in the form of case studies) and our split-second decision capacity, buy it. If you want to walk away a better instinctual decision maker, with great understanding of the human psyche, don't buy it.To fully enjoy this book, INTROSPECTIVE READING AND UNDERSTANDING IS NECESSARY. Don't like to have to think about what your reading to understand it? Run from this book.",
            "I thought The Tipping Point was a great book. Entertaining, enlightening and relevant.My pitch on this one: \"We intuitively 'know' in our gut what's right or accurate 'at first blink'. And more often than not, that reaction is accurate more than 50% of the time. The more we 'think' about something or get emotionally involved, the less accurate our 're-thinking' it is. Professionals who have lots of experience in a particular area of expertise develop an ability to process very complex concepts or situations unconsciously and are right more often than wrong.\"Malcolm goes on to cite plenty of entertaining examples around art forgery (pros who spot a fake but can't tell you why it is), marriage consultants (who predict with over 90% accuracy whether a couple will be together), gamblers (who change their betting behavior before they consciously know what's wrong), a tennis critic (who could predict a fault before the ball hit the racket) and plenty of others that are interesting.After reading a couple chapters, my wife said, \"I call it a woman's intuition\"...no big deal.I can't say that's all there is to the story, but there's some truth in the comment.The bottom line: it's a fun, fast read and it's good for some entertaining conversation with friends and business associates.The good- Very Entertaining- Well-written- Malcolm is a great story-teller (or has an awesome editor or both)- The stories are relevant and interesting- He boils some complex ideas down into easy to understand stories- As a consultant, it's an easy book to recommend to others- Very good conversation materialThe not-so-good- It's not a \"how to\" nor do I feel that there significant distinctions or lessons that can be applied to your real or business life - adjust your expectations now- It's \"kinda mushy\" - I'd categorize this a \"Pulpy Pop Business Book\"- Not as revealing or useful in a business environment as \"The Tipping Point\"My \"Blink\":- I'm betting he got a multi-million dollar advance on this book- If you like Dan Brown's books (The Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons), you'll like this. Note that there's no connection between the content, author or material here. It's just an instinctive reaction- Malcolm needs to write another book as great as \"The Tipping Point\" or he won't be seeing another big advance like this one.All in all, it's a nice \"Chinese dinner\". Great tasting, enjoyable but I felt hungry an hour after the last bite.",
            "I am sad to say how disappointed I was with Blink. After reading Tipping point I expected this book to be another phenomenal book, making the complex simple. Alas it did what Einstien warned us about \"Make things as simple as possible and not any simpler.\"This book tried to argue that we need to let go of the logical thought and analytical thinking in favor of gut feelings. \"Think\" by Michael LeGault is a rebuttal to this book and I think it is worth reading in conjunction with Blink. Why? because implications of pattern based thinking (whcih is how our brain processes information at the fundamental level) and what Blink argues for, is deeply powerful, yet is a fundamental imperative to use the carefully balanced approach in decision making that uses instinct and mixes it with analytical thinking. Without this balance our society can be regressing towards middle ages as opposed to advancing towards the next creative era of growth.",
            "Blink discusses and describes the value of intuitive thinking, but it explains that intuition is not ESP but the result of a vast amount of knowledge and experience properly ordered to facilitate an immediate \"still small voice\" (my quotes, not Gladwell's) of certainty that we should heed. Gladwell goes on to explain what happens when intuition seems to fail, and why, and how to avoid that. He uses as an example of failed intuition the tragic shooting by police of Amadou Diallou and the analysis is superb. His chapter of facial recognition and discerning exactly what someone is feeling or thinking from the briefest flickers of expression is worth the price of the book, which is a fascinating read superbly written. Never dull, informative, highly useful.",
            "I'll make this short. Blink is an interesting book that makes for a great read while waiting at the airport or the like. My finace has a phd in neurological psych. and has revealed to me how Gladwell misuses some contemporary psychological theory to prove his \"real-life\" illustrations. Given that his notions are not qualified, it takes a turn from being entertaining to a viable option to watching NASCAR. Hard to believe this one is so highly rated honestly.",
            "Gladwell writes well and the book is interesting. I read about half the book before I knew it! But I was jolted when Gladwell suddenly changed the focus of the book. In the first half of the book snap-judgments are good, then theyre suddenly bad. \"What's up with that?\" I asked myself.Well, what's up is people are programmed or brain-washed, if you will, to react however they react to specific stimuli. And how they react depends on their fund of experience with specific stimuli, or the messages society drums into their skulls. Phobias and aversion reactions and addictions are the extreme forms of such mental activity. Like peeing on an electric fence. One experience is enough. No need for college or a seminar or a cost-benefit analysis. And no need to suffer guilt for your prejudice against all electric fences. So you save money on counseling, too.Gladwell can improve the organization of the book by keeping the first half, which explains the benefits of snap-judgments, then address the issue of how to correct faulty snap-judgment decision making. That is, provide some helpful hints about how to reset the triggers to include new and better information.I was gonna buy the book and am mighty happy I didnt.",
            "After having thoroughly enjoyed Gladwell's 'The Tipping Point', I eagerly awaited for this one to come out. I must say that I was quite disappointed. Whereas his first book captivated the reader with engaging ideas of many social phenomenons, this book seemed to lack an identity and purpose.An extreme viewpoint would be to say that this book was written primarily to ride the wave of the success of the first one. 'Blink' lacks the ingenuity and wit that Gladwell displayed in his first book.",
            "This book is a typical case of an author who finds a good idea but doesn't figure out how to deliver it. I have been working in Strategic Marketing for over 15 years and was very excited to receive and read Blink. I thought his last book was brilliant but don't waste your money on this one. Go buy yourself a drink instead. In a blink, without thinking. What a dissapointment this read is. Mr. Gladwell chooses all kinds of well known incidents, examples and dissasters to prove his ''Blink concept''. From the New Coke flop(come on Malcolm)to a Pentagon war games excercice. The general idea of the book is: Keep a balance between the emotional and rational parts of your brain when you make a decision. But that doesn't warrant a 276 page book and absolutely not being in the top 10 on the Amazon best seller list. I want to have breakfast now....Blink...Blink... Should I or should I not? My stomach says yes. C'ya.",
            "I heard this was the great book of our time, so I had to rush out to buy it. Sucker. The only good thing I can say is the cover is catchy. The contents scare me. The author's claims are pseudoscience at its worst. Do none of us remember the laws of \"cause and effect?\" They are totally twisted here. Then twisted back. Then twisted back again. My biggest complaint is that the author needs to look up the Websters definition of \"subconscious\", a word he throws out on virtually every page. He seems to repeatedly confuse the concept of \"subconscious\" with \"experience.\" Just because someone experienced in a given field can process information faster than they can verbally articulate it, doesn't mean the information is \"subconscious.\" Conversely, just because someone lacks the education to articulate which ingredients make them prefer one strawberry jam versus another, doesn't mean the preference is subconscious. It means it's sensory. That's like saying that you can't know the sky is blue if you don't know why it's blue. Or worse, like saying if you were never taught the word \"blue\", that your eyes see it unconsciously. There are many books and magazines that, using layman's terms, give much more rigorous and justifiable theories about some of the new findings correlating brain activity and psychological studies. I've even seen many of the studies this author cites in other books. I will say the studies themselves are fun to read about and ponder independently of the author's own interpretation. It's curious that in the Afterword section added to my 2007 edition, the author seems to revise the premise of the entire book. It should be the foreword. More importantly, why do so many think this book is good? It's strongest value is in showing how sorely lacking too many are in the basic priciples of logical thinking and scientific analysis.",
            "For someone who is writing a book about the ability to suscinctly understand things without any elaboration, this author drags on his points like none I've ever seen. He puts 5 word concepts into 20 word runon sentences, just like this one, that contain extra phrases and words that really dont quite necessarily need to exist in the particular sentences when you could, if you wanted to, make them significantly smaller and much less burdensome in length. If you enjoyed reading that last sentence, you will love this book. I got about halfway through and it was a struggle to continue. I actually signed on to Amazon.com tonight purely to see if anyone else was as miserable as myself, reading this book, and I was glad to see so many were. Blink is brilliant in one sense: He put a lot of psychology into getting his book sold. He puts it in airports, he made a ghostly looking coolly designed cover, and he put enthralling teaser material on the inside of the cover. That's pretty much the only thing I was impressed by with this book. Im sure he's a nice guy but .. zzzz.",
            "The book begins with an enticing account of the power of intuition, i.e., of the \"adaptive unconscious\" to make decisions more reliably than linear, left-brain evaluation of data. The reader expects a guide to accessing this subliminal power. Instead, the author gives a series of overlong, padded accounts of cases where instant perception trumped careful data gathering, balanced by accounts of cases in which careful data gathering trumped instant perception.The reader tries in vain to see a solid connection between the episodes recounted - from \"thin-slicing\" of videotaped encounters between married couples to the benefits of a trained sensory apparatus in evaluating food and wine to the dangers to innocent bystanders when police officers jump to stereotyped conclusions about people and places. In the end, the reader is no wiser about the means of mining the \"adaptive unconscious\" than before picking up the book. The book can be summarized in two sentences: \"Sometimes the right brain is more reliable than the left brain. Sometimes the left brain is more reliable than the right brain.\"The author has provided some endnotes with useful references for the reader wanting to learn something substantive about the subjects hinted at in \"Blink.\"",
            "The reason it doesn't always work is because it isn't about guessing, it's about listening. Often when it's our first impression in a situation, we don't realize that we didn't conjure up the answer. It simply came with no mental prodding. That is, it didn't come from the mind, but through it. No doubt, that's a hard one to swallow for someone who's rigidly geared to left-brain thinking. But this is what I have come to know is the truth, and that enlightenment did not come from a science book...or \"logic.\" :)When we scramble for the answer, we are conjuring up one out of fear. Things we create from fear are generally inaccurate...and it also creates really lousy supposed \"art,\" but that's another point... When we put less thought and more \"feel\" into it, we're more likely to be accurate. When all you have is a split second, \"feel\" is all you've got. Hence, in those situations, we don't have time to muddy up the answer with our fearful thoughts, the answer will come and there's no time to analyze it and change it to a more \"logical\" answer.But if we have a few seconds or moments to think, infuse our fear and supposed logic into it, then it may seem that it was our first impression, but it wasn't. We didn't \"hear\" the first impression, because we had just enough time to jump in and be all logical, hee, hee...We've been given the keys in biblical text, \"be still and know.\" When the mind is racing with fear, it isn't still, we aren't calm. That true first impression comes before we have time to introduce that element that generally gums up the works (fear).When you do have time, get still (mind and body) and listen, don't conjure or guess, just listen. When you don't have time (split-second situations), no time to question or analyze, not even an instant for fearful guessing...when there's no question that it came without thought. Feel it, trust it, go! :) I'd trust that in a heartbeat over long, laborious, fearful thinking.Ultimately, lighten your grip on them there science books and know that there's a lot more power in your \"heart\" than you seem to realize. Your right brain/heart will serve you well. Balance it with what you seem to believe is the totality of your power (left brain), and you'll see...",

            "I am disappointed in this book and feel it has been a waist of my time and money. Unfortunately the book is poorly (if any at all) researched and relies heavily on a number of public stories that are already known and extensively debated in public media, most importantly, without drawing any useful nor new conclusion. Most of the conclusions made in the book are either common sense and already well known so it really adds no value nor offers any useful thought.The book argues that the snap judgments (called thin slicing by him) made by experts are often closer to truth than snap judgment made by amateurs but then gives contradicting stories. It then talks about the fact that humans behave unexpectedly, often irrationally , often hastily in emergency situations (e.g. police arrests, assassinations). Both of these points are common sense that are familiar to all of us. We all have experienced these situations and know that they could be true. However, what we don't know much about is whether we can learn anything to perform or prepare better for these situations. The book offers absolutely no insight nor useful thought unfortunately.The stories are all over the map, he touches, race, police brutality, fake art, coke tasting etc etc with no clear direction nor conclusion and fails to encourage any useful thought at the least.",
            "This book gave me a keener awareness of how much information is communicated through facial expressions and first impressions, and the pragmatism of learning to read and interpret them better--but little on how to do that.The book would have been enormously better if written in less than a quarter of its length. The author drones on and on with example after example, often needlessly coming back to earlier ones. This lack of conciseness contributes to a general feeling of wondering what he's trying to say--and wondering if it's really clear in his own mind. On the one hand, we should be able to size people up in an instant, and on the other, that's how we perpetuate stereotypes. It's really not until the Afterword that the author acknowledges, more straightforwardly, that a balance is not easy to learn or achieve. Only experience over time can help us get a feel for it. In the end, we're left with no really practical advice to implement in our daily lives, beyond greater awareness.At one point, I got excited, thinking some practical advice was just around the bend. We are told there exists a training tape for learning facial micro-expressions. In 35 minutes of training, one can go from seeing none of such expressions to seeing them all! \"This is an accessible skill,\" we're told. And then, end of discussion. No mention of how WE can learn from this tape (rent it, buy it, go to a seminar, employ a consultant, read a synopsis?). This is the one thing the author has built us up to want to know, and we're left with a sort of \"Gotcha!\"I found the entire Afterword to be a lazy avoidance of revising the book before reprinting. All the points made there, including too much rehashing, should be incorporated into the book itself. Both here and in the body of the book, I always had the feeling the author was still thinking--not really sure exactly where he wanted to take this book. I especially did not appreciate the tediously elaborated military examples; talk about too much information! We did not need to know every little facet that the author mused while digesting his research and mountain of anecdotes.I don't feel the little I learned was worth the time spent hanging onto the book in the hope of finding its redemption.",
            "A few years ago, Malcolm Gladwell wrote a very entertaining book,The Tipping Point. He had a central thesis, and while it was plausible, I wasn't particularly convinced. BUT Gladwell is one of the best writers around at making psychology experiments and other social science studies fascinating and accessible, so the book was interesting and fun to read.That brings us to Blink, in which Gladwell seeks to demonstrate that our split-second first impressions can be incredibly insightful but that sometimes they are not, and how we can train ourselves to move toward the insightful side. The book is not particularly convincing (even less than Tipping) on the final aspect of the thesis that we can train ourselves to do better. But along the way, he presents fascinating cases of how these snap judgments can be right on (and why they're wrong when they are). The research isn't quite as interesting as in The Tipping Point, but I was still engrossed, entertained, and instructed.For an example of a psychology writer who also makes research fascinating and accessible (and funny) but is much more convincing on his hypothesis, read the excellentStumbling on Happiness, by Harvard psychology professor Dan Gilbert. He also reads the audiobook himself and does a fantastic job.Despite my critiques, this was still good enough that I'll read whatever Gladwell gives us next.",

I am able to pick up the little warning flags that are everywhere when you look. You have to have an open mind when you read this book, or you will not get anything out of it.",
            "Gladwell supplies you with extensive research and reliable sources to convince you of something you may have experienced already.It's called a hunch, a gut feeling maybe even intuition and what's more it can be learned! At least that's what the research Gladwell points us to suggests. Like The Tipping Point he brings experts together to compile the data - his fly-on-wall approach is convincing because he doesn't offer his own opinion so much as offering evidence found by others - it makes him a credible witness. You feel as if you're along for the ride as much as he is.The premise is convincing because anyone can relate to it, but he takes it step further and suggests one can learn how to have hunches and accurate ones too. It also suggests that our intuition may be buried and just needs some coaxing out.One is left fascinated by the human mind and wondering what junk or treasure has found its way in there and if you have used your mind to its full potential. The examples and case studies are interesting and relevant keeping you hooked and wanting to know more. You feel educated and equipped, perhaps even a little academic if you're learning this stuff for the first time.Most of it is explanation rather than discovery, but it is an entertaining explanation. Once again Gladwell found a unique thread to pull on - and the unraveling is worth the read.",

In retrospect, had the Generals approached the virtual war games with open minds, instead of impenetrable egos, they may have been better equipped for the current war effort. Honestly, I think Blink allows most people an opportunity to flirt with the idea of intuition. In the end though, I think we're all simply a collection of personal experiences. And while some of those experiences prepare us for the unknown, some of them do not! And without those experiences, you may need more than simple intuition to reach a proper conclusion. While common sense goes a long way, and blinking may be fun, in the real world, I think it remains prudent to blink, but verify.",

These items are served to you in a series of diverse and instructive stories that could be useful to you in your everyday life.Most of the instruction is about positive things like how to better manage potential heart attack cases and fight wars more effectively. With regard to heart attacks, however, there was a negative story. It was about how sensation transference was used to market margarine.

            "Well, as a huge fan of Gladwell's last book, The Tipping Point, I was excited last week to finally get my hands on his new effort: Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking. This time around Gladwell's basic thesis is that often snap judgements (what he calls \"thin slicing\") can be more accurate than well researched, careful analysis. Gladwell uses many examples (most are interesting) to demonstrate this behavior such as determining when art is faked, sizing up car buyers, picking presidential candidates and determining the characteristics of a person by observing their living space. This has always been Gladwell's talent: taking just-under-the-radar topics and bringing them into the public's view through great journalism and storytelling.Gladwell is also careful to examine the flipside of this phenomenon: the times when \"thin slicing\" misleads us or gives us the wrong results. For instance, he presents examples where the mind works based on biases that don't necessarily enter the realm of conscious thought, but are nevertheless there (age, race, height, and so on).It's a great topic and Gladwell sets it up with some wonderful examples, but then the book begins to have problems. First, the book is a little too anecdotal. Anyone who has ever had a 200-level psych class knows that what looks like cause and effect may be accounted for by an independent variable that wasn't considered (e.g., concluding cancer rates are higher in some area of the country because of pollution, when in fact the area has higher smoking rates as well). Given this, I found that too often conclusions are made on basic handwaving, or that important aspects of studies are not mentioned. For instance, Gladwell describes a study were observers are asked to determine certain characteristics (such as truthfulness, consciensciousness, etc.) of students by observing their dorm rooms; but, never does he mention how exactly one would determine these characteristics of individuals in a scientific manner for comparison. Such omissions leave the reader a little less than convinced.Nevertheless, even with this flaw the first third of the book supports the thesis and makes for the usual entertaining reading; but things derail from there. The examples start to seem more peripheral: a rogue commander beating the conventional forces in a war game exercise, an artist known as Kenna who apparently should have made it big but didn't (why this example is interesting I've yet to figure out), and some rehash about coke vs pepsi from one of his older articles.By the end of the book the whole thing derails into examples that just don't seem appropriate for the topic. Sure a study of why Pepsi always does better than Coke in blind tastes tests is interesting (and you can read his article on this without buying the book on Gladwell's web site), but does a study of \"sips\" vs \"whole-can drinking\" - people prefer sweet for sips (Pepsi) - really say something about unconscious rapid cognition?One of Gladwell's greatest strengths is in recognizing interesting things, and then bringing them into conscious awareness so we actually realize these things are happening (whether it be tipping points or rapid cognition). I think he's partly achieved that in this book, but it doesn't come together the way the Tipping Point does. One gets the idea that this topic may have been better handled in an article rather than a full blown book.",
            "The mistake was too try and get all of these wild animals onto the same boat. The book a series of semi-socio-scientific articles on insight and intuition. It is not a cohesive theory.The writing is enjoyable - I read the most of it in a single plane flight. Some of the insights provide building blocks for understanding how certain professionals (people who practice a subject or skill for many years) are able to develop an additional sense about things -- gamblers, art curators, policemen. They are essentially seeing something that doesn't register at the conscious-level but provides them a gut-feel about the thing. Actually, I should say that these articles are how this MIGHT be happening - it's more speculation based on the diverse theories of a number of different researchers. Individually the stories and ideas are believable. Unfortuately, Gladwell fumbles in trying take them into some unified theory that is comprehensible let alone cohesive -- at times you wonder \"where is he going with this?\". Without that thread the indivudal beads get lost and fade into memory as clever ideas...and not much more. Without confidence in the grand idea, the individual pieces begin to feel simply exploratory. It's a shame because there are some remarkable ideas. He's a good documenter of curiousities of research (sort of like a Ken Burns is to historical things) so the storytelling is good enough for entertainment. Another reviewer likened it the addage about Chinese food, tasty but hungry an hour later. I agree. Flawed but still some interesting ideas to puzzle over.",
            "I bought the book before a flight after reading the adulatory comments on the front and back.It started well, with the premise that the subconsious forms a conclusion long before the consious mind is aware of it. I suppose it is obvious, but he makes the point well.From there things get a bit lost. Reading along I soon realised that I was nearing the end and the number of pages left for a profound and all-encompassing conclusion was rapidly diminishing.Unfortunately it never came.This is a very short book which promises much but delivers little. I hope that the author will follow up with something more worthy of the title. It is really just a collection of true stories, mostly about racial or sexual prejudice, which leave a bad taste in the mouth. Each story is drawn out as well, a little like the History Channel.I'm sure that there is a good book somewhere in this subject matter, but I can't for the life of me reconcile the reviews that this book has received (Compelling, Astonishing, Brilliant) with my experience. Maybe they only read the first chapter. Maybe I missing something.Since reading this book I have been looking around and found this one:The Genie Within: Your Subconcious Mind, how It Works And How To Use It (Paperback)Maybe this would be a better choice for this subject matter.",
            "I am a great admirer of Malcolm Gladwell's writing, having read him for years in \"The New Yorker\" and loving \"The Tipping Point,\" his earlier book. But \"Blink\" is no \"Tipping Point.\"The idea here is that people often have intuitive first impressions that are more valid and valuable than carefully considered, well-thought-out, researched conclusions. Except when they aren't, because first impressions of individuals, for example, can be clouded by (and Gladwell even discusses this) such matters as attractiveness, gender, race -- and even height (what Gladwell calls the \"Warren Harding\" error). And how are we to know when our quick-as-a-blink reaction is valid and when it isn't? Well, that's the problem with the book. Ever experienced love-at-first-sight and then realized the person wasn't really everything you thought s/he was...?This entire book flies in the face of an excellent article Gladwell wrote in 2000 called \"The New-Boy Network\" [...] about how worthless the typical job interview is (because it relies too much on gut impressions) and how \"structured interviews\" are the only worthwhile ones (an excerpt from the article: \"This interviewing technique is known as \"structured interviewing,\" and in studies by industrial psychologists it has been shown to be the only kind of interviewing that has any success at all in predicting performance in the workplace. In the structured interviews, the format is fairly rigid. Each applicant is treated in precisely the same manner. The questions are scripted. The interviewers are carefully trained, and each applicant is rated on a series of predetermined scales.\")Even examples he uses in this book are not very on-target, such as the Red/Blue military exercise he spends a considerable amount of time discussing. He implies repeatedly that the victory of the Reds was due to thin-slicing and their quick judgments, but by his own description a lot of well-thought-out strategic decisions about communications, etc., really were at the heart of the victory, not intuitive decisions made in the blink of an eye.On the other site of the intuition vs. analysis coin, a very good read is Michael Lewis's \"Moneyball.\" Central to that book, with applications well beyond its baseball setting, is the realization that the gut reactions of seasoned baseball scouts are often unreliable, being clouded by how a player looks rather than his actual on-field accomplishments. A more analytical approach has helped Oakland make the playoffs repeatedly with a salary a third (now a quarter) that of the Yankees -- and also was at the heart of general manager Theo Epstein's player moves that helped the Red Sox win the World Series.Gladwell certainly loves the social sciences, and runs all over the landscape discussing various experiments, theories, etc., but it doesn't really come together here like it did in \"The Tipping Point,\" or in many of his articles. My \"thin slice\" (as Gladwell would say): a disappointment.",
            "There are a number of writers and reporters out there who never fail to impress me with their skill in gathering and presenting information and at the same time never fail to stun me with foolish conclusions. Malcom Gladwell, whose writing graces the pages of the New Yorker, is one such writer. He is such an excellent reporter and writes such beautiful prose that his readers seem to swallow even his most dubious and unjustified conclusions.Perhaps it's simply a consequence of his narrow education, but Gladwell manages to present the grossly obvious as if it were a brilliant insight while at the same time making inferences that are just this side of nonsensical. In this he reminds me of William Greider, whose \"Secrets of the Temple\", although the best history and description of the US Federal Reserve system ever written, in full of nonsensical conclusions, i.e., that inflation helps fuel economic recoveries. Tell that to Jimmy Carter.Gladwell's earlier book, \"The Tipping Point\", postulated that various phenomena take off once a critical point has been reached. Now put that way, it sounds profoundly obvious, and it is. Ice freezes at a critical temperature. Water boils at 100C. And so on. But Gladwell also accepts, at face value, a number of sociological theories that are without theoretical base, or even data, other than some casual observations. He doesn't, for example, touch on graph theory, which &lt;em>does&lt;/em> have some bearing on the spread of phenomena.In this book, his insight is that sometimes snap judgements are better than well-thought out ones. Again I'm reminded of Samuael Johnson's comment to a writer that \"Your manuscript is both good and original. But the part that is good is not original, and the part that is original is not good.\" There is a good deal of recent research that looks at the processing between pereception and cognitive awareness, but when Gladwell touches on this he gets both his anatomy and his function wrong. Much of his discussion- like the fact that voters often choose attractive political candidates regardless of their qualifications- has more to do with factors other than the immediate perceptions he's trying to make a case for.I still often enjoy reading Gladwell in the New Yorker- his recent piece on drug prices was a fine bit of reporting, even if his conclusions were not of the same caliber. But his books don't seem to be in the same category.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell is one of the most brilliant non- fiction writers working today. He is a researcher and a thinker who looks into social phenomena and makes connections between diverse activities and areas of life in startling and interesting ways. While he is most known for the concept of ' the tipping point' I personally found his most remarkable essay to be on key figures in human social networks, and the way one individual may connect hundreds of even thousands different kinds of people together. In this present work which I have read the British edition of he writes about what he calls 'adaptive unconscious' about processes of mind and decision that determine much of our action in life. He opens with a consideration of the Getty Museum's considering the purchase of what seemed to be a great new discovery, a statue of a certain kind called a 'kourous. The Getty went to the greatest experts in scientifically evaluating the materials of the statue and they come up with it as genuine. However when the Getty showed the stature to people who live in the world of art history most of them instinctively recoiled from it. They made the kind of ' blink' split - second decision which bypassed their consciousness. They proved to be right. Gladwell goes on to consider ' thin- slicing' decision making in other areas, that is decision-making which is based on a very small set of experience. In his second chapter he looks at the work of a psychologist John Gottman who has developed a method of predicting whether a couple will eventually divorce through noting certain qualities revealed in a fifteen - minute conversation between them. Stonewalling, criticizing are two of the factors attended to but the key one is the degree of contempt one of the partners may have for another. But for Gladwell the focus is on understanding that it does not take a prolonged process of consciously investigating and collecting data but rather a quick- thin- slice evaluation to get to the truth of the situation. Gladwell investigates other kinds of situations in which in one case a firefighter, in another a Vietnam War veteran and Marine officer show a kind of instinctive ' right action' which would not be possible had they talked or thought too much at the wrong time and confused themselves in the process. Gladwell writes of very interesting characters , finds people of extraordinary abilities even when it comes to selling cars or tasting food. He centers on non- conventional figures who have in one way or another extraordinary gifts in ordinary life. In one chapter he looks at the diagnosis of heart- attacks in emergency room and shows how a method a researcher tried to push and had rejected for years has enabled quick, life- saving diagnosis. In this situation too he shows how too much information, too much conscious rehashing of data can interfere with a kind of quick- decision making a kind of ' in a blink' judgment. Here however it should be pointed out that Gladwell insists that in many areas of life it is only because there has been prior training, study, rehearsal that such wise- snap judgment is possible. All in all this is a richly informative and highly interesting work, a very pleasurable read.It will take more than one blink to read, but it will be worth it.",
            "This is one of the most fascinating books I have read in some time. The book centers on the concept of how fast we really do make judgments, called \"thin slicing\", and how deeper analysis can sometimes provide less information than more. It is all about cognitive speed.The concept of \"thin slicing\" is dissected and explained. What I found fascinating, and also common sense, is that we process information on a subconscious level, \"behind the door\", and process so holistically that to over analyze can actually hinder our ability to make decisions.Several key points are applicable in business. One of the in depth studies looked at a military leader who was particularly successful. One of his more poignant observations was that a great leader needs to let the people do their work. When deciding how often to follow up \"you are diverting them, now they are looking upward instead of downward. You are preventing them from resolving the situation\". (Page 118) Further \"allowing people to operate without having to explain themselves constantly ... enables rapid cognition\" (Page 119). It seems that most micro-management actually prevents people from successful decision making.Another strange phenomenon occurs when we try and explain how we come to some conclusions. It seems that the more we try to analyze how we come to some conclusions the less reliable they become.The ability to absorb and detect minute changes in facial expressions allows us to essentially \"read minds\" if we pay attention. There are several chapters on how reliable we can be in predicting behavior with very little information.Overall, this book is so well written that I had a hard time putting it down. My only compliant, and it is a minor one, is that the book just ends. No summary or wrap up, just \"boom\", it's over. However, that is more a testament to how engaging the book is I suppose. Highly recommended!",
            "This book suffers from numerous problems. The first is that while it claims to be about \"the power of thinking without thinking,\" this is only one of three ideas that are discussed. The failure to mention the other ideas in the title might have been acceptable if they were mentioned explicitly in the text, but it is unclear that Gladwell realizes the distinction. The second problem is that the book is made up of six distinct essays, and they have been sloppily edited to produce a book that is simultaneously disjoint and repetitive. Though perhaps the second problem is really just a symptom of the third problem, that Gladwell's style is painfully repetitive to begin with. Gladwell does not simply beat dead horses, he beats the dust into which he has reduced their carcasses. The fourth problem is that towards the end of the book Gladwell goes off on a tangent about \"situational autism\" that is both poorly motivated and very likely to offend the autistic community. And finally, rather than having an introduction and conclusion that tie the book together, these sections present whole new situations; the conclusion in particular seems largely unrelated to the rest of the book.The book has four points. First, is that the human mind has an impressive ability to process information at an unconscious level very quickly. For instance, by listening to a brief snippet of a doctor speaking, even if the recording is digitally altered so that all you can hear is the tone, you can very accurately determine whether the doctor has good bedside manner. Similarly, by watching a few seconds of a college professor's lecture, even with the sound turned off, you can make a remarkably accurate determination of whether the professor is a good lecturer.The second point is that this ability often leads us astray. Our unconscious can be shown to harbor prejudices against blacks, women, and others, and these prejudices are bad for both us and society. And on a less socially relevant note, people consistently prefer the taste of liquor that comes in fancy bottles. The book gives absolutely no advice about how to improve our unconscious's attitudes towards either minorities or conventional packaging of foodstuffs.Without explicitly mentioning it, the book points out the importance of making decisions based on relevant information, rather than large quantities of irrelevant data. The best example of this is given in the introduction. An apparently ancient Greek statue is analyzed with all sorts of fancy chemistry equipment, and the lab technicians come back and say that the marble is indeed from an ancient Greek quarry and that the surface of the marble has a chemical composition that is usually the result of centuries of weathering. On the other hand, any art historian worth his salt can tell you that the feet of the statue are carved in a style never seen in any other Greek statue. While the information from the chemists seems more concrete (their equipment costs more), the relevant fact here is the style of carving in the feet-the statue is a modern forgery.Finally, the book talks about ways to improve decision making under intense time pressure, for instance in a military engagement or police shootout. The conclusion, not surprisingly, is that practice making split-second decisions is important. Also, if you can slow down the pace of the engagement in order to allow yourself more time, you should do so, but if slowing down gives your opponents a greater advantage, you shouldn't.If you have made it through this review, there is certainly no need to read the book. Every idea Gladwell had has been summarized and clarified here. Which should really make you wonder how he stretched the book past 20 pages, let alone 200!",
            "One anecdotal story after another with a weak conclusion (which was yet another anecdotal story) attempting to tie it all up left me flat. Here's my summary: All you need to know is \"Don't judge a book by its cover.\" well... unless you're an expert of some sort. In that case, you can trust your initial reaction, because you're probably right. Well... unless you've paid attention to the wrong things... in which case you are proabably wrong. So, Don't judge a book by its cover - ESPECIALLY THIS BOOK!! You will see it on the bestseller list and assume it is worth reading (as The Tipping Point arguably was) rather than a weak, seemingly rushed attempt to ride on the coattails of his earlier success.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell is a \"gatekeeper.\" In his book, Blink, he opens the gate to a room of self-discovery - a room that allows the reader, perhaps for the first time, to realize that our actions and judgments often are not as \"objective\" as we might think. Mr. Gladwell, through a series of examples and stories, explains that we each have our own \"programming\" - dare I say \"prejudices\" - about how we (and the cultures we grow up in) judge and respond to things we \"see\" and \"know to be true\".He also says there are other more benign, untainted impressions that come to us in the \"blink\" of an eye. About these untainted impressions he says: \"We don't know where our first impressions come from or precisely what they mean, so we don't always appreciate their fragility.\" Implicitly he suggests that we also don't realize how powerful our \"programming\" is to potentially override and taint those benign and fragile first impressions.Mr. Gladwell provides examples of what some people have done to preserve their \"blink\" experiences and offset their \"pre-programming\" - a fun read - I recommend it.As I was reading through the book, I was reminded of two other books (both of which I highly recommend) by Ariel and Shya Kane. In Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation and Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment, the authors include discussions of human mechanical behaviors - behaviors we absorb from our families and cultures at an early age. They point out that we are mostly unaware of these mechanics and until we become aware of them, they can influence and even \"control\" our behavior and life choices - very eye-opening and easy to read as well!All three of these books are well worth reading - enjoy!",
            "Having read \"Outliers\" and \"The Tipping Point\" I was excited to start \"Blink\". That excitement quickly subsided. The book starts out great. Gladwell does a great job of drawing the reading in an capturing their attention. The problem appears to be that he doesn't know what to do with the reader's attention once he has it. His other two books kept me hooked from cover to cover. This one lost me halfway through. Some of the examples he brings up in the book seem out of place to say the least. He also skips around a lot from example to unrelated example trying to make his point. By then end of the book, I wasn't even sure what his point was. I would definitely recommend \"Outliers\" and \"The Tipping Point\"; however, don't waste your money on \"Blink\".",
            "I'm not someone who reads a whole lot, and I hadn't read but one book book cover to cover in over two years until I heard about Blink. The book focuses on how people unconsciously know much more than they give their brain credit for, and that the unconscious is qutie good at picking up on subtle signals and processing them very quickly. The key to harnessing the unconscious is not only know when to use it, but also recognize when ingrained yet unjustified biases interfere with our otherwise sound snap judgment. I read it at my leisure in only a couple weeks and really enjoyed it. I had read Gladwell's The Tipping Point and it really made me think. That prompted me to investigate further into Gladwell's writing. Blink made me excited about reading again, which is something I never thought I'd say. As soon as I finished this book, I went out immediately and bought Gladwell's What The Dog Saw and can't wait to start reading that. This book is definitely worth your time. Gave me insight into areas ranging from the power of \"thin-slicing\" in order to predict the overall longevity of marriages all the way to examining how the perceptions from the autistic person's point of view can give us better insight into our own minds.",
            "Gladwell is one of the best at integrating massive amounts of research into easy to understand themes that are transformational. Blink is a great example of how he helps us understand how we think.",
            "The book was a good quick read. He has an easy writing style, but tended to dwell on points a bit too long for my tastes.In general he sought to discuss the power of thin-slicing situations. He successfully showed how its something everyone does subconsciously; sometimes to our advantage otherwise not as much. He includes a plethora of examples when \"first impressions\" save us misery, give us superior insight but contrasts them with examples of the opposite. He had also set out, according to his introduction, to discuss how to hone one's \"thin slicing\" ability, but here he fell short. The book had a very abrupt ending.",
            "Before purchasing this novel I had read Outliers and enjoyed the book so much I decided to pick up Blink. Gladwell's prose is very clean and straightforward, which leads to a quick and interesting read. Blink did have some intriguing chapters but as a whole, the book left much to be desired.The author attempts to elucidate how our subconscious quickly makes decisions in a real time environment. Further, the author draws the conclusion that more often than not we should trust our instincts and our ability to \"thin slice\". However, the book lacks the execution that is characteristic of his later novels.I would recommend this book to those who are interested in psychology because some areas contain merit and this book may be more attractive to those who are in the field.",
            "Awesome book!! Have read The Tipping Point and the Outliers by Malcolm McDowell as well and they are all excellent. He writes in a way that holds you from page one and reads like a fascinating novel. Blink is my favorite as it is amazing food for thought, insightful and makes you look at things in a whole different way. I've recommended this book to many people.",
            "I enjoyed Blink's concept which is based on a theory someone can learn in a psychology course. Basically, the author states that people can make snap decisions that are just as good as thought out decisions. The rational is that the human leverages the knowledge is learned throughout their life and subconsciously processing these decisions without knowing. I am not sure if I completely buy into this theory however, the author provides back-up to reinforce his points. I think this book would be an interesting read for some and should be considered if you are looking for something different to read.",
            "This is a very interesting book. With his characteristic easy-going style the author examines the first two seconds of human observation. He refers to them as intuition or snap- judgments first and later as intuition. The book is well articulated as he explores different parts of this phenomenon through different chapters. He states that there is a sophisticated unconscious process that takes place whenever we are facing a situation in which we are required to take action. This process is much faster than our conscious thought and rationalization process, he points out that this ability it is related with a particular area of the brain's frontal cortex located behind the nose. He points out experiments in which patients with brain damage were unable to choose between two sets of alternatives with their pros and cons detailed laid out by themselves.Gladwell also points out that there are many unconscious associations that are transmitted to us by our environment. Moreover, he asks the reader to engage on some exercises and test throughout the book in order to experience this and other assertions made by him. One direct implication of the previous is that our unconscious process can be educated or trained. Another implication is that these implicit associations may bias our intuition which reveals that our intuition can also lead us to make mistakes. Still this doesn't mean that we must only use our conscious rational thinking process as the only way to solve problems as data can also fools us. Worse, having extensive data won't necessarily protect us as too much data can prevent us from seeing the forest because of the trees. Information or knowledge means nothing if there is not any understanding of what these information means. Our \"intuition\" works with understanding, understanding requires a lot of preparation, education and experience, the alternative is just making random choices.Understanding translates into \"good\" judgment and \"good\" judgment into good decisions. In situation in which we are overwhelmed by information, variables and intricate consequences \"intuition or judgment\" is found by Gladwell to be better at making the call that our traditional conscious logic and verbal analysis, which ironically has proven far superior for making simple decisions.The book ends with a reflection and a call to action. Both methods of taking decisions have their strengths and weaknesses; there is no panacea but a need for balance between these two methods. Moreover the observations made on this book are here to stay, but now that we have this knowledge about the human decision process, how are we going to use this knowledge to overcome the current deficiencies that we as a society have when taking decisions.Along the book there is a Gladwell signature everywhere, the language is clear and direct, the message is relevant. Gladwell is not trying to construct a classical scientific theory, but to transmit his observations as directly and clearly as possible. In short , a fine reading.",
            "Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell is an influential book that analyzes the decision making process in humans. The first part of the book deals with unconscious decision making. The book thoroughly describes the experiment done by a psychologist. He records the conversation of couples and can tell if they are going to be together in a few years or not. The psychologist analyzes different reactions of the partners and can tell if everything is right or something is going wrong. By doing this study for a long time he has come up with \"four horseman\" that can give information about a relationship. They are defensiveness, stonewalling, criticism and contempt. Even by listening to a couple's conversation for 30 seconds he can tell if they are going to make it or not. It is also important to stress the fact that none of the partners know themselves how they react.Then the author goes in more detail on unconscious decision making. The author believes that sometimes we are better off by making snap decisions then making decisions based on too much information. He uses the example of The Pentagon strategy game to illustrate this idea. The Blue Team representing United States that had an enormous system of information and The Red Team representing a rouge country that was very limited in information and communication. Despite these differences, the Red Team won because they used snap decisions made in the field while the Blue team was lost in the huge amount of information it had. Oftentimes we believe that what we think is free will but in fact it is our unconscious that is doing everything for us. As the author says : \" Much of the time we are operating on automatic pilot.\"Then the Gladwell also talks about the downs side of quick judgment. We often judge people by their appearance and this can lead to a wrong conclusion. Warren Harding was a tall dark skinned man that imposed authority and respect. People voted him to become president of the United States because of these attributes while overlooking other most important elements required in a president. He came to be one of the worst presidents in the United States history.Up to this point the author seemed to be contradicting himself. Should we trust our gut feeling or not? Our first impressions may seem that snap decisions come from nowhere, but in fact our unconscious is making these very fast decisions based on our experience and on the environment we live in. By changing our experiences we can change our first impression judgments. So the core idea of the book is that we should trust our snap decisions and that experience improves our instant thinking. We should often make decisions based on our first impressions if we have a good amount of experience.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell has a reputation of integrating researches and studies into his books. Blink definitely followed the same path. The opening story of the Getty museum is compelling and leading to a question of the reliability of snap judgment or in the first two seconds. Malcolm argued that the first two seconds is very important when it comes to making a decision. Too much information and data often overwhelm and cloud the real truth that he/she is looking for.Though, the first two second rule does not always apply as Gladwell cautioned in his book which he called the Warren Harding error. Because human brains are pre-conditioned by individual experience, we often make our snap judgment based upon our past experiences whether or not we are conscious about it; so snap judgment can sometime be wrong and unreliable.The conclusion of a good judgment as point out in his book is that experiences play an important role in order to be able to rely on one's snap judgment. People usually misinterpreted their own feeling and did not say what they really felt and it became a big problem when we started relying on a market research data that contains misinterpreted information of such group.In time of overwhelmingly massive information at our fingertips, Blink is a great book that reminds us of our conditional snap judgment and the problem of too much information in making everyday decisions. It is a norm now before buying something that you have to google the product, read the reviews online, comparing the product with other choices and exhaust any available information before deciding not to buy one. We spend too much time and read too much information that ends up clouding our thought and real feeling. Blink tells you to consciously listen to your intuitive, together with organized information; you will have the power of thinking without thinking.",
            "I didn't expect much when I started BLINK. Then only a few pages in, as Gladwell is describing the manner in which a University of Washington professor is able to tell with 90% accuracy if a couple will divorce based on 5 MINUTES of speaking with them based on snap judgments, I WAS HOOKED. I spent the majority of the three days I took to read the book periodically stopping and then reading allowed passages to anyone who would listen.Although Gladwell covers a wide range of scenarios from music, to relationships, to merchandising, to police brutality, to prejudice, everything was well connected through the theme of how our snap judgments affect even the smallest portions of our lives. Two seemingly random scenarios were illuminated and connected in ways I might never have thought.I walked away from BLINK hoping that I could take his advice and that by being aware of my snap judgments I could hope to have a deeper understand my subconscious. Although I feel that I may never really understand my own snap judgments, it was wonderful while reading this book to at least begin to 'try.'",
            "Are you interested in how the mind works? Do you ever wonder why people do what they do? Do you like reading short case studies of interesting historical events? Do you have to make quick decisions under pressure? Are you interested in music, art, politics, or psychology? If your answer is yes to any of the above, this book is for you!This book was recommended to me by one of my professors in my MSW program. I have been wanting to read it since then and just barely picked it up from the library. Because I had high expectations, I was worried that I would be let down. I am happy to report that I was not!This book is well organized as the author takes you through various case studies and research experiments. The logic was easy of me to follow and his style of writing kept me entertained. More than once I stopped in the middle of a chapter to write down a term, person, or website to look up online. This is a book I could enjoy reading over and over again. Indeed, for me to fully grasp the concepts, I plan to re-read it when I have more time to ponder the ideas and someone to discuss it with. This would make an excellent choice for a book club.",
            "I didn't care for this book much--certainly not as much as I did the author's previous Tipping Point. This one seemed no more than a bunch of magazine articles strung together, with no over-arching vision or even a unifying thesis.Ostensibly, it's about the power of the unconscious in judgment. But there's no Freud in there (neither Siggie nor Anna) except an interesting quote that a reader of the first edition sent him that Gladwell stuffed into the \"Afterward.\" There's also no Butler (who wrote several books on unconscious memory--including one entitled Unconscious Memory) and no William James, who discusses the nature and power of unconscious thought very interestingly in Varieties of Religious Experience as well as in his massive Psychology. In fact, Gladwell doesn't seem very widely read in this subject at all: he just goes the interviewer route here, talking to loosely connected \"experts\" from a wide variety of fields (from battle strategy to auditioning violinists) and then making a half-hearted effort to pull their comments together--all with no any cohesive theory.Sometimes the \"blink judgment\" is desirable (as when a tennis pro can tell when a server will double fault on his next serve or when an art historian can tell a fraud immediately with little or no examination). At other times it may only result in discrimination against female musicians or black pedestrians. But Gladwell knows neither when it should be trusted, nor how it knows what he thinks it sometimes knows. These are issues that have been studied for the last couple of hundred years, yet Gladwell doesn't cite a single source in his book and doesn't seem to have read a very much on the topic.But well, why should he? It reads quickly and is a best-seller anyways. Besides, Gladwell's got his next golden goose to think about....",
            "My waking eyes have been opened to what my subconscious has already seen . . . This book brought to light the fact that our subconscious operates at a much faster speed than our conscious minds and that it's our conscious that often trips us up during problem solving. I think this notion aligns perfectly with suggestions promoted many leaders such as, \"go with your heart,\" and \"trust your instincts.\" Overall, I thought is was a great read!",
            "I am a big Malcolm Gladwell fan. He has a way of weaving very dry, scientific material into great stories in which you learn not only what he's intending to advocate, but also about miscellaneous, interesting topics. In short, you become a great guest at cocktail parties because you have fun topics to chat about with other people.He's tough to recommend, though, since the subject matter can be a bit dry and bog down at times. I am also sometimes challenged by the leaps he makes that A automatically equals, or leads to, B, without giving me more support for why. But, I still enjoyed the book (although enjoyed The Tipping Point a bit more). All in all, very interesting, though.",
            "I really enjoyed Malcolm Gladwell's first book, Tipping Point. He offered some significant insights in this book, and because of this, the book became a blockbuster big seller. I wish I could say the same thing about his second effort, Blink. Don't get me wrong, Blink is interesting. But at best, Blink should have been a long article in the New Yorker, not a whole book. If Gladwell had not been so successful with Tipping Point, I doubt that this book would have received the accolades that it did.Blink discusses the age-old concept that first impressions are lasting impressions. Gladwell spends a significant amount of time looking at the science behind first impressions, including the fact that most first impressions are made sub-consciously. But he spends so much time on the science behind this theory, that the book becomes uninteresting, and he feels it necessary to make his point in numerous ways. I've talked to people who have read this book, and they all say that they loved it. When asked what they loved about it, the readers find it difficult to recall any distinctive take-aways.All I can say is that I knew Tipping Point, and this is no Tipping Point. You can read this one, and it won't be a waste of time, but I doubt you will walk away saying you loved this book.",
            "The blink of an eye only takes a moment, as does the making of a first impression. Sometimes first impressions are incorrect, but my fantastic first impression of Blink by Malcom Gladwell, the best selling author of The Tipping Point, could not have been more spot-on. Gladwell's use of specific stories and case studies opens the reader's eyes to the possibility of the mysterious subconscious and the effect of subliminal thoughts on judgment.Included studies address the causes of discrimination and autism, successful relationships, police experience, and human fraud-detectors for artwork. Each topic goes into a different detail of the subconscious. Discrimination is generally not on purpose, but studies find that it is inevitable in the world that we live in. Society's general views of a race or gender are engraved in our minds to the point that we are not even aware that the thoughts occur with every person we meet. Human fraud-detectors for artwork have studied pieces of art with such intensity that they can tell a sculpture is fake by glancing at the fingers. Gladwell also goes into Ekman's famous studies on facial expressions and expertly explains how faces naturally give away genuine emotion in the blink of an eye.Gladwell's Blink was a joy to read and I am a strong advocate for everyone reading this book. Now, after reading Blink, I actually think about my immediate judgments of people and try to be more open when meeting someone for the first time. Gladwell's novel is mind-changing and I believe that Blink can benefit anyone who is willing to read it.",
            "A very interesting book that can help you learn to trust your own decision making processes. Teens often try to blame their behavior on other things or people. One of my favorites is, \"I blacked out and didn't know what I was doing.\" While we are all responsible for our actions, our brains can go on automatic pilot from time to time. With this phenomenon laid out, we can learn to control our thinking a bit more than the average person who seems to always fly on auto. Also, Gladwell discusses intuition quite a bit and how if we listen to our deepest self, our decision making can really improve.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell has written yet another thought-provoking book. In Blink he postulates that often our first impressions or gut instincts are more likely to lead us to the the correct decision than if we spent a long time gathering information and weighing out the pros and cons of the particular situation. In other words, you should \"trust your gut\" In trademark Gladwell fashion he uses many entertaining stories and case studies to illustrate his points, while at the same time cautioning against trusting your first impressions too much. I don't think his arguments are as well articulated as those in The Tipping Point, but I'll leave that up to the individual reader to decide for themselves.My previous complaints about Gladwell's organization, and the repetition of his writing are still valid. I find reading the beginning of one of his chapters to be a very enjoyable experience, but by mid-chapter I usually find the going excruciatingly slow, and by the end I feel as if I've been wandering around the desert for days, and have finally found my way back to civilization.Despite these minor flaws, at the end of his books I always find myself excited as to what his next project might be, and eager to share his insights with others.",
            "This book was fascinating... Malcolm Gladwell can sure tell a good story and run a persuasive and provocative argument. As I was reading, I had some concerns about the implications, particularly about stereotypes and marketing, but Gladwell not only addressed them, but put them in a deeper context. An insightful read!However...I did get the uncomfortable sense that there may be studies or examples out there that did not agree with Gladwell's hypothesis, and that he just ignored them. I assumed he just cherry-picked the studies that would help his case. I also couldn't figure out enough ways to apply this personally to my own life and my own actions.Ultimately I am a very practical person, and I want to know what to DO with the information, not just have random facts floating around in my brain somewhere. I also was concerned about the marketing implications of this book, even after Gladwell's discussion.",
            "In a book as research-rich as this one, I expected the writing to be \"scholarly\" and dense -- the opposite was true! I was surprised to find Gladwell's writing to be accessible and easy to read. I do wish there were more of a take-away, though -- is the conclusion to trust your gut because it's founded in conclusions drawn from data? Or not to trust your gut, because it can be wrong? Or only trust your gut if you're an expert? Not sure. But I'll trust my gut and recommend this book.",
            "Blink explains that.I love this book because it explains how I think and it will explain how you think and how you come up with brilliant insights into truth.This is a book about intuitiveness but not about the \"woo-woo\" kind of intuitive thinking many books describe.While not a scientific treatise on how thoughts work or are created, it explains in detail how flashes of brilliance and deep understanding without explanation work and why.You'll find yourself having many aha moments throughout this book and you'll find yourself really thinking.This is a book for thinkers . . . as well as those who'd like to think better.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's *Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking* is a fascinating and quick read, saturated with studies and statistics and stories about how our (subconscious) mind works.Blink takes us into that paradoxical realm where quickness in judgment (\"in the blink of an eye\") can be amazingly accurate and we, at a conscious level, don't even know why. The opening story about the Getty museum ancient artifact hijacks your attention. You're caught in Gladwell's grip for the rest of the book.I like books of this kind because they stretch our thinking and even reverse the settled results of popular conclusions and myths. You meet some unusual characters in the book like Paul Van Riper and John Gottman, Abbie Conant and Paul Ekman. (Each of these are tied to some amazing stories about our thinking processes.)The chapter titled \"Seven seconds in the Bronx\" is worth the price of the book (or read it at your public library for free). It's this chapter which launched my imagination into the Bible's references to \"the face,\" whether human or God's. The Bronx story is about tragedy in space of 7 seconds. Yet, the last story of the chapter, about a human encounter in the space of perhaps 1.5 seconds, relieves the tension you feel. 'Nuff said.Gladwell is also the author of *The Tipping Point.*",

EXCELLENT!It is a little of everything I guess and while pattern matching neural nets and experience are plausible, there is something more, I am sure. Is it soem spiritual source or theunexplained quantum physical ability of our brain?Intriguing thoughts indeed. A very enjoyable novel that builds on those concepts and made me wonder is 'Journey To Eden' by Max Pucher. Not for everyone but very courageous ideas.",
            "This is an excellent pamphlet that has been expanded to book length. It is unfortunate that at about half-way the author begins repeating concepts previously presented.

If, after reading the first half of this book, you do not think about how you think, you are not thinking!",
            "This book is a great read. We are reading this book as a team and every manager has learned something. I highly recommend this book! I thought it was a little slow at first, but then it took off and I am very pleased.",
            "Do you believe that your snap decisions are better than those you worry about, mull over, and even lose sleep over? Malcolm Gladwell does, and this book is his defence of that idea.Gladwell is a superb writer, and even if you find yourself questioning some of his evidence, you will learn a lot from \"Blink.\" He has amassed material from a huge range of sources to give you insights into police work, art fraud, speed-dating, firefighting, classical music, marriage counselling ... the list is enormous. The author's gift is finding a common element in seemingly unrelated areas, as he did so effectively in his previous best-seller, \"The Tipping Point.\" In \"Blink,\" that common element is that people make better decisions, he believes, if they follow their intuition and decide quickly, rather than weighing up every facet of a problem and taking a long time to decide.I largely agree with his theory. But the reason it works may be that most of the examples he gives are of people who know their subject inside out because they have had so much experience or training in it. His first example tells how an art fakebuster felt there was a problem with an ancient sculpture that a museum was considering buying. All the tests showed the sculpture was ancient, but the fakebuster's first hunch that it was a fraud turned out to be right. I suspect it was not so much the snap decision that was the key, but the years of experience in art fraud the fakebuster's subconscious was relying on.Nevertheless, this is an interesting book. Not quite up to \"The Tipping Point\" standard, but well worth reading anyway. If it does nothing else, it will probably convince you that faster decisions are at least no worse than slow decisions. And that will save you time and stress.",
            "Popularizing scientific research is always a dicey game. Gladwell does it better than many, especially in the complicated arena of cognitive science. He oversimplifies things, but he has a knack for looking at the human/social consequences of whatever it is he's discussing.BLINK promotes some pop-psych stereotypes I wish he'd dealt with more cogently. That applies in particular to his imprecise use of terms relating to the distinction between what we are aware of and what goes on in that 80+% of our brains that we don't have explicit ('conscious') access to. I guess I would have liked some more neural science here. But keep I remind myself that it is a book intended for a mostly non-scientific audience; and maybe one has to tone down the science-speak these days, for the sake of broadening the spectrum of those buying the book, who would otherwise not have bothered.All in all an excellent and worthwhile piece of popular science, tackling what is a difficult subject and showing clearly that, as with all things, the powers of our minds always hold as much promise as danger.Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, CONTINUITY SLIP, SELADIENNE",

            "I'm surprised by all of the glowing reviews here. Unfortunately for me I suppose, this book was my introduction to Malcolm Gladwell. Wasn't impressed.As another reviewer noted already, the idea was good in theory, but apparently very difficult to approach in practice. There were far too many anecdotes (some of which dreadfully recounted the procedures of quantitative research... an absolute snore-fest), and to top it off, some of the points CONTRADICTED each other to the point where one just couldn't be sure what he was arguing for anymore. Judging from this book alone, Gladwell reminds me of one of those college professors that looks good on paper and in person, but doesn't say very much anything at all. That one obnoxious tenured professor who reads directly from PowerPoint slides and then expects her/his demonstration of lazy thinking to pass for good teaching.If you're the type of reader that recoils from the idea of using indirect--possibly irrelevant and tangential--anecdotes to make an argument, then you'll probably, at the very least, strongly dislike this little number (**SPOILER: the example that immediately comes to mind--although I'm sure there are better ones--is when he talks about the quantitative data overload suffered by the Blue Team versus the ingenious invention of the valid and reliable heart condition survey administered in Cook County). As a side note--though no less critical a point--I also found problematic the fact that he doesn't even DESCRIBE or DEFINE in any considerable detail the nebulous and highly contested term, \"unconscious.\" He just sort of takes it for granted that we all have one and use it in the same way, and on a regular basis. Again, lazy thinking.I hate giving books lousy reviews because I know from personal experience how difficult drafting a book can be. However, I would be remiss if I didn't suggest to potential readers of this book (especially the ones that are thinking about making a purchase) that there is definitely better material out there (and for FREE, no less). Just run a key search on Google Scholar and you'll find a plethora of material on this subject and related issues that are more thoroughly parsed out than the half-hearted attempt of this book. College graduates will probably know this fact all too well.",

            "The author, who previously wrote The Tipping Point, a book about the spread of ideas and fads, takes us on a fascinating discussion and exploration of how we make snap decisions and how effective our first impressions and decisions can be.Through a wide variety of examples Gladwell helps us see how we can be better decision makers in all parts of our lives without necessarily collecting more data, but rather by focusing on the most important information.The author writes in the introduction, \"I believe - and I hope that by the end of the book that you will believe as well - that the task of making sense of ourselves and our behavior requires that we acknowledge there can be as much value in a moment as there is in fourteen months of rational analysis.\"I can think of several reasons to read this book, among them:- You read and loved the The Tipping Point.- You think the premise is interesting.- You want to be among the first to read what I believe is destined to be one of the most talked about books this year.Any of these are good reasons. This book is interesting, well researched and extremely well written. I recommend it highly.",
            "\"I didn't like his face.\"It's an apocraphal story of Abraham Lincoln and a favorite for preachers everywhere. As a young lawyer, Lincoln allegedly once rejected a prospective employee on the grounds that he didn't like the man's face. When his fellow lawyers incredulously pressed him to explain, Lincoln responded that every man older than 40 deserves their face.In his latest offering, Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, Malcolm Gladwell examines the snap judgements we make every day and our own inability to understand what prompts us to make them. From the experts who had a vague intuition that an artwork was a fake--an intuition that was later confirmed--to the rest of us, who will choose one product over another because of the packaging and context in which we see it, subconscious judgements affect every aspect of our existence, including race.Much of Gladwell's work does focus on the fact that these snap judgements can be trained, which often separates the expert from the rest of us. When music industries heard Kenna sing, they knew he was special. The rest of us, though, are still catching on. Yet there is one qualification to this: in one study regarding our responses to jam, college students and experts ranked six jams nearly the same. However, when a different set of college students was asked to describe their reasons for their preferences, the similarities went away. \"By making people think about jam,\" Gladwell writes, \"[the study] turned them into jam idiots.\" Sometimes, our unreflective judgements are the most reliable.To draw a parallel, it seems Gladwell demonstrates what deconstructionists have contended with respect to literature: that the unconscious perceptions of authors shape their texts and meanings. Rather than descend into the world of suspicion, however, Gladwell repeatedly exhorts the reader to have charity toward the subjects of his examples.Like The Tipping Point, Blink could have been 75 pages shorter. But Gladwell's style is engaging and readable, which makes the repetition somewhat more bearable. Regardless, Gladwell has produced a provocative analysis of a difficult and intriguing aspect of the human experience.",
            "The book tells of how there are people who know, but dont really know how they know. The stories/cases that are presented in the book about snap judgements are interesting. Gets a little to technical in a few cases, particularly the part about reading faces. It doesnt leave you with a sense of \"hey, I can do that too\", just makes you think \"oh, ok, well thats nice\"",

            "This is the author of \"The Tipping Point\" and Blink is about how we make choices, decisions, impressions in a blink of an eye with some doing it very well and others not so well. How some people can go with their \"instincts and win while others stumble into error\". Gladwell tosses on it head the notion about waiting to get all of the information necessary, making analysis before making decisions. Whether one is looking at great or fake art, the reasons why \"New Coke\" failed miserably or why police make split-second decisions that can be horribly wrong or predicting a professional tennis serve in or out or whether a marriage would succeed or fail was fascinating.Gladwell writes of a concept called, `thin-slicing' or `the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behavior based on very narrow slices of experience.' Whether one is concerned about marriage, suing a doctor, marketing, speed dating, taste tests, electing a president, pop music or `listening with your eyes', this book is fascinating and has a lot to say to us about our decisions, our context, our environment, our experience and how we process information in a moment, make impressions and make decisions.This book will change the way you.......",
            "Some very interesting case studies. Some very obvious (not so interesting) case studies. Decent writing. Overall, worth the read (or, as in my case, the listen-to).

Blink is like several NYM pieces strung together, not fully satisfying for the stringing, but entertaining enough, and occasionally thought-provoking.",
            "Looks like a lot of people have written reviews, so there is no need to comment on the content in detail. I especially enjoyed the unabridged audio book. I istened while commuting mornings and evenings, even though I commute pre-dawn and after sunset in the winter --something harder to do with a book. Some comment that the \"science\" may be flawed; I don't really care if it is or isn't. For me, the basis of enjoyment is to consider a lot of what goes on in my business and social life, a new way to think about what is really going on.The problem of using the audio version is that you can't stop and listen to just a sentence or two again and again (at least not on my MP3 player). The advantage of the audio version is that I stopped thinking like the student compelled to put those bright yellow marks over everything deemed important, and I could listen for the broader concepts. After all, I am not going to be tested on who did what experiments, or if the psychology is sound. I'm listening to this book to expand my own range of thinking.I enjoyed it thoughly, and now want a tangible copy to keep in my office bookshelf for easy reference.At first I thought that the voice would be monotonous and would lull me into a bored stupor. But, the narrator does a fine job of voice inflection, emphasis, and pace change. You can tell when he is moving from anecdote to concept presentation to summarization pretty easily.

The author quotes from relevant research and it does made me wonder how much control my sub conscious actually has over me.The narration for the audiobook is by the author and is read in a matter of fact and conversational way, which is easy on the ears.A must read if you loved Freakanomics and/or The Wisdom of Crowds since I feel the book belongs to same genre.",
            "Book Review submitted by: Stephen J. Hage, SteveH9697@aol.comGladwell is able to take complex situations and reduce them to ideas and concepts that cut through the complexity to reveal an incredibly simple structure. And, it's that structure that becomes the focus for not only wading through but ultimately being able to understand what's \"really\" going on.He revealed that ability with his first book, The Tipping Point and carried it through in writing blink.In trying to understand what blink is about Gladwell explains it best:\"It's a book about rapid cognition, about the kind of thinking that happens in the blink of an eye. When you meet someone for the first time, or walk into a house you are thinking of buying, or read the first few sentences of a book, your mind takes about two seconds to jump to a series of conclusions. Well, Blink is a book about those two seconds, because I think those instant conclusions that we reach are really powerful and really important and, occasionally, really good.\"We're taught early on that the right way to make a decision is to gather as much information as possible and carefully weigh all the pros and cons. But sometimes, there just isn't enough time or information. Other times there's just too much of it. Those are the kinds of situations blink is about; situations like war, street shootings and dealing with things that appear to be something they are not.Gladwell's approach is lucid and satisfying. His style is conversational and avuncular.The subject is serious but the read is comfortable and easy. And, when you finish it you truly will have learned something valuable and useful.Read blink and I promise you won't be disappointed or sorry you did.",
            "I was looking forward to reading Blink. The combination of an interesting topic and critical acclaim had me excited.The first few chapters of Blink were moderately intriguing. Gladwell seemed to be getting at the point that thin-slicing (drawing instantaneous conclusions subconsciously) is both powerful and accurate. Then the book starts to wander though and the reader is presented with many examples of thin-slicing being incorrect and even deadly. Gladwell then wraps it up (sort of) by offering that sometimes thin-slicing yields correct conclusions and sometimes it yields incorrect conclusions. Really? That seems like a trivial thesis and one that I probably didn't need to read 300 pages to reach. The material in this book could have been parsed significantly and served as the basis of an article, with greater final effect than this book.Although there are some good stories along the way, I doubt many readers will find it hard to put this book down at points. Those that truly enjoy it will probably do so more for the anecdotes than because it offers any deep insight.",
            "As it's title suggests `Blink' is essentially about what happens within those first few seconds of meeting someone new. Reading the book, we quickly learn that first impressions are more important than we realize.Gladwell uses stories as diverse as dating scenes and military maneuvers to show us just how powerful a first impression is and then shows us how we can use this to our advantage.For a job seeker in particular, this can be a very powerful tool. Knowing how to give the right first impression can make an astounding difference to how successful we are in job interviews and life in general.Danny InyAuthor of the free eBook \"Forget Everything You Know About Looking For a Job...

            "Although I found \"blink\" engrossing, Gladwell's talent as a writer often lets him get away with murder. The distinctions he makes sometimes seem arbitrary, particularly if one takes just a little more than 2 seconds to mull things over. Some of his extrapolations not only seem unjustified but mislead. For example, in his discussion of malpractice, Gladwell urges his patients to find their doctors \"wanting\" if they appear not to be listening or talking down. But the research on which Gladwell bases his malpractice discussion simply found a correlation between this sort of behavior and a physician's likelihood of being sued. There was no discussion of whether the physicians who were sued more frequently when this sort of behavior was present also had delivered less appropriate care with any greater frequency. While many of us would prefer a doctor who takes the time to listen, we also want a competent doctor. Would it necessarily be wise to pass up a doctor with an excellent clinical reputation simply because he/she was a cold fish? In a discussion about hospital emergency departments, Gladwell asserts that \"what screws up doctors when they are trying to predict heart attacks is that they take too much information into account.\" He bases this conclusion on research performed in the 1970s that produced an algorithm for determining heart attacks that considered far less data than traditional methods of diagnosis and was far more accurate and safe. What seems obvious, however, is that the algorithm worked better not because it required less information but rather because it had identified the right information to use. And the algorithm had been developed after only \"feeding hundreds of cases into a computer\", so there also appears to have been nothing intuitive about which data would prove to be the best data to use in assessing the likelihood of heart attack. Gladwell ends his Afterword with the suggestion that, given the demonstrated bias against black defendants in criminal trials, \"the accused shouldn't be in the courtroom\" and \"should answer all questions by e-mail or through the use of an intermediary.\" In this manner, the jury's and judge's bias would be mitigated. Constitutional issues aside, if juries and judges are on average (at least unconsciously) biased against black defendants, why shouldn't those same biases affect jury and judge perceptions of black witnesses? Do we also need to remove all witnesses from the courtroom? But after having removed all witnesses and defendants from the courtroom, how much potentially valuable information is lost by the inability to view witness and defendant (if the defendant chooses to take the stand) facial and body language of the sort that Gladwell earlier in the book asserts is so meaningful? Has one type of injustice been \"solved\" in exchange for creating the possibility of many more? My gut tells me that figuring out how to remedy courtroom racial bias is going to require more thinking than blinking.",
            "Let me being this by saying that reading Malcolm Gladwell's books are always a pleasure; he constructs his works like a documentary film, and that makes the complex topics he writes about both engrossing and more approachable. If a reader were to read only the first half of this book, they may have a more positive impression of this book then it is worthy of.However, this book is an utter disappointment because it never reaches a conclusion. I feel like Mr. Gladwell started this book in support of the unconscious mind as a powerful, accurate decision making force; and as he researched further, grew less sure of this position, until near the end of the book he warns us against relying on the unconscious At the very end, it's apparent that the author doesn't really know where he stands on this topic, and in the afterward, the reader is ping-ponged back and forth as Mr. Gladwell argues with himself.His final conclusion that he leaves us with--that juries should not be allowed to view a defendant in person--flies in the face of other research that he presents earlier in the book--that the unconscious mind is able to pick up on \"micro-expressions\" that reveal obscured emotions and motivations.Mr. Gladwell is clearly unable to make a decision on this topic, and that only leaves his readers ultimately confused.",

Most readers take from the book that we can make decisions within a couple seconds and that can be more accurate than taking weeks or months to study the situation. Often it boils down to experience. At the same time, the book talks about how wrong our initial impressions can be, because of bias, stereotypes, and pressure.So the lesson is that your initial impressions made within the first second or two can be dead on right...except when you're dead on wrong. Fun stories, though.",
            "There are almost one thousand reviews for this book, most are positive, do I need to submit one? Yes.The author discusses split-second thinking, or \"in the blink of an eye\" speed of thought. He postulates that those rapid decisions are usually better. He backs it up with many examples of decisions made with more time, more information, and more discussion that turned out wrong, when the initial decision was actually the correct one. How does this happen?The subconscious mind processes many inputs and helps to steer our decisions. It is usually right and we need to trust it more often. I trade financial products and I have found that too much information does not give me a clearer picture of what is going to happen, especially in the short to very short term future. I don't know how many times each week while looking at the market, I get this flash of go long, or go short. I have started tracking these thoughts and they are correct almost 90% of the time. How is that possible? I don't know, but I assume my subconscious mind picks up small clues that my conscious mind misses, or needs more information to form an opinion.The whole process is very exciting and while I can't explain the details, I can verify the results. Another book that delves deeper into the thought process and the subconscious decision-making process isHare Brain, Tortoise Mind: How Intelligence Increases When You Think Lessan excellent book, which I read a couple of years ago and I think I am ready to pull it off the shelf and give it a second read.",
            "Where does it all go, after you are done experiencing the experience, thinking the thought, feeling the feeling? Nothing is ever lost. The subconscious is like a vast warehouse, limitless, in fact, and as Malcolm Gladwell illustrates in \"Blink,\" we access all that is stored in that warehouse with every blinking and waking moment.Usually, we call this instant access - gut instinct. Or, the inner voice of wisdom. Instinct, however, is nothing magical or mysterious. It is simply our accumulated and stored knowledge over a lifetime. If there was ever an argument for listening to those who have some serious and well-lived years under their belts, this is it. \"Blink\" illustrates with numerous and widely varied examples how life experience, the more the better, contributes to our ability to make quick, yet sound decisions. In fact, the quicker, the better.\"Blink\" is about what the author calls \"thin slicing.\" He defines this process as the moment of time in which we all make snap judgments. Two seconds, two minutes ... and we make an assessment of a situation or a person or a circumstance. The fascinating thing is - these snap judgments are, more often than not, precise ones. It is when we begin to over analyze and rationalize that we tend to go awry. The trick is to allow the accumulated wisdom rise up and do its magic, trust in it.Then again ...Gladwell never does make a concluding statement in his book, and perhaps it is up to the reader to decide (do it quickly?), but his many fascinating examples and his reports on various studies can lead one to think these snap judgments are the way to go - or, then again, thinker beware. For all the many situations in which that moment of initial wisdom is uncannily precise, there are other times that our deeply ingrained biases muck up the clarity of that process. Gladwell cites data to illustrate how stereotypes, for instance, persist - no matter how gallant our conscious efforts to overcome them. Telling yourself you don't really think what you think simply won't work. Only exposure to experiences, or positive visualizations, will change the false ideas and images our subconscious has absorbed over time. All of which is a strong argument for \"garbage in, garbage out.\" That is, be careful of what entertainment you choose (e.g. pornographic images, violent movies or games, etc.), because no matter how hard your conscious mind tries to guide you toward decisions and behavior that is more appropriate, your subconscious will always, but always win out.The idea of what you present to your eye is what you will later project out to the world is a convincing one, as the author finds himself unable to beat the test on stereotypes when he has to react quickly. Only exposure to more positive images over time can change his test results and dislodge his prejudices.Gladwell discusses this phenomena of instant response-true response in a manner of ways. How patients respond to their doctors (we sue the physician who has a lousy bedside manner, even if more skilled, but remain loyal to the physician who spends as little as three extra minutes talking with us); how facial expressions, when viewed on slowed down video, will without fail, always reveal deceit (there are facial movements that arise from our subconscious that we cannot control, and no matter how quickly we think we have our facial mask in place, there is always that instant that our faces tell the truth); the intricacies of marketing and advertisement and why the obvious ad, even when based on feedback of focus groups, may not be the effective choice; how military decisions by experienced military leaders are successful, but fail miserably when they are constrained by strategic analysis; how micro-managing in workplaces can only lead to mediocrity while suppressing creativity and innovation; how speed dating may be most effective in finding potential lifelong connections (we read about research that can pick out successful, longterm relationships in observing as little as two minutes of interaction between a couple - and no, it isn't the couple that argues that breaks apart); how our societal subconscious biases for certain physical characteristics, such as height or gender, often mislead us to make dangerously faulty snap judgments (Gladwell observes that most of our leaders are tall and male, and that our corporate world pays tall men higher salaries, factoring dollars down to the inch, regardless of intelligence or ability). On and on, in one fascinating example and study after another, Gladwell intrigues with his findings.And you know he's right. You know it ... in your gut. But if the author doesn't make any overall conclusion from all of this fascinating data, then the reader is left to her own wiles. Experience counts more than credentials. What we expose ourselves to on a regular basis molds who we are, how we view others, what choices we make and how we behave. Biases and prejudices are far stronger than our conscious will to overcome them; we must align our environment to align our subconscious. Our deepest self forgets nothing. All we have ever done and been and seen and observed leads to who we are today and tomorrow.All of which gives one pause. But don't pause too long. It is that initial millisecond that may matter most of all.",
            "This book is full of promise and full of interesting stories. But ultimately, it doesn't even end up proving or disproving any of the ideas on its jacket.Some people are good at trusting their instincts, and they end up right. Others are bad at trusting them. Other people's instincts themselves are untrustworthy. Other people don't trust their instincts. Some are right, some are wrong.It's the equivalent of snob candy--it feels like an intellectual book, but it really doesn't say much of anything. It just makes you feel smart for a few minutes, if that.I'd put money that no one will be talking about this book in two years. It's just the flavor of (last) month.",
            "In theory, this book was good. It had a great concept, but it could have been explained in just a few chapters and not an entire book. The examples went on and on and on and on. I was bored with the book by the time I got to the end.",
            "Another excellent Gladwell book. I love Malcolm Gladwell's books. They are so intelligent and informative and thought-provoking. They should be assigned reading in college if not high school. They are very entertaining too.",

            "Great read!Made me think in a different manner about my \"knee jerk\" decisions. Trust them a little more and don't analyze things so much.Gladwell was a little long-winded in some points, but overall was well written.Would recommend for everyone of any age.",

            "When you see someone on the street, what goes into your instinctive judgment about whether they're trustworthy or shifty? If you've ever wondered that, &#34;Blink&#34; will sort you out. Gladwell is an excellent writer, and the research that he puts into his examination of split-second decision-making will leave you astonished. You'll be glad you read it.",
            "I have read all the books of Malcolm Gladwell so far and though this is not his best work but still the book has a lot of insights to give. The only thing I didn't like about the book was that sometimes it became a little vague otherwise a great book.",

            "I gave three stars because at least it was easy to read. But it lacked any real depth or insights.It is more like talking in a bar to some guy who has some insights but takes a very long time to convey them.For some light reading it is fine. I am not sure the book is usful in any real way.I suggest Predictably irrational by Dan Ariely. It is also light and easy to read but you may come away with an idea or two.",

I have read many books on personal finance and wealth building, but this one by Malcolm Gladwell is really good. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. And a great book that everyone should read. Malcolm Gladwell ties his stories well together - he is a master at making things previously unnoticed incredibly interesting. I highly recommend this book.",
            "Full of useful and more importantly need-to-know information, \"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\" by Malcolm Gladwell is one of the books that brake out of the traditional non-fiction genre to deliver more than the promised and subsequently anticipated content. The title is engaging in a sense that it reflects some powerful and mysterious skill set humans possess but are somehow not aware of. However, this is not a self-help book but one that none the less helps with its message. Its multiple examples reveal what once seemed conceivable but not cognitively possible. Who knew there is a study proving men over 6 feet earn on average $5,000 a year more than shorter men do? And how stunned can one be if one learned facial expressions are not necessarily evoked by emotions, but quite the opposite - facial expressions do evoke emotions (try it yourself, force yourself to smile for 5 minutes and observe the results afterwards)?The author constructs the book by offering remarkable incidences and then examining the core networks of their causes, while at the same time drawing some powerful conclusions. In the end, even if you are unsure about the book, whether by looking at its cover, or reading reviews about it, I encourage you to pick up a copy in a bookstore or at the library and read the first 10 pages- you wouldn't be disappointed. Overall, I highly recommend it.-by Simon Cleveland",
            "Im not sure why I, as a 14 year old, chose to pick up a book such as Blink and read it for fun. But nevertheless I did. With my dictionary handy and my advil on the beside table I opened the book.As I began Blink I thought I was in for 288 pages of sheer philosophical confusion. But I am glad to say I was wrong. Malcolm Gladwell is a very understandable and vivid author. Blink is a book about the phenomenon of split second thinking, or \"thin slicing\" as he refers to it. Thin slicing, is the art of taking apart a decision into sequential segments and deciding the most beneficial option for the situation. The beauty? This all occurs within about two seconds, almost a first instinct if you will. All of this process occurs unconsciously, under your radar of noticing. The problem with individuals today is that we have been taught that thinking a problem over, evaluating each part, and probing it dry. Thin slicing is often correct but society doubts the reliability of the quality of a 2-second decision.Gladwell conveys this fact with the help of a series of very interesting examples. Each example tells a different story that somehow relates to thin slicing. This is probably my favorite part of the book. Such stories such as: marriage, heart attack triage, speed dating, choking on the golf course, selling cars, military maneuvers, and that coke really IS better than pepsi. These stories each push his point and give different examples on how thin slicing really is a very useful tool.So if you have a few empty summer days, or some snowed in winter nights pick up this book. You will be amazed at how amazingly clear Gladwell tells about these \"blink of an eye\" decisions. A very enjoyable story, I found my self laughing out loud at times, and sometimes I found my self sitting there thinking \"wow\".",
            "The capacity to assess situations or circumstances shrewdly! That is merely the definition of judgement, right? Well, the nudgers and whisperers of psychology will reluctantly agree that \" Blink \" contains the all the parts of life`s thought tapestry. Founded on the jaw-dropping studies of human reactions, while breath-takingly displaying the intricacies of the mind, Malcolm Gladwell begins to rout out how one`s sequence of thought works! After studying how the journey through life is fraught with peril, he explains how we are under growing pressure to reach a conclusion. Such is the devasting picture of Military, some may be trying their darndest to flog the one most likely to provide a soaring rise of defiance. The luvvy intelligence of a man as vitriolic as Gladwell is worrying enough! But the thinly veiled attack on Politics will surely unleash a foul-mouthed rant from some. Still, it comes as little surprise that the rising tide of facts will underpin his argument, hence making the book enjoyable yet compelling. With astonishing Biological savvy, including information about the real causes of heart attacks, this book will undoubtedly stand at the seemingly glittering summit of Psychology! While some pick apart the wholly improper acts from authority, doctors are just as worthy the potshots! Armed with Political genuis, threating a wide-spread revolution in society, the Messiah`s mutterings of slipshod work from the bureau might stun those who are easily offended. Nevertheless, this book is fascinating! If I had learnt so much, you will gain knowlegde in abundance, but you will still enjoy this piece of work. I recommend this for everyone!!!",
            "I'm really shocked at the few negative reviews - some want more scientific language describing what is known about how the brain works - others think this is too anecdotal and is NOT scientific. I think it's brilliant stuff - it draws from existing studies and maps out a practical guide as to how people can craft protocols for reaching better decisions, i.e., when to trust snap judgements and when you have to look further to make sure you are not introducing bias. This is heavy sledding and requires a lot of thought, but Mr. Gladwell makes it easy to read and understand. Applying it is hard, but he give plenty of examples. I'm not sure what more he could do to bring this topic to life?",
            "This book is about the power of quick, almost instantaneous, decisions that some people make with excellent results. It is about the value of intuition. Our subconscious mind can integrate small, even subtle, clues to very quickly make great decisions. Of course, not everyone can do this. This book, in part, is about who has this power, how valuable is it, and what can be done to acquire this power. The second part of the book is about how we often get these quick decisions wrong.",
            "In this book, Gladwell reaches the astounding conclusion that EXPERTS know more than other people. That if you spend YEARS doing something, or researching it, or training, you will be able to spot more details than others. A real eye-opener.",
            "Jameson Thottam: Don't blink or you'll miss a truly good readDo you ever wonder why you have such strong instinctual responses? Ever curious as to why your gut feeling is almost always right.For those of us who fell in love with his Tipping Point, it was big news when Malcolm Gladwell announced that he was tackling the topic of thin-slicing. In plain english, this book is all about how our mind makes snap decisions, and what we can learn about that process to make ourselves better decision-makers.What's it about? (James Thottam)Much like Tipping Point, this book is much more observational than conclusive. Gladwell's stated purpose is to make us more aware of the thin-slicing we do on a daily basis, and to understand the pros and cons of this natural behavior.Method of Teaching (Jameson L Thottam)The way the book teaches is through groups of anecdotes, each focused on a different facet of thin-slicing (reading faces, understanding vocal nuance, etc). Generally Gladwell will tell a \"framing\" story, outline the teaching point and then reinforce it with a number of smaller examples that prove the same point holds true in a variety of environments.The War Games Story (Jameson Thottam)Personally, I found the war games story that Gladwell dissects to be most informative. Focused on the Millenium Challenge, a competition in which a retired military officer know for his lack of process went head to head with senior armed forces leaders who had the benefit of a staggering amount of tools and data. The key there is staggering, and as we watch the inevitable defeat of the better educated team we learn a number of critical lesson about why learning to trust the ability to thin-slice can prove more valuable than any artificial thinking or technical solution we can develop.The Main Opinion (Jameson Thottam)I strongly recommend this book, which is a very quick read by the way, to anyone who is interested in better understanding human behavior or looking to refine their own self. Also, this is nearly guaranteed to be a business \"it\" book in 2005, so you marketing/strategy/sales folks should be prepared to talk about it at cocktail parties and strategy sessions all year long.Strengths: (Jameson Thottam)1.The stories that Gladwell uses are incredibly engaging and the run of topic areas. Something here for everyone (romance, military, medicine, etc).2.Stylistically, this is one of the most engaging books of its type that I have read. Crisp, clear and written in a colloquial narrative style, it's actually fun to read.Weaknesses: (James Thottam)1.As I have said before, Malcolm Gladwell is the John Grisham of the non-fiction world. If you are looking for a strong ending or a conclusion that will distill this books teaching points, you are in for a disappointment.2.Outside of the facts of the anecdotes themselves, Gladwell doesn't bring much hard data to the table to enforce his wider hypotheses regarding quick decision making.Enjoy the read,Jameson Thottam",
            "It's not clear whether this book has anything in it that could be called a 'theory'.Gladwell (if he wrote it - there's so much race awareness that I can't help wondering if the book was ghosted for a professional half-caste) has two characteristics, typical of the market aimed for: [1] They must have no knowledge outside any conventional establishment beliefs, [2] They must be swayed by emotions - violence, typically, though softer emotions peep in as well.Some of Gladwell's examples are taken (I'd guess from popular books) from such worlds as art appreciation, wars, police activity, market research into drinks, and formal music. In each case the 'American' view is assumed without thinking (even momentarily). A few examples: Tom Hanks has appeared in essentially misleading films on e.g. AIDS, Vietnam war, Second World War, NASA - but Gladwell knows nothing of this, and quotes some real or imaginary casting person talking about Hanks's supposed wonderful screen image. There's an account of a cheap brandy, packaged in a boring way, losing ground to another brandy, packaged attractively. There's something similar about 'colas' - the amazing insight that one sip of a drink may have a different effect from a whole bottle. A 'veteran' of Vietnam is discussed (there is a painfully long digression on military matters) with no discussion of the rather overwhelming superiority of firepower.The examples Gladwell gives of accurate spli-second decisions generally need huge amounts of preliminary work - e.g. whether a classical trombone player is good, whether an artwork is a fake, how to sell cars, whether a facial expression exists - two men (who appeal to Derren Brown) get quite long mentions, but their decisions are only possible because videos of facial expressions now exist. All of this material is what might resonably be called 'learning'. Some material, for example the effect of facial expressions on emotions (in addition to the other way round - something claimed by William James) or of words of a certain tone on peoples' behaviour (New Yorkers becoming polite because of reading scrambles sentences with polite words in) doesn't seem to connect with the general idea of the book.One star. But only because I'm in a good mood.",
            "Like many others I bought this book thinking that it contained more scientific information. The book is just a compilation of anecdotes that the author repeats over and over again. If you read the story about the Getty's Kouros you have read the whole book.",
            "I too decided to read the book due to hype and enjoyed the beginning of the book. I soon found myself skimming forward due to the meaningless examples, military, doctors, etc. Please, we all know that data can be 'sliced' and manipulated to prove anything, even opposing viewpoints so why the long self-serving studies. I don't disagree that certain subconscience responses can guide our actions and views, tell me how to tap into that. Tell me more practical applications and everyday life situations. I found the book to be 25% value and 75% filler.",
            "The book is an incredibly enlightening piece of work providing insight into the human brain. Worth the read and probably worth reading more than once.",
            "His second book is no less riviting than his first (The Tipping Point), in Blink, the author looks closely at why and how we do better with first impressions sometimes than labored thought.",
            "The author makes the following points: 1) sometimes you can make a correct decision very quickly; 2) sometimes a very quick decision is wrong. In his book he states that he has taken a whole year to write this slender volume. This book is the scientific equivalent of a trashy airport novel - it passes the time and then you forget it. It would be a very good buy if you don't read novels and are taking a trip - a short trip.",
            "This book offers a lot of intresting ideas. It really makes you think, and will help you decide things much more efficentily. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to improve their decision making skills, or just wants to learn about the thought process.",
            "Great look at how a person's entire existence and experience can impact the snap judgments they make when faced with a decision, the book also does a nice job of giving encouraging a person to trust your instincts - unless of coarse you have very little background in the decision you are about to make. Fun read similar to Gladwell's other book tipping point.",
            "This is an excellent book. It really makes you think about snap decision making, how we all do it, how some people are more adept at it, and how to become better at it. It's a really enjoyable read.",
            "You ask yourself, \"What could be so interesting about 'The Power of Thinking Without Thinking'?... What does that even mean?\" I didn't know how to approach this book, except with anticipating curiousity. I actually bought this and avoided reading it until I could take in Gladwell's earlier success \"The Tipping Point\". After loving that, I knew it was time to address the secret workings of split-second decision making and human perception. The book sounds ambiguous, inaccessible, and odd... it is not. It - like only a handful of books I have read over the years - truly reshapes your focus of the world. I can't do justice to describe the capability of Gladwell's analysis... but from one average reader to the next, put this book at the top of your wishlist and get to it shortly. (Then I'd move on to the Tipping Point)",
            "I have heard many good things about this author. I like the fact that he grew out his hair during the process of writing this book. It started out really strong and then he lost me in the middle. Its about the re-discovery of his youth and the rules you learn more than intuition.",

            "This is a very amazing book that is so amazing and interesting that you'll be finished before you know it.Gladwell really hooks the reader from the start with his wit and surprises. It will really change the way you think about the way you think (as complicated as that might be).The stories and tests that are told about in this book are usually pretty interesting and make little sense until you read the end, and it all makes sense again.This is a very good read- now I'm just hoping Gladwell comes out with more books!",
            "tipping point was a much better book in my opinion. i enjoyed the diversity of the examples in the tipping point. blink caught my attention faster but towards the end, the ideas and examples began to get repetitive. Not a bad read though!",
            "Most of us have experienced a split second of \"knowingness\" when confronted by a particular individual or circumstance - the heart pounds faster, the hands become clammy; \"something\" tells us to steer clear of this person or situation, only to discover later that our instincts were absolutely right. I cannot count the numerous occasions this has occurred over the years. This instinct we all possess is hard wired in our brains, fined tuned over millions of years of evolution. Of course this is nothing new. We have always been told to \"trust\" this inner voice, to run with it, that it is, more often than not, the right call. However, this is not always the case. As Gladwell points out in \"Blink\", our unconscious minds can be influenced by implicit cultural conditions, and this \"instinct\" can be terribly wrong, leading in some extreme cases, to total disaster.Gladwell's message is that these implicit feelings, these instinctive signs, is one of the more powerful skills we posses. He suggests that our so-called \"snap-judgement\" based on \"thin slicing\", that is computing minimal but important observations from the environment, can be fined tuned. Unfortunately, he does not explain exactly how this \"fine-tuning\" can be effectively done. If we are all simply products of our environment, conditioned from an early age to believe and see the world in a certain way, how is it possible to \"un-learn\" the false data we've accumulated over a lifetime, to ensure our \"snap-judgements\" are the right ones?As Gladwell does in his best selling book, The Tipping Point, he supplies the reader with a plethora of examples and tests to substantiate his arguments. The most interesting example was the gentleman who could \"read minds\" solely based on interpreting facial expressions. In the studies of Paul Ekman and Wallace Freisen, they focus on the literally thousands of facial expressions we learn from infancy, and how a vast majority of our expressions are involuntary, revealing our true and innermost thoughts. Gladwell suggests that all of us, at least unconsciously, can read these expressions, which aid us in interpreting and contextualizing our environment.\"Blink\" is an interesting discussion on our instincts, proposing that operating on less information and following our \"guts\" is usually the wiser path. Gladwell's conclusion, however, is an age-old one, and that is attaining a balance between body, mind and spirit. The ancient Greeks gave this same advice over three thousand years ago. It is good advice, but similar to anything apparently simple, it is easier said than done.",
            "Gladwell said all he needed to say in the first 10 pages. Need I say more?",
            "Alright, I did start it, but I could not finish it. It was that boring. Don't make a snap judgment though, you should read it for yourself and realize that anyone without a brain can get published these days. A former boss who liked to drink and employ the services of hookers gave our team this as a Christmas gift which were some of the many Blink judgments he made.",
            "For a book that has received so much acclaim, I'm surprised by the number of logic holes in Malcolm Gladwell's arguments. He is also very verbose and talks about many random things that are unrelated to the topic of the book. The arguments look like obvious attempts to make money by deceiving the general public. By far, one of the poorest books I've read in a long time.",

I just wish they would have been their original size.",
            "I really did enjoy this book, but it didn't change my life or make me desperately want to read anything else by this author.The negatives: The start of the novel is a touch disjointed and jumps around a bit. Lacks focus at the beginning. (The book's flow is just fine at the end though). It still jumps around though. This book is racially charged and clearly written by an African American. This isn't a bad thing, but all the racist accusations are pointed toward white against black. Nothing of Islam or Middle Eastern prejudice or others. He does touch a bit of blacks being prejudiced against blacks which is interesting, but I would just love to have heard more expanded research into some concepts.Positives: If you're a fan of the TV show, Lie to Me, you'll at the very least like this book. Interesting read. Has some great incites. I'm tired of writing this review now.....",

            "I found this book absorbing and I enjoyed Gladwell's pleasant and approachable style of writing. I find human behavior fascinating and if you do too I can't imagine how you wouldn't enjoy this book. It made for an ideal beach book as you can read it in short bursts or stay absorbed in it for long hours. I go to the beach with my large family, ( = frequent interruptions), and I found this book held my interest strongly yet was not so deeply complex that I would have to back way up if something broke my train of thought.",
            "A bit long on the anecdote and short on how to develop and employ this ability.",
            "Blink was the first book I read by Malcolm Gladwell, although now I devour nearly everything he writes. Both as a psychologist and a woman, I have grown to understand the necessity of learning how to tune in to one's intuition, understand as much as possible about our \"gut\" feelings (and from where they may originate), and to reduce the self-talk or rationalizations that may cloud/squash our instincts.Mr. Gladwell's insight is remarkable; he views the world in creative and non-ordinary ways that allow readers to experience \"A-Ha!\" moments, offering them a guide to building their ability to see their world differently as well.",
            "I was intrigued by the message. While I don't necessary agree with everything the author states or his generalities, I felt the book was stimulating and created a good opportunity to reassess thought processes. Shipped timely and was in good condition.",
            "The 1000th something review, so I'll keep it short.Blink is Malcolm Gladwells second book (after tipping point) and in it he looks at making decisions \"in the blink of the moment.\" Are these decisions better or worst than carefully analyzed decisions.The first part examines why they are actually better. It looks at the unconscious part of the brain and how we can use that to make quick decisions that are often better than decisions that are well analyzed. However, on the second part, he looks at the mistakes we humans make when making quick decisions. It gives advise how to train your unconscious brain and how to use it effectively for making quick decisions.Unlike most other reviewers, I enjoyed blink more than \"the tipping point.\" I felt the structure to be more coherent. As his previous work, most of the book are stories trying to make or break a certain point. Malcolms writing is excellent, but that ought to be expected from a journalist of such caliber.All in all, blink is worth reading. It is still written for a general audience and often didn't go into the depth I would have liked in books. Still, a good book and excellent writing.",
            "What a bore! \"Blink\" is a grab bag of platitudes that leads absolutely nowhere. The core thesis is risible. The author basically argues that under the right conditions, humans make better decisions when they use their instincts. He then states that under the wrong conditions, decisions based on instinct can be disastrous. Jee-whizz, Malcom, thanks for the insight! The book is hype and empty of any valuable content; it will certainly become standard reading in MBA programs.",
            "_Blink_ is certainly an entertaining read, and the author does an excellent job of staying on track and using many different areas of study to buttress his major topic. However, the book never provides a payoff of WHAT should be done now. According to Gladwell, \"thin-slicing\" is good, unless it's not good. It's good when it works, but otherwise it's bad. There's no step forward here, and the only applications provided are the politically-correct ones that one could presume without even opening the text. It's a good book, but not the masterpiece that many seem to be seeing here.",
            "I enjoyed reading Blink, but don't think it needs your immediate attention.This is a book about judgments, snap/subconscious decisions, and what we can do to trust them or try to change them.I think that Blink flowed really well and had some good arguments, but I don't think there is anything new here. Nothing in this book is spectacular.Putting all of the examples together and analyzing them does have some interest, but there is nothing striking about Gladwell's arguments.I think that the idea behind this book is very important, but needs more work.",
            "definitely more of a \"rental\" (i.e. used) than a purchase. It's a quick read, starts off with an interesting notion, but the second half of the book didn't have much to say nor did it deliver a strong conclusion. There are some interesting stories in between, including evidence suggesting we are all biased in some ways, but nothing original. The bottom line here is that with experience, your intuition on areas of YOUR expertise improves. Wow.",
            "The author's first book was pretty damn good. (The Tipping Point). here he attempts to tackle to subject of intuition and gut feeling but it never really suceeds. His writing style to constantly come back to an example he cited earlier made the book feel repetitive and burdensome.I wish that this book was better because the premise was pretty good. Too bad!!",
            "I had high hopes when I bought this book, but it turned out to be a big letdown. Rather than a manual about how to refine one's snap judgments, the whole book is a series of how quick decisions can sometimes be better than careful reasoning. As I read, I kept thinking, \"Great, snap judgments might work sometimes. How do I improve them?\" but he never got to it. The examples were interesting, but to write a whole book about them and only them...it makes you wonder if the author just wants you to go through his book without thinking.",
            "The author's style makes for a painless, quick read. However, I felt I wasted my money on too much description, and dismissal of intuition, knowledge, or experience that may be contributing to a person knowing something is awry...one who may be thin slicing (Blink Thinking I believe would be a better term).He gave examples of how it works successfully for some people, but he didn't or couldn't explain very well why it happens, nor could he give guidance for people to improve their own thinking. Then he gave examples where it didn't work, so the reader wonders, \"What's your point? Does this work or doesn't it? If you say everyone can do this, well, HOW?\"He went on tangents (face reading could be a book of its own, and I would be very interested in that) and tiptoed into areas that might be a bit political - casually saying it's not working for the police who shot someone, it's not working for the military who doesn't want to work off of \"hunches\", though in some cases it HAS worked for a leader or two. It dismisses market research almost entirely, because a singer (who is obviously a favorite of his has yet to make it big), because test audiences didn't like his music, yet thin slice thinkers must. He seems to contradict himself with his own examples.Again, not an unpleasant read, but I was craving more. It's an unfinished work.",
            "Mildly interesting, and certainly the easiest of reads. Of course Gladwell is a huckster, but like all hucksters he occasionally entertains. I suppose that warrants throwing a couple of bucks his way.",
            "I was absolutely startled that this book got 3.5 stars so far! The whole book talks about one thing: the 6th sense sometime works, sometime doesn't. What a spectacular revealation! It was a practical humilation to me that I've finished 80% of the book before I am writing this. Don't waste your time and money on this book.",
            "First 1/3 was good. Last 2/3 was tedious and failed to deliver the books claimed reason for being. Agree with others, take a nap and save the money and time.",
            "about buying this book.What a load of garbage. This book, as some other reviewers have astutely pointed out, is a total waste of time. It simply serves to illustrate the point that anyone can and will do anything, find any niche, to make a buck. A complete travesty of time, energy and money. Avoid. No redeeming qualities whatsoever. Enough cliches? Well, the bottom line is that they are all true. There really is nothing worthwhile offered by this author, and, by the end of this book, you are truly left feeling had. This author should stick to writing short articles for The New Yorker. That, if anything, is all he is truly suited for in terms of writing.Stick with what your gut is telling you about this book - it's b.s. Good call.",
            "Blink, is predominately a collection of outcomes from previous research on unconscious thinking. In the first half of the book, the author tries to categorize rapid, unconsciousness decision making as an \"instinct\" that the human mind makes on its own. The second half of the book the author wonders off into a re-interpretation of unconscious thinking as something that is a product of extensive training and experience. The preface of the book is \"The power of thinking without thinking\". With the two different interpretations of unconscious thinking, I am not sure the thesis of the book was proven. For anyone with little education into the human mind, this could be a good primer on unconscious thinking, otherwise, leave it alone.",
            "I don't normally write reviews, but this book (actually I bought it as an audio CD) could be the most fascinating piece of literature I have ever listened to. The information contained within Malcolm Gladwell's expose&eacute; is both enlightening and captivating. I purchased a few other books on mind mechanics and decided on a \"snap decision\" to include this work (last) on the list. Boy, am I glad I did.The concepts which Gladwell presents have, overnight, harnesed themselves into my own cognitive decision-making processes, happily and beneficially. I think the crux of his research really amounts to whether it is of benefit to make decisions based on a \"hunch\" (ba-da-boom-cha) [anyone who has seen Marty Feldman in Young Frankenstein might find that allusion funny,]...but back to the point....Upon purchasing this audio CD (which I unequivocally recommend as opposed to the book, as what better way to be stimulated than by listening to a terrific work such as this in the car when you would not normally be doing anything else as productive) I was finding myself tearing up upon hearing what amazingly interesting and insight-reaching information Gladwell has unearthed to draw upon for his work. I find it absolutely fascinating that, for example, Ted Williams always said he could \"follow the ball to the point where it made contact with the bat\" and upon further research, it was revealed, and then pointed out to Ted, that at the last 5 feet of a pitch, it was [italics here for emphasis, please people...] Physically Impossible to manage this given the speed for which the ball was traveling. And of course Ted's reaction was \"Well, I guess it just felt like I was following the ball all the way to the bat\". That's good stuff.I'm sorry, but gems like this, juxtaposed with Gladwell's own likable and again, the word which comes to mind is 'captivating', reading of the disourse on the CD make this work an absolute must have, a clear-cut leading addition to anyone's Summer Book Club listening list, and for that matter Winter, Spring or Fall.It is indeed rare and delightful when a tome of information such as this bridges the gap between written work to be browsed over and moved aside for the next, and, in contrast, \"Bink\", which can be absorbed, digested, and then assimilated into your own behavior patterns, and in doing so making you feel all the wiser and more knowledgable for having begun the process of recognizing and then pinpointing the cognitive processes which make up a chunk of our own mind behaviors at work, given the fact that we all must possibly \"thin slice\" numerous times throughout the course of the day without actually knowing we are doing so and that even better still, actually are utilizing a part of our awareness which operates, dare I say, subconsciously, for our own benefit if only we would give it a forum to breathe and become aware of it's time-saving and seemingly omnipitant intelligence.As a note to Mr. Gladwell, I would suggest taking the Blink discovery one step further. Let's discover what additional components, universally, present themselves as part of significant timetable events, in addition to the \"hook\" of the initial telltale information disclosure which seems to exist ubitiquously in connection with querried factual conclusions.Otherwise, what other components do completed factual events share universally, besides the thumbprint of an associated initial informatinal Blink keyhole portending the concluding outcome. We could learn more about what patterns to look for, what experience comes next after the Blink, we must journey through before arriving at our final conclusion. There must be a deeper, larger, more fundamentally encompassing mechanism operating behind this Blink story.Well worth the price of admission, I give this work 5 stars and look forward to anything more Mr. Gladwell has on his next \"to publish\" list.",
            "Blink is a fast read. The case studies show how the human brain is hardwired for certain actions and shaped by others. Anyone who enjoys psychology or the nature versus nurture discussions will get a lot from Blink. The synopsis of a police officer's thought process when shooting at a person or being shot at was revealing and riveting.",
            "It is hard to put this book down.It can be read in a single day.One of the best things to gather from this book was its reasoned discussion of the Amadou Diallo shooting and the use of the time scale on which the whole event happened as an explanation for WHY it happened.Another very strong point of the book is his use of experimental details of experiments run to explain sociological phenomenon. So, for example: A lot of people will repeat typical banalities about \"Internalizing the hatred of the oppressor\" and \"Minorities being marginalized by society\" but Gladwell actually gives the basis by which phenomenon can be measured and demonstrates the experimental techniques that can be used so to do.Also, when Gladwell talked about the experiments that were run to analyze couples he took it all the way to the conclusion by detailing how well the experiment predicted the results. (This may seem like a small point, but a lot of scientists don't respect psychologists for the very reason that their discipline does not deal with the experimental aspects very well.)Even if you are not a hardcore scientist, there are so many good things in this book that everyone will be able to find something of interest.",
            "I thought that Tipping Point was a decent book (4 stars), and I was much more interested in the subject matter of this one, but it was kinda disappointing. The individual stories he uses to illustrate his points are informative enough, I guess, but I really don't think he has any business drawing conclusions from any of it. Unfortunately he just doesn't have the expertise, he's only a writer. Stil, I did read it all the way through, and got some interesting bits out of some of the experts he quotes. I got it fom the library and am glad I didn't buy it. Gladwell has potential, but whereas Tipping Point was on par, this one is a bogey.",
            "Best-selling author Malcolm Gladwell exercises his formidable talents at storytelling and research with 'Blink,' and excellent exposition on how people make decisions.Why are some of us good decision-makers and others very poor? What are the hidden skills and 'instincts' that let some folks excel at snap judgments. What are the key bits of information that go into a correct decision and how do they differ from popular misconceptions about how people really decide?With a wealth of real-world case studies, Gladwell takes us from food tasters to the insurance industry and the military. Good prose and an eye for the captivating anecdote and key detail make Mr. Gladwell a top author.You will enjoy this book and may be unable to put it down. Go make a snap decision to buy it!",
            "Blink was a bit of a disappointment. After reading other reviews and learning about the author, I expected a book full of great insights and anecdotes. Instead, I found a book of few significant insights and fewer interesting anecdotes. The beginning of the book started strong, but by mid-way, I felt as though the author had already used up his best material, and the remaining pages were simply filler. In places, it began to read like my college textbook from Social Psychology 101. Mr. Gladwell should have waited until he had more to impart, and included the best parts of this book as a chapter or two in his next, more complete work.",
            "Gladwell covers a broad range of topics as he studies how we make decisions in the \"blink\" of an eye. He details numerous studies that shed light on how we make decisions, and how our subconscience influences those decisions. A sampling of the applications covered: art, Coca-Cola v. Pepsi, Aeron office chairs, facial expressions, implicit race discrimination tests, police procedure, auditions for symphonies, top 40 radio, autism, market research, marital counseling and much more. Gladwell writes a very readable, engaging book that will prompt many questions on how we view the world and the many things that affect us. This book is one of the most unexpectedly interesting books that I have read this year and I would recommend it for anybody who is curious about how the mind works.",

While I wouldn't bad mouth Mr. Gladwell, I tell people it's not as good as the Tipping Point, which, by the way, is a MUST read...",
            "Excellent book that looks closely at how and why we make the snap decisions that we make... also helps one to re-evaluate why we make these decisions and how we can change our mindsets, if we so choose. Really liked the eyeopening, descriptions of why some people are so good at making snap decisions, in spite of the reality that we can't explain \"the why\" of our decisions very well.",
            "I think it is a good book to awaken people to the fact that the human being is more of a multi-dimensional creature than we realized. More is going on subliminally than is occuring on the surface. Blink wets your appetite to pay more attention to yourself and others for these subliminal clues as to the Truth of a situation or individual. I found it fascinating and delightful. It contributes to the delicious mystery of life.",
            "Malcom Caldwell has done a good job with Blink, his latest work. Blink is a good introductory book on the growing field of behavioral scientists performing research on how little things, which appear to be meaningless, do carry a lot of power. Those things can make or break the next big deal you are working on, help you advance your career or help you have a wonderful long-lasting marriage.The book is still very unstructured and in many cases comes out as anecdotical. The truth is that Malcom had the courage to write about something in which science is only beggining to get his hands on and therefore there are not many major studies that can place of this wonderful knowledge in a structured system to be used. Despite this fact, the lessons from Blink are very relevant to your professional and personal life.If you really want to make the book experience more meaningful, look for other studies related to snap judgement. Of particular interest is the MIT's research on Micro-Inequities, or subtle-discrimination acts that often come as simple as a change in the voice tone or a gesture addressing a co-worker that is different from how you address the rest of them. It's very likely that your colleague will pick this immediately, even if you are speaking kind words to him or her.The truth is we do process tons of information every single day and the phenomenon is not easing in the information age. We will continue to process more and more info and therefore snap judgements will grow in your daily life. People are very selective in which things they pay attention to and which things they dismiss -- it has become an act of survival to the information overload. If you do really want to win the next project or you want to avoid presenting you or your company in a negative way you do need to know your customers and know which buttons trigger their snap judgement. In many cases you don't even have one hour to persuade somebody to buy your product -- it can be as short as 30 seconds on a call or a glance on an internet ad; or even in the first few minutes of the sales call in which you customer makes her mind. If you actually want to use this for marketing purposes I also recommend you to read Robert Cialdini's classic Persuasion.Blink also tells us that in some professions and under some extenuating circumstances (e.g. police work, physicians) our snap judgements are made over a very narrow set of variables. Understanding this can help us avoid those situations and actually save lives.Finally, you can also use many of the learnings from here to understand how simple, rather innocent situations can destroy valuable personal relationships, such as your marriage.Blink is a good book, entretaining read, given its storytelling. Its major flaws are that it is still unstructured and therefore its lacks contundent conclusions. Also, without reading other books on related subjects you can probably see most of the contents as unrelated anecdotical material. But don't judge it on a blink -- it helps understand other behavioral studies on how we deal with information better and that is priceless.",
            "Is it true a fake can produce intuitive revulsion in the eye of a knowing observer? A blink is a glance, fast and frugal decisionmaking.The truth of a marriage can be understood by an observer in a short time. A relationship between people has a distinctive signature.Free will is an illusion. We can be coached, primed. Gladwell speaks of thin-slicing, the process of making decisions quickly on the basis of very little information. When you start second-guessing you may be undermining yourself. Sometimes extra information just confuses the issue.Thin slicing is recognizing patterns and making snap judgments. It turns out that buying jam is a snap decision. Less choice means more sales. The face is an enormously rich source of emotion. Every blink is a series of discrete moving parts.Music auditions are thin slicing moments. The use of screens, blind auditions, has changed the composition of orchestras.The notes at the end of the book are of great interest.",
            "Blink describes the underlying understanding of many things we see on TV, from our salesforce and with our day-to-day interactions with other people. Many of the presented concepts can help to drive improved marketing, speech-making and other outbound communications. I highly recommend this book and Tipping Point.",
            "Malcom Gladwell has a unique ability to see connections where no one else has. Blink may not provide stunning original insights that make you fall out of your chair. It's more like you smack your forehead and say \"why didn't I think of that?\" It's fascinating to read the articles in the archives of Gladwell's website and see the evolution of his books. I can't help but wonder at what point these disparate topics coalesce into one idea. Gladwell then melds them into an entertaining, enlightening, and cohesive narrative. Read and enjoy.",
            "On the average I read about 6 books a month. In the last 12 months this is the worst book I've read. It's not just boring it's simply awful. Imagine a meal where they served up a decent salad then your second course was another salad not much different than the first, then your entree was a really big salad and the meal was finished off with a desert of, you guessed it by now didn't your, salad.This book is a series of stories about how things happen really fast and that some people can tell really quick whether something is authetic art, a dangerous situation, whether someone is a virtuoso muscian, etc.But the \"meat\" that's missing from all this salad is the basics of how to develop that skill and whether there is really any difference between intuition and dumb luck.The chapters second guessing law enforcement officers that have to make life and death decisions in nano-seconds is particuliarly egregious.This book is sold on a promise of a premise that would be useful in everyday life. No way, it's another \"I wrote one interesting book, now I'm going to take advantage of it as soon as I can with something I'll throw together as quick as I can\".this is no \"tipping point\".

            "I purchased this book right when it came out. I usually like to wait until books come out in paperback before I buy them, but I was so intrigued by this author and book, that I purchased it right away.What I found, was the book is written at a very basic educational level. Because I have a BA in Psychology, I have already heard about most of the phenomenon's he discusses in the book. So, most of the book was a repeat of my undergraduate social psychology course. Also, most of these phenomenon's and methods for testing have technical terms in psychology. Instead of using any of these terms, he makes up his own terms as if he read a few research papers and then decided to write an entire book about a subject that he doesn't know a lot about.If you didn't go to college, or haven't had any psychology courses, then you will probably enjoy this book. But, if your background is similar to mine, then avoid reading this book. It reads like really bad cliffs notes from an old textbook.",
            "This book is a prototypical bestseller...entertaining and just vague enough to appeal to a mass of readers, whether they are firm believers in love at first sight, analytical engineers or somewhere in between. This book is a bestseller precisely because it will validate your thinking no matter where you fall in the spectrum. Hopefully it will also challenge you to rethink how analytical and/or how emotional your decision-making process really is.What stood out to me about the book was how Gladwell proves the main thesis of his book: that your subconscious is capable of filtering out superfluous information in order to make snap judgments based on the few details that really matter. His proof lies in various examples of how experts in particular fields can within seconds create a diagnosis (even without understanding or acknowledging all of the symptoms).One of the examples he uses is of a professor who has been studying couples' communication for many years. This professor can apparently, within 30 seconds of viewing a taped dialogue between a couple, determine with 95 percent accuracy whether or not the couple will last. The proof of Gladwell's point is supposed to come from the fact that increasing the amount of taped dialogue viewed by the professor does not improve his accuracy.It was not lost on me, however, that all of Gladwell's core examples (including the professor) involve experts who have been studying their particular fields for many years. This is not something clearly pointed out in the book, but something that certainly deserves mention. It would be easy for an inexperienced investor to walk away after reading this book with the notion that he or she should make more investment decisions by trusting in his or her gut. Yet the proof of Gladwell's point relies on people with large amounts of specialized experience.Gladwell does make a valid point that many people spend too much time fretting over the minutia. This is all too true in investing. Many investors acquire too much information, much of which is probably irrelevant (or at least too unpredictable to quantify as part of an investment decision). This can lead to either making decisions based on unimportant variables or in complete investment paralysis.Here's hoping you discover someplace in between,Jeremy Ames, Executive Editor",
            "\"Next time you meet a doctor, and you sit down in his office and he starts to talk, if you have the sense that he isn't listening to you, that he's talking down to you, and that he isn't treating you with respect, LISTEN TO THAT FEELING. You have thin-sliced him and found him wanting\" (p. 43).\"Perhaps the most common -- and the most important -- forms of rapid cognition are the judgments we make and the impressions we form of other people. Every waking minute that we are in the presence of someone, we come up with a constant stream of predictions and inferences about what that person is thinking and feeling.... We easily parse complex distinctions in facial expression.... You wouldn't need to hear anything I was saying in order to reach these conclusions. They would just come to you, BLINK\" (p. 194-195).In Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, author Malcolm Gladwell (The Tipping Point) discusses that \"first impression,\" the \"BLINK\" moment, or the \"thin-slice\" of cognitive judgment. He basically is saying that gut feelings are more often right than wrong. Unless... they are wrong.Gladwell gives examples of the subtle reasons why, in vocal inflections, facial tics, or some other type of unknown mechanism leading to our impressions of people, things, or events, we know something is \"wrong\" immediately. In fact, he argues that some issues are pretty darn predictable from those first few precious seconds of exposure: lying, incompetency, forgery, longevity of marriage, and evaluation of musical talent.I agree, to a degree. I find his case history summaries intriguing and interesting. I've participated in the Harvard Implicit Association Test. I seen first hand the gender schemas addressed by Virginia Valian (Why So Slow?) that affect hiring processes and decisions. And, like most humans that have ever lived, I've had my own \"gut feelings\" that I've regretted not paying closer attention to.Gladwell made the same mistake in his best-seller The Tipping Point, however. He \"reverse-engineered\" the issues. An event happens. Later, somebody (usually not Gladwell) goes back to see if there was a clue to the lie, the malpractice, the divorce, or the hiring bias. Ah-HA... there is the clue! [Read -- there is the tipping point.] You would think, however, with something so clear-cut -- we now know the behaviors (or lack thereof) of liars, spys, mistake-prone surgeons, and cheating spouses -- that we could USE these behavioral cues in court, in police investigations, in premarital discussions (perfect for those required church premarital conferences), and in choosing a physician (see that first quote in my review, above).But we don't. In part, this is because Gladwell also notes cases where those \"thin-slices\" of impressions are wildly and catastrophically wrong.Ah-ha.So, I am intrigued but not convinced. This IS interesting stuff, and I thank Gladwell for summarizing it for me. I need more evidence, more studies, and a demonstration of greater utility.Oh, and do you think that there is a \"tipping point\" in the \"thin slicing\" when we unconsciously flip our impression from one conclusion to another? Maybe this issue will be the last portion of this trilogy!",
            "The book is an entertaining read filled with stories suggesting that our quick decisions made \"in the blink of an eye\" can be just as good as (or even better than) decisions made cautiously. The first part of the book gives examples when snap judgments have turned out good, whereas the second part of the book provides examples when such decisions have turned out bad. The question then becomes: \"When should we trust our instincts?\"The author suggests that we need to work out the \"right mix of conscious and unconscious analysis on a case-by-case basis.\" Although this statement may appear vague for someone who is looking for a direct answer, I believe that Gladwell does provide guidance when one reads the entire book.In the end, I believe the author is trying to make us understand our decision processes a little better. We need to be wary that we all have snap tendencies based on our own experiences. As such, decisions would be optimized if we try to identify and filter out irrelevant biases.",
            "I first read Tipping Point in 2001 and was blown away by its message. I found myself quoting him at parties, thinking about my life in relation to the book etc. So I was very interested to read Blink. But 6 years later, I'm not sure if it was my more advanced knowledge of the topic over time that made it less intriguing or if the book itself was just less ground-breaking.Blink is about how we all make immediate gut decisions on things and we don't even know it - and how this impacts us in both good and bad ways. In Blink, Gladwell's style is to let readers uncover the point of his thesis themselves as he makes his points through a series of short stories. I admit I got a bit bored by the stories at times, just wanting Gladwell to get to the point rather than labor on with examples. But I found after reading the book that it was the stories that stuck with me long term - meaning the book's value seemed to linger and grow as I thought about it later. In all, it's a worthy read for anyone that is a student of human psychology - in business or in life. But I just didn't revel in its message like I did his first book.",
            "Gladwell's book is a nice collection of interesting stories. It is an easy read and generally entertaining. However, beyond that, it does not hold up to the other reviews in my opinion. In one instance, he insinuates that we should trust our first instincts yet points out many cases where are first inclinations are not correct. If you are looking for a book to teach you how to hone your intuition and first instincts, this is not it. Beyond the storytelling, there is not much in terms of deep analysis to help an individual learn to utilize their instinctive abilities. Nice stories but little else in my opinion.",
            "Gladwell spends half the book telling you how we are capable of making incredible, enlightened deductions in an instant thanks to our subconscious. He leaves you hoping the next half of the book will tell you how to harness and refine those deductions so you can use them in everyday life and decision making processes. Instead he goes on to reveal how we override our initial intuitions with conscious thought, and interestingly, vice versa. He ends by giving examples of how we make errors in judgment by relying on our intuition too much. So what was the point? Not the treatment on the subject I was hoping to receive. Basically he says the subconscious is capable of powerful things. Great. Now buy a book that talks more about how to use it to your advantage.",
            "Blink is about those first moments whether it's looking at an ancient relic or taste testing Pepsi & Coke. When applied to this book, my 'blink' was that this is going to be a great book. As I continued reading, I realize it lacks a huge amount of substance. For the most part the book is about a concept, blink, followed by numerous examples filling out the book.About halfway through, I started fearing that I wasn't going to have my curiosity satisfied. What I was hoping for were some detailed ways we could apply or improve our 'blink' ability. I wanted something practical, not just an intellectual tease.Also, some of the things the author says are just unsupported by any facts. I found him drawing conclusions from certain 'blink' situations, and I'd be able to reason out other conclusions. Maybe these are all addressed by his sources, but why not explain fewer examples of blink in detail, rather than discussing numerous examples from a shallow perspective? I'd prefer depth over breadth.I think many of you will like this book. As far as being a book about interesting anecdotes/stories, Blink does a solid job. I think the author is decent (but possibly overrated), so I'll most likely check out the Tipping Point in the future. However, I tend to be a curious person, and for me this book just didn't go in detail enough. Sometimes your 'blink' is just wrong.",
            "But, I didn't like tipping point. Anyway, Gladwell has some interesting points about how we reason and make decisions. First third of the book shows why we should trust our instincts, next two thirds shows why that's a bad idea. Not sure what he really believes. As with Tipping Point he expounds on some intersting social science studies that often but not always have something to do with the point he's trying to make at the time. The studies are interesting all by themselve, but sometimes I think they're there only to make sure the book has the requisite number of pages.",
            "There is just something about this book that holds it back from greatness...Gladwell writes well and presents his stories and illustrations admirably, but he bills this book to be an argument and it simply isn't structured to be a good one. The most glaring shortcoming of the book lies in its failure to recognize the role of preparation in the conditioning of the subconscious. He draws from examples of doctors, gamblers, and art historians to support his argument but fails to reflect the immeasurable effort and experience that positioned such experts to deduce and calculate in ways beyond appreciation.Flaws aside, this remains a provocative read from a fascinating voice. It does succeed in instilling or at least encouraging a sense of confidence in one's subconscious, and as such it will long remain a valuable (though potentially dangerous) book.",
            "This book should be read by anyone who is looking to add to there intellect and by anyone who is yearning to learn more and more about people. I think of this book as the next level to a movie like Crash. Crash is an icredible film that illustrates how connected all of us are, and how convaluted our decisions can become if we rely merely on prejudice and stereotypes. Blink tells us why we do that. Blink explains why we make these snap judgements and touches on how such snap judgements can be helpful or detrimental. Blink also talks about cultivating our subjective unconsciousness into something that we can use in our everyday life, whether it involves love or the work place.This one is for the human who are dedicated to take their intelligence to the next level.",
            "Great concept, but the book is simply too repetitive. After the first few chapters, you get the point - gut decisions are about as good as long, thought out decisions. It would've been a nice magaizine article, but didn't justify an entire book.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell takes E.M. Forster's famous instruction, \"Only connect,\" to heart in this fascinating little tome. Around a few key situations--a marriage counselor who can tell in 15 minutes if a couple will stay together, a group of art historians who figure out in two seconds that a statue is a fake while the museum buying it spends 14 months convincing itself the statue is real, a musician whose music is adored by those who give it time but shunned by focus-group testing, a group of police officers who make a tragic, split-second error in judgment--Gladwell builds a narrative that never ceases to engage the reader. How are our perceptions of the world influenced by the calculations our unconscious mind makes in the first moments of any encounter? Gladwell makes the case that these calculations can change everything, from who companies hire into positions of power (tall white men, more often than not) to the way we all know when someone's being insincere not by the words they say but the way our brain processes their facial expressions.If this sounds like a lot to cram into a 250-page book that can be easily read in one day, it is, and that is the book's chief flaw--we're left wanting more, a lot more, about all of the anecdotes introduced during the book. Gladwell is a master storyteller, and while we're happy to float from one example to another with him, at the end of the book I was left feeling like I'd touched only shallowly on a great many topics about which I'd like to know a lot more. But then, if the worst I can say about Gladwell is that he's piqued my curiousity, that's some pretty faint criticism, isn't it?Highly recommended.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell turns in a rare achievement: a clear, coherent book about a concept in science that isn't all too well defined, which draws from stories and examples that at first seem unrelated. In other words, a new synthesis, instead of another book on \"the story of _____(fill in the blank with your favorite scientific theory)\". \"The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\": it sounds like anathema to practitioners of careful, methodical science. Yet Gladwell presents a strong argument for the potency of thin-slicing and the rich, nimble workings of cognition that lie below our conscious level of experience.In this book we get to meet policemen in the heat of a chase, couples who seem happy but are actually, almost imperceptibly, frayed, a singer named Kenna, speed daters, and a rogue commander. The book itself is something of a \"blink\"--a light read, leaving me wishing he had included more detail about the concepts he was presenting. Lots of fun, however. It's certainly a fresh entry in the science section of the bookstore. I haven't finished reading his first book, 'The Tipping Point', but I think 'Blink' is much better.",
            "The author and publisher wasted a lot of time on this book. My time. From the start I was disappointed in just about every conclusion and assertion Gladwell made. For example, he said most doctors who were sued for malpractice were sued because they had bad personal rapport with their patients and not because they were incompetent or negligent. He said that in fact many of them were very good doctors. Then on page 43, he suggested that patients choose doctors on the basis of their inter-personal skills or personal feelings about the doctor. This does nothing to improve a patient's chances of finding the best medical help. In fact, using Gladwell's information (highly suspect) presented to describe doctors who get sued, points in the opposite direction - that a person should pick the doctor they hate the most in order to have the best chance of getting the best medical treatment. The rest of the book was just like this. At least up to page 188 where I finished the book. It is in the dumpster now to prevent some other human from wishing they had that part of their life back spent reading Gladwell's stuff. Go read V. S. Ramachandran's Phantoms In The Brain for some real information.",
            "There are some books that are the brain equivalent of cotton candy-- satisfying but with no real nutrition. There are other books that really stretch your brain but also throw it into cramps trying to understand what the book is saying, so you end up grabbing your head shouting \"ow ow ow!\"Blink is a great example of a book that really blows your mind without causing it any pain; it is an entertaining, accessible introduction to a fascinating but little known field of research known by various names such as \"adaptive unconscious\" \"thin-slicing\" or as the author likes to put it \"thinking without thinking\" (see, simple words, no brain cramp there!).What is he talking about here? Simply put, most of us divide our brains into two functional parts, the part that does things like control our muscles and breathing (unconscious) and the part that composes poems, makes mathematical calculations, and decides where to go on vacation (conscious).However, our brains have a third distinct type of function: subconscious processing. Every second we are awake our brains are compiling huge amounts of data that our senses are feeding us, then making complex decisions about that data instantaneously and continuously, then feeding those decisions to us subconsciously. We don't even realize this is happening-- it's often what we call \"our gut\" or \"intuition,\" but in reality it is an incredibly sophisticated and powerful processing ability that is beyond anything that a computer can do.Gladwell uses a variety of entertaining, thought-provoking, and sometimes alarming examples of both anecodote and detailed research to open our minds to what our \"adaptive unconscious\" is doing for us every day. For instance, one research project he mentions in the introduction found that,\"A person watching a silent two-second video clip of a teacher he or she has never met will reach conclusions about how good that teacher is that are very similar to those of a student who has sat in the teacher's class for an entire semester. That's the power of our adaptive unconscious.\"So, what does the book cover? Gladwell himself outlines three major tasks that he wanted the book to accomplish:First task: decisions made very quickly (through our subconscious processing abilities) can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.Second task: That we can learn about how this subconscious processing works and when it can be trusted and when to be wary of it.Third task: that \"our snap judgements and first impressions can be educated and controlled... as we can teach ourselves to think logically and deliberately (better), we can also teach ourselves to make better snap judgments. The power of knowing, in that first two seconds, is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few. It is an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves.\"Along the way, the reader is intrigued and entertained by a wide variety of little known research facts about human behavior and thinking. There is the marriage researcher who can predict divorce with 95% accuracy years before it happens by only listening to a couple have a conversation for a few minutes. How does he do it? By focusing on the ratio of conscious and subconscious positive to negative emotion expressed (a ratio any worse than 5:1 positive:negative is bad, and any expression of true contempt is a death knell).Then there is the online test you can take to show whether you have a subconscious prejudice against blacks (80% of whites and even 50% of blacks do). And how you can influence how patient a test subject will be by having them read sentences that have words like \"patient\" in them before they have to wait on someone. And his interview with a lady who can separate the taste of Oreos into ninety separate components (eleven of which are critical, we are told!). And the team that has calculated every possible anatomic facial expression, what they mean, how some cannot be faken or hidden, and even that the mere act of forming some facial expressions trigger the autonomic nervous system on a subconscious level (in other words, smiling really can make us feel happy!).So, by the time you turn the last page, how well does Gladwell succeed on each of his three tasks? For task #1, he does great. Time after time he convincingly shows the power and the wonder of our subconscious processing, and how often it is superior to what we normally think of as \"thinking.\" I gained a great deal more respect for the incredible things that my brain does and what an incredible creation of God it is.What about the second task, to understand how this works and when to trust it? This is much harder, because we are just beginning to do serious research on the nature and extent of our subconscious processing. He gives a few good examples of where our \"gut\" doesn't do a good job, such as when evaluating people by stereotypes such as height or race, or having to make certain decisions in rapid high stress situations. But that's really just the tip of the iceberg regarding the limitations of our subconscious.Unfortunately, with the third task (to make better \"snap judgements\") no book can deal definitively, because generally you have to thoroughlly understand how and why something is going wrong to correct it, and our limited understanding of our preconscious really hampers our ability to proactively improve and correct it.All in all, this is an enormously fascinating and entertaining book that is both an important and a fun read for anyone. To better understand both the power, extent, and limitation of how we \"think without thinking\" is of value to all of us. Unconditionally recommended.",
            "I've read both the Tipping Point and Blink, and I've felt the same way after each: Gladwell has a knack for describing fascinating research studies and observations, but the conclusions he draws from them are not always logical. I don't doubt the accuracy of his reporting of studies and events, especially since I studied a lot of the research he describes as a psychology major. What turned me off were the giant leaps he takes in drawing conclusions from his stories.For example, in Blink he describes a study that found that the amount a doctor is sued for malpractice is not correlated with the number of mistakes they actually make. Instead, it is correlated with the manner in which they speak to their patients. Domineering doctors are more likely to be sued, regardless of their skill. So far, so good. However, Gladwell goes a step too far in concluding that if you get a bad feeling when you're with a condescending physician, listen to that feeling because it's your intuition giving you a sign. A sign of what? All Gladwell has shown is that this doctor is more likely to be sued -- not that she or he deserves it.Overall, I think this is an entertaining read that tells many interesting stories. I just recommend reading it with a healthy amount of skepticism for Gladwell's conclusions.",
            "I confess, I was disappointed.Gladwell is one of a current generation of authors who wears his learning light with the benefit of a hip, punchy tone. He identifies a marketable idea and uses it to hang his various, jumble bag of ideas on. In Blink, the key is 'thin slicing' - in other words, the practice of judging a book by its cover.Does Gladwell think this is a good idea or not? At first, it seems yes. He kicks off with the story of the Kouros statue in the Getty Museum that an art expert was able to identify instantly as a fake, overriding the detailed analysis of the museum curators. Similarly in the case of Paul Van Riper, military maverick. He destroyed a team of military brains in a Pentagon war game by his radical, guerilla, instinct led tactics.Ah, but thin slicing is not always a good idea - take the case of Coca Cola. In blind testing, Pepsi always comes out on top. Coke CEOs changed the recipe based on this and the result was a disaster. Why? Because in a sip test, Pepsi wins, over a whole can, Coke is preferred. Should have done more tests.Then there's the difficult area of instant racial profiling. Gladwell mentions the common racial test which proves that many of us have an unconscious wiring that prefers whites to blacks. In split second decisions taken by armed police this can be fatal. Thus poor Amadou Diallo, an innocent black man in the Bronx pulling out his wallet from his pocket found himself pounded down with bullets. So thin slicing not such a good idea there.What is the lesson Gladwell is trying to teach us here? He says he doesn't aim for all encompassing, overarching theories. Fair enough, but this doesn't excuse blunt contradiction. Seemingly, we should set up structures to ensure that our minds become conditioned to make the correct decision in the thin slicing moments. Gladwell concludes with a description of how orchestras stopped discriminating against female musicians by setting up auditions behind screens so the expert committee could make their correct intuitions based fairly on the sound produced.So if we are already an expert with world class knowledge and the conditions are fair, it is okay to trust our gut instinct. If we are not, then it is better to stop and think things through to avoid disaster. This seems to be the lesson, but little is resolved at the end of Blink despite its many impressive fragments.George Bush trusts his instincts - does Gladwell support every decision he makes? The reality of things is complicated, and the useful substance in Blink is pretty thin sliced fare.",
            "The book is a very easy read and the lessons are absolutely fascinating. Some of the insights about humans, how they think, how they interact and how they make mistakes are downright scary. Unfortunately, I am left wondering what to do about it. If people make judgments in 2 seconds then how do I prepare for my next job interview? when should I work hard to overcome my gut feel about something and when should I just trust it? How would I do it anyway?...There is not a person whose life is not affected, on a daily basis -- both on the receiving and giving end -- by the phenomena described by Gladwell. Anybody who wants to influence people needs to be aware of Gladwell's warnings. For the real lessons, however, we will need to look elsewhere.",
            "The basic ideas of Blink are that people make snap judgments, some people are good at it, sometimes snap judgments reflect prejudices, sometimes too much information can cloud thinking, using both snap judgments and deliberation can be effective, and it's never too late to give up our prejudices (well, that's how Thoreau put it). Gladwell documents these banalities with anecdotes (some interesting, some not) and bits and pieces of marketing analysis and/or research.Really, there isn't much more to say about it than that. There is nothing here that is groundbreaking or original. In essence, this New Yorker writer wrote an extended magazine piece and put it out as a book. I think a better title would have been Snap!, but I'm not a marketing analyst and that's just a hunch!Borrow it and pass it on.",
            "This book seems to have been written only because of the success of the Tipping Point, not because of a worthwhile subject matter. It jumps from facts, to anectodes, without a strong enough argument. After reading the first one, I was very disappointed.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's obviously done his research. He writes clearly and articulately. But, I found Blink wanting.While the book starts strong, and presents a compelling argument, in my opinion I thought it kind of fizzled out. I would have enjoyed greater substantiation of the Blink theory.But, this is a pop psychology book. I'm sure the author was advised against inundating readers with too many facts. Still, when reading such a work, more supporting facts would have proven beneficial.It's certainly worth reading (and a fast read), but not necessarily justifiable hard cover material.",
            "While people from all walks of life will enjoy this book and benefit from it, I have been recommending it to all of my clients who must \"sell\" for a living. Many of the principles Gladwell espouses have been covered in greater detail elsewhere (many of the NLP books out there come to mind) but none have been so enjoyable to read and so easily understood. His notion of \"thin slicing\", and how it can at times provide a better answer in a \"blink\" of an eye as compared to more lengthy and robust analysis is right on the money.I also enjoyed the book's focus on the power of the unconcious mind and the examples provided that show just how easily influenced our unconcious minds are. Again, plenty of selling and marketing applications can be seen.In my opinion Gladwell has hit another winner following on the heels of the Tipping Point.",
            "Blink\" is carried along by the strength of the vignettes and the author's clear understanding of a very innate ability: interesting how even on this review list how much those belief patterns we all have. I loved the book and had to see what Malcom's latest book was about. Wow. I'm just blown away by the information in this book and the insight into why our first impressions are right sometimes and wrong other times. I highly recommend this book.",
            "Now that I reflect on this book, I think that the central message that it conveys is common sense: if you have deep expertise in a particular domain, then the snap judgments that you make in that domain may give you as good or better results than any amount of analysis. Even so, the book is still a very enjoyable read - the anecdotes that Gladwell uses to illustrate his points are each entertaining in their own right. I recommend the book as a good diversion, and as a source of interesting anecdotes across a range of topics (attributes to watch out for in assessing the likelihood that a couple will stay together, leading without micro managing, understanding the entire range of factors that influence purchase decisions (new coke), when to be wary of your intuition, etc.).",
            "The author makes compelling arguments about when quick decision making--in a blink--works and when it doesn't, but he doesn't highlight them, so they're easy to miss. I suggest reading it a chapter a time. Even though it's short, give it some time for the impressions to sink in.The examples and stories are stupendous. They'll stick with you. I still find myself referring to them months after I read it.",
            "Blink was fast and fascinating reading. The idea that subconscious mind constantly churns in the background, only to reveal its accurate conclusions as feelings and intuition makes a great foundation for this book. The author's insight and logic add great value to the well-researched facts.I found it to be profound and thought provoking. I am learning to trust my intuition.",
            "I enjoyed Gladwell's writing style and ability to incorporate data from many fields. In the end, I find his analyses a bit shallow, but useful food for thought.",
            "I breezed through this one. It could have been condensed into a long article but is worth it none the less. I think it is both provocative and thought provoking. I particularly like d the idea that a relationship of many years can be summed up in a matter of minutes by people trained to do so.",
            "Anyone that enjoyed tipping point needs to get this. I skipped over it a couple of times in the bookstore until I finally decided to spend my giftcard on it.

            "My writing would sound a little freaky -try weirdo sometimes- to the western mind; but as a Muslim, what so called Blinks is part of your daily life. You are somehow told to always try to understand by perception what you cannot see by your eyes.I have noticed that far-eastern philosophers and strategists entice their followers in the same manner: thanks God we are not alone in this one as well!!Well, the book is a mess, a kind of mumbo-jumbo worthless ritual, works as multiple articles in a newspaper as one of the reviewers put it; but not in a good one. In some chapters, we are told how brilliant it is to relay on blinks (or on that thin layer of your... whatever) and in others we are told how deadly this could be. In some chapters, mathematics approve the blinking facts, in others chemicals tests disapprove it... so all in all, there are no positive definite evidences, nor negative definite ones: meaning, there is no theory!!So why the author wrote a book about it? Is it to make money, or simply because he know how to write in fluid and smooth way? He really does; and I am almost confident that when he speaks he never stops. Because the book could be 100 pages less if you remove the chewing of the repeated fractions of it; which, somehow -if you are in an airplane for example- could make you believe that you are finding a series of rings that would form a chain ultimately.It is a simple fact that logic theories do not apply on spiritual matters such as perceptions. It has not been proven that brains have layers (like cakes). And it is dead wrong to write books telling us that there are such layers before real science discovers it.",

How anyone can consider Gladwell a serious author or innovative thought leader needs to complete more detailed research in to his writing.

I'm hoping it'll pick up the pace as I keep reading.",
            "This book questions if believing in scientific research or gut instinct is the right thing to do. The author talks candidly about his new Afro hairdo which brings him unwanted attention from the law, which questions if subconsciousness stereotypes our ethnicity. Blink questions if incidents such as Rodney King bashing by the police or the shooting of Diallo in front of his house are due to racism or due to our mind not functioning rationally when we have very little time space to spare. Subsequently, he questions if those \"temporary insanity\" is equivalent to people who has autism. Then, there are also discussions about food, drinks, and music tasting and how focus groups would have gotten them so wrong. The author continues to add that people know what they know when they like or dislike something but when they are told to justify why they like or dislike certain things, that's when things get pear-shaped. Does that mean just because we aren't able to justify things constructively, those results are proved less useful? We also then question if gut instinct is in fact a constructive symptom at the first place? There are also many illustrations about face reading, body reading and the author endeavours to justify that if we hone in our critical assessments of those subtle clues, maybe, we are able to \"educate\" our subconscious to discern certain situations and circumstances which ordinay people aren't able to pick up. This book is foremost thought-provoking and entices me to see things from a new dimension, or shall I say, a new paradigm shift. It's entertaining and highly enjoyable to read. Avid readers would appreciate that the author works with David Remnick who himself has written a few best sellers himself.",
            "I found the book very readable and highly entertaining where Malcolm Gladwell illustrates his point with many real life examples from the past.I am highly convinced with the presence and working of our subconscious (this point has also being published and argued by many other authors).Readers would be highly engrossed by experiments that enable one to tell how long a marriage would last, the effects of Pepsi and Coke tests, the autistic blindness that occurs when we were under extreme stress and many others.However, I do not find any useful methods or means whereby we could control and command this subsciousness to maximise its usefulness in our daily life. Maybe at this point in time, it is still an unknown universe.",

            "More detail might have been useful, but overall \"Blink\" does a reasonable job of describing and quantifying the once-elusive skill of \"intuition.\" Those who don't get it might do well to review Gavin de Becker's \"Gift of Fear\" or study the materials and research papers in the annotated bibliography.It is often said that muggers take about 7 seconds to size up potential victims. However, potential victims can be equally adept at recognizing threats. I saw this in South Side Pittsburgh a few months ago; a serial armed robber was apprehended because a clerk spotted \"suspicious behavior\" from across the street. What was this behavior? It wasn't waving a gun or screaming threats or looking like a character in a Spiderman comic strip with big teeth and a handful of chains and tire irons -- it was his simple failure to look like he had any destination and looking too long and lingering at passersby -- or their pockets and purses.\"Blink\" does not go into bad guys on the street as de Becker does. Nevertheless, he ranges through brand loyalty, prediction of divorce, and how we see each other -- for good or ill. It starts with gut responses to art forgeries (more reliable than the scientific testing) and ends with why music auditions are now conducted behind screens to the enormous benefit of female musicians who were once blinked out of competition.Loved \"Tipping Point\" and this is another excellent piece of work.",
            "While this book has some fascinating sections (see the section on autism, as well as the opening chapter) mainly I found Mr. Gladwell's latest release to be boring overall. Some of his examples of 'thin slicing' were far fetched to say the least, and he did not explore the other possible reasons behind the failure of certain of his examples. Read it for a book club, and everyone else liked it to give the author credit... but I won't read any of his other books on my own. After the interesting first chapter I was expecting better, and was let down. And there was absolutely no reason to include every muscle twitch in the body language section.",
            "it's not the deepest thing and it feels more like a compilation of other people's ideas... but is that bad? it's a very interesting read. and quick. I recommend it, but it won't change your life forever, I suspect.",
            "Like the author's \"Tipping Point\", \"Blink\" gives a fascinating hypothesis that will change your marketing perspective dramatically and forever, whether you're pushing yourself or a product.The only problem is: in both books, Gladwell's unique, little brainstorms could easily be reduced to about 25-30 pages without losing a thing. Once his theory has been expressed and examples given, there is not much else to say, but Gladwell goes on and on and on...and on. I have to admit, I could not make it all the way through either title. I felt like I was being repeatedly beaten over the head with the same information, just formatted in different ways.Would have made a great, A+ school report, but a book??? Now THAT'S marketing!",
            "Some insightful stuff, but not a lot earthshattering. Intuitive listening is the principle, and some time spent on how that is used against you (not actually your intuition, but basic assumptions that have you make snap judgements).The key is to be able to distinguish between intuition and preconceptions. It takes awareness, the book does not provide means to develop this. Instead it merely documents the phenomenon.There's probably a lot better material to spend your reading time on. Like The Tipping Point, I think the concept can be garnered quickly, you really don't need to read a whole book to get it.",
            "Gladwell, following up on his big literary hit, \"The Tipping Point,\" cranked out another interesting life/leadership/decision making book in \"Blink.\" The premise is pretty simple, go with your gut, and heart, before you go with your head. He gives example after example of research that shows your instinctive reaction is better than your thought out response. I agree, but also have known this since 2nd grade when our teachers told us to go with the first answer that we put down.Gladwell rightly also makes the point that these gut decisions can be patently wrong as well, getting into race relations and gender among other topics. The book kind of fades at the end after a strong start. Probably could have been 50 pages shorter. Anyway, you will enjoy most of this book - Joseph Dworak",
            "In the blink of an eye we gather huge amounts of information. The author, Gladwell, likens our brains to giant computers capable of processing lots of data in a flash. I found it fascinating how we can use this information either for survival purposes and / or we can apply our intuitive knowledge to any given situation. The author coins the term \"thin slicing\" to explain the process of applying one's intuition. He states that we are often suspicious of trusting this intuition because it's so quick and easy, even when it's on target. He relays experiments where instantaneous \"thin slicing\" has amazing results, sometimes in life and death situations, but also explains what can cause the skillto fall short. The reason often being that we are not truly living in the present moment.Two books that easily guide one into the present moment are Ariel and Shya Kane's \"Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment\" and \"How To Create A Magical Relationship\". These refreshingly fun and practical books effortlessly get the reader into the present moment where enlightenment resides. In an instant life can become brilliant and magical. Both of these intelligent books have shown me that life needn't be hard work in order to be amazing.",
            "Even the staunchest critic of Malcolm Gladwell's \"Blink\" should readily admit that his writing style is clear, concise, and extraordinarily accessible. While it is true that he focuses this literary effort upon only one core theme, (i.e., that our brains are capable of far more rapid clarity and raw computing power than we normally take advantage of), I find that the numerous and diverse real-life examples that Gladwell uses to illustrate this central theme provide considerable, and nuanced, food for thought. Of these examples, I find that those illustrating how the use of \"thin-slicing\" or rapid cognition can lead us terribly astray are particularly intriguing and thought-provoking.The juxtaposition of good and bad results leads to healthy self-examination. How is it possible that, in one example, the human mind can be trained to discern with astonishing accuracy (over 90%!)whether two spouses will remain married based upon a few emotional markers that are observed in the course of watching 15-minute videotaped segments of seemingly mundane arguments between spouses? Yet, in other dramatic examples, how is it that seemingly infallible physical senses are so warped by biases that they are able to betray the brain's recognition of reality? How are these same \"thin-slicing\" techniques as practiced by experienced police officers able to result in the senseless beating of Rodney King in one instance, and the tragic slaughter of unarmed Amadou Diallo in another? How often in everyday decisionmaking are our brains betrayed by the background noise of miseducated prejudices, or by information overload? What are the consequences of these failures for the world we live in today? What are the possibilities for our future if we can learn to overcome these cognitive failures?Gladwell's greatest strength is in telling the stories; summarizing plausible scientific explanations and theories for the good, the bad, and the ugly of thin-slicing; and finally, in raising the \"what if\" possibilities for a world in which we consciously seek to minimize \"the bad and the ugly\" influences on our powers of rapid cognition while simultaneously embracing the enormous (and largely untapped) powers of discernment that are locked away in our collective grey matter.Gladwell's greatest weakness in this work is that he barely scratches the surface in providing concrete solutions and strategies for taking our subconscious minds to a higher level of discernment. We are left to guess about what we should do next to raise our thin-slicing batting average. However, there is considerable merit in Gladwell's willingness and ability to illuminate the tough issues. For this reason, I give this book four stars instead of five. Perhaps a \"how to\" manual from Mr. Gladwell will be a worthy sequel.",
            "Blink is about the first reactions you have to things. Whether it is your first impression of a new co-worker or your gut instinct on the court, these quick contemplations have serious repercussions in our subsequent actions.If you think about that for a minute, you'll realize that the better your first impressions/gut instincts are, the better you will have positioned yourself for further action. Gladwell manages to take this one idea and fill it out to almost 300 pages. Not to spoil the book for you, but the premise is simply that the better you've trained yourself (priming), the more appropriate your \"blinks\" will be. Bad or no priming leads to poor initial reactions. Good priming leads to good initial reactions.There are a lot of allusions to real research, but no real research is presented. There are lots of anecdotes, but anecdotes are just helpful stories. On the surface, this book would seem to be a loser.What makes this book worthwhile is not its single insight. Rather, it is Gladwell's writing itself that keeps the reader interested. His breezy manner is welcoming and enjoyable. His recounting of anecdotes is interesting and funny. He never hesitates to put himself in the middle of the action, so we readers never feels like we're standing too far from the topic at hand.I liked the book, and took away from it its singular lesson. If you like this kind of pop psychology, you'll really like this book. It's accessible for anyone with a few hours to spare. 4 stars for a readable and enjoyable lesson in quick thinking.",
            "The author begins with the claim that when making decisions, we frequently place too much value on thought and deliberation, rather than intuition (or what he calls, \"thin slicing.\"). However, although using our gut feel can sometimes result in brilliant outcomes, at times it can be disastrous. Things like prejudice or even product packaging can interfere. The solution appears to be that one must first become an expert through in-depth study and practice. Further, the environment must be controlled to eliminate prejudice and other factors. Only then can a \"pure blink\" moment be created.I fear that many who don't read the entire book will mistakenly walk away with the idea that their practice of making decisions without doing their homework has been validated, when in fact that is simply not the case. Hopefully not too many have \"thin sliced\" the initial concept of this book and have read through to the end to get the full picture.Nick McCormick - Author, Lead Well and Prosper: 15 Successful Strategies for Becoming a Good Manager",
            "\"I believe . . . there can be as much value in the blink of an eye as in months of rational analysis\". Gladwell promises to show the reader that quick decisions can be \"every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately\", when we can and can't trust such snap judgments, and how they can be \"educated and controlled\". He fails. Entertainingly and informatively, but he still fails.Blink analyzes decision making in everyday life, sport, crime, war, and emergencies of various kinds. Each individual case study is presented admirably, showing how experts make their decisions in that particular field. The problem is that the lessons are usually not transferable. What can we learn from the following?-An art historian, with one glace, identifies as fake a statue that months of scientific tests had pronounced genuine. She can't say exactly why. It just doesn't look right.-A decision tree based on a few simple questions gives better results than the expert clinical judgment of doctors in an emergency room. The tree is derived from extensive statistical analysis.-Psychologists can make good predictions about the durability of a relationship (not perfect, but much better than chance) after watching a couple interact for only a few minutes. They do this by watching for signs they have picked up by watching hundreds of hours of slow motion videotape of other couples.-Professional tennis and baseball players believe in and teach techniques that they do not use in practice (\"roll the wrist\" and \"watch the ball onto the bat\" - the former causes injury and the latter is physically impossible!).-People who believe themselves unprejudiced reveal unconscious bias (with regard to race, sex etc) in word association tests and auditions.All of the brilliant \"blink of an eye\" decisions are grounded on knowledge of many previous decisions and their outcomes. (With a formal decision rule, the decision maker need not possess the knowledge personally, but it is guiding their actions all the same.) It seems an almost inescapable corollary that there is no generalised skill called \"good judgment\". One heart attack or statue is enough like another to permit useful generalisation, but heart attacks and statues are different enough that the rules for one are useless for the other. Sometimes decisions are made quickly because they have to be, and sometimes because there is no gain from waiting for more information or analysis. Sometimes the logic of the decision can explained rationally to a non-expert, and sometimes it can't. Expertise can come from formal training, or years of practical experience, or just following the instructions, dummy. And prejudice based on irrelevant information can bias even the most expert.(Scene: foot of bodhi tree. The Author, sitting in great serenity, is approached by a worshipful Reader.)Reader: So, Mr. Gladwell, can I learn to make quick, accurate judgments?Author: Of course. Just make sure that you consider all relevant information (but not irrelevant information, which might cause prejudice), and take as much time as you need (but no longer).Reader: How do you know which information is relevant and how long is long enough?Author: Well . . . you just know! You are an expert.Reader: But I'm not an expert. That's why I bought the book! [Reviewer's confession: I actually borrowed it from the library.]Author: Well, in that case I suggest you work and study hard for many years, and then you will be an expert.Reader: In decision making?Author: No, just in whatever subject you spent years studying.This is just how the world is, so it might seem unfair to blame Gladwell. But the whole book is explicitly about \"the power of thinking without thinking\", one might say intuition for short. The promise was insight into decision making in general, not just about the authenticity of art or heart attack treatment. An impossible promise, maybe, but all the more reason it should not have been made.",
            "I absolutely adore Malcolm Gladwell and pretty faithfully follow his work in the New Yorker and on his website, as well as his other works. (No, I'm not a stalker, just a fan hee-hee). However, I didn't love this book quite as much. I won't summarize it again here; I'll just leave a few quick complaints.1. It's possible to read the last two paragraphs of each chapter and pretty much get the gist of the whole chapter. If the paragraphs leading up to these last two were interesting and thought-provoking, I wouldn't do this, but by the end, I just wanted to finish.2. The pattern of each chapter follows a predictable course: introduce an eccentric real person, introduce a concept related to our brain's ability to make a snap judgment, and then combine these two to show how that eccentric person is or uses an example of neural abilities. Oh, and then follow-up with a quickie bit of advice on how to apply this to our own lives.3. None of the eccentric people or neuroscience is especially new or thought-provoking anyway.So, save yourselves some money and continue reading Malcolm's work in the New Yorker online.",
            "A book obviously intended to entertain as opposed to educate. While the premise is interesting, the science does not support the jumps that Gladwell makes. Read Damasio, Baars, or even Dennett to get a better idea of recent brain science from people actually in the field.",
            "the idea of the book, the fact that someone outside the narrow specialized groups of people who actually experiment with \"thin slicing\" put all the information in one place and presented it to general public is amazing.kudos to gladwell for seeing the thread and making it into a book of fascinating data. however, he did not manage to make the book itself fascinating. maybe its a criticism i should direct at his editors.book is slightly all over the place, it does not lead to a conclusion, it is more like a collection of information, ideas, stories, examples, anecdotes, many of which get rehashed almost ad nauseam.the good thing about it is that it gives a lot of sources for further research.worth reading, even if it leaves you a bit wanting at the end.",
            "The writing was very good and kept my attention and the book was enthralling. The whole point was how our mind is so powerful that a lot of times it can make instant decisions better than if we thought on something for a long time. It taught that \"gut instincts\" are a lot of times our brain making subconscious decisions based on our past knowledge and experience.Also the book showed how prejudice and ignorance can also cause the wrong instant decisions. It is a good read but it really had no final big revelation.",
            "To start with the positive, this book is very well-written and hooks you in. The author makes great use of interesting stories to highlight points or lead into new discussions. Unfortunately, the stories end up being told to lead you down a very specific path.This book is marketed and touted as being an interesting psychological and science-based discussion of the power of first impressions, gut reactions, and/or intuitive thought. However, the book fails miserably in the credibility department once the reader realizes the author's social/political agenda. After spending the better part of half the book making the case that snap judgments and shoot from the hip decisions are the key to a better life and more efficient workplace, Gladwell then plays the cards of racism and sexism to suggest, that these sole areas are reserved for careful thought and reason. Gladwell acknowledges at the end of the book in the acknowledgments that one of his motivations for writing the book was his concern for racial stereotypes. He is half black apparently, and was razzed by the police a couple of times in New York city because of his afro. Seriously, he talks about this at the end of the book.If Gladwell wants to write a book about race relations, that is fine. But this book is really a load of pseudoscience laid out to make the case that people need to watch their stereotypes. That last argument is a valid one, but after reading this book I felt that the presentation and marketing of the book was very misleading. In the end, \"blink\" does not make the case or provide any real evidence for the proposition that initial impressions are consistently better than logic and thoughtful decision making. In fact, with all the discussion of racism and sexism, Gladwell shoots himself in the foot and explains just how unfair, foolish, and even dangerous it can be to try and analyze a situation in the \"blink of an eye.\"",
            "The premise of this book is that accurate decisions often can be made without an abundance of data, and that in many situations, too much data and analysis actually hampers the ability to make an effective decision. In particular, Gladwell posits that persons with an expertise in a specialized area of concern often develop a keen sense for making quick decisions, a concept Gladwell refers to as \"thin-slicing\". At it's best, the book is well-written, evokative, and entertaining with its myriad examples and anecdotes. But at it's worst, we are left with merely a \"common sense\" awareness that experts can (and often should) rely on their \"gut feelings\" about situations within their specific realm of expertise. Reading this book left me asking \"so what?\" and wishing for practical information about how persons like you and I can develop skills to take advantage of thin-slicing. I think this work would have been more revealing if Gladwell had gone on to apply how concepts such as situational awareness can be used to enable persons to develop better perceptions of their environment and thus develop thin-slicing skills of their own. More information about situational awareness can be found at:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_awareness",
            "This is a subject of great interest to me: what kind of thought goes on that we are not \"conscious\" of. What powerful, parallel algorithms are executed by the brain, but outside of the step-by-step process we call rational thought. The anecodotes are great and give a real feeling for the wonders of the mind, but Gladwell's analysis seems a little sketchy. The fundamental criticism is that the experts he discusses have spent years learning their unconscious skills. Gladwell is obviously aware of the theory of learning, how sequential thought eventually gets turned into pattern-matching parallel systems in the brain, but the tone of the work is more \"magical\". This makes for fun writing, but leaves you feeling a little disappointed. I would really rank this as 3.5 stars...it is better than average, but there are lots of 4 star books out there one could read instead.",
            "One of the criticisms of this book is that is nothing more than a string of anecdotes. For the first few chapters, I was of the same mind. However, even if that were the case, the anecdotes themselves are interesting enough to keep one moving through the book at a rapid pace. In the end the stories drew me in, convincing me that there was a real phenomenon that the author describes as \"thin-slicing\" (making a decision at an essentially subconscious level based on a few pertinent pieces of data). I was intrigued enough to finish the book, hoping to see if Gladwell succeeded in his goals of describing where thin-slicing can be successful, where it fails, and what one can do about it.I would say that he had mixed success. Does he lay out a comprehensive blueprint for using thin-slicing - no. However, he does succeed in raising awareness about this phenomenon and where it might apply in daily life. In particular, the descriptions of situations in which thin-slicing breaks down are generalizable.For example, after reading the book, I am now more open to the possibility that bias might color my hiring decisions. The description of the results of blind versus unblinded auditions can be applied to any interview situation. In the future, I will take more steps to avoid this.Another example is the description of how our ability to read subtle clues breaks down in high-stress situations. I work in the medical field, and these lessons can be used to minimize decision-making failures in medical emergencies.Finally, the description of how over-analysis can paralyze judgment can be applied in any catastrophe. In the twin towers attack of 9/11, there are reports that workers in the second tower were told to wait for more information before acting. Some did as they were told. Others trusted their gut instinct that things were not safe and left. The ones who \"thin-sliced\" are the ones who lived.So - if you understand that this is a superficial introduction to a complex topic, I think it is an enjoyable and thought-provoking book. It reads very quickly. If you hesitate to pay for a hard cover that you will finish in a few hours, this might be one to put on your paperback watch list.",
            "Gladwell knows he's no expert--he's a researcher and a writer, a listener and a storyteller. Attempting to pull together the fascinating and at times mind-boggling stories and facts in this book into a neat package of conclusions is best left to academic experts and pompous quacks, so Gladwell steers clear. You shouldn't expect to read this book and walk away with six points to remember and apply. But you can count on enjoying the sharp writing and the engaging stories. It's unbelievable that a book about the human mental capacity to make split-second decisions could be this readable.This book ultimately adds up to a great big \"something to think about.\" But the earnest work and feeling Gladwell has invested in this book of real substance make mulling it over deeply rewarding.",
            "What is behind the split decisions that we make all the time? What mental processes go behind our first impressions and our snap judgments?Malcolm Gladwell, the best selling author of The Tipping Point, explores these questions in his challenging book Blink. Gladwell draws from a fascinating array of stories of people who rely on their first impressions--art critics able to identify a supposedly ancient Greek statue as a fraud in mere seconds, a psychologist who is able to predict whether or not a married couple will stay married after a single session, and a tennis coach who developed the ability to predict when one of his players was about to double-fault.What do all of these people have in common? According to Gladwell, these people all have the ability to \"thin-slice.\" Thin-slicing is the ability to draw conclusions by looking at a small piece of data--the moment takes to form a first impression. Thin-slicing is a survival skill, our nervous system is constantly taking in overwhelming volumes of information and \"thin-slicing\" is how we quickly make sense of that data.Gladwell respects the dangers of our ability to process information quickly. In Chapter Three: \"The Warren Harding Error\", we find that our thin-slicing has a dark side. Gladwell points out that inherit in thin-slicing is a susceptibility to fall victim to the power of stereotyping. We meet Warren Harding, who is widely recognized as one of the worst presidents in our history. Why did voters place him in office, in spite of his lack of qualifications? Thin-slicing. Harding was tall, handsome and looked the part of a leader. This chapter points out how thin-slicing is related to racial stereotyping.What are we to do with this new-found knowledge that we \"thin-slice?\" Gladwell suggest that while we can't stop thin-slicing, we can train ourselves to pay attention pertinent factors-- factors that will help us make accurate and valuable decisions in a blink.Gladwell has given us a brilliant read that entertains and informs. Gladwell effortless delivered a lesson in neuroscience to his readers. However there's nothing \"textbook\" like about Blink. Blink is a compelling, fast-paced read that is sure to get you thinking about how you think.THINK:* In Chapter Three, Gladwell writes about the Implicit Association Test developed at Harvard University. The test is designed to measure the connections that we immediately made between ideas. Visit www.implicit.harvard.edu and take the Race IAT. How does thin-slicing influence your view of other races?

            "I've always had these \"gut feelings\" that I couldn't explain, but which I've learned to trust. Much like a woman's intuition or a cop's hunch, there are things that sometimes you just know, even though an attempt at explaining them would only leave you questioning yourself. Blink explains these things, finally providing quantifiable meaning and terminology for the abstract \"hocus pocus\" of those things we just sort-of know, without knowing how.The chapters don't really flow the way I expect a book to flow -- each chapter is a wild departure from the last -- but they are tied together well enough to remind you of the overall theme. The up-side of this is that each chapter allows you to look at the topic from a completely different point-of-view.For me, the best thing about this book is the wealth of real-world material used to make examples of the ideas being presented. An amazing amount of leg-work must have been done to gather all this material and put it together under the common theme.Also, as a side-note, I find the concepts presented in this book to be useful to me as a software developer, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone who works in a design capacity in their own career.",

Hardly a week goes by that there isn't a new article about how to measure ROI, as requested by corporate headmasters to justify expenditures.

            "I picked up this book without any expectations but I was pleasantly surprised! The book is very well written, the author has a really nice style, he gives you a lot of details but it's not boring at all, organized and narrated in an engaging way. He not only talks about a premise but he actually supports it with a lot of scientific data. I like that a lot. The premise of the book is that you can have a really good understanding of something in a very short amount of time and spending more time on it does not necessarily result in a better judgment. I was a little skeptical about this at the beginning but the author did a really good job of supporting his thesis which is rare to find. He also provides a lot of evidence on when the snap judgments can go wrong. I feel like he's not really trying to prove anything, he just puts out data supporting his thesis and he also shows how his thesis can be challenged and at the end, he lets you decide and I think this is what makes his book unique. I'd say it's a book on human psychology but written for ordinary people. It's very engaging, easy to read but at the same time, quite thought provoking.",
            "Great audiobook, and I think perfect for that medium. I like to hear the inflection an author gives the work, and Gladwell read well. Gladwell also excels at story weaving -- starting an example, giving more information/research, then more story, then more information/research, then concluding the story.There are a lot of people I want to recommend read this book--my brother for the Marine who won the war game thing (reminds me a lot of an uncle), my friend the auggie cop for the story of the cops who shot Diallo. I was personally fascinated by the study of facial expressions and musculature and would love to read more about that.But the shortcoming of this book is that it doesn't really help one be more blink-ful, or blink-wise. It isn't a self-help book. There is also research in the book that I don't particularly buy the premise of, such as that having trouble categorizing disparate things into falsely dichotomous categories reveals culturally ingrained biases.But it is a fascinating listen, engaging, and I'll be looking for anything else he has written for his style is terrific.",
            "When I picked up this book, I was hoping by the end that I would be better equipped to make those \"thinking without thinking\" sort of judgments more reliably. While there was a lot of interesting and thought provoking stuff in the book, I felt like I missed the \"meat\" I was after, in that there was no lesson in how to apply everything. Mostly, the book just prompted me to look further into other research, which Gladwell summarized in the book.",
            "Most of us have had those moments in life, when we have made a decision in snap; probably because of lack of time as in an emergency or we heard an inner voice prompting us to take that decision. At a later date, we can not actually justify or explain as to how we were able to reach such a brilliant decision in almost no time at all. This book is all about those decisions taken in a blink.The book gives a fair treatment to the topic and talks about those snap-decisions, which were successful and it talks about those, which were disastrous as well. It also talks about in order to understand a person you don't need to spend a good amount of time with him/her; instead, a thin slice of interaction with that person will be good enough. The book comes up with lot many surprising and paradoxical statements and then gives logical and scientific explanations for the same. As an example consider this - \"we are a bit too quick to come up with explanations, for things we really don't have explanations for\".The book, by any stretch of imagination, is not a step-by-step guide on how to make better snap decisions or how to replace your elaborate decision making processes with snap decisions. It does talk about how a snap decisions based on our pre-judgements can have disastrous results. One very startling conclusion made by the book is \"information overload prevents you from not only taking a quick decision but even a correct decision\". Now this is contrary to our belief \"more informed you are, better are your decisions\".Where it is even difficult to write a paragraph or two about our intuitive decision making ability, the book really does a commendable job in discussing various aspects of it in such vivid detail. The book is full of examples which make it a very interesting read. At the end, you come up with more respect and trust for your intuition and suddenly you have discovered a new friend in form of your inner voice.",
            "This should really be titled \"Blink for People in Areas of Their Expertise.\" Gladwell points out that we should often trust our gut instincts more than we normally do. Fine. But he also points out plenty of instances when we should not. For example, he notes that we are more likely to sue doctors who are not nice, rather than those who screw up in diagnoses or operations. That's not an example of strong blink instincts. However, he notes that people who have LOTS OF EXPERIENCE IN A FIELD SHOULD TRUST THEIR INSTINCTS. Now that makes sense to me and my big gut!Also interesting: a story of a military guy who challenged his bosses in practice wars. The US military should have listened to this guy BEFORE Iraq.",
            "\"Blink\" is a very interesting book to read. Plenty of stories that really make you think about how people make decisions, even first impressions. The reason I gave this book 3 stars instead of 5 is that though the book is interesting, after finishing it, I'm unsure of how to apply what I have read or even if there is any benefit to applying what I have read. The book's focus is on the bad and good decisions that people or companies have made in the blink of an eye. But, even as I write this, I'm still left with -- what did I really learn and can I apply it? It's still a good read but I wish I would have borrowed it from the library instead of buying it.",
            "I thought that this book, though well-written and easy to read, didn't really teach me much that was useful. Perhaps my fault for setting expectations too high, but I thought this book would offer insights into how WE can go about improving these gut-decisions that we sometimes have to make. I don't think I got anything like that. Outside of some interesting data points on how accurate some people's instincts seem to be or how, with training, we can discern some of the causes underlying some of our decisions and prejudices, I thought this was just trivial.",
            "I have read several of Gladwell's books and this is my favorite. I find his ideas fresh and interesting and I love the way he looks at the world. Mr. Gladwell certainly has many \"sticky\" ideas; my husband and I still find ourselves often saying, \"So what's your blink?\" Meaning of course, What is your first impression? While we certainly believe the author is onto something when he says first impressions (often without even realizing you are having them) are accurate, there are certainly times when second and third and fourth are well deserved...and Gladwell does acknowledge this. Fun read.",
            "As I read this book, I could not help but feeling a sense of deja vu. Many of the concepts and examples that Gladwell presents have parallels in my own experiences. The knowledge that something is the right choice even before being able to consider all the circumstances can be both liberating and troubling in that you can spend as much effort second-guessing yourself as plodding through the decision process. In that manner, I really enjoyed the book as it seemed to reinforce that one could indeed experience effective thinking without thinking about it. However, I can also understand the negative reviews as well. The experience and enjoyment of the book can really be related in the old saw, \"for those that have, no explanation is required - for those that can not, no explanation is possible.\"",
            "I liked this science behind making fast decisions. Why speed dating can be more effective than dating services or viewing a person's home can be more revealing than a 2 hour job interview. This book proves the natural ability that so many of us have to make good, but unexplained decisions. However, Malcolm Gladwell also explains how our decisions and even self image can be manipulated prior to making decisions. A good read, but not a complete answer to why we make the decisions that we do.Doug Setter, author ofStomach FlatteningandOne Less Victim: A Prevention Guide",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's book takes research from existing fields and combines them with compelling case studies, accessible prose and entertaining style. He persuasively demonstrates that we can make intelligent and founded \"snap judgments\" in the blink of an eye. It really helps to break down what many of us entertain as instinct and intuition.It's great for professionals who want to advance their careers. This book discusses how we judge others in professional contexts, but that these seemingly \"gut feelings\" we have can lead to making effective decisions that will sometimes prove more beneficial than excess analysis or simulation modeling.The book gives broad examples of these \"intelligent\" blink-of-an-eye judgments, from how people can prevent fraud and save millions, win in simulations, judge others in professional contexts, as well as win over strategic analyses by using experience.It's one of my favorite books of all time and I refer to it when training professionals on First Impressions and it's inspired me to do more research, training and writing on the field. He's a trail blazer because he takes makes this area of interest fun and readable to the general public.",
            "Not perfect science, but like Freakonomics, a very interesting filter to see the world through.",
            "I got this as a gift for my husband. He likes listening to the CD's while driving to work. He really liked the information given in the audio book, which is word for word with what the book says.",
            "Gladwell presents snap decision making and gut instinct well. I think for those that have the ability to evaluate situations quickly either by \"thin slicing\" or just common sense this book will validate that your abilities have merit in the world. Not a book for everyone and those scared to make decisions without all the facts probably will be frightened by it.",
            "There are some relevant points in this book. The main point that I gathered from this reading is that our unconscious does some of the thinking for us, and decisions relating to this thinking are some of the best. However, if people were to think why they made these decisions, then they might not understand why they made the decision they made. Some of these decisions are based on intuition and result in good choices.I believe this book to be the scraps left over from the Tipping Point. This book is written along the same lines, but some of this material seems to have less of a scientific appeal for me. I believe there are many relevant points in this book.This is an OK read. I liked the Tipping Point and will see how I feel about Outliers.",
            "Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell is a book that teachers people to rely on there instincts. It's that first few seconds that your mind can tell if a stranger is friend or foe. According to the book we have to train our minds to focus on the facts. That sometimes less information can be a good thing in some instances.One should rely on their \"gut\" feelings too.By the way,",
            "I'm not quite done with the book but it is so interesting! I really like it and will probably read Gladwell's newest book, Outliers, as well. If you are interesting in marketing or communication this is a really great book to read. Highly recommend!",
            "Is blink worth thinking about. What do you think. OK. Just do not think.Confused! Well, now you are ready to read the book.Gladwell is a great thinker. He talks of instinctive decision-making process and starts of with how some are better at making snap judgments than others. To justify this, he tried (may be he did not think) on what could be a supportive crutch. Well, he meandered through game theory, probability, neuroscience, rapid cognition. He added a term called `thin slicing' for whatever two cents it was worth.Wow! Lazy bones and quarter brains like me, would just love this exciting piece! If some one who does not know me at all, can so confidently tell that I can take decisions in two-seconds, without thinking, why not!The examples are excellent. They are very diverse from police files, music, marriages, museum, and advertising. Great short stories that could well be a Bollywood flick. (Hmm...may be not! There is no running around trees). Also, one would need to remember how music on page 46 and is related to a police chase in page 256.Well if you are reading Gladwell, you are better off without thinking.Gladwell covers the mastery of thin slicing as a science. Excess information is a bane. Thin slicing can be done if you have practiced for 20+ years, with tons of information analysis. The example is about the two elderly women, who can clearly differentiate and articulate the thousands of flavors of margarine. God must have really given a real great number of taste buds. Quite interesting indeed!This is a very unusual book, well written, makes you think again and again and again. The later part of the book, talks of how split-second decisions have failed. The earlier part talks of how long scientific decisions fail. For heavens, take a stand.I have discussed with people, about this book and they have some extreme opinions. They better have. This book swings between extremities and we lesser humans in general have an aversion to grey areas. Think about it!I am still thinking, on what this book is all about. It is over 60 days, since I have read this book.Is it airy nothing or is it the essence of life.Is it an attempt by Gladwell to make some money without readers thinking;or is it an attempt to have readers make money without thinking.Yes, snap judgments are sometimes right and sometimes wrong.Yes, our analyzed judgments are sometimes right and sometimes wrong.Moreover, yes, the more the experience, better is our ability to make either of these judgments.Mr. Gladwell communicates the above three sentences extremely well using in the 288 page book using 4,172 sentences, 71,276 words and 412,533 characters.Well worth a read.(...)",

            "This book really delves deep into the psyche of the average person, a topic that I find interesting. It does it in a way that is very easy to follow and Gladwell manages to make otherwise dry academic content, dynamic and fun to read. This is a must-buy for anyone who enjoys psychology and human behaviour on a deep instinctive level.In summary, great book. If you're in doubt about what to read next, I would say get this book right now.",

            "1. The only reason I gave this a one star is that the material in this book (which is interesting) could have been markedly condensed. My \"blink\" thought prior to reading this book was, \"this is going to be a lame book... I'm going to be wasting my time on common sense stuff\" and as this book describes throughout the too many pages, I was right.2. Thus, unless you want to waste your time reading redundant and somewhat boring material, just read some summary reviews, get the gist of the book and live life.",

            "For me this book wasFreakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (P.S.)with a theme. A bunch of really cool studies that were centered around explaining the good and bad of our sub-conscious. Super fascinating and fun. One of those books that make you want to tell everybody about what you just read. The sad part was how it left me wanting a sequel called: \"Blink II, Training and Shaping Your Subconscious.\" It left me feeling like our thought \"locked behind the door\" can shaped into a skill set but it didn't explain at all how to really go about it",
            "I made the snap decision thinking this book would be good. I was wrong. He spends the entire book trying to explain snap decisions are right the majority of the time. I made a snap decision to buy this book because it looked interesting. I was wrong. I give him credit though because he tried to tackle a very \"gray area\" topic. Snap decisions are often times correct, and I hoped I would hear some logical reasoning to this. I had high hopes after hearing his first test, the Iowa Gambler test. He though, always fell short by never answering WHY anything was the way it was. Since he stated he had 3 objectives in the beginning of the book, and failed to meet any of them, I had to give him 2 stars.The entire book had the following theme:1) Tell a story that dealt with somebody making a snap decision instead of an informed one (always was a story that only would take place on the rarist of circumstances).2) Inform the user this thought process has a psychological name.3) Re-iterate story inserting psychological name all over the place.4) move onto a similar story or new chapter5) repeat",
            "Blink is a compilation of the work of certain researchers that is cobbled together to create a \"book\". There are different names than people I have studied, different research than I've previously read, but the subject matter, results and observations of the researchers is similar enough to not add a thing. In the end, the book is a fast read because it is slick and glossy, cotton candy for the mind.",
            "Malcom Gladwell has done an outstanding job examining a little understood process. While we all realize that we make many snap decisions, Gladwell looks beneath this simple fact to uncover how we make these decisions and when we make them poorly.He discusses four primary mechanisms:1. Our ability to recognize a signature that pervades a person's behavior or an object's coherence.2. Our ability to strip away unimportant information to make snap decisions -- or conversely to be confused by too much information.3. Our inability to make clear decisions when confronted with our built in prejudices.4. Our inability to make clear decisions when forced to make decisions too quickly in unfamiliar situations.Gladwell uses stories about real people to illustrate all these behaviors and thus gives us the ability to recognize new situations where our ability to make \"Blink\" decisions may be helpful or compromised.The stories themselves are also fascinating, for example there is a professor who can analyze 15 minutes of conversation between a couple and predict, with 90% accuracy, whether they will be divorced in 15 years. Blink explains how he does this in clear and entertaining language. A great read.",
            "Blink is the diet version of Gladwell's previous book: The Tipping Point. It is neither original nor thought provoking. The bottom line of the book is that we are influenced by our snap judgments in our everyday life. However, some persons are more capable than others in that craft. Yes, that's true. And Cialdini's book: \"Influence. The Psychology of Persuasion\" says the whys and the hows.",
            "When reading \"Blink\" it's important to keep in mind who Malcolm Gladwell is. Gladwell is a writer and reporter by trade. As such, he needs to bring things, that may otherwise get overlooked, to general public's attention. Moreover, Gladwell has to work through psychological studies that left to themselves serve as insomnia cures, but once translated into useful knowledge, have the potential to alter how people act and think.\"Blink\" is such a translation that makes the reader question, \"How do I \"know\" what I \"know\"?\" We have, according to some numbers, over 50,000 thoughts a day. And if you are not careful about what you are thinking, in a blink, you can have 48, 500 of the same exact thoughts the next day. If you hear and see something often enough, you come to believe it. So if we follow this reasoning, if we don't filter our thoughts we'll begin to believe that same material we re-play in our head each day (regardless of whether it is true or false). This locks us in a life of mediocrity. Gladwell proposes to crack the monotony by asking a question about the very foundations of our belief and \"knowing\" systems.Granted Maxwell's treatment and examples such as how an art expert can spot a fake sculpture in a second, and how day traders can overpower five-star generals in a two day war may seem cursory. Should he have delved deeper, Gladwell would have risked boring the readers and never attained the overarching goal of getting the masses to re-think their split-second thinking processes, judgments and decisions.",
            "Mr. Gladwell does a wonderful job of piquing the interest of the reader. I thought this was a very easy book to read and also very interesting. Some of the information I knew, but Gladwell has a way of clearly examining things that we may \"know\" but not know how to explain. I also have spent quite a bit of time at the Implicit Association Test, looking at the unconscious biases that I may have. I found that to be one of the most interesting things in the book. It makes perfect sense, but I had not heard it so succinctly posed and I have had to look at my own unconscious responses to others. I would highly recommend this book if you wish to challenge your sense of self and look a little deeper into how you personally operate. Great book, great read.",
            "Blink is comprised of a combination of multiple stories that are used as examples to demonstrate Gladwell's ideas of how individuals think and how decisions are made. Gladwell focuses on how important first impressions are and how individuals focus on the small things that eventually led him to the power of thinking. In my opinion this is a book for anyone, it is very insightful for any profession and every day life occurrences. It encourages one to trust our instincts and describes the power of our intuitive ability. Blink would also be good if one is curious about how the mind works and the process of thinking. I would recommend this to an individual who enjoys books with case-studies and is looking for a good book that is a fast read. I enjoy reading books with case-studies and I believe that they help one to understand an idea and technique, but I thought Gladwell used too many. I thought he could have fully developed some of his ideas and eliminated others. In addition, I thought he developed his ideas in a chaotic manner. In some of the case studies he started explaining the story and then stopped without finishing. He would then start another case study and finally later on the chapter he would go back to the first one. It made it hard to follow and some of his ideas were confusing. I often did not understand how the case studies fit until he finished them in his later sections. I think his greatest flaw is his randomness. I enjoyed the stories and I found his ideas and techniques insightful, but I believe they would be easier to follow and more effective if they were written in a more organized manner.",
            "A lot of prior reviewers seem disappointed in this book, but I found it interesting. Maybe it is because I spent 15 years as a newspaper editor and the past 21 years as a domestic violence counselor. Perhaps I have more experience with \"snap judgments\" and with \"social science research\" than many readers. Author Gladwell contrasts the two ways of making decisions, and attempts to explain why the quick, instinctive opinion often works out better. The book has a little too much repetition, and jumps from one situation to another without always connecting the former with the latter effectively----but those are small flaws. Consider this short work an introduction to the topic of instinctive responses, not the final word, and you should be content. His section on traumatic, temporary autism as an explanation for things such as police officers shooting suspects who turn out not to have been threats will be controversial, but makes sense to me. So does his contention that \"contempt\" between spouses is the best predictor of divorce. I'm glad I read it. If you are cautious due to the reviews which are not as positive as mine, just go fetch your copy at the library, as I did. Then, if it does not hold your interest, you are only out a little time, but no dough.",
            "This book attempts to provide insight into intuitive decision making. Gladwell starts strong with his prescription for data selection reinforced with fascinating case studies, but the book loses steam. I definitely prefer his previous book, The Tipping Point, which is more substantive. For solid information on decision making and optimal choices using logic with intuition, read Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self.",
            "When I first heard about this book, I assumed it was about how an untutored, hasty, first impression would be just as accurate as a thoughtful, studied examination. I was wrong on two counts. To begin with, it seems the judgement formed in an instant may be more accurate than the one created with labor and agony. Finally, the rapidly formed judgement is not an impetuous, irresponsible act. The attention of the cognoscenti focus on points that make a difference. Excessive information is ignored as obfuscating clutter. In a blink, judgement is rendered.Certain jobs require snap decisions as a matter of course. Soldiers, police, firemen, athletes and courtroom lawyers have jobs that cannot abide quandries. How do they ready themselves? Clearly the successful ones have prepared for their momentous minutes with countless hours of training. If you have only your first impression- count on soon being wrong, ignored, disgraced or dead.Malcolm Gladwell applies psychological observations to the real world with a delightfully engaging narrative. However, I am concerned about --Blink's-- lessons being misapplied. Recently, I saw a political roundtable discussing the book and a pundit suggested that the successful politicians were the ones whose values and vision were so ingrained, they could make snap decisions and never regret it.How we love those leaders of certitude who valiently sail the course of righteousness. What citizens of a democracy most need is to recognize when obstinacy, prejudice and weakness is concealed by a patina of bluff and guile. I would much prefer to be led by an expert who assembles other free-speaking experts, takes a vote and abides by the majority. (See --The Wisdom of Crowds-- by James Surowiecki, who like Gladwell, writes for --The New Yorker--.) That said, I have nothing but praise for this book's observations.",

            "Gladwell is an impressive author, and his understanding shows in this book. He applies the principles he discusses in \"The Tipping Point\" and his numerous articles in the writing of a book that is catchy and easy to read without sacrificing information. Many of the conclusions he draws are surprising and challenging to how you view everything from yourself to the justice system, but the arguments are strong, drawing on both example and research data. All told, an excellent book.",
            "We've all had the experience of knowing something we haven't really meshed through cerebrally YET ... where does this come from? Malcolm Gladwell has put it into works for us! If you are the type who likes to muse over the roots of your thoughts and their interaction with other thoughts, and well ... thinking in general, you will love this book. Not only is it informative but has offered me a greater confidence in my \"initial responses.\" So many times I've said to myself, geez I knew that why didn't I act on it?! Because my sociatal-thinking told me the data hadn't been chewed on enough. Don't you think there are some thinking processes that do not require in-depth analyzation? That they are strong enought to stand on there own! Well ... read the book!",
            "It's rare indeed that objectivity is brought to bare on a subject as ethereal as intuition. Malcolm Gladwell seem to have made strides to build a bridge that focuses our attention on this phenomenon, and to outline a possible technique to making it a practical ability. 'Blink' is a 'must read' for anyone looking for a clearer understanding of that inner voice, that sometimes come to the forefront, and demands to be heard in one's decision making.",

            "I enjoyed this book much more than Gladwell'sThe Tipping Point(which I rate a 4 out of 5). Gladwell presents inBlinksome wonderful insight into our ability (and in some of us our super-ability) to intake lots of information, assess and analyze it, and come to some final decision literally in the blink of an eye.I've personally been interested in the topic of intuition and how we might be able to develop it as a skill. Gladwell's work has enabled me to further my understanding of intuition tremendously. He gives many examples and provides a lot of scientific explanation of how it works, or at least how it might work.Gladwell also provides several case studies in a variety of areas ranging from assessment of rare antique art to predicting divorce in married couples. For the case studies alone Blink is worth the price of the book.Best Of The Book: Gladwell's chapter on \"Listening with Your Eyes\" and how we often allow non-pertinent factors, such as what we SEE, to be the deciding factor in major decisions. I particularly enjoyed his description of how Abbie Conant became First Trombone for The Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. `Course it's in the conclusion of the book and you really should read the earlier chapters so you get the full impact.I recommend the book for anyone interested in how we can make snap decisions and, depending on our knowledge and expertise, often be correct.I hope you enjoyBlink.",
            "This book was an interesting read until I reached the chapter \"Seven seconds in the bronx\" I disagree that police officers should be taught to look at a persons face when most officers are killed by the HANDS of another person. I agree that a lot can be learned by evaluating a person's facial expressions; however, I am always skeptical about persons who second guess anothers actions. I had an appreciation for the book as a whole. I would never encourage a police officer to focus on an offenders facial expression, PERIOD! Take a ride in a patrol car and see what body part you focus on.",

            "I enjoyed this book very much! So many examples of \"blink\" moments are included, from music to art to law enforcement, to military, etc. Great reading!",
            "This book is fun to read and thought-provoking. Gladwell makes the point that much of what we do is necessarily based on snap judgments. For people who understand a subject thoroughly, such quick thinking is a good thing. For people who are ignorant of important facts, snap judgments are often very wrong indeed. Gladwell uses the amusing example of Warren Harding, whose rise to the presidency was based on nothing more than good looks and pleasant manners. In office Harding's ignorance led to one poor decision after another. This sort of thing is all too prevalent today. In my opinion, it's one of the best explanations available for the lackluster political career of George W. Bush. An increase in ignorance is unfortunately a characteristic of our day; Bush's lack of knowledge is common among voters and politicians alike. The result? Believers in astrology and ghosts are everywhere. Most people have no understanding of evolution, or even of such basic facts as the origin of the irreplaceable oil we burn daily.One of Gladwell's main ideas is that humans tend to overestimate our own rationality. However, he also points out that there are ways to organize society to compensate for these tendencies. Here's to hoping we succeed.",
            "This book is full of highly entertaining and thought-provoking psychology studies, true life stories, etc.But the oraganization as a book has major flaws. Here are three:1. TMIS - Too Much Information Syndrome.2. Hard-to-follow Organization, from cover to cover.3. Evidence doesn't support main arguments.****************************************1. TMIS - Too Much Information Syndrome.****************************************One hugely ironic example: When the author tried to demonstrate that when doctors at Cook County Hospital Emergency Department treat chest-pain patients, many seemingly important medical details (e.g. drinking habits) can be ignored (for more accurate diagnosis! yes, no kidding!) and therefore help more patients, he writes:\"[The department head] was raised in New York City, the product of a classical Jesuiteducation: Regis for High School, where he had four yearsof Latin and Greek, and Fordham University for college,where he read everything from the ancients to Wittgensteinand Heidegger and thought about an academic career inphilosophy...\"How are these details related to the main message?And they are not even remotely important at all.*******************************************************Second, Hard-to-follow organization, from cover to cover.*******************************************************Just two examples among many:The introduction chapter tells the reader about the three tasks of the book. That's nice, but if you want to find them, good luck. They are buried in the middle of 2nd section:\"The Internal Computer\" (and first two tasks are in the middle of paragraphs).The closing chapter tells us the two lessons of Blink (sort of).The first lesson (\"We are often careless about our snap judgement\") isn't obvious until the reader encounters the mentioning of the second lesson and it is at the third sentence of second paragraph of page 252:The second lesson, which begins as a second sentence in last paragraph on page 252, is about we can make our snap judgement better.*******************************************************Third, Evidence doesn't directly support main arguments.*******************************************************A pair of contrasting examples of this flaw are in Chapter 4: Creating Structure for Spontaneity. From the title I'd assume the author will show us creating a structure can spawn (good) spontaneity (and maybe how to create a structure, etc.)The author presents two long, long cases.First case is about a Pantagon war game in 2002. This includes an inspiring account of the more \"spontaneous\" team won the war game. But not much is said about how structure was built or how structure helped or what the structure was.Second case is about Emergency Department of the Chicago Cook County Hospital. This example has a stunning tale of how doctors used a structured approach to improve their treatment of patients. But nothing is said about \"spontaneity\".******************5 stars for nuggets of fascinating information in this book.2 stars for many flaws for it. Round up to 4 -:)",
            "It's good to exposed to Gladwell's thinking. It can stretch you a bit.And we need to encourage good writing-that is, writing that is clear, intelligent, and crisp.All that said, there's little other than the above of value. It's remarkably thin, actually, especially on reflection. His apparent point of view is that snap judgments are good, except when they aren't.And everything he offers suggests that snap judgments-or at least those he discusses-are neither snap nor judgments. They are conclusions based on years of experience.In the end, this book dissolves into very little. You cannot say you learned much from it, or even were coaxed toward deeper understanding and insight. All you can say is that you may, or may not, have enjoyed the ride.That books like these are our best sellers may be the most compelling information to glean from all of this. There's not much here here, to steal and paraphrase from Gertrude Stein. .All this said, I will at least scan his next book, simply because the author gets access to some interesting studies on human behavior. We're better served by his New Yorker articles, not least of all because they are as long as they need to be to impart the information.Maybe a 3.5. And I do hope he keeps reporting, because he covers what others do not.",

If I ever hear the term \"thin-slicing\" again, it will be too soon!While some of the examples were good, there was just too much repetition. Basically, it reads like a textbook. I expected to learn how to use the information provided, rather than read the same examples over and over again.

This something is cognition...and sometimes your hunches are right and someitmes they are wrong, but here are some cool stories about lucky guesses! That is basically all Gladwell writes about. He tries to impress you with stories of the rogue general who beat the big bad US, and about the classical archeologist who just felt something was wrong. He tries to tell you about the 1920 election and the most perfect yet ugly chair. He tries to explain that all of these ideas are related to a power none of us can control or really understand.

Paint drying boring.Gladwell's epiphany: humans make quick subconscious decisions that are often correct. However, sometimes subconscious stereotypes can result in wrong decisions. Duh.If my review can save two people the pain of purchasing and attempting to read this book, at least I will have gotten some value out of the book.",
            "After his bestselling book brought the phrase \"tipping point\" into popular usage, which is that moment when an idea, product or concept suddenly catches fire with the population at large, Malcolm Gladwell now gives us two more phrases that are likely to become equally well-known: \"blink\" and \"thin-slicing.\"We \"blink\" when we think without thinking. We do that by \"thin-slicing,\" using limited information to come to our conclusion. What's interesting is that in our age of information overload, according to Gladwell, we often make better decisions with snap judgments than we do with volumes of analysis.The book opens with what reads like a heart-racing detective story about the discovery of a statue that initially fooled one group of art experts for being genuine and was later shown to be a fake by another group. The first group had exhaustively studied and analyzed the statue. Members of the second took one look --- \"blinked\" --- and declared it suspect and ultimately a forgery. And they were right. Why? How did they know? Why was the first group so wrong? Are there dangers in overanalyzing? Are we always right when we blink? Can we be wrong, even dead wrong? What is the science behind blinking? What can we learn from this phenomenon?Gladwell addresses these questions and gives a wide range of examples of blinking from the worlds of gambling, speed-dating, tennis, war games, the movies, malpractice suits, popular music, and predicting divorce. Interspersed are accounts of scientific studies that partially, but never completely, explain the largely unconscious phenomenon that we have all experienced at one time or another in our lives. Nevertheless, the hypotheses, the scientific experiments, and the examples are very interesting.A researcher tells the story of a firefighter in Cleveland who answered a routine call with his men. It was in the back of a one-and-a-half story house in a residential neighborhood in the kitchen. The firefighters broke down the door, laid down their hose, and began dousing the fire with water. It should have abated, but it didn't. As the fire lieutenant recalls, he suddenly thought to himself, \"There's something wrong here,\" and he immediately ordered his men out. Moments after they fled, the floor they had been standing on collapsed. The fire had been in the basement, not the kitchen as it appeared. When asked how he knew to get out, the fireman thought it was ESP, which of course it wasn't. What is interesting to Gladwell is that the fireman could not immediately explain how he knew to get out. From what Gladwell calls \"the locked box\" in our brains, our fireman just \"blinked\" and made the right decision. In fact, if the fireman had deliberated on the facts he was seeing, he would have likely lost his life and the lives of his men.It took well over two hours of questioning for the fire lieutenant to piece together how he knew to get out. (First, the fire didn't respond as it was supposed to; second, the fire was abnormally hot; third, it was quiet when it should have been noisier given the heat.)One take-away from the book is that how we blink is a function of our experiences, training, and knowledge. For example, prejudice is so unconsciously woven into our society that, despite our best intentions, at an unconscious level it can lead to really bad blinks. This is partly why tall people are frequently seen as natural leaders when there is no basis in reality for that belief. And, in the case of the Amadou Diallo killing in 1999, it is why four policemen incorrectly thin-sliced a situation and wound up killing an innocent man by mistake.Gladwell is obviously fascinated by the phenomenon of blinking. Properly understood --- and properly prepared for --- it is a valid way to make decisions. Gladwell says, \"A world where snap judgments and thin-slicing is taken seriously is a better place.\" I know some people who might object to that viewpoint, particularly when it comes to decision-making in foreign policy, but if you want an entertaining read, fast-paced, rich in entertaining anecdotes and some unusual scientific research, then BLINK is worth picking up.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's Blink is about decision making, in particular about making decisions on the spur of the moment. Gladwell's contention is that, however counterintuitive it may be, snap decisions are very often superior to those resulting from long hours of thought and research: having too much information, it turns out, can impede decision making. The trick is that the person dong the deciding must be sufficiently informed about a topic that he can, consciously or not, isolate the salient factors in a given situation, disregarding extraneous information, and come to a conclusion based on them, a process known as \"thin-slicing.\"Gladwell peppers his book with intriguing examples of real-life thin-slicing: a fireman's snap decision while spraying flames in a burning kitchen to order his men out of the building--moments before the floor collapses; the immediate certainty of a number of art experts upon looking at a particular statue, a Greek kouros which exhaustive tests had indicated was genuine, that it is in fact a modern forgery--a suspicion later proved correct. In these cases the experts could not explain at once the reasons for their snap decisions. Their unconscious minds had sifted through enormous amounts of information--about the fire's behavior and sound, for example--and had spat out a conclusion--the floor is about to collapse--without their being aware of the thought process. The examples Gladwell unpacks for us are unusually dramatic, but in fact we thin-slice all the time, when we interpret people's facial expressions, or decide whether a potential suitor is desirable or not, or determine whether it's safe to cross a heavily trafficked street.Snap decisions, Blackwell demonstrates, can be very powerful, but they can also sometimes be very wrong. Gladwell explains how stress and the weight of our prior associations with what we're observing can pervert our first impressions. It is in this context that Gladwell discusses the police shooting of Amadou Diallo in the Bronx in 1999, a tragic case of individuals in a stressful situation being unable to \"mind read,\" to properly discern another's intent from his behavior and facial expressions.If my explanation of Gladwell's argument has been at all dry, then I have done his book a disservice. Blink is a simply fascinating read, studded with little mysteries--about military strategy and emergency rooms and Warren Harding and the Pepsi Challenge and innumerable other topics--that will keep readers glued to the page. Blink is also well researched and well argued and--and I don't say this lightly--stylistically flawless. This is nonfiction at its best.Debra Hamel -- author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in ancient Greece (Yale University Press, 2003)",
            "I picked up Blink solely on Gladwell's prior work, The Tipping Point. I should have allowed thin-slicing to work and passed this by.Oh, if you wish to read what dozens of other researchers have to say about snap judgements and why we make them, it is a passable read. However, if you are looking for the application in your own life...look elsewhere.Along about page 100, I wanted to put it down because it seemed to have little to say. Another thin-slice I missed. By the time I got to the end of the book, I felt like my time had been wasted...not to mention the money. The good news for me is that I got the book at a considerable discount.I agree with one of the other reviewers here, i.e., \"take a nap, instead...\"",
            "Malcolm Gladwell is a talented writer. He summarizes some good researchers' work in a very readable way (i.e. the thin slices research that was popular in academic circles a few decades ago). You'd have to be a professor to not learn something from this book, and you'd have be a Pulitzer prize winner to not appreciate the quality of the writing. These positive features earn the book 4 stars in spite of what I view as a profound flaw.The major problem with Blink is that it has no explanation for when to trust our instincts. The book title suggests that non-cognitive and rapid judgments are good. As amply pointed out by other Amazon reviewers, this idea is ludicrous. Gladwell provides no roadmap of when to trust our first impressions and when to attempt to override our first impressions.First impressions are sometimes good and sometimes horribly wrong. Now what? Gladwell provides no answer.In my own academic research, I investigate what I call the \"lizard brain\". We use our brain's prefrontal cortex when we attempt to think rationally; however, our behavior is often influenced by the rest of the brain, the lizard brain.In Gladwell's language, the lizard brain is sometimes right and sometimes wrong. The answer to knowing when to trust the lizard brain and when to shackle the lizard brain, I have come to believe, is to understand the logic of the lizard brain.The lizard brain is great for lizard activities like finding food and shade. Yet it can be terrible for other decisions. By understanding the lizard brain we can figure out when the lizard brain will help or hurt.\"A pile of sundry facts\". The great biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky said that behavioral study without underlying theory is ultimately unsatisfying. With the light of the correct theory, everything makes sense, but \"Without that light, it becomes a pile of sundry facts -- some of them interesting or curious, but making no meaningful picture as a whole.\"Because Gladwell does not understand the logic of the lizard brain -- the source of so called non-thinking -- he has produced a series of fascinating stories that make no meaningful picture as a whole.Terry BurnhamCambridge, Mass",
            "The points Malcolm Gladwell makes in \"Blink\" are immediate and straightforward. Trust your intuition. People who overanalyze problems will most likely come to flawed conclusions and stale perspectives. Malcolm sets out the ideas in story format that is easy to read and maintain the line thought. Not only is intuition often your best guide to reach logical conclusions, but the process can be streamlined to aid decision making.Whether or not to read \"Blink\" is an easy decision. Do it. And enjoy the process.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell tells an interesting story about the decisions we all make in the first 2 seconds of a situation. The book is fascinating at times and confusing at others. I bought this book thinking it would help me better understand how these decisions are made and guide me on how to make \"better\" snap decisons. While Gladwell enumerates throughout the book on the point that these decisions are in fact being made averyday he does nothing in the way of teaching the reader how to hone this innate ability to make more accurate judgements. Entertaining and easy to read but not really educational.",
            "This book is based on the observation that, for better or worse, we make decisions in the blink of an eye and that the ability to \"thin slice\" information is often crucial for timely action. This is all well and good, but I was hoping for information on how to cultivate this skill, avoid misusing it, etc. All the book gives is example after example, after example. Might be worth reading if you've never thought about it before.",
            "This book is a fast and interesting read, but don't let that mislead you: the information Mr. Gladwell presents is extremely substantive. What could be more crucial than having our eyes opened to the way we stereotype and misconstrue important information (such as peoples' characters and abilities) in the first few seconds of perception? Of equal interest is the way that \"thin slicing\" of limited initial information can at times yield incredibly accurate results. This book has helped me, as an artist, understand how art is perceived and perhaps how to better evaluate my own work. There are times we should trust our gut instincts (our lives may even depend on it), and other times when our judgments could be vastly improved if we were to consciously override our initial impressions or screen out prejudicial information. While making the distinction between these courses of action can be tricky, training exercises and other techniques are available which would make operations such as law enforcement safer and more effective. Mr. Gladwell offers a concise and well-researched roadmap through this complex but fascinating terrain.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's follow-up to \"The Tipping Point\" is not just an interesting read. He tells us how companies try to get inside our heads through marketing strategies, how the U.S. dismissed a creative \"war games\" enemy's tactics just before heading into Iraq, how we think wthout thinking. Snap judgments can't always be right, but Malcolm shows up how and why we \"thin slice\" and are not even conscious of the process. A brilliant book. Involved, but overly complicated, easy to understand and each page is there to make you think. And you will think about the snap decisions we ALL make on occasion.",
            "My sister recommended I get this product and I generally take her advice, so I jumped on this without thinking. I am easy to please, a good story or meaningful self help idea is always appreciated.Having said that, I would not recommend this product. It felt to me as if the author was writing a PhD dissertation with this audio. He went into such colorful detail on tangential themes in order to attempt to relay his points that it became difficult even in the car to sit and listen to. His points were not that difficult to relay, but one got the idea that he had to fill space/time, and a lot of it. That is exactly what he did.Unfortunately, I can't even say that his ideas were very creative. It was a serious chore to listen to the 6 or so CDs, I NEVER would have sat and read this material.For those people that prefer to get to the meat of a subject and do not have the luxury of having immense amounts of time needlessly wasted, I cannot recommend this product.",
            "The Big Idea in this book is that it's possible to know something without knowing why we know. We need to accept this - and sometimes we''re better off this way. If we all took our instincts seriously we would live in a very different and better world.Analyzing why we think what we think or know what we know can radically change our thoughts. Often people give extremely different answers to a question when they need to explain or justify their answer - introspection can sabotage solutions.Our \"Adaptive subconscious\"\" makes these quick decisions for us (it has nothing to do with Freud''s subconscious, The Oedipus complex, or any other such psycho-mumbojumbo). It throws away most details and concentrates on what it considers to be most important in order to make quick decisions. In general it is remarkable at making great decisions very quickly with very few facts available.Our subconscious can certainly make errors as well. For example, Warren Harding, perhaps the worst US President ever, \"looked\" presidential. Everyone thought he would make a great president based on his appearance, but apparently they were extremely wrong! Another example: US CEOs average approximately 3 inches taller than average. There is no link between CEO ability and height, but certainly an ingrained bias that tall men are leaders (or something like that).This is an engaging book with many well-researched examples, each of which is fascinating in it''s own right. This was a hard book to read in two days -- I wanted to read it cover to cover. It was so riveting that although I started reading it at night when both mentally and physically exhausted, I seriously considered making coffee when nodding off around midnight so I could continue reading!",
            "Blink is an intriguing essay that dives into the human mind and explorers the power of the unconcious mind. Gladwell catches the reader right from the start and tries to get the reader to come to become more self-aware of his or her unconcious mind through reading the book. Gladwell makes it very clear from the beginning of the book what he is trying to prove. First, he wants to prove that the decisions made instinctly (snap-judgments) are just as valid and sometimes even more valid than decisions made through concious analysis and rationalization. Gladwell provides a plethora of examples to aid this argument, and although quite interesting, he only proves that snap judgments are worthy of more attention than they currently receive. However, Gladwell is unsuccessful in proving that snap judgments are just as valid as a concious, rationalized thought process. He provided many examples; however, at times he is \"blind\" to the comfort and logic through a concious thought process. If he were to give more credit to the importance of the concious mind, his argument regarding snap judgments would have been more effective. Gladwell's second task was to prove that we should trust our instincts. Again, he provides plenty of examples to support this, and offers detailed analysis, but the argument is nothing more than an intriuging theory. Gladwell's third task is to prove that snap judgments can be educated and controlled, and he is very succesfful with his argument. Through his examples of the IAT Tests and War Games in chapters 3 and 4, Gladwell proves that snap judgments can be trained, and that the snap judgments of experts in certain areas are more valid than that of the \"Average Joe\". In conclusion, Gladwell's overall argument isthat if snap judgments are seen as valid and trustworthy and if snap judgments are educated, the world would be a different and better place. Gladwell is not directly effective in proving this to the reader. He provides few strong examples, such as the Diallo case, and he is unable to substaniate that very large claim. However, indirectly, I feel that Gladwell is successful in his purpose. I feel that Gladwell targets this book at more of a younger audience with the idea that although we will not take direct action to train our snap judgments, we will unconciously begin to question our actions and motives after reading the book. Although Gladwell is not able to get his readers to go out and speak up, he is able to indirectly and unconciously make an impression on the readers' frame of thinking towards the world around them. After reading Blink, go to a public location where there are a lot of people. See if you act differently than from how you would before you read Gladwell's book. You'll begin to notice a slight change in the way you think.Overall, Blink is an excellent book that is most intriguing to younger audiences but still has something in it for everyone. Next time you meet somebody new, size them up in a second...in the blink of an eye. Do not forget your intial impression of them. Then, after you've known the person for a while, compare your intial impression to your impression after knowing them for a long time. Where you right? Where you off? Why? Did something in your mind cause your intial impression? Did a false intial impression prove to be harmful to your relationship with the person? Blink investigates these questions, and surfaces their disastrous outcomes, yet promising potential.",
            "Our mind, faced with a life threatening situation, drastically limits the range and amount of information that we have to deal with. Narrowing allows to focus. In good decision making, frugality matters. Even the most complicated of relationships and problems have an underlying identifiable pattern. Less is more. Overloading the decision with information makes picking up that signature harder, not easier. To be a successful decision maker, we have to edit. Malcolm Gladwell learns that thin-slicing is doing just that. Blink is about the process of editing unconsciously. The book is a fun read as the writer is a great story teller and is able to translate several research fields to wonderful stories.",
            "I wasn't going to read BLINK at first. While I highly enjoyed THE TIPPING POINT by Gladwell, the idea of an entire book on what boiled down to snap judgment simply did not appeal to me until someone who read it shared some insights. I read it and I am glad I did. It's another wonder-inviting investigation by Gladwell in his pitch-perfect voice.Specifically, Gladwell is talking about the ability to process a reaction so fast, at a subliminal level, that one is already acting before actual thinking or articulation set in. This works well for some and it works disastrously for others. Much depends on how well the subconscious is informed and practiced. Gladwell visits cutting-edge research on the subject and provides dramatic accounts of how snap judgments have played out. The latter range from art expert Thomas Hoving instantly identifing a sculpture as a fake, when panels of professionals sweated it out through long examination and came up with the wrong answer, to the sad case of the African immigrant gunned down by police who thought he was a criminal they were chasing. He visits an actors' improvisation group and studies how a few years ago the US military participated in a simulation that bears a resemblance to what the Middle East shortly after became and applying its traditional strategies was defeated by a group of improvisational thinkers.I never realized there was as much to instant judgment as Gladwell kicks up. He kind of peters out in the last chapter, but even that is interesting. Will this book become viewed as an \"answer\" that will find put it at the center of workshops, think tanks and book groups like THE TIPPING POINT? I doubt it, but it is still good information, thought-provoking and fun.",
            "Nothing in Blink is groundbreaking, but it is illuminating. While you may find everything here to be merely an expression of \"common sense,\" sometimes being reminded of the obvious has real value in that it re-focuses and re-emphasizes simple truths. It is the loss of those simple truths - the inability to differentiate the meaningful facts from the overburdensome ones, the need to \"slow things down\" to give yourself enough \"white space\" to allow your intuitive skills to operate properly - that is at the core of the book.Most everything is presented anecdotally, and social scientists, psychologists, etc, will likely scoff at the presentation, even if the conclusions are correct. But Gladwell is a business writer, and for the general/business reader, the anecdotes permit an identification with processes that may otherwise be overcomplicated. Gladwell does a good job at tying what may otherwise appear to be disparate problems together and Blink is extremely readable. And the anecdotes are fascinating little stories on their own to boot - especially the section on the Pentagon's Millenium Challenge.",
            "I just finished reading Blink by Malcolm Gladwell; it's a fascinating little book about how some people make extremely accurate split second decisions. On the back it suggests placing the book in the \"Self Help/Psychology\" section of the book store, which I find a bit perplexing, it is about psychology, but it's nowhere near a self help book, in fact it reads like an extended New Yorker magazine article, which it might be, since Gladwell writes for the magazine. I remember reading some of his pieces before, and I've been recommended his web site by a friend. Anyway, it is interesting why some people are able to see things in a glance that regular people can't. I particularly found the section, 7 Seconds In The Bronx, which discusses what went wrong in the 1999 Amadou Diallo shooting (he was basically in the wrong place at the wrong time and took 41 bullets for it) and what it says about people under pressure and police officers in particular was quite revealing. But all of the chapters were equally interesting and well written. I found it though provoking to evaluate how I personally used \"thin-slicing\" (looking at limited individual moments of time with scrutiny) in daily life.",
            "I enjoyed reading this book for understanding how humans make subliminal decisions during an on-going decision process. The research showed results of what some call the 6th sense.The first three quarters of the book was interesting to read since the author was writting about the \"blink\" concept in our minds and actions and backed it with different examples.The one example that I thought was interesting was the commander beating the computer in simulations, although another insight to that was how humans are enhancing computers to start thinking like our \"blink\".The last chapters of the book were not interesting since it seemed the author ran out of examples and kept repeating himself, and started writting more about technical data.",
            "The first 100 pages sped by in virtually the blink of an eye. They gave me a significant amount to think about, and how I could particularly apply the concept of adaptive unconsciousness (thinking without thinking) in my business. In fact I have already begun to explore how a simple prompt can be imbedded within a process to unconsciously produce a desired end result.If you have ever said, \"If I only get a single good idea from it, the book would be worth it.\", then a) buy and read Blink, and b) set higher expectations.I am giving this book three stars because the second half moved slowly, and I have read a few other books recently that I thought provided even more food for thought - and action.",
            "This book is extremely easy and interesting to read. I wouldn't consider it a serious scientific endeavor in how the mind works, but for a general overview and introduction to decision making, it's fascinating.Gladwell spends the first part of the book crediting the amazing power of the brain to \"thin slice,\" or make seemingly instantaneous subconscious decisions. Midway through I was ready to always trust my first instincts and gut decisions. However, the latter part of the book explores how our brains gets \"thin slicing\" wrong.The book is thought provoking in that it allows the reader a glimpse into faulty assumptions and biases that strongly influence thoughts and decisions. Particularly of interest is the discussion on marketing and the IAT (Implicit Association Test)research done by Harvard.Blink is a fun read, but I'm glad that I borrowed it from the library and didn't buy it.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's book is a very lively read, although one of his central premises is somewhat contradicted. Yes, it's possible to hone your instincts so that you learn how to better anticipate things. However, that seems to happen by itself, not by anything on your part.In essence, intuition is the experience you have in your subconscious mind. When a veteran police officer approaches a potential criminal, he or she is using the experiences of many similar situations, most of which happen in a matter of seconds. But they still collect as memory in the subconscious mind. I would argue that you can't just make a New Year's resolution to learn how to use your intuition better. It takes life experience and a number of parallel situations to get to that point.The case studies and vignettes in this book are very entertaining and cross a wide variety of disciplines. They make for a very fast read because people can relate to many of them. But don't expect them to teach you anything by themselves. Many people, however, could read them and relate to experiences in their life where their instincts have taken over. And this book might help explain how they got there.",
            "Having enjoyed his previous book on idea manipulation and selective networking, \"The Tipping Point\", I am happy to report that New Yorker columnist Malcolm Gladwell has come up with an even more interesting treatise in \"Blink\" about overcoming our biases against first impressions and snap judgments. Once again, he does a superb job in integrating anecdotes with some impressive research data to present his theories without pontification. I really like how he makes the seemingly obvious utterly fascinating by turning upside down our preconceptions and lifelong learnings. In fact, Gladwell sometimes runs the risk of turning his concepts into arguments against intellectual rationalization, i.e., why study and analyze anything if our gut reaction is so sound? But before one can dismiss his thinking, the author comments repeatedly that he is not advocating abandonment of careful research. In support of that perspective, he talks specifically about the \"Warren Harding error.\" Voters across the nation voted for Harding for the White House because he looked and sounded so presidential. But he was poorly prepared to serve as U.S. president. Underneath the faade, he was deceptive and morally at odds with the first impressions he made on the country. Gladwell asserts that guarding oneself against this type of error is key in harnessing the power of using first impressions on important decisions.Consequently, it's not the gut feeling of the layman that counts but that of the expert who has been trained to feel correctly through thousands of relevant experiences. I like an example he used in relation to a Greek statue acquired with great fanfare by the Getty Museum. When the new acquisition was unveiled to renowned antiquities historian Evelyn Harrison, she blurted out, \"I'm sorry.\" Her instantaneous feeling that the statue was faked wasn't based on a careful examination or any quantifiable factors, just her sense that something was wrong with the artifact in front of her. As it turned out, she was right, and Harrison's two seconds uncovered a forgery that 14 months of work by the museum's team of scientists could not. The reality is that those who harness the power of first impressions most powerfully are ready to do so through years of preparation, in the science laboratory or in the realm of day-to-day life. The origins of Gladwell's book provide one of the most telling observations. The author, who is half-Jamaican, half-Caucasian, began to build his theory based on a personal experience. When he wore his hair closely cropped, police never hassled him. When he grew an Afro, he found himself hassled more than once. He understandably wondered why were police making incorrect snap judgments based on hairstyle. Gladwell's natural curiosity about his own situation has led to this wonderful book. Strongly recommended.",
            "This book makes for a very enjoyable and illuminating read, full of fascinating ideas and information. There is no explicit theory that Gladwell relies on, and neither does the book make any clear cut conclusions. This however should not be looked upon as a flaw-rather I am of the opinion that Malcolm's sheer enthusiam for genuine discovery and making these ideas accessible, makes this an extremely gratifying book to read. Gladwell is an immensely gifted writer, and his narrative skills are superb. This book is defintely worth a read.",
            "I read Outliers and I decided to buy Blink as well. It seemed like a good idea. BLINK is possibly the worst book ever written and believe you me, i will return it to amazon for a full refund. I have never felt so strongly about a book.THERE ARE NO LESSONS LEARNED from this book but mere long and boring examples of fast thinking. OH GOD !If I can save one person from buying it, my job is complete !",

I stayed with the boring statistics but Life is short, so get to the nitty gritty, and give us what you promised. Unfortunately the author doesn't follow through. It's been referred to as a hunch, a sixth sense, even just a feeling. And we're probably all familiar with this stuff. Nothing new here at all, however, it would have been nice if a smidgen of information regarding how one could use the information reliably was provided as promised. Who are they that give high ratings to this ilk. Hey, I want my money back.",
            "As a political organizer I found Gladwell's \"Tipping Point\" to be essential reading for anyone looking for a better understanding about how to change people's minds. I had hoped that \"Blink\" would offer further insight. On some levels it does - Gladwell's theory seems to be accurate. Despite being an excellent writer, however, he harms his thesis by using poor examples.The general idea behind \"Blink\" is how to make better snap judgments by examining those who are successful at making such quick judgments and those who have made blunders in various circumstances (whether they be expert or not).On the issue of having excess knowledge Gladwell uses the example of the US military practicing for Gulf War II against an \"unnamed Middle Eastern leader.\" (It's obvious the person they had in mind was Saddam Hussein.) He repeatedly refers to this leader as having \"strong religious support.\" Illustrating Gladwell's unfamiliarity with the topic he fails to mention in his analysis of the military that Saddam was a _secular_ leader and was viewed as evil by Islamic fundamentalists. In other words, one of the key elements of the _premise_ created by the military (which Gladwell does not question) is obviously false.Gladwell insinuates that the US military has had trouble in Iraq because it concentrated on having too much intelligence and can't filter out what is important. While they may or may not be true as a contributing negative factor, it is an argument that shows a lack of political knowledge. There is clear evidence, as stated by the former head of the National Security Agency and Counter Intelligence at the CIA, that the Bush administration pushed for analysis that would reflect their goals. These obvious political motivations don't even enter into Gladwell's analysis. But then, that would destroy this example as a metaphor for his overall (legitimate) thesis.This failure to question the premise for one's actions shows up in one of his most central examples - the NYPD shooting of an unarmed black man who was reaching for his wallet. Gladwell isolates the incident to a few seconds. This fits his theory. He never addresses the general NYC environment in which many New Yorkers felt they were under assault by the police. This environment, combined with an obvious focus on racial minorities, helped create the shooting. Obviously, the police didn't intend to kill an innocent man. But their actions took place within a larger context - and Gladwell ignores it completely.The most glaring flaw in Gladwell's examples is his insistence on using issues of personal taste as proof that someone is somehow an \"expert\" or \"knows more than others.\"For example, Gladwell repeatedly talks about the singer Kenna and how he was shafted by the music industry because flawed surveys showed that the public wouldn't like his work. I listened to several Kenna songs after reading this book. I don't like Kenna! But this doesn't make me right and Gladwell wrong. It just means we have different tastes. It comes off as nothing less than arrogance on the part of Gladwell to argue that experts inherently know more when it comes to something as personal as musical preferences which are so obviously linked to culture, family upbringing, etc.Despite these huge criticisms, I think Gladwell's theory is correct. We can make quicker judgments if we're able to filter out all the excess garbage. This works when we're dealing with a B&W; outcome. For example, is this art real or fake? Does this medical procedure help or harm patients? Does this police procedure benefit the commuhity? These are all examples used in the book. They work. It's just a shame that Gladwell had to muddy up the water with all these other inappropriate examples.",
            "Gladwell writes in an engaging manner, but his methods are suspect. Thousands of psychological experiments are conducted each year at universities around the world in an effort to advance knowledge. Cherry-picking the ones with broad appeal and presenting them (out of context and without mention of their methodological constraints) is just plain wrong. Fine for a superficial understanding of certain topics. Read Roy Baumeister for a better integration of experimental findings and real-world concerns.Note to Gladwell: psychological questionnaires are not \"highly respected\", they are either valid or not, that is they either adequately measure the targeted psychological characteristics or they don't.",
            "The main idea behind \"Blink,\" is how to make fast judgements by examining those who are very successful at doing so. I would suggest reading the conclusion first, then the whole book. The author's thesis has merit, we can learn to make better, & faster decisions when we filter out all the excess data.Here are some of his examples. Does the new Police procedure benefit the community? Will the new medical procedure do more harm than good? Can we determine a persons character by observing their living space? The author gives various examples where the mind works based on biases that are not always in the realm of the conscience thought. That clearly is true. Mr. Gladwell is good at recognizing interesting things, whether it is rapid cognition, or a tipping point.A fine example of this was President Warren Harding on pages 72-75, about appearances being favored over substance. But, after page 98 I felt that he posed more questions than he answered. His example about \"Gulf war 2\" being against a fundamentalist leader, showed historical ignorance. Saddam was always a \"secular dictator.\" He also negates to analyze the politicizing of U.S. intelligence information about the Iraq war. It seemed simplistic not to question the premise for someones actions. His examples about the awful Police shooting in N.Y., & the music of Kenna are isolated to fit his thesis. He tries to hammer a square peg into a round hole. This illogical insistence on using matters of personal taste as proof that someone is an \"expert,\" takes away from the positives of the book. In conclusion, I think forty Percent of the book is a worthy read. The remaining sixty percent was too anecdotal for my taste.",
            "I will start by saying that this book does make some interesting points about using our current understanding of the brain and human reactions under stress within institutional frameworks in ways that MIGHT help make a better society. It even may inspire a few people to be more conscious and alert to their surroundings. But an epiphany or cure-all pill for humanity it is not. If you're looking for personal realization you might try meditating for few years. Much of the personal aspect of this book can be had from far more ancient wisdom that doesn't cost $18. I should say that there are some interesting bits of information and the reading is easy so the fluff doesn't seem so bad, but Gladwell stretches his arguments pretty thin and comes to some dubious conclusions. In many ways this book lulls you into thinking that it might actually have something to say and in the end all you really have are a few more trivia facts on modern psychology and neuroscience and few opinions about why some musicians are overlooked, some police make mistakes and some museums dupe themseleves into buying counterfeits. For me it was an easy read that I didn't have to think about too much about that got me through a very very long excursion in todays world of US airports. Take what you will from this.",
            "In education, standardized tests have become a way of life. As a student, I happened to be very good at these types of multiple-choice tests. One reason I was good at these tests was that I realized something early on: my first instinct was almost always right. The few times I thought over an answer and decided to change it, I nearly always changed the right answer into a wrong one.This experience came to me as I was reading Malcolm Gladwell's book, Blink. Essentially, this is a book about making snap judgements. As Mr. Gladwell points out, all of us are constantly making choices \"in the blink of an eye.\" The question is, why are some people better at making these kind of snap judgements than others?The answer, as Mr. Gladwell describes it, seems to be: preparation. All of us make our judgements based on our experience--experience that becomes so ingrained that we can become ultimately unaware of why we know what we know. I was a rigorous student, so I was prepared to make the right judgement on tests and I learned to trust that judgement. In his book, Mr. Gladwell describes a number of interesting instances of this: art critics who can instantly recognize fakes, tennis coaches who can predict a double fault before the serve is complete, the counselor who can tell which marriages will fail from listening to a couple converse with each other. He then goes on to describe research that can pick apart these situations and help us understand what in these persons' experience has given them these abilities.But Mr. Gladwell is also aware that snap judgements can lead us into error. In Blink, he looks at some great failures of judgement like the Diallo shooting, the election of Warren G. Harding as U.S. President and the introduction of New Coke. What seems to set these events apart is that, whereas in the successful examples the judgements are made by individual experts in narrow fields, in the failures the settings are social ones where the decisions are made by groups. In these groups, cultural influences have colored our experiences and often in a negative, albeit unconsciously negative, way. The subtle associations of African-Americans with crime and charisma with success can lead us down the wrong paths in ways we may not even expect.How, then, to successfully \"thin-slice,\" as Mr. Gladwell calls it? Awareness. Once we become aware of our prejudices, we can mold our minds and sharpen our experiences. Then we will be better prepared to make choices. In this powerful book full of excellent examples and descriptions of current research, Mr. Gladwell has provided a step to that awareness. It is well worth reading.",
            "Blink is disappointing.The theme is good. The value of snap judgments and thin-slicing is useful. And enjoyable. And entertaining.So what is wrong?Well, Gladwell says it all in the first 5 pages. The rest of the book is examples, and more examples and many more examples.He should have realized that we will 'get it' in a blink. And then left us alone. Except for the beginning, the book is probabaly aimed at satisfying the minimum word count for publication.Just read the reviews and summaries. The book has nothing to add.",
            "This is a readable and even engaging book on decision making, but although I sympathize with the author's main thesis about rapid judgments (people are often right about these, but then, they're often wrong, too), he's a little too facile in discussing some of the more technical psychology and neurobiology and whether that evidence truly supports his thesis. For example, as another poster here mentioned, the fusiform gyrus isn't a piece of software but is an anatomical area of the cerebral cortex. But Gladwell not being a trained neuroscientist I can forgive him for confusing anatomy with functionality.However, Gladwell's theory that accomplished experts in various fields can often intuit, or on the basis of very small \"slices\" of information, often make quick and very complex decisions is nothing really knew, and it might or might not have anything to do with the ability to make snap judgments in general. It could be that such experts are quite competent in a particular area that taps into their cognitive and analytical strengths but they are incapable of making such decisions in other areas. It's more likely that people who have the ability to make quick judgments in many areas function differently from those who don't. For example, I can make quick analyses and decisions in two or three areas that I know well, but in other areas of my life I have to sit down and think and deliberate more. All this means is that some decisions are information intensive and some aren't, and if you're skilled in a particular area you can function faster than someone who has to work more slowly through the relevant information or decision-making steps.Another important point to remember is that power doesn't always equate to speed, either. For example, it's said that Einstein wasn't a very quick thinker, but leave him alone with paper and pencil and his mind could go further than any physicist of his generation, because of his powerful analytical and visual/spatial skills. Hence, rapid decision making, although perhaps useful on the battlefield or at the yearly stockholder's meeting, doesn't necessarily equate to quality and depth which is probably more important in the long run. It's also sobering to consider that more and more we seem to be electing politicians on the basis of their ability to come up with facile and great-sounding 20-second sound bytes that are hardly a realistic test of a candidate's ability to actually lead, govern, or come up with new and viable policies and solutions to our social problems. By that criterion Einstein couldn't have gotten elected to his local city council. But he's definitely someone you'd want on your team because of his ability to think creatively and deeply about many problems.That having been said, much of the organization of the human brain relates to generalized, quick decision making, although mostly on a sensory processing level. The human brain is extremely adept at combining inputs from all the sensory modalities in real time and being able to select and make decisions on the most vital information. This is aided by multi-sensory and multi-associational neurons in the anterior parietal cortex just above and to the side of the visual cortical receiving areas. The technical jargon aside, this makes perfect commmon sense if you think about it. If something is stalking you and may eat you, and you hear a twig snap, well, it could be your buddy, or it could be a big tiger or other predator. All animals (including humans) know when to haul a_s and get the hell out of there when they see or hear or smell something suspicious. These sorts of sensory abilities make such quick, selective responses possible. This is actually the most convincing evidence for the sort of abilities Gladwell is writing about, but it's not discussed in the book.One other minor technical point, I also agree with the previous writer that I don't understand what the author means by rapid heartbeats shutting down the motor systems. Obviously, certain abnormal cardiac conditions can impair motor functioning (it only takes about a four-second interruption in blood flow to the brain to result in unconciousness, which would certainly tend to interfere with motor control :-)) But other than a heart attack or a loss of blood circulation to the brain or serious arhythmias, such as fibrillation, which, depending on whether they occur in the ventricles or the auricles, can be potentially fatal vs. merely annoying and slightly debilitating, I'm not aware of anything like that. However, I'm not a doctor (I'm a neurobiologist by academic training) so I don't claim to be an authority on that area.However, I give the book 3 stars for effort, and some of the stories and info was interesting.",
            "Let me start off by saying that I read this book and really liked it. In fact, the pragmatic side of me is refusing to find offense in a chapter of the book that would highly offend others with loved ones with Autism. This book was fascinating and will change the way I think and behave.And then the other shoe drops...I never would have read this book if someone had mentioned the chapter using Autistic as an adjective. And maybe it would have been my loss, but when you live, breathe, and lose someone to the quiet of Autism, you lose a part of you--even if they eventually become high-functioning and casually indistinguishable from their peers. I can't imagine how hurtful this book might have been to someone with a newly-diagnosed child or an adult family member struggling to be independent.Let me include some quotes. This is how Autism is introduced: \"...the way that people with autism see the world gives us a very good sense of what happens when our mind-reading faculties fail.\"(I guess the fact that I still capitalize Autism--when I know it's not technically capitalized tells you I'm not as far removed as I pretend, but anyway....)Gladwell goes on to describe studies on those with Autism and layer by layer establishes that the subjects of these studies lack social awareness including missing social cues and relating to people as objects and often as tools. For those unfamiliar with Autism, this could be a really good look at the symptoms and thought processes of some in the Autism spectrum.For those familiar with Autism and those who've just read this book on how stereotypes color our blink reflexes, his use of the term \"normal\" to describe those in the studies without Autism or just everyone without Autism--grates. In a clinical sense, are Autistic people abnormal in some ways? Yes. Would you ever describe someone's loved one as abnormal? I hope not.And this is where this book fails in my opinion. Gladwell's distilled use and portrayal of Autism as a set of abnormal symptoms often displayed in cases of heightened emotion where people behave rashly and even kill innocent people--is insensitive and possibly even offensive. Our society needs to stop seeing Autism as a clinical term and as a set of symptoms and, now, in a blink--Gladwell has just reinforced them as abnormal.He doesn't imply that Autistic people are unintelligent... in fact: \"Peter is a highly intelligent man. He has graduate degrees from a prestigious university. His IQ is well above normal...\" But then: \"But because he lacks one very basic ability--the ability to mind-read--he can be presented with that scene in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and come to a conclusion that is socially completely and catastrophically wrong.\"Catastrophically wrong.He says an Autistic man's inability to get the commonly-accepted message in a film as catastrophically wrong.Gladwell then goes on to relate many negative, violent, and often fatal situations where \"They didn't take the necessary steps to steer clear of temporary autism.\" \"What police training does, at its best, is teach officers how to keep themselves out of this kind of trouble, to avoid the risk of momentary autism.\"The chapter's primary focus is on the 1999 shooting of unarmed Amadou Diallo by four policeman--who fired at him 41 times when he went to get his wallet out. The police officer was \"not mind-reading now. He's effectively autistic. He's locked in on whatever is coming out of Diallo's pocket, just as Peter was locked in on the light switch in George and Martha's kissing scene.\"A police officer who kills an unarmed man is not effectively Autistic, but using the word in this way is effectively offensive to those dealing with a disorder that now effects 1 in 88 children.Having said that, Gladwell in his typical brilliant way presents the subject of split-second thinking very well through-out the book. I can see what he was trying to achieve here in this chapter by relating it to Autism, but not all disorders can or should be boiled down and dissected to using a part to present the whole. His clinical portrayal of a disorder as only a sum of symptoms can be and probably will be offensive to some. At some points, he swapped out the term \"mind-blind\" and I wish he'd stuck with that.For the record, I couldn't bring myself to knock off a star for this because it's obviously the viewpoint of someone not personally affected by Autism. He didn't get a five star rating because I thought his concluding points in this book weren't as strong as he finished in Outliers.",
            "About three years ago, I read an article in \"The New Yorker\" about microexpressions. They're these fleeting and nearly imperceptible expressions that cross a person's face so quickly that the average observer can only see them if you slow down recorded images.These expressions cannot be consciously controlled, and they betray your true feelings. (The mental image I particularly remember from this article is of normally mild-faced Kato Kaelin snarling at Marcia Clark during the OJ Simpson trial for a split second. You don't remember seeing that, do you? Me neither.)The weird thing is that, after enough practice, you can learn to see those microexpressions.The possibilities! If I could see microexpressions, I could have the world trembling at my feet! I could become what amounted to a mindreader.Since I'm not really a megalomaniac, that feeling subsided, and I hadn't thought about that article much until recently.But now I've read \"Blink\" by Malcolm Gladwell (also the author of that microexpression story in \"The New Yorker,\" also the author of \"The Tipping Point\") and have spent some time thinking about what can take place in a split second.Among other things, Gladwell looks at various marketing successes (like the Aeron chair, first saddled with the moniker \"The Chair of Death\" due to its perceived aesthetic shortcomings, now you're probably sitting in one (or a knock-off of one) as you read this) and failures (like New Coke) and compares how these decisions were made.In order to make a good rapid decision, it's necessary that you know (instinctively) what information to accept and what information to discard when you're being bombarded by too much of it.It seems that it goes pretty much like this: if you already know a great deal about the subject at hand, you're pretty good at making quick judgments about something.If you haven't been trained, had a lot of experience, or practiced, well, then it's likely that you're not very good at it.In other words, if you aren't looking at exactly the right variables, you might end up making a colossal mistake. And how can you determine what those variables are? Well...by knowing through experience.Although sometimes you do just know.There's a lot going on in your brain that you simply aren't aware of-you might instinctively act one way without being aware of your reasoning for it until afterwards.It's also important to note that there are a lot of variables over which you have little or no control when it comes to making a judgment in a snap.Like it or not, each of us has prejudices, and they're difficult to abandon when you're in a situation where you're making a decision very quickly.All of these subjects are covered in great detail in the book, both the cheery and the dark sides of rapid cognition.Here's what Gladwell says are the tasks of his book:1. To convince us that decisions made quickly can be as good as those made deliberately2. To flag the reasons that our instincts can mislead us3. To convince us that our snap judgments can be controlledDoes he succeed on all points? Well...yes and no.When I started this book, I admit that I was seized by the same kind of excitement as I was while reading about microexpressions. (My productivity will increase! No bad decisions again!)After reading \"Blink,\" I'm convinced that my snap decisions can sometimes be as good as my most careful ones. And sometimes not.I do see why my instincts can mislead me at times.And, I am convinced that my snap judgments can be controlled. Up to a point.However, if you're looking for Gladwell to teach you how to \"thin-slice\" and make great quick decisions, if you're looking for him to teach you how to control your snap judgments, you won't find that in this book.What Gladwell does do is unload a quick succession of stories and research that loosely interweave to form a book that is chockablock interesting material.\"Blink\" is nothing if it isn't entertaining, and if you're intrigued by the complex inner workings of the human mind, it is a book worth reading.But if you're interested in takeaways beyond thought and theory, your time might be better spent researching your decisions instead.",
            "\"Trust your instinct except when it's wrong\".There, I just saved you $10. No kidding, that sentence is the entire book. Sorry Gladwell fans, I must say this book is terrible. For the first few chapters, Gladwell talks about all these instances where lives, money, and prestige were saved thanks to people who trusted their instincts (or where all this was lost, because people did not trust their instincts). So you're thinking, great, you should trust your instincts. Then without warning, all his stories start to shift to ones where people trusted their instincts and turned out to be wrong. The End. And you're left wondering, why did I just read 10 stories where people who trusted their instincts were sometimes right and sometimes wrong? Of course that would happen.Skip this book.",
            "This book is a revalation in new thinking! Easy to read, although I read it in one sitting. We just need to trust our instincts, and say \"I don't know\" more often. Buy it!!!",
            "I heard a book review cum interview on NPR with the author. The social implications that they talked about in the show was definitely interesting, so I bought the book - its still on the best seller list, if it means anything to any one - and I couldnt put it down. Its one of the few non-fiction books that has had been rivetted. It is written in a very organised way, in very simple lay person terms and also explains every concept with examples. It demystifies, without reducing the respect for the phenomena. I would recommend it to anyone who is curious about social psychology.",
            "Blink reminded me of what Bruce Lee had said: \"Master the lessons in this book and then throw it away.\" He meant that once you have it down, his fighting style is automatic; you no longer have to think about it, and the structure of thought is no different.Another book is relevant here; Moral Armor. Blink discusses cognitive action in slices; a better mind works with manageable slices while a slower mind attempts to work with too much information. Moral Armor describes the moral pattern of thought, which isolates its essential elements and makes decisions efficiently with an additional facet: complete moral certainty.In Blink, it is said that those at the top make decisions with much less information than one would suppose, but I'm inclined to think that like Bruce Lee, they have mastered their realm so completely that they can strike fast, precisely due to that prior foundation of experience.Perfect action in thought is based on Aristotelian logic, which is algebraic. Lethargic thought such as Blink's thick slices is evidence of a mind that cannot tell the difference between what is essential or inessential in any given context; such a person lacks a clear standard of value. In Moral Armor, that standard is shown to be life itself, where any speed of mind will reach the same end if only the way is known.I like both concepts. When you reach the point beyond all doubt that your moral course is correct--the point of total conviction by rational means--you become untouchable psychologically. To know what is right and how to get there, I'd love to get there in a Blink!",
            "I devoured this book, it's an interesting, quick and fun read. Initially I was convinced the author had conveyed some brilliant insights, and my life was changed. A few days later, though, I kind of think that his insights are interesting, yes, and thought-provoking. But not really much more than common sense would lead any intelligent person to conclude.Still, I do recommend it as an interesting book.",
            "As a New Yorker, Malcolm Gladwell could not resist the distractive style of writing of an urban writer. Though the book title is concise and descriptive, the entire book brings to my mind a scenario of a preacher reading a convoluted long story in a bar crammed with drunken folks. Too many stories on psychoanalytical research, of military personnel, musicians, corporate deals, police incidents, attacks on the president on USA, etc., are unnecessarily inserted and are confusing the main theme of the book. You won't escape plenty of unnecessary journalistic events such as the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan in the afternoon of March 30, 1981, the Michael Jackson's speaking for Pepsi Corporation, the Amadou Diallo's 1999 murder by police, or the O.J. Simpson verdict.Thus, instead of tackling the subject of interaction between the unconscious and conscious minds and the environment during decision-making, the author opted to use thousands of words in order to describe the simplest of the thought processes. The chapters' titles show how circumstantial the book presentation is, as follows.The Introduction, \"The statue that didn't look right\" confuses the error, on the part of an antiques dealer, in consulting inexperienced experts with irrelevant background for evaluating a statue for authenticity with the poor decision-making despite the abundance of information. The author attempts to show that the real experts that discovered the fake statue had made inexplicable, yet correct, snap-decision. He omits the fact that their pervious and long experience was the reason for making such right snap decision. Thus, they did processes abundance of data over many years before reaching that top-notch ability to decide in a blink.Chapter 1, \"the theory of thin slices: how a little bit of knowledge goes a long way\" attempts to dwell on facial expressions and personal conducts to reach quick conclusions on issues such as love relationships and judging the professionalism of doctors through first impressions. It lists many stories in order to reach the conclusion that one could discern a whole lot of information by mere glancing. It ignores the fact that individual circumstances dictate different reactions.Chapter 2, \"the locked door: the secret life of snap decisions\" contends that people are not free at will when making decision but rather operating at autopilot mode, with their prejudices and instincts through previous priming forces.Chapter 3, \"the Warren Harding error: why we fall for tall, dark, and handsome men\" shows how circumstantial the author could get. Instead of analyzing the issue of prejudice and scapegoating based on physical appearance or racial bias, the author wastes many long pages on personalizing the character of senator Warren Harding in the year 1914.Chapter 4, \"Paul van Riper's big victory: creating structure from spontaneity\" dwells on story of a Vietnam commander to advance the importance of spontaneity and the value of relying on less information in making sound decisions.Chapter 5, \"Kenna's dilemma: the right-and wrong- way to ask people what they want\" discusses the issue of general impression and perceived image in the success of a musician, the Coca Cola's image, and other corporate advertisement.Chapter 6, \"Seven seconds in the Bronx: the delicate art of mind reading\" attempts to explain the process of thinking of the police officers who shot Amadou Diallo in 1999 in the Bronx. The author list three arbitrary mistakes that led to the tragically flawed decision to shoot. He omits many confounding factors such as the white race of the cops in a black neighborhood, the questionable level of training of the cops, the unfortunate situation of miscommunication with an immigrant unfamiliar with police procedure, or the possibility of foul play by the cops.Had the author avoided personalizing the underlying processes of thought-making and adopted more systemic psychoanalytical explanation of snap decision-making, he might have been able to present a more credible book.",
            "I had high hopes for this book. It actually has some insights that are worth listening to. But ultimately it turns into a culturally biased commentary on why you are racist whether you know it or not. Also, we are reminded that the author is better than you, particularly if you are a white male. And finally, he manages to make the book political by using only examples to support his arguments that are out of the liberal playbook of stereotypes and false premises. I actually think some of his points are valid, but if he cannot see past his own viewpoint that racism is under every rock and behind every tree (which is patently false if you are a liberal reading this) how can you trust any of his conclusions?",

            "I really enjoyed this and other Gladwell books. His ability to intertwine different, yet related, topics is fresh and keeps readers entertained!",
            "`Blink' is aptly named, as it provided enough entertaining anecdotes to while away a rainy weekend. However, this work falls short of Malcolm Gladwell's more credible treatise, `Outliers,' because its central thrust leans clumsily on psychology, in which the author has no training whatsoever. The result is not particularly cohesive, and Gladwell often comes to fore-head slapping conclusions at times. For example, he cites a psychologist who is able to tell if a marriage is on the brink because he can detect `contempt.' The characters in the story fit the argument too neatly to be credible.The book has repackaged popular psychological ideas (many were explained in Nassim Taleb's `The Black Swan') about intuition but would have been better coming from someone more authoritative. Steven Pinker, perhaps. Half the time, I found myself wanting to read the psychological studies themselves, skipping Gladwell's buckshot summaries of them.However, the chapters closer to the author's own knowledge base are satisfying. In particular, Gladwell draws from a deep well as a former Washington Post reporter to present fascinating insights on various police issues. Those are Blink's best chapters.",
            "Most people have always grown up with the belief that good decisions require planning, and lots of time to take in details. Malcolm Gladwell, writer for New Yorker and best-selling author of The Tipping Point, Outliers, and What the Dog Saw: and Other Adventures suggests we do not give our own intuitions enough credit.Blink shows us the many times where split-second decisions have ended in positive results. Gladwell shows us scenario after scenario of times when our intuition gave us the ability to make accurate decisions.In one example, Gladwell talks about a musician named Kenna. Immediately upon hearing ten seconds of Kenna's music, Craig Kallman, co-president of Atlantic Records, decided the Kenna's music may have a home with his company. In the end, Kallman didn't rely on his sixth sense and decided research Kenna's selling ability. Though Kenna already had a small fan base, according to the research apparently the selected audience seemed very unexcited to hear anymore of Kenna's music and Kallman never signed him.Through the example, Gladwell poses the question that perhaps if the Kallman had listened to his instincts instead of doing a load of research Kenna may have proved to be a pretty successful artist.The book consists mostly of more examples among these lines, constantly showing how some of the best decisions have been without having to give them much thought. The idea is very interesting, and the first few chapters and examples are very thought provoking. However, the book quickly digresses into heap of repetitive examples. The book leaves us convinced but confused, without any explanations of how or why our brains make good quick decisions. After awhile the book became difficult to read.The book seemed very good overall. It has very exciting ideas. However, I believe that it could use some more insight and fewer examples. This book entertains the audience and will leave the reader wanting to know more.",
            "BlinkThe power of thinkingwithout thinkingBy Malcolm GladwellBlink, the unconscious awareness that sits in the subconscious helping people assess the situations and problems in their lives. Communities unknowingly have a blink tendency that was experimented on and shown in a study perform by a group of scientist from the University of Iowa that showed with a simple gambling test that anything that is not good for us or that place the slight bit of stress on is recognized but not reacted upon.The recognition occurs within seconds of any said action/problem being started or observed, this means that people have the capability to access, understand, and adjust to any situation or problem within a blinks time.The brain sends different signs to inform that it has unconsciously decided what we are going to feel about an object or situation, like the palms of the subject's hands becoming sweaty from the gambling experimentof the study by the University of Iowa scientist, or the \"Intuitive Repulsion\" that Angelos Delivorrias felt when she got the chills and instantly knew that the Getty kouros.The reader is initially stirring with questions, \"Why should I trust this response?\" \"When should we be wary or trust the intuitive response?\"It is very easy to make mistakes; this was shown with the four police officers who shot and killed Amadou Diallo. One officer, Sean Carroll said that Diallo appeared \"suspicious,\" a man sitting around, he then said he was amazed because of the fact that he didn't run at the sight of police and called him \"brazen,\" a man standing outside observing his surroundings is brazen?Finally they said he was dangerous because they miss read the snap judgment, or intuitive repulsion that they felt as he reached into his pocket before they opened fire, feeling as thought there life was in some kind of imminent danger.Too often as humans do we misread our snap judgments and blink responses because of an emotion, which a previous occurrence has, lead us to form, this is the sole problem that people have with interrupting these early notification signs today. It is good that there was someone who was able to publish work in which readers can understand that they may be making these mistakes without recognition, and doing it in a way that the readers remain interested and entertained. Malcolm Gladwell made this scientific study amusing and easy to understand a great trait to have in any book published for the masses. Because this book was so interesting, it should be instituted in to school classes, instead of some of the books that are so dreadful to read and relate to. This is a great read and I would recommend this book to anyone without hesitation. we",
            "What provides the best results: Careful and complete deliberation, or making a snap decision; gathering all the information available, or using a few selected facts; a blind audition, or watching the performer? Are our best decisions made by our unconscious mind, \"behind the locked door,\" so to speak?In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell uses dozens of illustrations and experiments to answer these and other questions, alluding to a power in \"thinking without thinking.\" One of several propositions in the book suggests that too many details actually hamper good decision making rather than helping.After reading Blink, I felt dazed by too much scattered information. Perhaps Gladwell should follow his own advice and cut to the chase rather than dragging his message out ad nauseam.It's not that Gladwell, author of the # 1 bestseller The Tipping Point and staff writer for The New Yorker, has written a boring book. I found the stories and experiments in Blink both interesting and edifying; however, the key points sometime seem illusive and maybe even contradictory on the surface. For example, one illustration emphasizes the importance of, \"mind reading,\" by careful study of facial expression, while another advocates blind auditions to avoid letting our eyes, biases, and culture taint our decision when selecting a musician for our orchestra. Blink uses so many stories and illustrations that the message becomes scrambled, if not lost.The final chapter in Blink takes off on yet another tangent rather than developing any sort of conclusion or summary of the previous dialog.Interestingly, the most concise and poignant message in Blink, comes in the \"Afterword\" chapter, pp. 273-276, \"A Call to Action.\" In two short pages Gladwell presents a convincing argument and recommendation regarding the justice system in the United States. Move the accused in a criminal trial out of the courtroom, Gladwell suggests, answering questions through an intermediary. Eliminate any evidence and testimony that tips the jury off to the age, race, or gender of the defendant, anything that could affect impartiality. The statistics on conviction rates of black men vs. white men in our country drives home this point in a powerful and convincing way.Now, if you will excuse me, the book Blink has \"primed\" me with the overwhelming desire to stock up on Coca Cola, buy some Knott's Berry Farm jam, some Christian Brothers brandy, and one of those unsightly but very comfortable Herman Miller \"Aeron\" chairs. Then I want to kick back and watch some Kenna videos on MTV2. If you read Blink I'm sure you will understand.",
            "The working of the human mind, one of the oldest mysteries remains the largest, most bizarre of frontiers. From the very beginning men like Freud and Wundt have been trying to unravel this mystery. They have attempted to map out and stake a claim on this measureless frontier. While we have came a long way and we do know more about \"knowing\" than we have in the past, there remains a great deal that we are ignorant of.Malcolm Gladwell uses Blink to stake his claim in the frontier of the human psyche. His book arrives as a fresh and interesting proposal about how we make decisions, process information, and take in the world around us. Gladwell, staff writer for The New Yorker and author of The Tipping Point, beautifully weaves together anecdotes, research, personal experience and interviews in order to prove his suggestion that the human mind processes information much faster than we are consciously aware of. Gladwell's first anecdote proves his point nicely; he tells the story of a Greek sculpture called a kouros. The owner of the kouros wanted ten million dollars for the statue which he claimed was from the sixth century. The J. Paul Getty Museum launched an investigation; fourteen months and many tests later they believed that the statue was authentic and purchased it. However, as soon as the statue went on display it was obvious that something was amiss-- every expert in Greek art who looked at the statue immediately felt that it was \"wrong\". One even going so far as to say he felt an \"intuitive repulsion\" after looking at the statue for only two or three seconds. At the end of the story it is discovered the statue is indeed a fraud. Gladwell states that our \"adaptive unconscious\" uses a process that he calls \"thin slicing\". This process is where our brain takes in a small amount of information in a very short time and arrives at a complex, and many times correct, hypothesis. However, Gladwell also shows \"our unconscious is a powerful force. But it's fallible\"Gladwell brings out the \"mind reading\" parts of thin slicing \"are subtle and complex\" and \"sometimes goes terribly awry.\" In the case of Amadou Diallo it went very wrong indeed. Diallo ,a black man from Guinea, lived in the Bronx. On the night of February 3, 1999, four plain clothes police officers mistakenly identified Diallo as a known rapist. As they approached him, he ran inside of a building and pulled a black object from his pocket. He was gunned down by the four police men. The black object was only wallet and the four police men had just experienced the dark side of thin slicing and snap decision making.Gladwell goes on to prove his proposal by interlacing many other anecdotes and research involving war games, gamblers, former president Warren Harding, and even rock and roll musicians.Gladwell uses a clever set up, a thorough introduction and is precise in proving his theory. He does a fantastic job in all aspects related to his proposal about our subconscious. While his use of research gives his proposal credibility Blink is far from a boring unimaginative list of statistics. His masterful use of a wide range of anecdotes and interviews invites the reader to continue exploring the topic. Gladwell's idea about the human mind and the way it operates is complete and made believable. Gladwell's writing style and presentation of facts creates the feel that you are having an intriguing and enjoyable conversation. His writing style and the organization of his information really adds to the appeal of his book, his proposal, and the likeability of Gladwell himself.",
            "Got this book from a reading list for a Critical Thinking class I attended. I struggled through the first couple chapters of the book thinking the support for the conclusions to be rather weak. But as I got further in I was finding it more interesting and meaningful. The book finished strong. I've since purchased a couple of the books referenced in Blink. I gave away my original copy and will buy another. I thinking my second reading will put the first few chapters in a much better light.",
            "What a great perspective. It really gets you to start looking at what we are truely quick thinking or actually judging.",
            "Everyone makes snap judgments about people, places, and events. Sometimes those judgments are correct, other times not. But what if you're forced to make a big decision in a matter of seconds? What processes in your brain help you make that decision, and how do you prevent bad decisions from happening?Through fascinating studies and real life examples, Malcom Gladwell explores these concepts and much more in this book. As Gladwell states, there are three purposes to the book. First, to show that quick decisions can be just as good as decisions made after slow, careful deliberation. Second, to identify when we should trust our instincts and when we should be wary of them; and third, to persuade the reader that snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled.To demonstrate Gladwell's points, plenty of pages are devoted to studies and examples that made the book sound like a marketing textbook at times. Descriptions of the many types of facial expressions were so detailed that it became monotonous. Also, I would have liked more tips about how to control snap decisions, but the book certainly gave me a better understanding of why and how first impressions are made. Having said this, Blink is a worthwhile read, and the concepts will compel you to reevaluate those snap decisions you make in your life.",
            "Lots of interesting information about how humans exercise percpetion. More detail than I was expecting with many long examples. Too detail for a quick read.",
            "Recently, I watched the TV play of Lie to me, in which the expert can tell whether people lie just by a glance at people's faces. In the play, the expert learned a lot about people's expressions and psychology. With the abundant studies and experiences, the expert can tell what a person is thinking about by looking the person's expressions. In the book of Blink, Gladwell also gave a similar example about the theory of mind reading.The book is mainly talking about making decisions by rapid cognition. It concerned with the content and origin of those instantaneous impressions and conclusions that spontaneously arise whenever we meet a new person or confront a complex situation or have to make a decision under conditions of stress. Gladwell took so many interesting examples in the book to describe how people make decisions instinctively in a short moment and what impacts the accuracy of our judgments.According to the author, the book is to convince readers of a fact that decisions made very quickly can be equally as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately. In addition, the book is to answer the question that when should we trust our instincts and when should we be wary of them. Moreover, the third and most important task of blink is to convince readers that our snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled.In the daily life, we have to make lots of decisions. Sometimes we spend a lot of time and energy to consider a lot to make sure that we can make the correct decision. However, we may finally make the same decision as we decided before the deliberately consideration. Or even worse we may find that our first decision is better than the decision made after the cautiously thinking.For example, when I am doing multiple choices, there is a problem I'm not sure between option A and option B which option is the correct one, so I just pick A instinctively. When I recheck my answers, I begin to analyze the confusing problem: I'm familiar with the concept of option A and I also have impression of partial information in option B. After a carefully thinking about the options, I ultimately choose option B. However, after the examination, the teacher tells us that option A is the correct one.It's interesting that the situation above always happens to many students. It seems that our decision made by the first impression often is the best decision. As the author said, sometimes we should take our powers of rapid cognition seriously. Although making decisions through cautiously consideration of large amount of information is a good method to determine things, the instinctive judgment can be a good way to make decisions. Since the instinct is based on our past experiences, we should pay attention to it.By combining instinctive judgment and analytical consideration, we are more likely to make right decision. Besides, it's also important for us to learn how to simplify complicated information to solve problems because sometimes the more information we know the more confused we are.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's Blink provoked some great thoughts on the power of the human subconscious and rapid cognition. It's amazing to think about the split second decisions we make every day that are based on first impressions or hunches and how they impact our lives. There are so many interrelated factors that we are somehow able to instantly process react accordingly. More interesting is that these \"thin slices\" usually generate a reaction that is pure, meaning it is very close to the truth or the best route to take in a given situation. Blink discusses both the good and the bad ways we do this and how controlling the process and focusing on the right information can benefit us.In my experience, when people over-think a situation or a problem, the end result can easily end up being worse than if they would have trusted their first instinct and gone with it. That being said, there are definitely times where a rational and well thought out decision making process is key to success. The trick is knowing when to rely on the power of thin-slicing and when to opt for a more robust process. In business, it is easy to see the struggle between the two approaches.Organizations rely on research, planning, and process to make important decisions on finances and strategy. Going this route is certainly prudent and leads to desired results. However, this corporate bureaucracy can also be a huge waste of time if applied to every situation, and can cause companies to be very sluggish in responding to change and getting things done. Conversely, if companies don't do their due diligence and are too quick to react, they can cause tremendous damage to their financial situation, reputation, and brand. Companies need to carefully manage when they rely on bureaucracy and when they can leverage thin slicing techniques to just react and move on.",
            "Blink: The Power of Thinking; Without ThinkingThis book is about how we process our mind. How the subconscious take places before the conscious. The author presents a series of studies and experiments to supports its point. So Blink it is that nano second that human's take to have a feeling about a situation or event. I really enjoy reading this book and could relate a lot of the book facts with my professional experience.Some of the examples that Gladwell, the author, gives are very real, although the book was written to the United States environment with some minor modifications it is possible to adapt to different cultures around the globe. The main point is that we can have an opinion and a certain hunch before we have a logical explanation for the fact. One of the most amazing examples was about the couple forecasting of the probability on the divorce. The book show studies that with as little as three minutes of tape of a couple it be done this forecast. The thin slice technique gives the researchers a great ability to forecast.The IDAT test is amazing, test that requires the person who is taking the test to associate groups or categories to words or pictures. For my professional experience we had to educate our work force, over and over again, to avoid unconscious associations that would result in a lost of a sale or reduce value perception in our service quality.Another point that the book make is how easy, or at least predicable is to marketing once we understand the Blink decisions of the general market, the point here was proven with the President Harding election, although he was one of the worse president in the American history, he had the physical imagine of a tall and strong person, and due his imagine he was elected the president. This point was also made with the CEOs of big corporation which also prefer to have a tall and strong male.The counterpoint of a success auto sales man proves that the individuals or companies that prepare them to have an open mind, the results of IDAT test will be change and the potential of a greater positive result in the market place are astronomical.My personal suggestion is that every decision maker has to address cultural issues and deal with the subconscious. And the more knowledge on these topics it is best to forecast, and gain market share of profitability. So use this knowledge to address advertising campaign and sales strategies.",
            "Blink: The Power of Thinking Without ThinkingSummary\"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\" talks about how everyday decisions that we make almost subconsciously tend to be more complex than we may realize. Malcom Gladwell points out how some people aren't better than others at making decisions necessarily because they spend the most amount of time thinking about them, but more because they are good at picking out the important factors in a problem from the sometimes overwhelming number of variables in a given situation, and therefore focusing on these factors in order to make a decision. The author talks about how some of the best and most urgent/important decisions that we make occur based on judgments made at the \"blink\" of an eye.Gladwell uses the term \"thin-slicing\" to describe how when faced with a problem or situation, we tend to almost immediately unconsciously begin to filter out information that is irrelevant to the situation at hand, while we simultaneously subconsciously start to focus more and more on important \"slices\" of information with each second. The author elaborates that much of this thin-slicing analysis is based on knowledge and experience that we posses from previous situations, much of which is stored behind a \"locked door\" (i.e. we often cannot explain in words why or how these \"snap judgments\" that we make actually occur). He cites research conducted by a psychologist named Jonathan W. Schooler in noting that the brain's two hemispheres work completely differently, in that the left hemisphere often works in logic and words, while the right hemisphere is very visual. While we often use the aforementioned thin-slicing techniques to make snap judgments that are fairly accurate most of the time, when people have been asked to put the logic behind this quick thinking into words, it often not only causes them to falter in their explanations, but also overshadows and clouds the original thinking that subconsciously took place in their minds.The author cites many examples and analysis to bring to light the true \"power of thinking without thinking\", since many of us truly do not realize how much of our thinking is truly done in our unconscious. He explains that if we can learn to improve the quality of our decisions, we need to acknowledge and respect the fact that we may not always be able to know the true basis behind our thinking. Furthermore, a true balance between deliberate and instinctive thinking is key. If we allow our unconscious to take over 100 % in our decisions and analysis/judgment-making, we may end up with results that are too shallow. On the contrary, if we rely too much on deliberate analysis, we may overload our brains with information and overlook the crucial part of our unconscious that is part of human nature and serves as a key element in allowing us to make even better and more accurate judgments and decisions than any amount of research and analysis could ever produce.Response/OpinionI personally enjoyed Malcom Gladwell's \"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\", especially because I feel as though I can relate very closely to the underlying premise of what Gladwell is talking about in this book. Gladwell's main focus in \"Blink\" is about the human subconscious: the thought process that is performed in almost every situation of life that occurs unconsciously. The author further emphasizes the true importance of this ability that we humans posses, and how it is even often more essential to our everyday lives than in-depth analysis and active thought processes.Gladwell uses the example of the Getty Kouros, a Greek statue dating back to the sixth century B.C. that had been discovered by Gianfranco Becchina and presented to the J. Paul Getty museum in the early 1980's. Because such discovered kouroses are typically heavily damaged, worn, and visibly apparent that they were dug out of the ground, the fact that this kouros was in such good shape made many wary as to its authenticity. As a result, months of analysis and testing were conducted on the kouros, all of which pointed towards the kouros being the real deal. Nonetheless, experienced historians and experts such as Federico Zeri and Thomas Hoving took a look at this kouros, and almost at first glance, something told them that it just \"wasn't right\". Whether it is the statue's unusual flawlessness, or even something odd about its fingernails, many experts in this field had a strange feeling when observing the kouros no matter what the analysis and evidence had shown. Hoving even stated that the first word that came to his mind when seeing the marble statue was \"fresh\", a word obviously not fitting for a kouros that is supposedly over 2,000 years old. Though it still has not been determined whether or not the kouros is a true work of art from the sixth century B.C. or simply a well-crafted replica, many historians were able to make an almost instantaneous suspicious judgment about the statue just by looking at it. What is even more interesting is that if they are truly right, their instinctual \"snap judgments\" made by \"thin-slicing\" (that in the end these historians could not even explain in words) would prove to be more accurate than months of analysis and testing.The author discusses other examples that cite the mysterious ways of our subconscious, such as in the case of speed dating. He makes the interesting point that even though speed dating only allows people to have six minutes with each other before moving onto the next person, this time is enough for most people to use their instincts and snap-judgments in order to determine whether or not they think this person may be a potential fit. Or, another example cites an experiment where a Marne, Paul Van Riper, and several Marine Corps Generals traveled to the Mercantile Exchange in New York to meet with a group of Wall Street traders. After the market closed for the day, these Marines participated in trading games. Afterwards, the traders were similarly taken to a military base and participated in war games on computers, as well as live tank exercises. What was ultimately found was that both groups did extremely well on their simulations and games. Because Marines and traders both work in positions that require them to make frequent, spur-of-the-moment decisions, they both think the same way. Both groups were used to working under pressure and relying on thin-slicing and snap judgments in order to make effective decisions, and therefore did very well in their respective exercises.Whether it be Marine Corps, stock brokers, historians, or any other type of human, Gladwell points out that we all \"think without thinking\" on a daily basis. I particularly enjoyed his analysis because I am frequently someone who has trouble acting on what my brain tells me, since I usually concurrently have a stronger gut-instinct present within my heart that can conflict with my logical side. I think that a lot of what Gladwell elaborates on when he compares snap judgments that come from our subconscious versus more drawn-out, deliberate thinking processes relates to \"thinking with your heart\" versus \"thinking with your head\". Because I am, as I said, someone who frequently lets his heart win over his head, this instinct versus logic battle is something that I find myself struggling with on a daily bases since I am also largely a logical thinker and always analyze everything before making a decision. In fact, I frequently find myself trying to teach myself to think a different way in future situations after I find myself regretting making a decision in which I either let myself rely too much on my heart, or too much on my head.Gladwell emphasizes the fact that as humans, we need to try to find a balance between deliberate analytical thought and instinctual thinking. Because this has long been a struggle for me, I thoroughly enjoyed Gladwell's analysis and examples. He makes the interesting point that though all humans naturally use thin-slicing to make snap judgments that we often cannot even explain, people who are \"experts\" in a particular field tend to make less shallow judgments because of their experience and stored knowledge. I think that as time goes on and as one gains more experience through a repetition of similar types of situations, we naturally become \"experts\" in dealing with certain types of situations and decisions. The problem that I have come across however is that I tend to forget knowledge that I have gained from past experiences too easily, and I end up making the same mistakes in my analysis and decision making processes by repeating these mistakes throughout time. I think that Gladwell's insights have taught me that I personally need to work more actively towards keeping track of my experiences and using this gained knowledge in the active sector of my thinking process when situations arise. Yes, I will never be able to change the fact that I think largely with my heart (which I should not want to change), but if I am able to store this experience and knowledge effectively, I will be able to use it to my advantage in being able to make more in-depth and knowledgeable decisions in the future, especially when it comes to applying more of a deliberate thought-process in counteracting some of my snap judgments that may be somewhat incorrect.Overall, I really enjoyed \"Blink\" and what Malcom Gladwell had to say in this reading. I think his analysis is very pertinent since this is a topic in which every human being can relate to. Furthermore, it is most certainly applicable to everyone's lives, whether personally or in the business world. In relation to this course and in measuring customer value, I think Gladwell's analysis is especially pertinent since much of the perceptions and decisions made by marketers often rely on thin-slicing and snap judgments in addition to in depth analysis and market-research, especially in face-to-face, real-time situations with customers. All-in-all, I think that this book was an excellent read and is very relevant to our society in many ways. I would highly recommend it to people in all walks of life, as it is an easy read that can be very beneficial to people's lives and future decision-making.",
            "Enjoyed this book gave me a different take on things, so much so I shared it with friends and strangers.",
            "Just finished Blink, I read it in just 2 days which is very fast for me. It's a very good book. Most of the stories he uses to convey the ideas are interesting and valid, and much of the information is incredibly intriguing. I would have said the book was excellent but something happens to the author about half way through and all the \"Oooo, Ahh..Awesome\" gets clouded with the author's obvious liberal views, and the previous astounding theory and fact is replaced with righteousness and opinion. The ending was anti-climatic, and my copy had the add additional afterward which I read hoping for a little better closure, but ended up with more opinion. The entire book is still very good the content is valuable, and I believe most people I know will enjoy it.I recommend it to anyone in management (decision making positions) or anyone simply interested in how the mind works. It is not so much a book to train you to think in the blink of an eye, as much as a book to make you realize your mind already does that and how to be aware when those thoughts are valuable or not.",
            "Gladwell Delivers again. He goes into detail about an art forgery that fooled many but not if they had trusted their initial instincts. It is an amazing window into the decision making process and in fact reveals a great deal about what it means to make a first impression and why they really are so very important. Highly recommend this book!",
            "The author describes the main subject of this book as \"thin- slicing\" which is our ability to gauge what is really important. During this we often make better decisions then a well researched decision. He also states that , \"analysis paralysis\", or information overload can often times cloud our judgment. People will need to shift their focus to only the most critical information in order to make the best decision. The author also talks about the halo effect, in which people build a perception using one or two traits that \"overshadow\" the other traits. In example, if you see someone who is wearing dirty clothes and their hair is messy, you may think of them as being poor, when in reality he could be a wealthy doctor that was just working in his yard.I never looked at Malcom Gladwells articles in the New Yorker. From reading other reviews it seems like this book is a compilation of different articles and they are criticizing that fact. It doesn't make a difference to someone like me. I find his books to be informative and easy to read. Like any business book though you may find that the author over exaggerates on a certain theory or point they are trying to make. Many business books you will find also that the same famous examples are used over and over again. Just skip over it and continue reading.My philosophy is read as much as you can, even if you don't agree with the others person or groups point of view, their view just helps you build a basis to better support your own opinion. This book is good for marketers, business owners, MBA students and people that are interested in building insight on spontaneous decision making.",
            "Overall the theory and analysis are interesting and the stories to support Gladwell's theory is interesting. I enjoyed the studies that were done and all the research for the first half to three quarters of the book but ultimatly the conclusion was incomplete and without a lot of hard core statistics to support anything.",
            "Blink deals with our innate capability to make snap judgments in the blink of an eye. Malcolm Gladwell strives to address three broad themes in this yet another masterpiece. He lays out that snap judgments could be every bit as good as ones taken after prolonged deliberation. He then states that we need to know when to trust such instincts and when we must be wary of them. Lastly, he states that the the human mind can indeed be trained to control and enable rapid cognition.What follows is a deep-dive into the way human beings judge situations and come to instant conclusions. It turns out that we are all experts at 'thin slicing' - an ability to find patterns based on choosing specific experiences & filtering out the rest. And as we are thin slicing, our subconscious mind does guide us towards a conclusion. To prove this point, Gladwell takes us through the world of art experts (who, at a moment's observation identify a fake), a marriage analyst (who, upon looking at perceptible facial expressions & hearing conversations determines the strength of a marriage) and medical malpractice lawyers (who can hear snippets of a doctor's conversation with his patient and conclude his risk of being sued). As you go through such examples, you marvel at his ability in marshaling his points and presenting them in such a manner that you can actually relate to them.But how do we sift the meaningless slices from the important ones? Gladwell states that slicing based on physical attributes, stature and stereotypes are best avoided. In other words, you change the way you thin slice. And, it would help to reasonably limit the options/choices that you use to arrive at a conclusion.While the first two objectives of the book are well structured, it is the third aspect that the book lacks, viz. how can the human mind be trained. The reader is only advised that he must 'practice'; the examples mentioned thereafter are on how repeated mind reading enabled under less pressure could lead to reduction in accidental police fatalities. While I wholeheartedly agree that practice makes perfect, I definitely would have liked better examples. Or may be, there is no better example than sustained experience?Regardless, this is yet another brilliant book from one of the world's most original thinkers. The next time you come to a conclusion in the blink of an eye, try to ascertain what you did. You may be surprised by what you find.",

            "This book is worth the read if you a fan of Malcolm Gladwells writing/thinking style. I believe people too often compare this book toThe Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Differenceand are therefore disappointed in this title. However, it's a different book with a different spin on how we think vs. how we feel. The main point to the book is that too much information can cloud your judgment and make it difficult or impossible to make the correct choice. Rather, we are often better served by listening to our intuition. I saw that other reviewers were pointing out flaws in his \"proof\" or pointing out that there could be other variables at play. Yes, of COURSE. However, the fact that there are other variables is exactly the point. The variables are endless and sometimes it's better to go with a \"Blink\" decision. Ultimately, like explained insomething like God: Six Weeks to Spirituality, there is a greater power \"out there\" in the universe, and by tapping into it, we can sometimes make better and quicker choices. Heck, if it's the \"wrong\" choice, at least now you can adjust your path as opposed to always wondering \"what if\" for the rest of your life. :)",

            "This book was an eye opener!! He really describes the way we may decisions in the \"blink\" of an eye. But he also discusses how there are times when you cannot make decisions like that. I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanted to learn more about non-verbal communication. The book also gave me a better understanding of autism.",
            "I am a huge fan of Gladwell. I loved the Tipping Point. The man seems to spend his time observing the obvious - yet in doing so he seems to see things others don't see. Once he talks about it, one can't help but become aware of what he is saying. Ah well I am blithering here, but I want to say that I recommend this and all Gladwells books. Wrong or right, he does give one something to think about. Intuition is something that has been around forever, but Gladwell explains it.",

            "BLINK by Malcolm Gladwell.I smiled a lot as I listened to this book. It's about a dozen different stories illustrating how people think, feel, judge, and decide. Some show us that our first intuitive impression is better than lots of detailed technical analysis. Some show us how we do better by not listening to that first impression. We see examples of people who think they feel one thing, but the truth is different.Some of his examples and conclusions might not stand up to scrutiny by psychology/sociology experts. I could see a psychology student bringing up one of these examples in class, and the professor would debate and quote some research for and against. The debate would be fascinating and fun. Just know this is not textbook stuff. This is dinner topic fun. I love nonfiction that is fun. And this author has the talent to bring it to us.The author has a very good writing style. I enjoyed his use of clever phrases such as \"thin sliced\" (looking as a small amount of data), \"drink it in\" (when looking at someone's room), your unconscious was acting like a \"mental valet.\"NARRATOR:The author narrated his own book.

            "This was the first Malcolm Gladwell book that I've read. I've seen his TED talk and I've read books by Seth Godin and Daniel Pink. These guys are great at what they do and they have a very simplistic writing style that makes for easy reads.This book is perfect for a short, thought-provoking read. It's made me question snap decisions, though I'm not entirely convinced that they are better than well thought out decisions. However, I do believe that first impressions are real. A sneaky person is still a sneaky person 3 months later. Also, our environment can impact these first impressions.I kept thinking about how environment impacts student learning and interactions at school. Possibly, better snap decisions can be made about poor instructors and disruptive students. A student's environment can also give us better insight into how they learn best and how they interpret content.",
            "Blink has allowed me to reconsider the quick judgments I have in decision making and realize some are valid decisions while others still need to be thought through. Gladwell is a fantastic author whose writing motivates the reader to continue until the end. This is a MUST READ!",

            "This is a pretty good book. I really enjoyed it, but am giving it a four-star rating because it's not as good as his other books, like Tipping Point or What the Dog Saw. Same format and some very interesting stories that draw you in, but it just didn't do it for me like the others.I'd say go for this if you're a Malcolm Gladwell fan, but if you're new to him, start with Outliers or Tipping Point.",
            "I was at a local coffee shop which has a used book selling area. I grabbed this one for it's simplistic look as I was in the mood for noting serious... before I knew it over an hour had past and I was completely lost in contemplation. I am not too great at book reviews as I don't know what serious readers/authors/editors would say about this book.... but for a reader like me who takes things at face value this book was delicious. Without trying Malcolm had me thinking about things that up until then had only been subconcious reactions and understandings about the world around me. I grew to have a much keener mind and attitude about all things \"Blink\", and you will just have to read the book to know what I mean by that as it's not something easily described. A point I can easily make here is that Malcolm describes this phenonmenon if you will with creativity, ease and a fascinated disposition. As you read you can feel his excitement and amazement over the things he has learned, almost as though it is a treat to be telling you such wonderful and intriguing stories.I recommend this book for anyone interested in the subtleties and grey areas of life less explored. It will have you thinking philosophical, deep and profound thoughts within the first 5 pages. I am truly impressed by this book.",
            "Blink is a short and artful compendinum of many known incidents of foretelling in a crisis. There isn't a lot new here but its a well told stringing together incidents resolved by intuition. But intuition is too lax a discription. What, Gladwell really reveals is how bits and pieces of our past exprience come instantly together, a processes suggestive of lens clouded with the detrius of missinformation, but one which still renders the outlines of fact in the blur and hurry of a needed decision. \"Blink\" will be new stuff to many but to those who have been around a whild it is nonetheless a refresher course how decisions are made, often under duress.",
            "Is it true a fake can produce intuitive revulsion in the eye of a knowing observer? A blink is a glance, fast and frugal decisionmaking.The truth of a marriage can be understood by an observer in a short time. A relationship between people has a distinctive signature.Free will is an illusion. We can be coached, primed. Gladwell speaks of thin-slicing, the process of making decisions quickly on the basis of very little information. When you start second-guessing you may be undermining yourself. Sometimes extra information just confuses the issue.Thin slicing is recognizing patterns and making snap judgments. It turns out that buying jam is a snap decision. Less choice means more sales. The face is an enormously rich source of emotion. Every blink is a series of discrete moving parts.Music auditions are thin slicing moments. The use of screens, blind auditions, has changed the composition of orchestras.The notes at the end of the book are of great interest.",

            "Instinctive decision and I placed the book back on the rack when I first picked up at a local bookstore. However, again some hidden instincts made me read the book. The cover page ain't impressive and its a snap judgement, maybe. In a Blink, the decision is instinctive - That's what the Book speaks about. The best selling author of 'Tipping Point', Gladwell reveals psychological facts on behavior patterns of people. Gladwell builds his cases that are supportively influential to a reader and makes him think small and focus on the meaning of \"thin slices\" of behavior. He has case studies on car selling, heart attack, etc. which explains his concept of thin slices - upon the information, derive to decisions. However, I feel that often the judgements may wry wrong with the decisions if its only based on information. The sixth sense or intuition plays an important role in thought manipulation. Snap judgements turn people off-track in decision making sometimes but in a blink, first decisions do turn the other way round. Experts in the field have proven decision and are correct in their presumptions. However, Gladwell's case studies is indepth as to pros and cons on accuracy and how one can go about 'Blink' - snap judgements. The book is fine as long as you like to ponder over. The fact remains - your own snap judgements or the intution, the sixth sense always helps you to make decisions! Fine read.",

            "Well, I rushed out to buy Blink and after the first 20 pages or so, I realized that this book was not worth the money. The Tipping Point was an interesting book, but in this boring and silly volume the author tries to analyze all sorts of topics without the credentials to do so. The reader is left with information that seems upsupported and in some cases outdated. Moreover, the book needs a good editor. Even some of the basics of English have been overlooked. For example, the author mixes a singular object with a plural subject in this sentence, \"we need the ability to know our own mind.\" There are a number of examples of this throughout the book and it made me think that the author and the editor rushed to get this book published. What a disservice to readers and what a shame. You know one would think if the author is so good at examining the mind, he would be as good at catching first-grade grammatical errors.",

            "I have quickly and easily decided with my first unconsciously guided impulse & gut intuition not to buy \"Blink\".",

            "I enjoyed reading this book, the language is easy and the subject interesting. I do however think that for so long of a book, there isn't much substance.",
            "I enjoyed reading \"Blink\". The whole issue as to whether or not we are \"robots\", and the nature of our \"programming\" and \"input-output behavior\", can be seen very starkly in sitting at the \"closed door\", as Gladwell describes the interface between environment and brain. One can illuminate much in considering the \"trendy\" subjects that occupy us: science, technology, war, politics, racism and sexism. I like the manner in which he criticizes, with an edge of objectivity, and appears to expose weakness, and yet displays a balancing compassion. He handled the case of the autistic person in a particularly sensitive manner which I appreciated, as a mathematician, since so many good mathematicians seem to be at least borderline autistic. Having myself been mistaken sometimes as having Asperger's syndrome, I could relate quite personally to what he described. Ultimately, we do not currently understand how to open that \"closed door\", but it is quite fascinating to sit at that edge that separates us from the inner life of the brain and the rest of the world.Much of the work seemed to be speculative, without a focused scientific basis, or rigorous theory. I can see that the numerous connections drawn in the course of developing these ideas could seem tenuous or superficial. One sees the overall connection converging on the \"closed door\" (more a metaphor than a true dichotomy between the inner workings of the mind and the external world), and just as with contemplating the significance of the event horizon of a black hole, one is aware that this is a crucial meeting point of disparate theories.",
            "The individual chapters in this book sparkle, like everything Gladwell writes, but the book isn't a coherent whole. We get the idea that we're better off being able instantaneously to \"mind read\" (i.e., read someone's intentions or emotions from their faces) than being like the autistic person who can't process these signals, and that those few of us who must make split second decisions like the police need to have such skills, but would we truly be better off in a universe where all of our thoughts and emotions could be read by others like an open book? If we had such a society wouldn't we all just have to spend time learning how to mask our emotions? A trope through the book is the fact that a couple of art experts knew \"right away\" that the Getty kouros was a fake, but Gladwell doesn't mention the fact that other art experts equally well respected thought that it was not a fake. (He sets up a dichotomy only between the one group of art experts and the science expert, ignoring the other group of art experts and making this seem like an open and shut case when it clearly wasn't.) Gladwell gives us no clues as to how we are to choose between competing groups of experts each relying on both their intuition and expertise. He raises the situation of medical experts having to triage patients coming to a hospital with chest pain (\"too much information that we attempt to analyze rationally leads to error\") but it turns out that analysis of vast amounts of objective data yields four factors that alone have virtually certain predictive factor as to whether a patient with chest pain needs to be admitted to a hospital. It is true that physicians were getting distracted by too much information and also true that the Getty curators were getting a lot of scientific information that turned out to be irrelevant. But beyond this similarity, the chest pain problem could be resolved only by close examination of the relevant data which turned out to be counter-intuitive, not by intuition. In the case of the kouros, Gladwell is making the opposite point that the \"real\" art experts can't really say how they knew it was a fake and therefore intuition, based on experience, should properly rule in these sorts of cases. Some fakes, however, will fool virtually everyone, and given that such an approach yields no method of resolving honest disagreements among experts with equivalent credentials, a modern society must reject it. In both cases the actual issue is the same: how to determine what we should measure, how to measure something in a way that will produce \"real,\" objective, verifiable data, what weight to give to each piece of data, etc. The problem with the kouros was that some of the information that the Getty was relying on was fake and that there was no agreement on what factors to analyze or measure and what weight should be given to those factors. The fact that the art experts who, in hindsight, turned out to be right can't articulate what led them to conclude that it was a fake does not prove, as Gladwell argues, that such determinations should properly be deemed to be forever beyond our reach.",

            "After reading Malcolm Galdwell's first installment,The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference, I had some idea of what to expect from Blink; a lightweight and anecdote-laded book that appeals to a mainstream audience.Blink is about gut feel, snap judgments, first impressions, interpreting facial expressions (which Gladwell calls mind reading) and a little bit more. Again, all backed by interesting stories of people and events more so than empirical research.The three tasks of Blink are:1) Convince you that decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.2) Answers the question: When should we trust our instincts and when should we be wary of them?3) Convince you that our snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled.These snap judgments and first impressions are what Gladwell refers to as \"thin-slicing\", meaning \"...the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behavior based on very narrow slices of experience.\" (pg. 23).If you enjoyed the Tipping Point, then you'll certainly love Blink; more of the same Gladwell writing style and stories.",
            "After following Gladwell in the New Yorker, and enjoying his most recent work \"Tipping Point\", I've been eagerly awaiting the release of his newest piece, \"Blink\". Gladwell is the king of common sense, many of the points he addresses are based on what we already know. But I suppose that's the exact reason I enjoy his work so much. What many of us, not excluding myself, sometimes fail to recognize about the current understanding of the brain and human reactions - Gladwell saturates himself in. Secondly, being a lifelong fan of the Getty - I was pleasantly surprised with his remarkable insights into the museum as well.",
            "Blink provides a way to start thinking...without thinking...based on experiences. It was a recommended reading for me. I now make this a must-read recommendation for anyone wishing to understand his unconscious thinking.",
            "I had great fun reading Gladwell's 'Outliers', so I bought 'Blink' and had a greater blast. The book is packed with mind provoking examples to illustrate vividly the challenge of figuring how to 'combine the best of conscious deliberation and instinctive judgment' in our daily lives. The newly added Afterword by Gladwell also put his original writing in a concise context, with pragmatic 'call to action'. I do hope that 'Blink' can encourage one to apply its insight in solving practical problems, it certainly has the power to lead me to do so.",
            "This book is about first impressions and when they are accurate and when they are not. It is mostly examples and stories (many of which I enjoyed reading). Overall, I thought it was interesting, but a little slow paced for me. I would recommend it.",
            "This book was very interesting to me, though I will admit it got boring at parts. Some sections were just very repetitive and seemed to be overkill, but the overall message the book sent was intriguing. It helped me understand the way the mind works and how people use this knowledge of their minds for good or evil. No, I wouldn't read this book if I didn't have a good understanding of the English language. And no, I most likely will never use the information I gained from this book for anything other than answers to Jeopardy questions or a means to impress someone. However, if you're interesting in the way that the mind works, I suggest this book. It's not as overly confusing as many other books about the same topic and it uses real-life experiences to help you understand what is trying to be conveyed.",
            "This is a book about snap judgments, decisions we make in the blink of an eye. It starts with wonderful examples, but it ends with the far more numerous disasters. If anything, Gladwell is too generous. Snap judgments are familiar to all of us. They are often at the beginning of some sequence of events we have regretted for years. Gladwell suggests we take new interest in this dangerous decision making strategy. Therefore, be warned. This book can be dangerous to your health!The book is an extended collection of magazine articles and seems to skip from topic to topic. The journey can be engaging, but the 'grand' theme gets obscured. Fortunately, the book is a quick read. Unfortunately, it doesn't cover anything in much depth. The most glaring omission is any differentiation of neural activity in the enteric (gut), limbic (lizard brain) and neocortex (mammal brain). But, it isn't necessary to know these neural mechanics to get something from the book and that is why many intellectuals will hate it.Gladwell suggest the odd notion that thinking in words can be counter productive to good decision making. The argument has obvious merit to the pragmatist, but telling someone 'in words' to 'avoid words' is somewhat paradoxical and will cause the word academic intellectual much distress. To make sense of this, Gladwell is advising a balance of word and action (rehearse, rehearse, rehearse). But, how do you get the reality of this across in words. Gladwell doesn't investigate this conundrum.Additionally, several arguments will upset the intellectual reader's sense of propriety. First, Gladwell has the temerity to link genetics and intelligence. Actually, Gladwell is smart enough to avoid the direct argument, but he does present an alias: genetics provide us with snap decision making skills, some people have better starter set than others. For many academics, this is proof Gladwell should be sent to the gulag.It is tempting to dismiss the importance of snap decisions since the 'really important' decision must be reviewed and people have been arguing over how to decide things since time immemorial. Don't take that escape route. Consider the autistic individual, someone who has no social timing and cannot successfully decide what to focus upon. This person will often never learn to speak. The ability to make snap decisions is critical for simply existing as part of society. Understanding the process is central to assisting those who have difficulty joining us.Here is an outline of Gladwell's argument:1. The best decisions are snap decisions: Gladwell has lots of examples demonstrating the idea that 2 seconds is about one we need:a) Reading faces in such a way it seem you can read minds (hint: Look for defensiveness, stonewalling, criticism and contempt)b) Saving museums from fraudsters.c) Winning warsd) Gambling to win2. Words are the enemy of good snap decision makers:a) gamblers in tests figured out stats for winning before they could 'tell' someone the rulesb) sports greats don't know what they do that makes them winc) It is easy to unconsciously prime someone to act as you wish them to actd) The ventromedial prefontal cortex makes the decision and you can't control ite) We seem to have (at least) two minds, conscious and unconscious. both are always working to find answers, sometimes the conscious listens to the unconscious, sometimes it doesn't. Use of the 'conscious' mind can overshadow and supress the 'unconscious'3. Your starter set of 'snap decisions' will remind you of a 5 year olda) We cannot help but be attracted to tall dark handsome archetypes, so we elect empty suitsb) Clinical tests prove almost everyone's snap decisions tend toward race and gender bigotry.4. But, don't give up. Some have snap decision skills that can be developed:a) Learn the rulesb) Practice the skills,c) Engage in full scale rehearsals (examples: army exercises and impromptu comedy)5. Roadblocks to training (1): verbal overshadowing:The left hemisphere thinks in words and the right hemisphere thinks in pictures. If you happen to watch a bank robbery, then describe the event in words, something happens. The words displace your visual memory and you can't identify the robber in a lineup. In another study, people who were asked to write about their thoughts solved 30% fewer puzzles than the control group who were allowed to simply cogitate. Avoid thinking in words, they will hide anything your gut might have to say on the matter. Intellectuals are not going to like this advice!Gladwell's solution: put the words in a decision tree so you preprogram the information search to allow your gut a chance to get involved. (see cardiac arrest decision tree)6. Key roadblocks to training (2): misguided simulationsa) Bad market surveysb) Bad military simulationsSolution: Knowing how people make decisions is more important than any single fact or opinion. (Gladwell is very brief here)7. Key roadblocks to training (3): stay in the zone (manage your body to insure you can think)The archetypal 'blink' disaster is a police shooting some innocent man. Gladwell connects the high speed chase and group dynamics of the cop-car with the disaster. The high speed chase put the body with adrenaline, thus predisposing the policeman to use the reactions of a 5 year old. In particular, a cop with elevated heart rate and lots of adrenaline cannot read faces as well as the calm cop might do. Much of face reading is timing (something autistics lack) and in their 'rush' of the chase, cops will operate like autistics. The group dynamics provide a false sense of 'order' since everyone in a chase is basically 'out of the minds'. The solution is self-management. Keep the heart rate low, don't rely on others, fall back on rehearsed responses.",
            "Don't Think..Blink, that is the premise of this book. The author, makes an attempt to explain our instincts using some extremely flimsy scientific reasoning. The examples that are provided are real life and very interesting, however when it comes to backing them up there is a serious lack in depth and research.I did not find this arguments in any particular way convincing. Each chapter a reveals a real life story which is followed by some half-researched scientific explanation and in order to get the reader to believe: \"wow, I think like that!\".I give this book three stars, for the fact that it does point out the obvious that would otherwise go unnoticed by us. Where the author strays is in doing his research and backing up his findings with anything solid. I felt that the book's research appeared to be flimsy even if it had been exhaustive. The writing is at a medium level and easily accessible though to weighed down with scientific names in certain sections.Over all, read the book if you are interested but make sure to pair it with something with more substance.",
            "This book is nothing more (or less) than an intriguing and entertaining collection of anecdotes. Gladwell presents these as examples of how a finely tuned unconscious can make near-instantaneous decisions that are superior to the results of extensive information-gathering and analysis. Unfortunately, nothing of any substance is offered in the way of how to train your mind to \"thin-slice\" or how and when to trust it (Gladwell points out that the unconscious can also be disastrously wrong). Perhaps the author has left that for his next best-seller?",
            "I enjoyed the book and found it to be well written overall, though there was a bit too much handholding at times. I will certainly never be able to look at margarine or tall men the same way again and my interest in investigating human facial expressions has been irreversibly piqued.Given his discussion, both in the book and in interviews, of being mistaken for a criminal -- a rapist, and on 14th Street -- I can't help but think that Gladwell should have drawn a larger parallel between his own situation and that of Amadou Diallo (who worked on 14th street and was mistaken for a rapist). He instead opted, perhaps with a nudge from an editor or his mother, to look at that parallel through a very broad lens and wrote Blink when a different book should have emerged.That being said, Gladwell is to be applauded for providing in chapter 6 the most sober, intelligent and considerate explanation I've read for what happened to Mr. Diallo on that fateful night in the Bronx. In this final chapter, he brilliantly gives us an all-too-salient real world example which illustrates so many of the elements that he describes throughout the book.",
            "This book is about the all important two second decisions or impressions that our \"adaptive unconscious\" leads us to without the rigor of detailed analysis that we otherwise do. Instantly, I realized that my decision to buy this book from amongst a large display at a book shop at the local airport was one such \"blink\" decision.The author introduces the concept very well. I was immediately convinced that it is important to realize the power of \"thin slicing\" and the need to understand and cultivate the skill of harnessing its power in personal and professional life. The quantum and the degree to which it exists and manifests differs significantly in each of us. The book aims to explain the phenomenon, situations under which it is mostly right or consistently flawed and the means by which one can build on this powerful mental resource.The chapters that follow are exciting with numerous cases across diverse fields that can interest a wide range of professionals. As the pages flow, it appeared to me that this was a case of discussing the concept more and more without following a systematic framework for analysis and application. No doubt the case studies are interesting, but then the objective of the book should have been beyond narration of stories and to build and present a powerful tool for successful deployment. The author does discuss one such model used by doctors in a hospital for diagnosis of heart attacks which substantially improves the chances of correct diagnosis.Worth reading once. However this can wait till you finish reading other books in your priority list.",
            "This book is a classic example of how good editorial style masks the flaws of poor writing. The thought leadership in Blink could fill a postcard--at most a sheet of note paper, if you wrote in big, loopy cursive. But Gladwell's anecdotes are entertaining (if loosely tied to the premise) and his prose clips along (if repetitively), making for a mildly entertaining read.The first half of \"Blink\" is about why you should trust your instincts (the orchestra story). The second half is about why you shouldn't (the Amadou Diallo story). And very little effort is made to reconcile this self-canceling arrangement. As for the promised \"how to improve\" and \"how to overcome\" sections, they largely fail to materialize.On a positive note, the book is self-fulfilling in one way. My first thought when I saw Blink is that it was another phatic suit-narcotic. Now that I've read it, I can confirm empirically that my instinct was correct.",
            "Gladwell can write, that's for sure. It's not often that I can finish 250 pages of utter B.S. The claim was essentially regressing psychology. To me, it suggested that anecdotal evidence was often more valid than empirical evidence. Anyone who has ever studied a science knows that is a rrrrridiculous statement.Basically, Gladwell described the remarkable gut instincts of experts of a particular field. The truth is, he was describing a population of elites, not normal people. This book was advertised as a book that could be useful and enlightening, but I would say it's more akin to reading Teen People or whatever you may see while standing in the line of the grocery store. In short, some people are exceptional and different. I'm so glad I read a whole book to have that illustrated for me over and over and over and over again!Logically, I have to pan this book because of its lack of pragmatic value, however, it was a somewhat entertaining read. Some of the experiments described where interesting (although validity was rarely discussed) and the flow of the writing was engaging.My conclusion is that Gladwell would do well to try a different topic that he is better suited for, and if psychology and cognition is his expertise, then he should stop insulting the reader by glorifying anecdotal evidence",
            "I thought this book would be interesting. I was disappointed. Starts off talking about a statue in the Getty Museum. Trained experts ran tests and were sure the statue was genuine (from 600 BC or so). Other authorities on art did not run tests, but could tell just from looking at the statue that something was not quite right. However, with all their training and education, they could not put their thoughts into words. This is \"blink\". When you decide something, based on your past experience. Your decison may be right or wrong, depending on what your past experience is.So, stuff you already knew, basically. Because we all know things we don't know how we know, we just know. But personally, I have enough sense to know when I don't know. Gladwell thinks that Warren Harding was elected president solely because he fit the American's ideal of what a president should look like. I must have missed the \"What An American President Should Look Like\" class in 5th grade.Gladwell kind of jumps around. He talks about a professor who studies married couples, and based on whether they show contempt toward each other (rolling eyes), can predict whether or not they'll get a divorce and in how long. What's the point of this? Is this important work? Gladwell also introduces a used car salesman, who never jumps to conclusions based on someone's race, sex or attire, and offers the same price to everybody. He's fair, and he makes a lot of sales through word of mouth and repeat customers. Something any car salesman could learn if he/she had been in business long enough. So - that's not blinking.Gladwell doesn't back up his stories with any proof. It all comes across as his own flawed opinion, or maybe just some hokey made-up stories, and I'm not buying it. I thin-sliced and decided not to finish this book. Luckily I didn't contribute to his wealth since I borrowed it from the library.Interesting idea, but Gladwell does less than nothing with it.",
            "This book starts off with an interesting notion: There is a level of circuitry in our brain beyond our consciousness (or rather beneath it), that is capable of making sophisticated statistical judgments far quicker than our conscious minds know. This makes sense if you think about it, pattern recognition being a necessity to survival throughout the generations of any of our mammalian ancestors. If you are skeptical, Gladwell provides some nice experiments that seem to support the premise, lab experiments demonstrating physiologic reactions to patterns before the subjects can consciously verbalize the pattern or even alter their own strategy to these patterns. Somewhere deep in our minds is a great calculator, unshakably logical by design. But the conscious mind complicates things, because we desire certain outcomes and thus, also demonstrable, we are more likely to believe things we want to believe.Gladwell's suggestion is that we can benefit from training our minds to hear the little calculator, that the best decisions are the ones made in a blink. What we call gut feelings and intuitions are actually the more dispassionate mechanism lying within.To me it seems that there are certain kinds of analyses that benefit from being made in that logical processor and others that are hindered. After nearly a decade in school or training, my tendency is to think in medical analogies. Any radiologist that has been reading chest X-rays consistently for over ten years is welcome to interpret my films in a blink. And cardiologist who has been interpreting EKG's consistently for over ten years is welcome to eyeball my EKG and diagnose me in seconds. In my field, the answer is more complicated, which is one of the reasons it never gets dull. In Psychiatry, a pharmacologist who goes from symptoms to diagnosis to treatment in a linear fashion can probable do so in the twenty minute visits that are now the insurance industry's dictated standard. Likewise, a well trained psychoanalyst, a specialty equally prone to simplistic reduction, can come up with one of their fairy tales in a matter of seconds. But a broad-minded psychiatrist who employs a combination of psychotherapeutic modalities in the context of prescribing medications, a doctor who integrates thoughts on the mind, the brain, and the body that houses it, should not be coming to conclusions in a blink. Less is more only when less is more. However, Gladwell's book does a universal service in alerting us that this is in fact what we are prone to do whether we know it or not. Good mindfulness is being tuned in to our pattern recognizing processors, but also knowing when to feed it and when to starve it, realistically confronting it when called for and then immediately resetting it so it stands as a linchpin. It stands as the stake that tethers the generous leash of our doggie Buddha Brains, giving us some slack but then snapping us back, always reminding us it's there, the Now that cradles the past and imagines the future.This is a worthy read. Good food for thought. It's good to once in a while stop and think about how you stop and think about how you stop and think. So thumbs up. Stuff it in the novelty oversized sock of a loved one this holiday season. Along with a couple of those little nip bottles of Tanqueray, a handful of lottery scratch tickets, and some Sudoku pages from last June of your forgotten Sudoku-a-day 2006 calendar. Okay. What else can I tell you?",
            "This book is one among a number of recent volumes which speak to quirks in human decision-making. Each emphasizes that our brains are not ideally constructed to make rational decisions; some of these argue that rational decision-making may not be as effective as many think; some argue that the use of quick and frugal \"rules of thumb\" are (or are not) pretty effective. Works addressing such issues include: Tavris and Aronson, Mistakes Were Made (But not by Me); Gilovich et al., Heuristics and Biases; Fine, A Mind of Its Own; Gigerenzer, Gut Feelings; Linden, The Accidental Mind. And now \"Blink,\" by Malcolm Gladwell (author of the best seller \"The Tipping Point\").The book begins with a vignette, focusing on the Getty Museum being offered the chance to purchase a particular work. The Museum used scientific methods to try to determine if the object was legit--or a phony. They decided that it was good and purchased it. However, a handful of experts, after just a quick glance at the object, concluded that it was a fraud. Later research agreed with those snap decisions.This illustrates a key point made by Gladwell: Sometimes quick and dirty decision making is actually better in terms of outcomes than agonizing efforts at rational analysis. He points out that this is what evolutionary cognitive expert Gerd Gigerenzer calls \"fast and frugal\" decision making.A number of examples are used to illustrate how well \"thin slice\" decision-making can work. In a war game, one side (the Red Team) used \"out of the box\" thinking against the other side (The Blue Team), which represented the United States. The latter team used rational decision making efforts, did after action analysis at each step, and tried, in short, to use \"best practices.\" The leader of the Red Team worked more by \"feel,\" allowing his subordinates to take initiative on their own. End result? The United States was defeated! Gladwell's conclusion is that thin slice, fast and frugal decision making was more effective.He adduces any number of examples as to why quick decision making works better than rational analysis. This is firmly in the tradition of Gigerenzer and his collaborators, extolling the virtues of fast and frugal heuristics (decision making shortcuts).However, Gladwell understands that there is also a darker side to this thin slice decision making. Stereotypes can end up guiding decision making. He wonders if this explains the disproportionate number of African-Americans who are imprisoned, if this explains why some people get better deals in negotiation with auto dealers than others, if this is why Amadou Diallo dies in a hail of gunfire from police in the Bronx. And this is the side of decision making shortcuts that Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, and their colleagues address (see the volume earlier mentioned edited by Gilovich et al).The final chapter is Gladwell's effort to somehow encourage the positive payoffs of the use of these quick and dirty decision making processes while minimizing the negative consequences. Convincing? I'm not so sure, but the author surely makes us think about these issues. A very well done book.",
            "\"Blink\" does a fine job of shedding light on the decision making process. The primary concept of the book is \"thin slicing\"--making decisions quickly on a minimum of information. The author shows when it works and why. He also shows when it doesn't work and why. Finally, he shows the reader how to improve on his/her \"thin slicing\" ability.The concept of \"thin slicing\" is a great one, and the book is well written and easy to follow. Several reviewers were critical that the book was overly repetetive. I felt the author was simply doing a good job of demonstrating and reinforcing his thesis.After reading this, I think I will pick up a copy of \"Tipping Point.\"",
            "This book uses a lot of words to say very little. Basically, snap judgements and gut reactions are the result of very quick processing of information by our subconscious mind, and if we try to think hard about why we feel the way we do, we'll come up empty because that information isn't accessible by our conscious minds. So we should trust our intuition...except that we shouldn't, because our gut reaction can also reveal our inner racist and cause us to elect people like Warren Harding. So we shouldn't trust it...except that many major decisions can and should be made using a very small amount of information, because too much will hinder your decision-making process...but you can't know which information is critical without a lengthy and detailed study of all possible factors. So...trust your gut only if you're highly trained and not under very much stress. I guess. I was tempted to put down this book several times, but the writing style is actually quite engaging, and I had faith that the author would somehow tie up all his suppositions into some kind of generalized theory. He doesn't. He shares a lot of marginally interesting anecdotes, but I was definitely unimpressed. So if you enjoy arbitrary and often conflicting psychological conclusions supported by loads and loads of case studies from a large variety of fields (from New Coke to marriages to police brutality), you will like this book. If you're looking for a cohesive explanation or even a concrete argument one way or another, you will be left wanting.",
            "Blink is well-written, hard to put down, makes one feel he is learning yet another great secret of the universe thanks to the NY Times Bestseller List. And Amazon, of course. We live in an age of information overload. Thus, we need to have an indigestible surfeit of technical gobbledegook predigested for us like a cow predigests its curds.Cut to the quick: basically, some of us have more blink than others. Many of us can train to improve our blink. Blink is useful, sometimes vital - remember those old 'New England Life' insurance commercials about two men talking near a tall apartment building, you know, the one who has blink looks up to see a grand piano falling right towards his companion (who doesn't have blink) and pointedly asks, \"What's your insurance company?\" Reply: \"New England Life, of course! Why?\"Paradoxically, some blink is bad. For example, those implicit assumptions about people who are handsome or beautiful: Wrong! That's the Warren Harding error - the handsome, skirt-chasing nincompoop U.S. voters elected to the presidency in the 1920's. Bad blink. Remember U.N. ambassador Shirley Temple? Bad blink. First impressions can be dead wrong. Get it?Information overload can stifle your blink. Regard the U. S. military or the C.I.A. as hog-tied by too much data, too much systems babble. A little Via*gra might help them get some blink. An enemy hand-delivers messages, gives local commanders autonomy, strikes at will, refuses to fight pitched battles, employs lethal low-technology weapons (think: Molitov cocktail). Sound familiar? It's worked from the American revolution to Iraq. Large organizations always get their blink bent.Thinking about something is bad. When one goes on an introspection trip, their blink takes a U-turn. Fill out a questionaire on WHY one likes something and the answer is different from the original blink impulse of liking it. Hmmmmm. Very interesting. Only experts can retain their blink whilst they report their findings to major corporations: you remember 'The Pepsi Challenge?' We flunked it. Coke is better. The experts knew it all along. They had trained their blink to stay up longer.Lastly - I'm sure you were waiting for this review to end - there's that darned abnormal ventral temporal cortical activity shutdown. Huh! What? It turns out that when your heartbeat goes much over 170 per minute, you have about the same ability to discriminate nuances as your cocker spaniel does. Remember cops doing the Rodney Ki*ng thing? Or Amadou Dia*llo? Over forty 9mm slugs into a hapless guy who was just trying to pull out his wallet to identify himself to them. Time. Give yourself time to recover to under 150 heartbeats per minute so the deepest recesses of your frontal lobes (those are the ones you use to impress your date with how bright you are) will resume functioning normally. Eh! voila. You're a reasonably normal, sensitive human being again.This generation of readers, you, my friends, doesn't read Dicken's novels to get it about how to act in society. No, you read books like this one. What you want is a techno-novel like Blink. Everything you already knew, explained to you in pleasant, condescending detail. You'll feel as you did after you finally learned how to factor quadratic equations in Intro to Mathematics 101. A little smugger. Water cooler chatter. For $25.95 list. Such a deal.",
            "This book has one of those eye-catching titles (congratulate the author for that marketing coup!) that makes you want to read the dust jacket. I found the first part of the book interesting, and the last half a bit confusing. In the first part, I suppose the key point was: at least give your first impression a fair hearing - maybe a book can be judged by its cover, and Mr. Gladwell sure tried hard on his own book. I do not agree, though, that this first impression, the \"Blink,\" is an irrational process, as opposed to a thought-out course of action. That blink is just as rational and natural to the human brain, only much faster. Rational thought and action doesn't mean writing every decision out on 85 pages of 8x14 legal paper, in ink and in grammatically correct sentences.The second half of the book was less interesting. I still do not understand Mr. Gladwell's story about the SWAT team shooting, much less which point he is trying to make. Should the \"Blink\" have been ignored, or should it have been trusted? Nevertheless, the first part was good enough for me to recommend reading the book. The part about judging someone by what their dorm room looked like was quite good, based on what I have seen through the years. The impression shouldn't be of how smart the dorm-room-owner is, or how kind he/she is, or how effective. Dorm room condition does seem to be a good indicator of the person's mental process - how neat or sloppy, how careful or careless with property.I didn't buy it, but rather waited for it to become available in the library. Best way, I think.",
            "Perhaps \"Waste of Time\" is a bit harsh of a description for this book. While there are concepts and ideas inside that may be fresh to most people, some of the subjects Gladwell focuses on can be a bit boring or even a stretch to back up his point. He talks about how Coke changed their formula after the Pepsi taste tests showed people in favor of Pepsi, and a police force that guns down a child they thought was pulling out a gun that was actually a wallet.In regards to the stories Gladwell uses to back himself up, he gets into explaining how our tastes change when we consume larger or smaller quantities of a product, which is why Pepsi fared better in taste tests. He also got into how causing people to describe their feelings ended up changing the outcome of test results. I guess he was trying to prove how initial feelings can be different than secondary ones, but is this really a new concept?In the beginning of the book there was something strange about him saying that he was only going to focus on what he calls \"thin slicing\" (a term he uses annoyingly often), and wasn't going to wander off into other topics. Why would you have to say this to the reader? I find when authors try setting up thier books in such a way, they end up straying from their original intended purpose as Gladwell greatly does. While he says he spent a long time writing this book, the topics he chooses seem somewhat of a stretch to his original point that snap decisions are usually the best ones.What does all this tell us? At the end I can't say I have a convincing argument as to how snap decisions (thin-slicing) are better. In life I have found myself glad for not making quick decisions, rewarded by balancing all of the correct data. I feel as if Gladwell could just as easily write a book as to why weighing all the options equally prove to be just as rewarding.",
            "I note that many reviewers have condemned this book seemingly with a \"blink of the eye\". It has been criticized for lacking technical background, offering too much background, providing too few hard examples, speaking out of context...the list goes on. While the overall structure could be \"firmed up\" and some repetition removed, it is still a provocative study of snap judgements and unconscious decision-making.Many reviewers have confused two distinct issues: The first one concerns everyone and how they unconsciously hold prejudices and attitudes, mostly cultural, that affect decision-making. The second concerns those individuals who, after only a sliver of data, can discern truths that stun in their accuracy. The author stresses repeatedly that this second group is NOT a random group of folks from the local bar but is composed of experts in their particular fields - food tasting, military prowess, counseling, \"reading\" faces, tennis, insurance, art. etc.Many of his \"solutions\" for overcoming societal or cultural biases seemed fuzzy at best. \"Putting ourselves in situations\" where we feel comfortable with all types of people sounds great but that is a conscious decision that one must make to affect our unconscious attitudes - a contradiction. The many tests were interesting and revealing and while some may ask whether only examples were offered that supported the author's thesis, it is safe to say that he is correct in the germ of his argument.What I fault the author for is suggesting that anyone can \"blink\" like an expert. That is simply not possible. All the experts were highly qualified, most all highly educated with curious intellectual abilities not shared with the general populace. His most telling point is that studying of \"blinking\" decisions can lead to safer crime patrol, fairer hiring and other admirable societal goals. A very worthy, provocative read.",
            "This extended journalistic essay is a fun ride. I like that Gladwell drew his examples from a wide variety of professions and contexts: the world of marketing and advertising (the Pepsi challenge), the buying and exhibition of antique art (the Getty's purchase of a fraudulant kouros), political campaigning (Warren G. Harding and Bill Clinton), rock music (the not-easy-to-classify artist Kenna), hospital emergency triage work (Cook County Hospital's introduction of a simple diagnotic protocol to determine which chest pain patients were most likely to succumb to a full-blown heart attack), orchestra auditions (the increasing use of \"blind\" auditions to force judges to base their assessments solely on what they hear), and police work (the Rodney King and Amadou Diallo fiascos). He augments these ancedotal findings with more scientific studies (such as findings from an extensive breakdown and cataloguing of facial expressions and work with an autistic man). The snap decisions we make, called \"thin slicing,\" can help us make urgent, life-saving decisions, or can (under certain circumstances) guide us to make the most disastrous of choices. Gladwell seems to be fair in considering the pros and cons, but in the end his project seems mainly to be to inspire in us a sense of awe for the powerful gift we all have, one which ultimately eludes logical explanation.Great for the beach on long train ride.",
            "I have been a major Malcolm Gladwell fan for years. But for all of the hype this book has attracted (and that might well be part of the problem), this one doesn't even come close to meeting the standards of his past efforts in terms of the calibre of the research, fresh perspective, new insights and writing. I have found that much of his work in The New Yorker of late falls short on the same counts. Perhaps he has forgotten that less is more and that his fans expect him to meet the high bar and standard he set for himself in the past? Or maybe someone should tell his publisher to stop hounding him for more books that don't make the grade to fill their pipeline?",
            "The author references some very interesting studies, including how one professor is able to predict with 95% accuracy whether or not a married couple will still be married in 15 years by observing the couple for 1 hour and identifying some key behaviors. Overall though, the author never forms conclusions that can be applied to life. After reading the book, I wonder to myself, how am I better informed about making snap judgements than I was before? I honestly don't think I am. Good start to the book. Poor finish. Also, many of his anecdotes are lengthier than they need to be. All-and-all, it's thought-provoking, but not instructional at all.",
            "This book should be taught in economics courses side by side with Freakconomics. The indepth coverage of economic learning is amazing.

            "Mr. Gladwell did a fine job following up Tipping Point. I've already noticed the way I see things both when I step back and think about it and on my first impression. I have more appreciation for thin-slicing now. This book would be great on a 6+ hour flight.",

            "Provocative book on the positive power of snap judgments, but it also addresses how they can mislead us. The \"editorial review\" here is good so I won't go on and on about the book.

            "I believe that Malcolm Gladwell belongs to the new generation of authors - the ones who definately look at the things out of the box and take their readers with them. The best thing about the Blink is that it makes you reflect on your own expereinces in life, even makes you think in a different dimention. I found this book a fascinating and easy reading - great book to read after work and add more enthusiasm into the daily routine. This book definately stays in your mind for a long time as a point of reference - and if you are interested in a deeper understanding of one of the concepts, Gladwell offers a wonderful choice of literature for the curious minds.",

I don't know what blinking has to do with it at all, though & that's why only four stars. Yeah!",
            "I have long believed that we need to trust our \"gut feelings\" about situations and people. This is now described and spelled out in a book - BLINK. A gut feeling has to do with instant recognition about something. It also has to do with your mind's ability to call up experiences on the spot as you confront a new experience or situation or person. BLINK affirms and ratifies those recognitions and judgments. The book details many interesting scenarios regarding this ability that we all possess and need to trust. Lynne Coates, retired teacher",
            "Blink is about rapid cognition, about the kind of thinking that happens in a blink of an eye. Making a decision within the first two seconds of looking-the glance that knows and interprets the fact in an instant. Gladwell emphasizes the first two seconds, because in that instant conclusions that we reach are really powerful and really important and, occasionally, really good. Unlike intuition, what goes on in the first two seconds is perfectly rational; it's just thinking that moves a little faster and operates a little more mysteriously than the kind of deliberate, conscious decision-making that we usually associate with thinking.Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology, he shows how the difference between good decision-making and bad has nothing to do with how much information we can process quickly, but on the few particular details on which we focus. Gladwell reveals how we can become better decision makers--in our homes, our offices, and in everyday life. The result is a book that is surprising and transforming. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.Gladwell, campaigns for snap judgments and mind reading with a gift for translating research into splendid storytelling. Building his case with scenes from a marriage, heart attack triage, speed dating, choking on the golf course, selling cars, and military maneuvers, he persuades readers to think small and focus on the meaning of \"thin slices\" of behavior. The key is to rely on our \"adaptive unconscious\"--a 24/7 mental valet--that provides us with instant and sophisticated information to warn of danger, read a stranger, or react to a new idea.The book is well rounded as it presents the limitations with rapid deductions. There are obvious caveats about leaping to conclusions as: marketers can manipulate our first impressions, high arousal moments make us \"mind blind,\" focusing on the wrong cue leaves us vulnerable to \"the Warren Harding Effect\" (i.e., voting for a handsome but hapless president). Then in explaining the Pepsi challenge he elaborates how people can be attracted to Pepsi (which is sweeter than coke) in taste tests. However if the entire drink is taken Coke is markedly more attractive to the same group. In a provocative chapter that exposes the \"dark side of blink,\" he illuminates the failure of rapid cognition in the tragic stakeout and murder of Amadou Diallo in the Bronx. He underlines studies about autism, facial reading and cardio uptick to urge training that enhances high-stakes decision-making.",

Now I read this book and thought it would be something totally out of this world (considering the buzz about it everywhere and nearly every excutive I meet citing terminology from it), but after reading it, I feel cheated out of the money I spent on it. So what does this book teach you? In one word \"nothing\" other than relating a whole spread of stories about people who can take instantaneous decisions. It is very ironical that Gladwell who exhorts to not overanalyse things spends so much time himself on the topic.Bad read for people who aim to learn things, more suited to people who are accustomed to reading publications that provide more gossip and little useful information. I think folks who shop the HSN will identify very well with the Blink way of decision making.",

            "I finished reading it in one sitting as it is a highly readable and entertaining book. That said, it has to be admitted that it did not reveal any significant new bits of information to me. Most of the assertions of the author are already well known. Actually little has actually come out of the authors mind and a vast portion of the book is made up of nothing but a series of anecdotes collected from various sources. The anecdotes are interesting but I did not see any of them supporting his cotention that \"blink\" judgements are better than deliberate judgements.At times I felt as if I was reading a book on the art of marketing products and services to consumers.The reason that this book is a best seller is probably because, in this age of information overload, people just do not have time to analyse all, or even part of the information available before making a decision. So, when someone comes along and says that snap decisions made on the spur of the moment can be as good, or even better, than ones reached after much deliberation, people can heave a sigh of relief for all the hard work that this will save them. However the book does not provide any guidelines as to how this \"power of thinking without thinking\" can be implemented in real life, especially in life and death situations, or in situations that impact us greatly on an emotional level. Additionally, even Gladwell admits that only the snap judgements of experts in their own fields have any validity to speak of and the snap judgements of people not belonging to that field are nothing more that random guesses.Even after reading this book I do not think anyone will actually come to completely trust his or her \"blink\" decisions. If anything, I am afraid, this book may lead many people to suddenly think themselves as expert mind-readers and lead them to form unjustifiable prejudices against many people who they meet by \"thin slicing\" a twitch of a facial muscle.If you want, just borrow this book from a library and make notes in your diary. The notes will occupy barely two pages. Save your money.",
            "In Blink, Gladwell assembles from many case studies, a strong argument for the amazing way we humans are hot-wired to make correct snap decisions based on minimal evidence. For sure, there are some astounding examples - of which the material on reading the micro-expressions of humans is the most illuminating. Clearly some people have a \"facial literacy\" that is quite astounding.But if you want to explore the reliability of the decisions we make in a blink of an eye, read up some of the writings of Kahneman and Tversky, who - on their way to winning a Nobel Prize - explored the perceptual and logical flaws commonly made by people. Or try the excellent prizewinning volume by Scott Plous: \"The Psychology of Judgment and Decisionmaking\" - which is a revealing look at our strengths and weaknesses in making judgments. In other words we're smart, but we're far from infallible. I feel Malcolm Gladwell could have balanced up his arguments somewhat without losing the immediate sense of marvel that he brings, so engagingly, to all his writing.Incidentally, another title you might check in this category is Sources of Power by Gary Klein, which looks at how people make decisions. I found this and Scott Plous' book a nice twin-act to go alongside Blink.",

While others of you with a mystical bent have seen many of these ideas already presented in Buddhism.

            "He promotes his book as a new contribution to the way we see and think, and that you would chance the way you see the world. He called it blink or thin-slice. However, he just rediscover the wheel because thin-slice is pretty much a synonimous of \"clinic eye\" and this concept is very old. For instance, I heard about clinic eye about 15 years ago, and I know that it was not something new at that time. Clinic eye is like when you mechanic tells you what is wrong with you car in a few seconds by just looking its smock. Clinic eye is when a police think somebody is suspicious by just looking on his behavior and look in a few seconds. Clinic eye is when you mother tell you that somebody would not be a good fried in a few seconds by just looking at him. Pretty much this book is about \"clinic eye\", but he called it \"thin slice\".

The different elements of the book didn't seem to fit together as well.However, I do still recommend it...just keep your expectations at a normal level to begin with and you'll be happy at the end.",
            "The book is interesting to read but it doesn't offer much (or anything) in the way of \"lessons to be learned\". It discusses how some people have developed a good intuition and why that intuition is sometimes wrong - but offers nothing in the way of improving your intuition / decision making ability.",
            "This is the type of book that you will want to re-read over and over again because it is well-written, entertaining, and insightful. The premise of the book is that we can know something without really knowing it. Gladwell uses a number of unique examples (such as the Getty's near $10 million dollar blunder on an artificial Classic statue, and how improvisational comedy works) to show how we can surmise certain things in a blink of an eye.Gladwell's proof is anecdotal for the most part (which makesOn IntelligenceandStumbling on Happinessgreat companions to this work), but the author gives us a great look into an almost sixth-sense we humans have though we may not be completely aware of it. He goes on to describe intense scenes where blink-thinking (meta-cognition) wasn't used properly (crime scene botching and in the Cola Wars) and a number of other entertaining stories.This work and another of his (The Tipping Point) have been very influential in recent popular books includingMade to Stickand my own personal finance book.",
            "An effusive monologue fortified with contrived oversimplifications does not make something factual or profound. In the end - I am right back where I started - only slightly chagrined for expecting to have gleaned some cogent insight regarding the recent advances in cognitive science in exchange for time invested.Granted, he's a deft writer. However, if you've had a college level introduction to psychology - you will struggle holding back natural questions that one would assume he would address in the succeeding pages - but no. Consequently, your \"bovine excreta detector\" will(or should) remain illuminated throughout the entire book.",
            "It is absolutely amazing how much we take for granted about our abilities as human beings with an amazing brain and its capabilities. I think that I read this book in one night. I was drawn in by the stories and the science and experiments that offer support to the ideals that Gladwell writes about. This book really made me think about not thinking about everything (excuse the pun). I learned alot about the unconscious mind and have learned to apply some of the ideals of this book to my life.",
            "In just a few short days of reading I was able to understand that those moments of clarity of purpose, those insights to my understanding why people do what they do, is actually me making a judgement in a \"Blink\" of an eye. Not based on ESP or clairvoyence but because my mind is preprogrammed through my lifes experiences and education to make instant judgements. An eye opener for me was that within one week of reading Blink I was faced with reversing my opinions of several very fine people who I had underestimated based on their appearance or their mannerisms.",
            "Blink is an entertaining read. Lots of interesting stories and anecdotes. It was also a quick read. Nothing too terribly deep or thought provoking to slow down for and contemplate. The actual \"lessons learned\" are few and far between, and not well tied together. I did find the book changed my perspective somewhat, but not in a significant way.",
            "Gladwell is certainly more talented than I am. If he were to write the review I am writing now, the review would be 8 pages long, it will make essentially the same point that I will, but you won't get bored at all.That's my impression of Gladwell based on Blink. There is, IMHO, exactly ONE point conveyed by the book. There are numerous examples that I have (and you too could) used to start or maneuver cocktail conversations. But the insight from each example is the same. It is ridiculous that any review of the book basically gives this away also.It is interesting and light (mostly) - so it makes good reading material for bedtime or the subway.But this is not a book you want to buy - this is poor reference material, and you could borrow it from your library and return it in two days anyway!",
            "This book relates the work of different psychologists and scientists who have done research on the power, benefit, and downfalls of split-second decisions. This research is combined with the experiences of those involved in the arts, sports, advertising, law enforcement, sales, and other activities. Gladwell weaves together a work that clearly explains how often split-second decisions are made, even in important matters. While Gladwell explains the benefits of this decision making, he also highlights the possible pitfalls of quick decisions, such as the different biases that might come into play.Quote: \"The power of knowing, in that first two seconds, is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few. It is an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves.\"I really enjoyed this book considerably at the beginning- I learned some new things, thought of things I already knew in different ways. Although I thought the book began dragging in the middle, to me it was not enough to prevent the book from being enjoyable.",
            "I was really excited to read this, but I thought it was just okay. He kept repeating the same idea over and over. It was one idea stretched ad infinitum. I don't regret having read it, but I still don't think it's brillian by any means.",
            "I have completed 75% of this book and found very interesting to read. I feel that there is a lack of information on how to use the information the author has presented.",
            "I enjoyed this book because Gladwell attempts to quantify and describe something that many people recognize on a subconscious level - that first impressions are very important and that your initial reaction of someone or something often turns out to be strangely prescient. It's that gut feeling you have upon many encounters, and combined with ongoing new research in the worlds of sociology, pyschology, and even physics (energy + aural relationships) it is very OTM - of the moment.Gladwell uses a sharp, chatty style to the book which makes it a quick read, and the lessons are not difficult. In general, I would say its better than his first book, which was already an achievement, but the idea is less zeitgeist that The Tipping Point was. Its more a form of threaded common sense, which seems to be a Gladwell Trademark.It would have been great to see Gladwell focus a bit more on the business side of Blink, like how to use it, but hey, you can't have everything. It also would have been nice if Gladwell had addressed the Hub Culture angle to the book: social globalization has created this common, linked urban community around the world, and it would be interesting to see how well he thinks they interact, read, evaluate and act upon their first impressions of eachother as they increasingly mingle through travel and virtual communication -- i.e. the modern world isn't just about the US and US examples.",
            "I finally got around to reading a book that's been talked about a lot in blogging circles... Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell. I found it fascinating, and it certainly explains a lot of things that I've often wondered about...The main question here is what happens in those first couple of seconds when you observe something? Without often knowing why, you make some snap judgements that can often be extremely accurate. But when asked to explain why you felt that way, it's nearly impossible to pinpoint the correct reasons. This process of decision-making is called \"thin-slicing\", and it's the stripping away of various inputs that don't end up affecting the outcome of your decision. If faced with 100 items of information about a decision, it's often just a small handful of items that consistently predict success or failure. The subconscious can often find those points and sift out the pattern without us being able to know why. Experts in a field, due to their exposure to the subject, can thin-slice even more quickly. They stand a better chance of being able to explain the \"why\" behind it, but even then it's somewhat iffy. Once you're aware of the thin-slicing phenomenon, you can start to accept it as a valid way to aid in the decision-making process.It wasn't covered in the book, but an application of this is something I've always found irritating in sports broadcasts. You have color commentators taking a play and dissecting the smallest movements in the players, explaining how each one made conscious decisions to shift the hips here or move the arm there. In reality, there's little conscious decisions made at all. The players are really thin-slicing the situation based on their past experiences, and making split-second reactions. The more experience and practice, the better the thin-slicing. All the extraneous action and information is stripped away, and the things that matter are handled instantaneously. If this type of thinking was more well-known, color commentators could be out of a job... :)Definitely worth reading and pondering. You may not agree with Gladwell, but it will force you to think about things...",
            "The book is based on an interesting premise and the writing style is very easy to read, it really sucks you in. I personally REALLY like Malcolm Gladwell's books/lectures/ideas -- he's defeinitely one of my favorites.Note that after reading this book I'm not convinced that I completely agree with the fundamental arguement it's trying to make. I also didn't like it as much as Gladwell's previous book, Tipping Point. But, I don't want to sound overly critical. What I consider high quality writing isn't based upon whether or not I agree with the arguement the author is trying to make. The ideas are unique and creative and that alone is basis enough for me to give this book four stars. One last note is that you might want to look at the rebuttal to this book titled Think! (I have not read it but if you find Blink interesting you would probably also like Think!).",

The pollen of popularization is still spreading across the printing presses... And we, the readers, violently sneeze out the allergies of oblivion as we thumb through the pages of these operating manuals for our consciousness...Excuse the late-night reviewing poetics. Seriously: be glad Gladwell writes so well - intuiton is no simple subject matter to \"thin-slice.\"Pavel Somov, Ph.D., Author of \"Eating the Moment: 141 Mindful Practices to Overcome Overeating One Meal at a Time\" (New Harbinger, Nov. 2008)",
            "An excellent book, just as good as Gladwell's previous landmark, \"The Tipping Point,\" \"Blink\" is fascinating in the confirmation that \"thin slice\" first impressions are more than intuitive, they are the results of subconscious factual significant experience and realities, and in many cases subconscious bias. Interesting too, is the evidence that we can think \"too much\" and counter our \"intuitive\" knowledge judgments with obfuscating factual study - \"introspection destroyed people's ability to solve insight problems\" and, as is quoted, \"what happens is that we come up with a plausible-sounding reason for why we might like or dislike something, and then we adjust our true preference to be in line with that plausible-sounding reason.\" I especially like the section on focus groups, how results on \"first impressions\" can be very wrong, \"We like market research because it provides certainty...but the truth is that for the most important decisions, there can be no certainty\" says Gladwell. I particularly like the example of how the Aeron chair by Herman Miller failed every focus group rating it took on looks, and \"likely to purchase\" reviews, yet became the best selling chair in the company's history (and then focus groups reversed their scores), ditto audience reaction to the best selling situation comedies of their time, \"All in the Family\" and \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\" Applying the analysis to a polarizing product today in the automotive industry, as someone who is looking at the launch of the new reaction creating Ford Flex vehicle (September 23, 2008), I'm wondering whether or not what Gladwell said about the initial \"looks\" rating for the Aeron chair is true for the new Ford Crossover in the looks department - that is, as its very different looking, \"Maybe the word `ugly' was just a proxy for `different.\" And when people get familiar with the `difference' time will change perception (as it did with the Ford Taurus over two decades ago). It will be interesting to see how this \"real world\" example of Gladwell's observations rolls out.",
            "We all take decisions \"in the blink of an eye\", even if it is only a decision of trusting a person or not. This is just how our brain works. Maybe we should not call them decisions, since the word decision implies some sort of reasoning and a process of weighing pros and cons. I would also not call this process thinking without thinking, maybe we should call it judging or pre-judging (\"prejudices\").A lot of information is stored, retrieved, compared and judged in seconds in our unconscious, a process of which we are completely unaware of. So it makes perfect sense that the more experienced and educated our unconscious is, the better these pre-judgements will be. I do not believe that a lay person would detect a false work of art by pure instinct (by a feeling of \"something is wrong with this work of art\"), like experts did in one of the stories. Their unconscious perceived some \"anomalies\" quickly, by comparison with the huge amounts of previously recorded information of the period's artistic style. The experts could not explain why they felt that way, since consciously they had not noticed the anomalies yet. On the other hand, I think that a person with deep knowledge of people might have unconsciously detected that the art dealer selling the work of art was uneasy in some way, so he might have got a \"hunch\" that something was wrong.This book tells you that you should trust your gut-feelings, but that you should \"nurture\" them with observation and expertise to make them more precise. Since these pre-judgements are influenced by our cultural environment and far quicker than ourselves and our conscious rational minds, they are also the basis of unfair prejudices that can make you act upon them and which are difficult to override (the author even claims that in situations in which time is of the essence, they are impossible to overcome, since we react upon them before thinking). Test your \"sexism\" in a brief exercise in a chapter of the book, you might be surprised...The best we can do is probably let our unconscious pre-judge and then we can still decide via an analytical thinking process. Nature gave us both abilities, let's use them both.This book is an excellent compilation of captivating studies in very different fields, carefully selected by the author to make his point. How by artificially altering your facial expressions your mood can change (for example if you put up a sad face you get grieved), how a psychologist can tell if a marriage is going to last by studying how the couple reacts in a simulated argument, etc. are some of the most interesting studies presented in the book.",
            "If you have a short attention span, these short stories, loosely tied together by a few ideas is great for you. This is my favorite book of all-time. I seriously recommend this to anyone who is fascinated by the weirdness of the human mind.",
            "This book is required reading for all incoming freshman at the top ranked engineering school in the U.S. The book is very readable, insightful, and useful.",
            "A fascinating study of how the mind works and the effects our gut reactions can have on our decisions, \"Blink\" hammered Gladwell's point into me in an engaging and entertaining read. The writing is easy but intelligent, and I loved the specific examples and stories, particularly one about the war games. Not only do they help support Gladwell's notion but they're enough to create enjoyable stories by themselves.The main idea I took away? First impressions aren't everything, but they're a lot more than you realize.",
            "A very interesting and clever book. We know more than we might think when it comes to making judgments. Malcolm Gladwell provides excellent examples of how we can improve our decision making by paying more attention to our intuitive side. He's not suggesting that information gathering and research be ignored, only that we also consider the benefits to be derived from learning and making decsions in a different way. His examples are fascinating and the book's long term high ranking is well deserved. It's a hard book to put down.",
            "This is a very good book. (Sorry to repeat myself...) I really appreciate the other side of the coin. Thinking has been drilled into my head and I tend to totally ignore anything else. If it isn't a fact that I can define, it can't be not real or true. But there is some value in intuition. Some things are under the radar of our thought, (and should be, or we'd be overwhelmed), but they can be important. Intuition is our way of communicating that to ourselves.This book has gotten some criticism - of course people should think. But there has not been much written on the power of intuition. When a person is knowledgeable about a subject, and they feel like something is wrong, they should trust, or at least acknowledge and respect that feeling. You can't just trust your intuition (make a guess) and go with it if you don't know anything about the thing you are \"guessing\" about. But if you do know about something, say you are an expert on US Currency (or someone who handles money alot), and you see a $20 bill that something seems wrong, should you act on that instinct, or do you say - \"I can't see anything specifically wrong with it, so it must be ok.\"? If you were a foreigner, and came to the US, and looked at a $20 bill and said - something seems wrong about this, of course you can't go with that feeling, because you don't know anything about a $20 bill.Anyways, read the book. It's worth it.",

            "Years ago, Legendary NBA Coach (recently retired) Phil Jackson started handing out books to his players, to rectify any flaws or hone any mental aspects of the game in the offseason. If a player had a problem with his jumpshot or defense, that could be rectified in practice, but if a player had an overarching attitude problem, or consistency problem, maybe that would have to be rectified with reading, and contemplation. And so, as far back as the Chicago Bulls era, Phil was handing out what he thought were great books, each one suited for each unique player's game, personality and weaknesses.A few years ago, I remember hearing he gave \"Blink\" to Kobe Bryant. Kobe, more than anything, has been known for these insane last second buzzer beater shots. He's taken tons of them. And if you factor in all the shots he missed, frankly, his hit/miss ratio isn't even that good. As the leader and captain on the team, he keeps finding himself with the ball in his hands at the end of games, and usually, he can get a shot off. Phil knew that Kobe was under incredible pressure late in games, in moments where every millisecond counts, and that's why he gave Kobe this book. If Kobe could just stop thinking altogether, he'd know exactly what to do. What could you improve if you could switch off your mind in the clutch?This review is going to sound like a Coda to the Steve Jobs book from last week. It just turned out that way. Steve, time and time again, relied on his intuition, laying waste to months and months of work, design, coding, budgets etc. What is our Intuition, really, and why is it so damn smart (at some things), if our senses and hunches seem, at first, so vague?First, let's go back to early stages of Man's evolution. We know that at some point, we were moving around, we were mobile, and we probably travelled in packs and tribes. How did early Man communicate? I can only speculate that there were a lot of visual signals (pointing, imitating large animals, etc), sniffing, tasting, yelling, whimpering, and so on. In other words, even if you toss the spoken word completely, you're still left with 5 senses, and those can still be employed to communicate (as a modern analogue, pro sports works, as does Improv Theatre, as Gladwell highlights in the book). Just look at a baby: the baby doesn't know what's going on, but instinctually does certain things to get what she wants. She's communicating at primitive levels. And we humans, in the modern era, do a weird thing: We teach ourselves to talk, to read, to study. We even learn thousands of very specific words to describe the world around us. Many of us even learn multiple languages. But if you really think about it, from Shakespeare to Stephen King, writing, at its best, is attempting to describe indescribable things. Writing and speaking, are, by their very nature, bastardizations, muddled, rough, approximations of pure thought and feeling. Verbal and written communication is inherently unclear and abstracted. So where am I going with this? Body language and instinctive forms of communication are pure, and it's that `language' we have to relearn, if we want to read systems and situations holistically. There is holistic communication going on, whether we like or not, it's just a matter of understanding the signals.Kobe Bryant dribbling up the floor with 11 seconds on the clock, down by three, isn't thinking (we hope) logically, but watching the floor for the tiniest of gaps, perhaps even noticing which of the opposing players is breathing heavily, or limping slightly. Where is the weak point?Why do some electronics companies spend so much time trying to design beautiful packaging, that seems to cradle the device like a precious jewel? Ultimately the packaging is going to be thrown out, right? The answer is that more companies are realizing that the whole experience of using a product contributes to the `Customer Satisfaction Rating` and if you push up that rating high enough, you get a sense of what kind of high price you can charge. That's perceived value. Visual, auditory, olifactory (eg. New Car Smell); it's obvious that all senses contribute, but perhaps those senses about a product, about a person, about a situation, are the most important of all.Over and over again, we chastize ourselves for `judging' people who dress like hoodlums, or look a little rough around the edges, but ultimately, aren't we just battling our own inner intuition? When we sit down to lunch with our high school friends, and one of them is wearing a beautiful gold watch, we subconsciously attribute positive traits to him, suddenly our minds start turning: \"How did he afford that?\", \"What did he say he did for a living? Something financial?\" We intuitively know everything we need to know about this person in just a few seconds, as long as we ignore everything we think we know, and listen to what our senses are telling us. Yes it's tricky. It's tricky because people often lie to us to improve their outward image/appearance. Toss out the company line, read the body, and the truth is right there, staring you in the face.More Reviews like this on 21tiger",

Did you realize that the first six seconds of a personal encounter 'the handshake and greeting' are 80% predictive of the outcome of the encounter? In 'Blink', Malcolm Gladwell will help you understand what happens during that first six seconds. Whether you are socially struggling or a master networker, you should check this out.

            "In the interest of full disclosure I am a huge Malcolm Gladwell fan and thoroughly enjoy the way he presents and supports his theses. In \"Blink\" Gladwell seeks to show us how our subconscious effects our snap judgments and gut instincts. I really enjoyed the book, and thought the manner in which the evidence was presented was fluid. The book is a very easy read and I found it affected the way that I went about my own decision making and personal interactions on a daily basis. For readers who enjoy books that make you think, Malcolm Gladwell's Blink is a must read!",

            "Throughout the book, the author offers numerous examples of how people make snap judgments, and how some of these are harmful while others are more accurate than decisions made after over-analysis. Unfortunately, though, the author doesn't say much about how to distinguish the two. I think we all know that people make snap decisions and that some work out and some don't. Gladwell tells us little more than that. For a book like this, it would've been much more helpful if Gladwell could offer insights as to how and when people should use snap judgments rather than just offering examples of them.",

            "Interesting but not great or revolutionary, There seems to be some publicity machine behind this book to make it in so many media reviews.The readers that think this is a great book, must have never read similar subject matter. It is a fun and interesting read at times. I enjoyed reading research studies that verified ideas I've read in other books about intuition and also how our thoughts affect our actions and behaviors. The problem with this book, as other reviewers have mentioned, is the fact that he just reports the studies, but doesn't give a plan on how to use this information in your everyday life. Having read many other books that are only about how to apply these concepts , this was not a big problem for me ,but it does leave the book lacking. It is a very interesting read and has good stories, worth reading but not buying. Of course, I usually limit my buying to books I want to read more than once or use as a reference. I definitely do not understand why it is on the top seller list and frequently mentioned in the media. The book is good, but not that great or revolutionary. He must have some amazing publicist!! Hope this review helps the undecided. First, try getting this book from your library or review thoroughly at a book store. Definitely worth reading, and it is very interesting, but it reads very fast and once read few will want to read again.",
            "Blink's subject matter is completely different than Malcolm's first book, The Tipping Point, yet it shares the same wonderful flow of great story telling which has become Malcolm's signature writing style. Each chapter shares a compelling story which leads you to rethink and then think again about how you make decisions. After reading Blink I had to stop and question what may be behind some of my own snap judgements.I had the wonderful opportunity to meet Mr. Gladwell at a book signing for Blink. After hearing him discuss some of the topics in his book, I'm ready to read Blink for a second time. I anxiously await the next topic he chooses to tackle for his third book and I highly recommend both Blink and The Tipping Point.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed reading this short and engrossing book. It was a great read, and once started, I could not put it down. Blink refers to snap judgments (really reactions more than judgments) particularly where these reactions have life or death consequences, such as a policeman deciding to fire his gun. In the tragic case of an innocent person being killed by four New York cops, there was no decision, no judgment, only reaction, a bad reaction in this case. In the case of the Getty Museum getting duped by a fake 2600 year old statue, the true experts immediately knew that the statue was fake, and their reaction was good. Gladwell makes useful points, such as : That the blink can trained and cultivated resulting in better reactions; that expertise and real experience usually results in better blinks; that if the situation is intense enough, many physiological systems shut down - including hearing, and bladder control; that additional information can actually lead to a worse decision by bringing in nonconsequential factors; being reflective in sports hinders performance and often a superior athlete gives the wrong explanation of what he's doing; that trained readers of faces can do a much better job of sizing up a person instantly. The story about Silvan Tomkins handicapping horses by looking at their faces was fascinating.Why the \"but\"? Well, I'm not sure that Gladwell is properly trained in this area and has the academic credentials to qualify as an expert in this area. Also, a lot of this is obvious, such as a trained expert would make better snap decisions than an ignoramus. Nevertheless, Gladwell is a fabulous storyteller, and he provides a great deal of things to think about. The points he makes are supported by beautiful real life stories, told in an artful manner. This is the heart of the book. If you don't read this book, you'll be missing out on a real treat.",
            "i would definately reccommend this book. it is an interesting subject, it is well written, and it makes you step back and realize how we take a large portion of our thinking for granted. when he talked about how words that we barely acknowledge can make subtle changes in our behavior and actions, it made me more aware of the potential of our brains, as well as more aware of what i am reading or seeing. this is not a self help book that tells you how to increase your thinking power. this book tells you that you already have the ability to make sound snap decisions and you should realize that.",
            "The first chapter was the hook, but as it went on it began to get a little repetitive. It wasn't really adding anything new and the topics began to feel scattered. It was as if the author had a bunch of really cool stories and facts that kinda-sorta all fit together, so he slapped them in.That said, I found most of it very interesting. It was also pretty easy to read - despite feeling scattered. If you're interested in a collection of psychological research in a fun, easy to read and understand format, pick up a copy of Blink. I enjoyed reading it.",
            "This book is basically a collection of various stories and their relationships to \"Blink\"ing, or \"thin-slicing\". The stories are interesting, and the book is somewhat engaging, but it all seemed somewhat incoherent. I came away from the book feeling as if I didn't gain anything new other than a couple interesting stories and maybe a fact or two. It's a good rental from the library, but nothing I'd buy again.",
            "This book is 50% \"thin slicing\", 50% lesson on stereotyping, and no real explanation on how to improve our already innate ability to thin slice. \"Don't rush to judgement without a sufficient knowledge of the subject and don't question yourself too much if you have sufficient knowledge of the subject\". That's pretty much the whole book in a couple sentences.",
            "I am a market research professional. As soon as I started reading this book I saw all kinds of practical applicatons in my work for using the knowledge in this book.I doubt many people will see this in such a tangible way as I do, but anyone will be fascinated by this book.It is a quick and easy read. I finished it pretty much in two days, but then, I couldn't put it down!There are techniques in here that can help you pass exams, feel better about yourself, just feel better etc. In a sense you can use this as a \"Self-Help Guide\" in that way.The main thing you will pick up from Gladwell is to learn to develop your \"hunches\" and your first impressions, and to trust them, because sometimes they are better than what you come up with from detailed rational analysis.All my life I have been told to analyse, analyse, analyse, get the data and let the data drive the decision. Gladwell is not saying \"throw all that away\". But he is saying that if your first hunch is negative and the data says positive - beware of the data. Trust your instincts.",
            "Although at times this book could be quite interesting, I found it to be unenjoyable. Often I felt as though the author was talking down to the reader and wasting time explaining himself too much.Gladwell does a decent job of introducing topics and concepts, but spends too much time telling explanatory stories and not enough time expanding upon the princpals behind them. Even with my rudementary understanding of psychology I often felt like I could have written a more through explanation of some of the topics. Perhaps Gladwell has a great many accolades in the area of psychology that I am unaware of, but after reading this book I have no reason to think that he does.If you are looking for an easy read that will not rot your brain or challenge it too much, this is a good book for you. However, if you wish to delve into the workings of the human mind and read something of a challenge then keep looking. I would reccomend Dr. Viktor Frankl's &lt;U>Man's Search For Meaning&lt;/U> as it provides much deeper analysis from the unique perspective of a concentration camp survivor.",
            "Unlike many of the unpopular reviews Blink has received on Amazon, I enjoyed it. While much of the information about our ability to make snap judgements versus using logic is not ground breaking information, Gladwell uses interesting examples and case studies to support his points; he successfully demonstrates how our intuition can be both useful in making decisions, yet harmful and ridden with stereotypes.The experiment which includes subjects who were asked to judge strangers' characters by visiting their dorm rooms (subjects observed belongings, judged how clean the room was, etc) was fascinating; the strangers who viewed the rooms were more accurate in judging character than the closest friends of the dorm inhabitants.",
            "\"Blink\", by Malcolm GladwellThis was a fun book to read. I've always been fascinated by my powers of intuition, and have long wondered how to more effectively - and proactively - tap into them. Mr. Gladwell analyzes various aspects of our intuitive natures, and his use of real-world examples helps to demonstrate how to apply various techniques he explains in the book. He also provides insights into a means of tapping into our self-conscious minds. Contrary to everything I'd read previously, this appears to be a skill which can be acquired with practice.The chapter on mind reading was also quite interesting; although I must admit I skimmed over the section which articulated the names of each of the facial muscles (there certainly are many!). I'd never before noticed how peoples' ability to read minds is so dependent on minute facial expressions.Having read Mr. Gladwell's book, I now feel equipped to progress my intuitive skills by using the tools his book has provided.If you're interested in intuition and \"being in the moment\" - which is a requirement if you wish to use your intuitive powers - you shoulddefinitely read another wonderful book authored by Ariel and Shya Kane entitled, \"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work\". This is a really fun book to read and offers an easy approach to living in the moment, and tapping into your natural intuitive abilities. Both are highly recommended!",
            "Second reading from Gladwell, with first one being \"The Tipping Point\", naturally. I am almost finished with this book so I might be doing a premature review. The book starts off strong, and captivates your attention from the start - the observations on small details and sub-conscious thinking that goes on in our brain is fascinating. I just wish the experiments listed were a bit more specific; as in the test environments, and all the control subjects. Sometimes I wonder well, did they look at this scenario vs. that one? I wonder (just slightly) if some of the conclusions might not be a bit premature. It is however an extremely stimulating read. I do like this type of modern pyschology and I do like how well the author writes. I do recommend it.",
            "As I read this, I kept asking myself if I really needed a book to tell me that at times my \"adaptive unconscious\" made quick decisions and that sometimes this was good and others bad. As obvious as some of the points in this book seem, it is important precisely because snap judgments are so natural I have rarely thought about the phenomenon.Several folks I know who have read this have asked me what is the point. To me that is the point. Gladwell does not provide definitive answers of how and when to use our adaptive unconscious. Instead, he provides us with plenty of information to make us more aware of how and why we make decisions. The real benefit of this book is that it leaves the reader thinking about blinking. This is no small feat considering it is something that I (and I suspect other readers) rarely thought about--in spite of the fact that we do it daily--before reading this.Hardly weighed down by excessive theory, the book's other charms are the innumerable entertaining stories and examples Gladwell marshals in support of his points. A good read that will inevitably influence the way you think and make decisions.",
            "Whereas 'The Tipping Point' seemed to lose me in how the total arguement was strung together, 'Blink' got a little tedious in that it spoon-feeds the storytelling yet never seemed to go anywhere. I consider it a quick, easy read and therefor worth the time and money invested. On the other hand, I want to say that it lacked depth even though I can't logically explain why that is. Certainly there are enough examples presented throughout and each was thoroughly over-explained. (Ugh.) Still, I finished the book wanting more...a stronger connection or something. The entire book felt like the build-up to a grand denouement that never arrived. It doesn't live up to the hype so just read it with realistic expectations. It *is* entertaining, let's leave it at that. ('The Tipping Point' was a much more satisfying read.)",
            "I often hear an interview with an author or read a review of a book that sounds terrific, only to learn when I read the book that I learned about all I need to know from the interview or review. Unfortunately BLINK fits that category although Mr. Gladwell does make some interesting observations that fall into the sad, the fascinating and the obvious.It is sad, for instance, that in the year 2005 we are still programmed by racial stereotypes when we blink. The shooting of Amadou Diallo is an unfortunate example. Police officers see a small black man on the street after midnight in a bad neighborhood in the Bronx. When they drive by him he does not run. Then he finally runs, attempting to get into his apartment and reaches for somethig that turns out to be a billfold. We know how this incident ended. Mr. Gladwell goes into great detail to explain all the mistakes that the polices officers made. For instance, if they had paid attention to his face they would have seen that he was frightened rather than dangerous. It is incredibly sad that in an experiment where black college students, when given twenty questions taken from the GRE, the standardized test for admission to graduate school, if asked to state their race on a pretest questionnaire, the number of questions they would get correct is cut in half, they are so programmed by negative racial stereotypes. (Congressman John Lewis has spoken out recently on racial profiling at airports.)Some of Mr. Gladwell's facts are fascinating. Shoppers will pay more for the same amount of ice cream if it is packaged in a round rather than a rectangular container, for instance. Then there is the Pepsi v. Coke taste test. Fanatics swear they can tell the difference, and many drinkers can. However, if you do the triangle test, where you put the same cola in two glasses and the other in the third glass and ask a thousand samplers to tell you which two colas are the same, only about a third of the testers gets it right. That, according to the author, is not much better than chance, so we might as well guess.Many of the author's observations and conclusions are obvious: what he calls the Warren Harding error-- that we often vote for attractive political candidates regardless of their qualifications; and that tall white men get promoted over black men, white women, black women and short white men; and that blinking or \"thin slicing\" is more accurate if it involves something we care about and are good at, i.e., we have experience in the area. He gives example after example of this: the psychologist who through years of study can predict from a short interview with a young couple- even if they are just discussing a pet-- if they will get a divorce down the road; the art critic who spotted an expensive fake immediately because she had studied ancient sculptures, the seasoned tennis pro who can predict when tennis players will miss their second serve.The Seventeenth Century philosopher Pascal is way ahead of Mr. Gladwell since he said something similar a long time ago: chance favors the prepared mind.",
            "Malcom Gladwell does a great job of discussing the pitfalls and powers of our instant perceptions. His concept of gut feel and the \"thin slice\" reminds the reader that our instincts and our perceptions (particularly visual percepions) are powerful influencers on our behavior. It is important to remember and understand our influencers and not allow them to disproportionally or irrationally impact our decision making processes. A great book to better understand yourself, others, and the psychology of interaction.",
            "Can non-fiction be well written, beautifully researched, entertaining and informative without succeeding in making it's case? If you've read Malcolm Gladwell's Blink, your answer is very likely to be affirmative. By Blink, Gladwell is referring to your first impression. Call it intuition (he won't); call it thin slicing (he does); his thesis is that first impressions can tell you much more about a subject than a lot of extra thought can. Never mind sleeping on a subject, or studying it; go with your instincts, first impression; go with your first blink. To make his case, Gladwell starts with some really good examples. He cites art experts that can pick out a well- engineered fraud in an instant. Then there's the military expert who uses quick thinking to defeat a superior force in a blink. By about a third of the way through the book, you'll be thinking, now this guy is on to something. But, alas, as you get into it, the examples get weaker. Doubt sets in. Indeed, some later examples completely refute his original organizing hypothesis that first impressions are more valid than too much analysis. Finally, in his nice conversational style, Gladwell cites several examples of policemen, who, in stressful situations, racially stereotype. What? It seems here the rule reverses: Don't jump to conclusions. At that point, you'll be saying Huh! By the last chapter, you'll be wondering if maybe they should change the title from Blink to Think.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed this book. As a non-fiction piece it is a quick, easy, compelling and even entertaining read. It's real value to me was in the individual anecdotes, particularly the ones about the Cook County Hospital and heart attack cases, the case of discrimination against women in European orchestras, and the Milennium Challenge in the Persian Gulf military exercise, all of which show how `thinking differently' can solve big problems without extended hand wringing, reports, and excessive committee meetings, the result being quick effective decisions. The documented studies he offers in some instances are helpful in justifying his conclusions.Gladwell addresses what must surely have crossed all our minds more than once, that too much information is just that - too much information. (In our `information age', internet-connection, and cell-phone-texting times, we are prone to just such overload, in my opinion.) But Gladwell shows how little information is very often needed for good decision making. He does not offer a formula, but rather stimulates thought about decision making, about the value of split decisions as well as the need in some cases for a more analytical approach. The challenge, in my opinion, is knowing when which application is appropriate. The value of experience is validated in this book.I would not want to have missed this book. It's too easy to get swept along in the information age, and miss our most valuable personal assets, our own experience. Gladwell helps.",
            "BLINK: THE POWER OF THINKING WITHOUT THINKING was a very interesting, quick read, that made me think of other books I've read recently on cognition, knowledge and decisionmaking, such as The Wisdom of Crowds by James Surowiecki (another New Yorker writer), The Logic of Failure by Dietrich Dorner and The Gift of Fear by Gavin de Becker (whom Gladwell references in this work). This book is about how we know what we know, how we decide when to act on that knowledge, and how our other emotional needs and underlying associations enter into our process to disrupt it. Gladwell writes about his premise linearly, developing his ideas and enriching the concepts as he goes along with rich examples from sports, pop culture, healthcare and psychological research. It was a fascinating and educational read.The subject of BLINK is that the human mind is capable of quick, decisive, correct thinking -- we can know things in the blink of an eye. Gladwell's introduction focuses on the Getty Museum's purchase of a kouros that turned out to be a fake. All the Getty's tests confirmed that the kouros, though very rare, was authentic, but when outside art experts saw it for the first time, they knew instantly that it wasn't at all authentic. How did they know? Some of them couldn't articulate this...they just knew that it was wrong.Gladwell states that this ability is founded on \"thin slicing\" -- the ability to separate necessary information for decisionmaking from \"noise.\" Gladwell then explores the \"locked door\" -- the premise that a great deal of our \"thinking without thinking\" goes on in our subconscious, and try as we might, we cannot understand how we know what we know. In this chapter, Gladwell explores psychological testing of human subjects with \"priming\" -- planting certain words in subjects minds and then watching how they behave in social situations (like planting polite words and observing heightened polite behavior or, conversely, aggressive words and aggressive behavior).In further discussion of subconscious influences on conscious decisionmaking, Gladwell uses the Warren G. Harding case as an example of cultural preferences for certain traits -- preferences that are rooted in the subconscious, of which we aren't even aware. In this discussion, Gladwell uses the Implicit Association Test research at Harvard (a fascinating experience...you can take your own at: https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/demo/) that measures the degree to which one holds preferences for thin or young people, or relates images of weapons to black men or science and math careers to men. This is cogent to the discussion of quick decisionmaking because these views may be predictive of how we may act in certain kinds of spontaneous situations.The subject of spontaneity leads to a fascinating chapter on a large war game, the Millenium Challenge, and the two approaches taken by its combatting leaders. The Blue Team used copious amounts of data, slicing and dicing. The Red Team, didn't believe that the fog of war could be lifted and went into battle giving a great deal of control and autonomy to lower-level soldiers and commanders. The Red Team won (until Blue changed the rules and started again!). Gladwell uses this example as a way to illustrate the damage too much information can do. A discussion of expertise follows in which Gladwell points out that experts snap judgments are different from the rest of the population's quick impressions because they are more informed. And this is, to me, the nut of the whole book. Blink thinking works best for those who have a basis of knowledge on a topic (such as the art experts' views of the fake kouros) because whether their decisions come from behind the locked door or not, they are informed by years of knowledge acquistion. They are often better able, as well, to understand some of the key aspects of their responses. The penultimate chapter is about the Amadou Diallo case in the Bronx, in which four police officers fired 41 rounds at an unarmed black man standing on his stoop after midnight. Gladwell's dissection of the case is fascinating and enlightening, as he takes the position that the police were neither racist nor blameless. Due to two aspects of the situation that makes people \"mind blind\" -- increased situational \"arousal\" and lack of time or \"white space\" to assess the situation, the officers acted out of their basest instincts because the situation (of their own making) reduced their ability to \"read the mind\" of Diallo. The final chapter includes an example of how our first impressions can be misshaped by other information that isn't exactly relevant, women earning positions in symphony orchestras by playing anonymously behind screens.Gladwell's work is so readable and fascinating and is a great reference for work, home and group decisionmaking because it explains our intuitive knowledge, when it functions best and when it misfires. I STRONGLY recommend this book!",
            "I've read the book a few times. The first couple of times I agreed with the criticism that it is a bunch of interesting anecdotes that don't actually come together into a theory. But now I think that all the examples do contribute to one idea and the problem is that Gladwell doesn't explain clearly exactly what he is doing. The confusing thing is that he is not just showing us examples of people caught in the act of rapid cognition. He is also showing us examples of things in nature and society that have data that could be processed in a rapid way. He is describing examples of the known along with examples of the knower.For instance, he shows that of all the data we could gather to determine the health of a marriage all we really need to pay attention to is whether or not the couple show contempt for each other. And that there are only a few things you ought to know to best decide whether chest pain is a heart attack. In the case of heart attack detection, he doesn't show anyone actually thin slicing. Instead he shows how a hospital set up a kind of artificial thin slicing by forcing its doctors to ask a specific set of only 4 or 5 questions instead of the tens or hundreds they possibly could attend to.The book goes on to describe ways in which people study a set of data for a long enough time that the detection of it has become part of their unconscious. It also describes methods people use to either avoid bad thin slicing or create the proper context for their thin slicing to work. For instance, he describes police departments that set up procedures to avoid getting into situations where they would have to depend on a rapid cogition that in times of crushing stress can move so fast it shuts out vital information. A good section of this book revolves around the idea that what an expert is is someone who has in one way or another developed his or her ability to thin slice and who also manages this ability by controlling the environment in which thin slicing is going to occur. Gladwell has not declared war on abstract thinking. He just thinks that one of its uses should be to open up more circumstances where rapid cognition can be used effectively and to avoid situations swhere its use is ineffective. It is hard not to agree with this once you consider how many times each of us has made a split-second mistake that botched a moment with a loved one or let the opportunity to do the right thing pass us by.I think the book is coherent, it just explores different facets and implications of rapid cognition without doing an adequate job of explaining its movement from one facet to another.",
            "Gladwell begins with a story about a supposed Greek statue that some experts, using scientific testing, could not detect as a fruad, while others were immediately suspicious. (So, some people look at the forest for immediate clues, before examining the trees in detail.)Another example involved a single tennis expert with an uncanny knack of foretelling when someone was about to double-fault. (The bad news is that he could not relate how this was done. Thus, what this proves is beyound me.)Still another revolved around an officer playing a \"rogue MidEast commander\" vs. the regular Army. Anyone who has been in government knows that it moves at glacial speed, and can easily be outdone by much smaller groups with a modicum of intelligence and speed (eg. Lockheed's \"Skunk Works,\" and Burt Rutan's \"space ship.\"). So the rogue officer's success is hardly suprising.To say that quick decisions - based on a few KEY VARIABLES - is better than studied analyses that include a multitude of minor issues is hardly surprising either.Finally, readers need to keep in mind that there will always be statistical abberations - eg. someone who correctly predicts the flip of a coin 50 times in a row. However, that does not prove that they have any special talent, and they are just as likely to be wrong as right on the next toss.Similarly, finding snap judgements superior to supposedly sophisticated statistical models does not necessarily support a conclusion supporting snap judgements - many statistical models are poorly specified and have embarrasingly large errors.Finally, would Gladwell ride a 747 designed in a manner he describes, buy a car similarly designed, invest in a corporation investigated in a style he supports here?Not worth reading.",
            "If you wanted to sum up Malcolm Gladwell's \"Blink\", I would tell you to see the very first \"Star Wars\" movie. Remember in 1977 when Luke Skywalker while piloting his fighter hears Obi-Wan Kenobi tell him to turn off his radar while attacking the evil star ship? Obi-Wan wants Luke to rely on the FORCE. In other words, give up his conscious thought patterns and go with your gut.This is what BLINK is all about. Our ability to instantly know what is real from what is fiction. What is good from what is bad? Gladwell is telling us to go with our right (creative) brain, and for the moment to shut down our left (logical, analytical) brain, and oh he is so right.In example after example, the author goes through diverse instances where people in just the time it takes to BLINK, can make FABULOUS decisions that turn out to be the right ones. Others using the power of their analytical minds can take days, weeks, and even months, and come to the wrong decision. There's something going on here, and Gladwell is onto it. Human beings have five million years of evolutionary history behind us, and consciousness for only the last 15,000 or 20,000 years.Somehow, we have TURNED OFF the power of our unconscious instinctual patterns, and overridden them with our super analytical ways of logic. The result is inferior decisions to what we had before we became conscious. Hey, when a lion was chasing down our ancestors for a meal, you didn't have much time to think.By the way, every page of this relatively short book is fascinating. You will literally not be able to put it down. Let's look at a few of the topics that Gladwell covers in depth and convincingly.A) The J. Paul Getty Museum & the Kouros StatueThe cash-flushed Getty Museum wanted to buy a 7-foot Greek statue for $10 million. With contract in hand they call in some of the greatest experts in the world who after running exhaustive scientific tests, agree that it's the real thing and you should jump to buy it. At the same time a handful of other experts just looking at the object instantly announce it's a fake, and you should walk away. Learn who was right and why. Hint: it took 2 seconds of looking to KNOW the answer.B) Who's a good Professor in less than 30 secondsRemember when we went to college we would attend a lecture or two to determine if we wanted to take the entire course with a certain professor. In BLINK you will see scientific studies that prove you can come to the same decision by watching a video of the professor for 30 seconds. Who's kidding whom?C) What if you could tell how long a potential marriage would last?This one is mind blowing. John Gottman of the University of Washington has shown in tests that he can do this with accuracy. Watching one hour of a couple talking, and Gottman can tell with 95% accuracy if 15 years later, they will still be married. Blink goes into it in detail. Too bad, I didn't learn about this study sooner.D) Why do some doctors get sued, and others not at all?You would think that the risk of being sued if you are a doctor is all about making mistakes, or improper medical care. BLINK shows that its really about words like \"RUSHED, IGNORED, and TREATED POORLY.\"E) Can a President of the United States be elected on looks alone?Read BLINK and you will see how an entire nation got suckered into electing Warren Warding President just for that reason, unbelievable but true. Read how and why, and be mesmerized.F) Only 14.5% of men are six feet and over. Why are 58% of CEO's six feet, or taller?Pretty wild when you think about it, yet true. Could there be some kind of unwritten or unconscious criteria for being a Fortune 500 CEO that involves height? There aren't enough tall people to COMPLETELY staff any one company. Why is it that the tall ones seem to rise to the TOP?G) Blue Team versus Red TeamThis is my personal favorite. The American military runs war games all the time. The good guys who are us are always the BLUE Team. The enemy is always the RED team. In preparation for the first Iraq war in the early 1990's, the government ran the exercise, and put General Paul Van Riper in charge of the bad guys, the RED team.The bottom line is that the bad guys blew away the good guys, the Americans by using unconventional \"BLINK\" type thinking, while the BLUE Team relied on conventional, overwhelming force, and inside the Beltway type bureaucratic thinking. This illustrates why this book is so important. You will learn out of the box type thinking.You will also learn when to use it, and when to go with your logical left brain type thinking. By the way in the war exercise when the bad guys, the RED Team beat the good guys the BLUE Team with ease, what did the Pentagon do? They announced that the game would be done over again, and they outlawed the techniques that the bad guys the RED Team employed.The result, the good guys won. The problem is that nobody told the bad guys in Iraq during the second Iraq War that these techniques were outlawed, and thus our Generals as usual find themselves in some difficulty to say the least. Read BLINK, and find out how and why. This book is FASCINATING, and NOT TO BE PUT DOWN, ONCE YOU START READING IT.Richard Stoyeck",

            "This book was an easy enjoyable read, but I haven't gotten anything new out of it. If you are a reader of \"pop\" writing, you might enjoy it and find it informative. I was looking to learn something new, and I was dissapointed. At the end, it wasn't worth the money I paid for it.",
            "Gladwell is a great journalist and in his latest book, he explores snap judgments. This book brings intuitive decision making to our attention and will provoke more research. As most senior executives use snap decision making in their day to day activities, this book is valuable and somewhat practical.I strongly recommend Gladwell's earlier book, The Tipping Point, for cutting-edge information about marketing success through word of mouth.",
            "This is the kind of book that gives publishing a bad name. The central thesis of this book - that those who are well trained in an area of study can be incredibly good at making judgments using only a few pieces of essential information - is the stuff of a short magazine article. And since Mr. Gladwell writes for the New Yorker, it probably was the stuff of a too long magazine article.What Mr. Gladwell has tried to do is dress up a somewhat interesting idea for a dentist office type magazine article into a full-fledged book. In the process, he has made a huge mess. This book is all about asides, amusing anecdotes, and often poor scholarship and poor interpretations of existing works.I know that the price of Manhattan real estate has gone through the roof and rents are ridiculous. But Mr. Gladwell made a ton of money with his first book. He can afford just about any condo he wants. He doesn't have to embarrass himself by writing a mindless piece of candy like this.This book is all about ego and greed. Essentially, Mr. Gladwell has nothing useful to say. He just goes on and on in a meandering fashion writing about nothing. It's like a well-written undergraduate research paper full of b.s. designed to con a professor. In this case both the publisher and Mr. Gladwell are trying to con the public out of 20 dollar bills. Apparently, they are succeeding.",
            "Blink claims to explore the power of \"rapid cognition\" and \"snap judgments\" i.e. - intuition and gut feelings.The book starts promisingly enough, but it's unwilling to take a stand on rapid cognition and snap judgments, and their usefulness in life. In fact, the author basically concludes that snap judgments are sometimes good, sometimes bad. In otherwords, he's unable to make a judgment.I was given the book by a friend who thought it would help me make better decisions, but the fact is Gladwell spends little if any time discussing how rapid cognition can help us in our daily lives.Worse, the author (who's half of African descent) spends much of the book discussing the problems of snap judgments in the context of discrimination against African Americans. Racism is a terrible thing, but that's not the advertised focus of this book. If you buy this book, you'll spend a lot of time and money hearing this author's manifesto on the ill-treatment of African Americans.Finally, the book also discusses the concept of \"thin-slicing,\" and indeed this book appears to be thin-sliced. For what is a fascinating topic, the author only skims the surface, and the result is a short book with relatively few words per page. I almost get the feeling he was rushing out the door to his next NYC cocktail party.If you're considering buying this book, I suggest you make a \"snap judgment\" not to.",

What makes the book worth 4 stars is the approach, and the editors enhancement.

Are we slipping so far into naiveness in the 21 century that we need to be told this? Brilliant deduction.

            "Every once in a while someone explains something so well that you can't figure out why you didn't see it before. Gladwell does this. I've read and studied decision making quite a bit, and most of it made a lot of sense and was based on good research. None of it--with the exception of one author--however, explained for me the reason of why people seem to \"jump\" to decisions, without following the \"rules.\" This is a great book! (The other author who explains things this well is Gary Klein (Sources of Power, Intuition at Work), whom Gladwell discusses).",
            "We have all been warned against the practice of \"judging a book by its cover.\" But is it OK to judge a book by its title? After hearing a friend talk about this book I looked it up on Amazon and was intrigued by the title. Not \"Blink\", but the part about \"thinking without thinking.\" As a person who tends to do his best when allowed to fly by the seat of his pants, I was immediately attracted to the potential subject matter of this curious little book.There are two concepts that make up the bulk of this book's foundation -- thin slicing and rapid cognition. It could be considered an expansion on the idea that our first impressions are frequently correct and that our sub-conscience is usually aware of things taking place in our surroundings much sooner that we are. The book also tells us that thin slicing and rapid cognition can be fooled or succumb to personal prejudice, and hence turn out to be completely wrong. And still Blink tells us that this can be overcome, or at least controlled, by learning to block out certain senses that cause us to proceed from false assumptions. Example: A college study where individuals were studied by two groups of graduate students. One that conduced a brief face-to-face interview, and a second that was allowed to very briefly study the contents of the individuals room without knowing anything about the person. The ones that performed the face-to-face interviews were less accurate because they made mistakes at the start of the interview -- mistakes such as this person is an athlete so he/she does not enjoy scholarly pursuits -- and so forth.The book starts off with a fascinating account of an ancient Greek statue on display in a New York museum. After over a year of scientific and historical analysis the statue is certified to be authentic. Meanwhile several amateurs begin having some interesting first impressions about the new exhibit -- guess which group ends up being correct? While there are other interesting stories and accounts along the way, once the ideas of thin slicing and rapid cognition get explained, parts of the book seem redundant and at times the book seems to get longer as one gets closer to the ending. Still, there are ideas and techniques discussed in this book that are valuable. I did enjoy the comparison between the Blind Taste test (as used by Pepsi/Coke in the late 1970's) and the Triangle test -- the concept of comparing two subjects by offering three samples and having the tester determine, not which one is better, but determine which one is not like the other two.I was torn between rating this book as a 3 star or a 4 star. Ultimately I decided to go with 4 (because I had a BLINK moment) because the ideas in the book are good ones, even if one does have to wade though some repetition. Also, one thing kept occurring to me as I was reading this book. I kept having this repeating thought telling me that this book was wrong. However, those little thoughts are largely what this book is about. If my impressions about the book are correct, then the book must be on to something. On the other hand, if my impressions are incorrect, then the book was not in fact wrong, but correct -- nice little paradox that works in Mr Gladwell's favor. See what reading this book does to a person.One last bit of closing information. This book seems to be a guaranteed conversation piece. I have had more comments book then anything I have ever left laying around the house. And it is not done on purpose. Again, something working very well for Mr. Gladwell.",
            "I like the concept of the book which is basically telling you to trust your hunches, instincts and/or gut. Good advice that is good to hear from time to time lest we forget. That being said, the book gets boring after mentioning tale after tale of people trusting their instincts in certain situations. You need only read the first half of the book (probably not even that) and you pretty much have all the info you need.Buy it used. Read it. Then give it away. Good book - just a little redundant and boring towards the middle and the end.",
            "First impression: good stuff; I understand what Gladwell explains about our first impressions and our second, more seasoned impressions, the concepts of thin-slicing and mind-reading; it's good that he uses examples to make and clarify his points.Second, more seasoned impression: Ugh! Give it a rest; confusion; way too drawn-out examples that made me put the book down for days, sometimes weeks, before picking it up again (and that's only because I have a thing about not finishing a book).I'm not a fan of filler and, for my taste, Gladwell is too verbose; the book became bogged down with too many examples and details, not to mention some confusion. In one chapter it sounded as though he was arguing for the accuracy of first impressions and in the next chapter, as if he were championing the other. All the back and forth about which is more accurate in which circumstance or given situation was unnecessary and cluttered up the message, and there were several times I found myself thinking, \"and your point is?\"I do believe that Gladwell could benefit from a piece of advice I read recently about giving the reader the benefit of the doubt when it comes to figuring things out on his or her own. Yes, it's a non-fiction, informational book, and as such, he does need to give explanations and make connections so a reader can understand what he's trying to say, but if I need that much hand-holding to get through the subject matter, maybe I should've picked up a Dr. Suess book instead.While I do feel a bit validated (if that's even the right word) in my trusting quite a lot of my snap decisions (they don't let me down often if I don't try to reason my way out of them), I don't know if that validation is worth the aggravation I experienced reading \"blink.\"",
            "In Blink, Gladwell examines how we develop our intuitions about something within seconds, and often our intuitions are amazingly accurate. Interesting observations:- By looking at micro-facial expressions, a psychiatrist can tell with 95% accuracy whether a couple will still be together in 15 years.- Priming our actions: by telling ourselves something about ourselves before doing an action like taking a test, you'll affect how well you do on the test. This demonstrates the power of positive thinking and the power of negative thinking.The information in this book will help you at the workplace, by knowing what you need to work on when it comes to \"impression management\" for your boss.",
            "Gladwell was on to something, and then he fell short of delivery when he vacillated with his latter stories and analogies. I think he should have sat longer on this before wrapping the writing up and publishing what looks to be unready. I found it to be weak in foundation and annoyingly confusing. If you have all the money to waste buy it, otherwise, look into more solid titles to spend your cash on.",
            "Many great books are ones that provide information and insights, but can be read quickly. \"Blink\" accomplishes both, and more. It's not a research book, and it's not a self-help, or awareness book. It can, help a reader perceive things they experience in life in a better way, which can help both personally and professionally.Many concepts we are latently aware of but don't consciously think about and discuss are in \"Blink.\"As we progress technologically, scientifically, and medically, we humans seem to have an urge and necessity to explain, analyze, investigate, and search for the reasons \"why.\" We categorize many of decisions we make, actions we perform. We even try to elucidate our our likes and dislikes.Numerous real-life examples are noted, and they're examples most readers will relate to.An art expert can often see a sculpture and know almost instantaneously that it's a fake. How does he/she know specifically? Sometimes it can be explained; sometimes it can't. \"it just isn't right,\" is the knowledge, but analyzing and dissecting it and then trying to verbalize an explanation, proves difficult if not impossible. Author Gladwell notes that this is fine. The concept of \"thin-slicing\" can remind one of the graduated steps of unconscious-incompetence to unconscious competence in work tasks and skills.Another example is the expert tennis coach that can accurately predict in a fraction of a second when a tennis player will fault on a serve. He just knows. In military campaigns, the Pentagon has long attempted to study how Generals make instinctive decisions in what's called \"The fog of war,\" where constant, unexpected changes, chaos, and lack of information coincide. Other research noted how doctors diagnose whether or not a patient is having a \"real\" heart attack or just suffering from chest pain. The Docs often have too much information and this leads to mis-diagnosing. Thin Slicing is also used in advertising, with some packaging tactics by companies noted.The psychological studies about our unconscious attitude towards race and first impressions were intriguing, relevant, and also disturbing. Even if our conscious minds tell us to treat everyone the same, do we actually do this, 100% of the time? Even when it adversely affects our income (costs us money)? Most of us aren't aware, when we do this. What lies behind the locked door of our sub-conscious has subtle yet influential ways of influencing our attitudes and actions in ways that we do not even know.The height factor: people that are tall comprise a very small portion of the US population. But the percentage of CEOs and those in upper management that are tall is overwhelmingly high. For every inch a person has they earn an $789 more per month. Add a few inches that the average tall person can earn several hundred thousand dollars more over the course of ones career/working years.One study revealed that car salesmen consistently treated people extremely differently because of their age, clothes, and gender even though these subjects reported the same income, residence, and education, and preferences on make, model, and price. The salesmen were unconscious of their unequal treatment, and were genuinely surprised that they were even doing so. It was actually costing them to lose money.Gladwell also points at the negative effects of \"thin-slicing.\" The negative effects of incorrectly acting upon our brief thin slices and instincts. (To me this is all-mighty \"assumption.\" And \"assumptions are the mother of all f-ups.\") Gladwell referred to this as 'negative Thin Slicing.' The Pepsi Challenge: how it motivated Coke to actually change it's recipe. But the \"Pepsi Challenge wasn't valid, and wasn't relevant. We usually drink more than just small a sip of cola, and we also do it without our eyes being covered. Nevertheless it caused a dramatic and disastrous change in one of the largest companies in the world.Another negative to improper thin-slicing is the \"Warren Harding\" effect. Warren Harding: a handsome man facial features, stature, and physical charisma that gave the 'impression' of power, strength, assurance and fortitude. was likely they major factor for his nomination and election to president. And he's rated as the worst ever. There are lots of anecdotes and few research studies. This is OK by me, and even preferred.",
            "I don't know that I buy everything (or even very much) that the author says about the whole \"thin slicing\" thing, but I enjoyed reading his ideas. I agree with Eric Antonow's review that the book contains a lot of speculation, and Gladwell does a poor job of unifying the stories, but individually the stories and ideas are fascinating. This book should be read with a healthy dose of skepticism, but do read it, because it is a fun read, and it really makes you think - always a good thing.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's book, \"Blink\" was offered up as a selection for a local reading group. Though initially less than fully interested I took the plunge and read it. I'm glad I did.Whether or not one concurs with the hypotheses and conclusions given by Mr. Gladwell, the fact that some of us are better than others in making correct decisions in a split second is a good place from which to start. He argues that, indeed, certain people have this natural (or often learned) ability to see immediately what others need to study. \"Snap Decision\" or \"In An Instant\" might have been good chapter titles for \"Blink\" but when the author discusses the downside of acting spontaneously (as in the Amadou Diallo case) \"Rush to Judgment\" would have been a more appropriate title.What gives this book appeal is Gladwell's narrative style. It's nicely paced, informative and often amusing. (see the section about Paul Ekman trying to explain how the muscles in the face work!) \"Blink\" has given me enough to savor so that I plan next to read the author's previous book, \"The Tipping Point\". \"Blink\" is a good read on an unusual subject and I recommend it.",
            "This is about choices we make 'without thinking' in an instant -- at the blink of an eye. He explains why some of \"The best decisions are those which are impossible to explain to others.\" Great decision makers are those who have perfected the art of 'thin-slicing' (the theory of thin-slices: how a little bit of knowledge fors a long way), without a large amount of deliberation.BLINK may change the way you feel about thinking before you speak and on-the-spot decisions. We learn a lot more about what people think by observing their body language or facial expressions than by asking them directly.A bad movie is always a bad movie. You hate it the first time you see it, carries over to the future. You drift away, avoid seeing movies in which those \"stars\" appear because of the awful feeling that other movie (the horrid thing you hated) left in your conscious and subconscious.On t.v. people watched 'All in the Family' about a bigoted person who was truly, absurdly bad. And yet they watched it every week. Why? Their subscious had become 'cushioned' to hear what they wanted to hear and let the rest slide.Mary Tyler Moore was every young man's dream girl. Adults, on the other hand, found her whiny and not on the up-and-up. She was great in the 'Dick Van Dyke show' but only half as good starring in her own show. She was my son's ideal woman, throwing her hat and her cares into the air, a big-city career girl. She was just a dream, not an actuality.We need to learn to listen with our eyes. We don't know where our first impressions come from or what exactly they mean. They often are wrong. We make assumptions without knowing the facts of the matter. When you get to know the person and the way he or she thinks, you realize that you miisjudged them. It's not how a person looks which matters the most but how he feels (is he sensitive or hard as nails tough?); the eyes reflect a prson's soul. If he won't look you in the eyes, he's not worth his weight in salt. He's superficial.A pure BLINK moment is when a miracle happens; they see you for who you truly are, and discover that snap decisions are usually right. When you digress or get misled, things turn out wrong.He also wrote THE TIPPING POINT: HOW LITTLE THINGS CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE which redefined how we understand the world around us. In BLINK, we learn to understand the world within. Now, I am wondering: why do we fall for tall, dark, and handsome men?",
            "Blink is a \" must read \" about the power and accuracy of our first impressions and intuitions about people and events. Malcolm Gladwell skillfully presents several case studies that inspire me to recognize my own intuitive talent and also to notice my tendencies to dismiss my intuitive knowing in favor of analysis and self-doubt.He cleverly examines stereotyping and predjudice, and demonstrates how this influences and distorts our intuition.As a result of this book, I feel more confident and freer to express myself spontaneously! Tuning in to my first impressions is fun and actually gives me a greater sense of well-being and living in the moment, wow!Another great source of well-being and Instantaneous Transformation is Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment by Ariel and Shya Kane. This lovely anthology gives me a window into living with ease and transforms everyday circumstances into life giving opportunities. I can experience enlightenment now! Without any complicated discipline, Guru, or hoops to jump through. Thanks to the Kanes and Gladwell for giving us modern day access to a truly satisfying life.",
            "Blink! explores the phenomena we have all experianced, that initial feeling we get when exposed to something new.Initially I was a bit skeptical of the premise. It sounded like one of the New Age self-awareness books. I was mistaken. Instead, Gladwell makes two, very important, statements.First, those gut feelings can be very accurate when an expert gets them. That is, someone who has a lot of experiance with an item or situation is able to judge that situtation rapidly and fairly accurately. Further, expertise does not mean college diplomas but experiance. We are all experts, to a large degree, at reading faces because we have been doing that all of our lives. So we can rapidly, subconciously, arrive at a conclusion about someone we meet for the first time because of their expressions. Our brains perform activities below the conscious level, and our conscious selves can access the results. (In a way, this is a neat argument for consciousness being an artifact of cerebration and not the other way around.)Second, even experts can be fooled when the cues we subconsiously use to size up an item or situation lead us down a the wrong path.Blink! is about intuition, and illustrates the power, and flaws, with intuitive thinking. It is another demonstration of the superior power of rational thought over intuition.",
            "Malcom Gladwell is really eating his own dog food. In Tipping Point he discussed how you create buzz and get your ideas into the mass market and market acceptance. He has executed this plan with Blink -- a book that basically reviews psych studies conducted by others in the 80's and 90's into an interested but uninspiring tale.Gladwell is pushing the book in every avenue possible -- inclduing a segement on CNN entitled \"are you a racist?\" A piece of jaundiced journalism if I have ever seen one. Generating buzz by this means is low and beneath any credible author. I stopped reading the book and decided to write this reveiw after seeing the piece on 4/12/05The material in Blink is mildly interesting, but its not Gladwell's work. He is at best an editor putting interesting ideas and stories together to tell a story, not provide soemthing to help you improve your business.The Tipping point brought you ideas from the 1970's and this book does much the same. I am not smarter nor more aware after reading this book. It is shameless commerce and promotion for Gladwell's brand that I would rather not participate in.",
            "There is plenty of food for thought in the pages of Blink. Malcolm Gladwell does indeed, to some degree, inspire you to rethink your whole way of thinking. I'm not sure how much of a practical effect the book has on a reader, though, because Gladwell never really comes out with a systematic method for training yourself to think differently. I would sum the book up this way: Your unconscious is smarter than you are - but not always. It isn't that radical of an idea. We've all been such advice as: if you don't know the answer, go with your first instinct; you never get a second chance to make a first impression; and the ubiquitous follow your gut. What Gladwell does is validate these sorts of common sense notions. Going further, though, he also describes situations in which your unconscious can lead you astray. Ideally, one must strike a balance between instinct and deliberation.The book features all manner of excellent examples to fit Gladwell's argument - although at times, it gets a little bogged down in minutiae (such as a veritable laundry list of scientific names for facial muscles). First, he talks about a Greek statue that was scientifically verified as authentic but almost immediately declared a fake (and rightly so) by a number of experts in that form of art. How could these experts see the truth instantaneously? Why can other people see and know things that logic dictates it is impossible to know? These are the questions Gladwell asks. It all comes down to thin-slicing, he tells us. Thin-slicing involves the filtering out of all but the most relevant data, and the human unconscious thrives at this special skill. Then comes the more interesting part - ask someone to explain how he knew something spontaneously, and he/she will struggle to do so. What is more, the very effort to describe one's reaction makes the person less sure of his/her conclusions. From here, it's only a hop, skip, and a jump to the argument that too much information can sometimes be a bad thing. This would seem to be bad news to those of us who prefer to sit and study about something before coming up with an opinion. It isn't always the case, mind you, but too much deliberation about too many things can be more of a hindrance than a help.Thus, after showing what an unacknowledged genius our unconscious is, Gladwell proceeds to demonstrate how the unconscious sometimes gets things horribly wrong. He uses real world examples such as the Pepsi Challenge (and goes on to explain why New Coke seemed like a good idea at the time yet failed miserably), the shooting of an unarmed man by police officers, and the success of market-testing failures such as All in the Family. A number of fascinating insights are gleaned in the process: perception affects satisfaction, stereotypes (even those you strongly rebuke consciously) affect feelings and behavior, mood can be affected just by adopting certain facial expressions, spontaneity is not random, and others.There is a level of contradiction worked into the book. Sometimes, for example, first impressions are right on the money, and sometimes they are not a good indicator at all. How do you know the difference? Sometimes, less information is more valuable than more, but sometimes it isn't. Gladwell's point is that sound decision making is borne of a balance between instinctive, reactive realization and deliberate, studied conclusions. I think he pretty well proves the point, but he doesn't really give us a road map for finding that balanced place. Thus, the book is made up mostly of thought-provoking, fascinating stories and examples. It makes for fascinating reading, but I'm not sure it will actually change the way I think about things on a routine basis.",
            "I was first caught by the title and cover of this book. It was fairly plain with \"Blink\" written boldly across the front. I read the blurb on the inside cover about what it was about and thought I would take a chance at reading it.The book starts out great with a few stories about people making snap decisions without knowing they were doing it. That drew my attention and I kept reading. The theories that the author was giving seemed to make sense and were interesting to think about.However, towards the middle of the book the tone of the writing changed. I am still not able to put my finger on how it changed but it almost seems that the author was hurried to get the book done and to the editor and so he became less thoughtful and more erratic in his theories and explanations.The worst part of the book is that it just ends abruptly. There isn't really a review of what was talked about and how it all fits together. The last theory is given and the book ends.If you have time on a plane to read the book, it might be worth it. But I'm not sure I would sit down and read this book for fun knowing what I know now about it.",
            "Like Gladwell's first effort, \"The Tipping Point,\" this book is fun and easy to read. Gladwell uses well-chosen stories to illustrate each of the points he makes and has a gift for telling the stories in a way that flows and keeps you interested. That is the great news about this book.Unlike \"The Tipping Point,\" however, \"Blink\" doesn't arrive at a coherent and usable conclusion. It starts with the promising premise about the power of first impressions and gets you interested to learn how you might be able to make first impressions - both your own and others' - work better for you. It seems a very reasonable expectation if you've read \"Tipping Point.\" Unfortunately, \"Blink\" breaks down into an ambiguous \"sometimes first imprssions help, sometimes they hurt\" conclusion that leaves you underwhelmed.If you haven't read \"Tipping Point,\" go there first. If you have and you really liked it, you will get more of the great writing and story-telling from this book, but not the useful conclusion.",
            "This book is well-written and engaging, but it only states what most people already know. One of the book's concluding points is that if you are skilled and experienced in your field, then being able to quickly make decisive and correct decisions will come naturally. Nothing new there. Some people would simply say \"with experience comes intuition.\" The author further notes that unless one is fully trained, the initial gut reaction can be misleading for a number of reasons, such as subconscious bias or stress. An abundance of stories is presented to support all the points in the book, but most adults will have already come across all the issues through lifelong experience.One thing for which I was hoping was a discussion on how to hone yourself to make better \"blink\" decisions outside your field of expertise. The author does not address this at all except for one small suggestion saying that it's better to reduce the amount of information one has to process in order to make a good decision. This approach is a good idea, but the author delves no further.",
            "I've never seen a more transparent effort to cash in. This is a (really) dumbed down psych lite book about nothing. At times, Gladwell's effort to make a strong point in confusing (I suspect there is no point). At other times, he provides mini-overviews of the examples discussed in the book in case we couldn't remember them...There is nothing interesting and nothing to gain from Gladwell's flimsy theory about \"thinking without thinking.\" If you're interested in the thesis \"the power of thinking without thinking is so strong unless it's a situation where regular thinking is required,\" buy the book. Because that's all there is to it.",
            "Gladwell, who is one of my favorite nonfiction authors and New Yorker writers, walks over a dangerous line with his latest book. As always, his book is full of interesting anecdotes which support his primary premise. But in Blink, unlike his terrific earlier book, The Tipping Point, Gladwell moves from reporting journalist to corporate keynote speaker wannabe. He's got a central idea and he's going to prove it. In Tipping Point, he moved from the other direction... he gathered a series of seemingly unrelated incidents and events and brought fascinating clarity to the reader. It was excellent writing, research, and journalism. But in Blink, I couldn't help but feel I was simply being sold a clever idea, something that seems terrifically obvious with a catchy name given to it. I suppose it's somewhat like when Dylan went electric. Some will like it. Some will think he sold out. But I have no doubt, he'll be extremely successful on his dinner circuit.",
            "\"Blink\" is an appropriate title for a book about the snap decisions that we sometimes make when heeding our instincts rather than making a detailed analysis. Malcolm Gladwell says that \"thin-slicing,\" or the use of narrow slices of experience to find patterns in situations and behavior, is often a more effective way to make a decision than through a lot of thought and an abundance of facts. He starts off with the story of a statue, purportedly rare and ancient, that was asserted to be genuine through careful analysis, yet was felt to be a fake through the instant intuition of some experts. He then presents a number of interesting examples, from speed dating to conducting warfare, from selling cars to interviewing job candidates, that demonstrate how to effectively make quick decisions based upon a small amount of data. Again and again he reminds us that less is more.There are fascinating anecdotes here that demonstrate the power of our subconscious mind. Gladwell presents some people whose sense of intuition is uncanny: a psychologist who, after observing a married couple for fifteen minutes, could tell with ninety percent accuracy whether they would still be married fifteen years later; a tennis coach who could tell when a player was about to double fault; a psychology professor who could read faces so well he seemed to be able to read minds.Unfortunately, there are two problems with this book that detract from its strengths. First, there is little or no explanation given for how or why we might experience these phenomena. It is not a how-to manual, as there are no hard and fast rules on how to thin-slice our way to brilliant decision-making. And second, Gladwell cautions that we can often be misled by our snap judgments due to priming, prior bias or associations, and stress. He contends that we tend to base our judgment about something as much on its physical appearance or packaging as on its actual function. Doing incorrect thin-slicing led to the New Coke marketing fiasco, led to the election of a president who was handsome and charismatic but one of the worst leaders in U.S history, and kept many talented women out of top professional orchestras. Will this book change the way I come to decisions? No. But it has been an informative read nonetheless, and it has given me more reason than ever to admire the mysteries of the human brain.Eileen Rieback",
            "I find it funny that people say this book is not as good as the Tipping Point. My opinion is the exact opposite. I found the Tipping Point laborious and smacking of pseudo-science. In comparison, Blink is a really good read and deals with science much better. Gladwell does have the gift of translating studies and research into a cogent narrative.",
            "This blink CD is not what I expected. I don't know if this type of CD is the only available CD or not. The main thing is this CD does not go according to the book. Therefore the purpose I bought the CD did not serve.",
            "The description that something `makes you think' no longer means that something `fills your mind with novel thought,' but rather that something `makes you skeptical of established beliefs.' The new meaning is useful, but some things out there just fill you with inspirational and amazing thoughts and those valuable things are what should receive the description. Malcolm Gladwell's `Blink' is one of those valuable things.This is ironic, of course, because the whole book is dedicated to turning off thinking--the author aims to \"think without thinking.\" Gladwell says that we may be \"better off without thinking,\" but what makes his book so fascinating is that it makes you wonder, speculate, and think.He makes his case for `snap decisions' well by describing examples when `thinking too much' led to incorrect and sometimes expensive mistakes. The book's opening example of museum curators who tirelessly studied a potential acquisition with the finest carbon dating tools and latest scientific processes was compelling. The curators concluded that the acquisition was authentic and bought the piece for millions of dollars only to find out later that it was a fake. All of their `thinking' couldn't uncover the truth that (as it turned out) experts could easily pick out in the `blink of an eye.'The moral (although not completely explained in the book) is that science, procedure, and thinking in general require `abstraction,' which is the process of reducing the whole truth into a smaller, more easily accessible truth. This allows us to expand our knowledge and hold on to it much longer than if we attempted to remember the whole truth. Since it is not the whole truth, the process of abstraction can distort or lose the truth altogether. As such, we would sometimes do better by scraping all our abstract knowledge and simply focusing on what we see in front of us. This is the central theme of `Blink.'Of course, the fact remains that without abstraction we could not know as much or remember as long as we do, and most human advance would be lost. Abstraction is a tool that has been elemental in man's ascent and cannot be discarded as completely obstructive.The author even proves this fact in his effort to diminish thinking. That is because many of his examples feature scientists' elaborate experiments aimed ascertaining the importance of simple, split-second judgment. Thinking is used to denigrate thinking.Inconsistencies like this foil any attempt at producing a solid idea and in the end `Blink' becomes not more than a series of stories. Most of the stories are really fascinating and invigorating and it must be said that they are expertly written. It is for these stories that one should pick up the book. But, ultimately, the stories (all stories) are just examples taken out of context--they are abstractions and lead to the same kind of mistakes Gladwell is trying to abolish.Read the book, but enjoy how much it makes you think and it will be worth it.",
            "\"Blink\" conceptualizes a new manner of thinking about our cognitive abilities. Rather than focusing on the power of the human mind and its ability to understand and solve problems through the development of complex statistical models and qualitative means of evaluation, author Malcom Gladwell dwells on the ability of the human subconscious and our ability to make snap decisions. Told through a series of entertaining and vivid vignettes, \"Blink\" illustrates how our thought processes can be both our greatest tool and our greatest impediment in making our most important decisions.Throughout \"Blink\", Gladwell highlights a variety of research dedicated to understanding human cognition and shows how that research can help us improve our understanding of people, our decisions, and human emotions. From art dealers to major military decision-makers Gladwell shows the role of our unconscious thoughts understanding the world around us. \"Blink\" reads like a novel, but manages to be powerfully informative.Gladwell mixes information with a deeper inquisition of the status quo and pushes the reader to challenge their perceptions of the world. He shows that we can become trapped behind the limitations of our own thinking or deceived by the falsehood of the \"truths\" we have been presented. I was thoroughly entertained by \"Blink\" and I found that it presented a similarly fresh perspective to that of Freakonomics.Gladwell integrates an underlying moral imperative to ensure that our decisions are not based upon prejudices or biases which we may be unaware of. I would recommend \"Blink\" to any reader, but it has powerful implications for those involved with the social sciences or those forced to make complex decisions with little information. \"Blink\" won't necessarily provide you with new mental tools, but it will ensure that you are properly using the ones that you already have.",
            "I have just re-read this. It first came out in 2005 and I probably read it about then. Of course, I'd forgotten a lot of the detail.The main premise is that when we make decisions we already have a lot of information in our adaptive subconscious that means we often need very little time to make our decisions. Sometimes having too much information input does not improve our decision making - we can make decisions with very little information. Sometimes our adaptive unconscious leads us to make racist and sexist decisions - despite our otherwise strongly held beliefs, but we can work around those.Easy to read - not full of jargon, but still thoughtful and thought provoking. There is a longish section about Dr Paul Ekman and microexpressions - he is the inspiration for the main character int he TV show \"Lie to Me\". I also enjoyed his discussion surrounding the Pepsi Challenge, new Coke, and taste tests.What I particularly liked about the book is the extended example - Gladwell takes one event/situation and teases it out so that the full implications/ramifications can be seen. He then refers back to some of the conclusions throughout the book, thereby cementing your understanding.An easy to read book that will get you thinking and looking at the world and yourself in a different way.",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Gladwell does a great job of using real world examples to draw you in and then backing it up with research / science. The subject matter in another's hands could be deadly dull, but he's a very good writer and the topic is captivating - how we think, the value of snap judgments, and the amazing capacity of our brains to put stuff together. There aren't any final gotcha conclusions but he puts out a lot of interesting ideas and I feel like it might change my behavior in some ways. For instance, how can we use the active subconscious / quick judgments and not feel like everything needs to rely on data and spelled out logic?I definitely found myself wanting to share the ideas in this book with others. Highly recommended.",
            "\"This was a gift from my employer... a signed copy from Malcolm Gladwell ! An amazingly gripping book. Couldn't put it down!The book tells about the power of subconscious, the power and dangers of decisions that we take in a blink. I was always amazed by the current behavior of the cops in the US and why two cops don't ride together when they have to wait for a cover anyway! This book provides answers to many questions of the subconscious and poses many more which remain unanswered! Where to use the power of blink and where not! Just like the Inception !!!\" . The only reason I am taking one point off is because it left me confused.",
            "I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in social psychological phenomena. My personal favorite study was the one done by Paul Ekman where Ekman demonstrated the universality of people's facial expressions. An excellent follow-up to this book is Social Intelligence by Daniel Goleman. Goleman gets more into the mechanics of the snap decisions people make.",
            "Blink is about subconscious thinking and how it can lead us to accurate conclusions within the blink of a moment. It is also about how subconcious thinking sometimes also can lead us to wrong, irrational or discriminatory behaviour without us even being aware of it.I read Outliers and now Blink. Gladwell's likes to tell anecdotes, most of the pages are small stories that can be linked to some scientific study. Gladwell knows how to choose interesting stories and how to tell them in a kind of feel-good colorful way. If that is your cup of tea, you will not be disappointed. Just remember, the guy is a journalist, he does best what journalists usually are best at, expect to be entertained or to find some thoughts worth further investigation.",
            "I really enjoy Malcolm Gladwell's scientific curiousity in trying to explain why our brains work the way they do. I listened to the audio version of the book and it was narrated by the author himself. Having him read his words felt like we were somewhere having a cup of coffee and he was telling me his ideas. I really like the way this guy's brain works. I have the same curiousity about things and I appreciate that Gladwell can articulate these interesting facts so well.",
            "I love Malcolm Gladwell. He writes well, he's funny, challenging, and never pedantic while teaching across many disciplines.\"Blink\" is my favorite of his books so far. It might have saved me from 2 bad marriages had it been written soon enough!Understanding when to trust your gut instinct or intuition and when to use your logical mind could change your life. I'll say no more, you have to read without knowing the subject matter.I'm thrilled the library had a long waiting list for this so I ended up buying it!",
            "Good book to learn how to write and it stayle is based on stories which include a point veiw and supports it with examples and explianations.",
            "Alot has already been said about this book, so I'll be brief. I found it not only an enjoyable read, but incredibly thought provoking. There are more than a few lessons to take with you from this book. Oh, and it's a really fast read. So don't spend alot of time analyzing, trust your thin-slice judgement, and pick this one up!",
            "This was my first Gladwell book, and so far my favorite. He covers a lot of interesting areas, although occasionally falls short of explaining them fully.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell has a rare talent for taking what we believe we understand and making it truly understandable. He has the ability to get us to stop for a moment and really think. He has a way using examples which allow any thinking person to relate what he is saying to personal experiences in our own everyday lives. This should be required reading in all of our schools.",
            "Similar in style to Gladwell's wonderful The Tipping Point, Blink provides fascinating stories and studies about how we make split decisions all the time, and how we are seldom aware of it. The studies that show our hidden biases are very disturbing as we try and assimilate ourselves into our multi-cultural society. However, as Gladwell concludes, being aware of those things that affect our decision making is the first step to changing them. The book does get bogged done a bit during countless descriptions of the mussels in our faces in a discussion about how our faces give away what we are really feeling, but besides that section the book sails quickly on Gladwell's engaging style.",
            "I really enjoyed this book. Many of the concepts presented aren't topics that I normally think about or talk about. Fascinating to learn more about what goes on in my mind, \"behind the door\" as described in the book. If you are a student of human behavior, or an interest in intuition or decision making, read this book! Very informative and an excellent read.",
            "The idea behind the book was very interesting up front and I was very much engaged for about the first 100-150 pages. What I started to realize as the book went on though is that the stories started to irritate the heck out of me. Gladwell probably spent 5-10% of the book providing useless background on what the people he interviewed looked like. This doesn't pertain to the key takeaways of the book and I found it to be a waste of my time to 'sort of' know what some guy he interviewed looked like. As I've seen noted in other reviews, this book is supposed to be a 'fun' and 'interesting' read more so than it is just to tell you the results of some analysis. This is likely why there's a lot of additional unnecessary background provided. This is also the reason I gave the book a solid 3 stars as opposed to only 2.All in all the ideas explored are interesting, but the stories just start to run together. It probably could have been boiled down into 50-100 pages instead of a couple hundred that it was.",
            "Kindle copy of \"Blink\" by Malcolm Gladwell. Have not finished it yet, but it's a fascinating look into the factors that made some of the most well-known people as successful as they are. And it's not as much of the \"self-made success\" that they make it seem...",
            "An exploration of what our brain does without us knowing we are doing it. Those fast decisions that help us cross the road when a car is coming up faster than you expected, and you dash out of the way before you know you are doing it. How do we make these decisions and can we control or do we want to control these fast judgements we make. Also looks at micro expressions that we perceive but don't know we see because of the speed at which they happen.I enjoyed listening to this book, it was read by the author which was enjoyable. The author is very sure of himself and all of the concepts he presents which can at times get a bit old. Some of the book wasn't as engaging as other parts but I liked the opening where snap judgments and science were compared. I'm sure there are also examples that can go the other way where science was better than intuition. I think what I liked most was the part of the book that talked about micro expressions and the expressions we make and how they communicate more to us than what is said. We learn these expressions before we learn to talk they are vital to our communication with others as well as the way we feel about others after we meet them. This is a book I would recommend but not to everyone. There are some people that will really dislike this book because of the discussion about thinking without knowing we are doing it. Those that need to be in charge every moment will not enjoy this book as it is letting the subconscious take over for a while. However, we may be able to use snap decisions and judgments to our advantage with some amount of practice at which point we may be in control of them more than we would know.",
            "Things may not be immediately discernible in what a man writes, and in this sometimes he is fortunate; but eventually they are quite clear and by these and the degree of alchemy that he possesses he will endure or be forgotten. - Hemingway, 1954Going with the tenet of thin-slicing, having read the first few pages, I should have liked the book cover-to-cover and lapped it up in a Sunday session of early morning's magic hours. Instead, the curiosity to discover something new unraveled over a few sessions and only the desire to finish the book had me complete it. The tagline states 'The power of thinking without thinking\", and that has a different connotation than I had imagined initially. It is not innate, it is honed over years of doing the same thing and achieving expertise in the subject, that allows someone to be on \"autopilot\".",
            "This Gladwell book focuses on the age-old question of whether to make a snap judgment decision using your gut or spend the time to gather all the information, develop alternatives, and select the best option.Humans probably have a quick built-in decision making system because we had to make up our minds quickly to run from the lion or stay and fight in the early generations of our existence.The advantage of making snap judgments is how quickly and easily they can be made. No time, effort, or thinking is required to make snap judgments.The author argues we should utilize snap judgments more often because they are fairly accurate and easy to make. He argues that 6 minute speed dating meetings are much more efficient and accurate than elaborate courting rituals. Other examples include predicting the probability of divorce by observing a couple for only a few minutes.Gladwell contradicts himself with his example of emergency room doctors. One might think experienced ER doctors should be accurate at diagnosing heart attacks. It turns out they are not accurate. A doctor spent years studying these types of cases and developed a flow chart which diagnosed heart attacks quickly based upon only a few factors. Flow charts are commonly using in industrial engineering to simplify and standardize processes. I found nothing too revolutionary about the idea of developing a flow chart to diagnose heart attacks.I had not heard of the 2 gentlemen who documented all possible facial expressions. This must have been the idea that led to the TV show Lie to Me.Gladwell argues that juries should not get to see any of the people involved in a trial. He claims seeing the people involved would bias the opinion of the jury. After having been in two trials that each lasted five weeks, I disagree with this recommendation. The subject of the trial was highly technical and I doubt the jury was able to grasp the technical part of the trial. They were able to easily able to figure out who was lying in their testimony and who was not. I'm sure that body language of the participants played a key factor in these trials.Vilfredo Pareto was an Italian economist. Around 1900, he observed that 80% of the wealth or income in Italy was attributed to only 20% of the population. He found the same phenomena in England, and it applies to the U.S. today.Pareto's 80:20 rule allows people to spend their critical time and resources on the key 20% that cause 80% of the issue being studied.Gladwell seems to argue in his book that we should try to increase our usage of our snap decision making abilities as a more efficient way to solve problems. An example would be observing a couple talk about their dog for 60 minutes as a way to predict their probability of divorce.......versus hours and hours of therapy.I also had not heard the example of the Chancellorville Civil War battle. General Hooker had more than twice the number of soldiers (134,000 versus 61,000), twice the artillery pieces, and hot air balloons for intelligence gathering compared to Robert E. Lee. Hooker successfully split his army into two and maneuvered half of his army around Lee without being detected. All Hooker had to do was commence and follow-through on the attack to defeat Lee. In sports terms, Hooker choked once the battle started and retreated. Lee won the battle.Gladwell argues that Lee won because he had less information than Hooker. He thinks Hooker had too much information and over-analyzed the situation.The most important question in Gladwell's book is not the effectiveness of gut decisions in some situations versus drawn-out analysis. The real question is...What are the guidelines for when to make snap decisions versus detailed problem-solving steps? Gladwell does suggest that gut instincts work best in complex decision making like choice of your mate or your profession.I would argue that if time permits, I would recommend doing both (gut decision and detailed analysis) and comparing the final recommendations. In the business world, one never has all the needed information. Decisions must still be made and part of the art of management is knowing how to make decisions with limited information. Sensitivity analysis can be used to help understand the impact of changes in key variables.I would like to see new techniques developed for airport screening. I would think a combination of Israeli type questioning of passengers plus facial feature recognition might end the thoughtless screening of children and grandparents.All-in-all a good read. This book was not as well designed or as interesting a read as Tipping Point.",
            "When I purchased Blink I thought that it would show me how to manipulate my subconscious or something. That was my own fault. I liked the book over all but I was frustrated while I read the book because I was confused in the direction that Gladwell was going. Some stories and results of experiments showed the strength and trust of your subconscious while other stories showed the exact opposite and by the end of it the conclusion is that sometimes you can trust your subconscious and sometimes you can't. I was really thinking this book was a waste until I read the much needed afterward by the author. I think he knew this was needed in his book because it ended with no real stated value. The afterward explains his intentions with the book which was really to have fun looking at the subconscious. Also, he explains better when it's good to trust the subconscious and when it's not good. Also, there is a challenge in his afterward that I much appreciated. This is where he shows how we can use both our split second decision making abilities and resources to make better choices, like in our justice system. Overall I like the read (with the afterward) and would suggest it to other readers. Btw...I like very much how this author writes and so far all his books are entertaining and enlightening. Thanks Malcolm! Also, sorry for the run on sentences and such. I'm a reader and not a writer! haha.",
            "Overall, this was a really great book. It was a fast read, and filled with a lot of cool information about the human mind and what Gladwell refers to as \"thin-slicing.\" It really opened my mind to what the human brain can and can't do.With that said, I've noticed a lot of people reviewing this book and complaining that there's no epiphany at the end like his other book, Tipping Point. It's clear this book has gotten worse ratings than it deserves because it's being held up to that standard. I feel like this book does a lot to reveal the potential of the human mind and shows great examples of what thin slicing can do. It's the kind of topic that can't be built up to and magically revealed at the end as a great epiphany, Gladwell has to lead you through it and build it up as you go along, and I think that's why a lot of readers feel robbed of a great conclusion.Overall, it's a great book, and while it doesn't train you to make snap judgments, it can shed light on the processes behind it, and it generally just a really good read.",
            "Very interesting and informative. It's a pretty quick read as well. I recommend this book, especially the part describing Ekman and his work.",
            "One of the primary criticisms of Gladwell's book, a criticism common to popular social science books, is that it covers the underlying research on an overly superficial level. I am not familiar with the scholarly work Gladwell relies upon, but if my experience in fields I am more familiar with holds, Blink certainly covers this corner of psychology on a superficial level. But that is ok. It would not be possible to write such a book otherwise. More important, in my mind, to this kind of book is that it clearly explain the consequences of the research to and spark some excitement for the subject in the lay reader. Blink achieves in spades on both counts.Blink is about snap judgments. Or, to put it another way, decisions made subconsciously, not consciously. Sometimes this is good (if you are an expert on the subject, for particularly complex decisions); sometimes this is bad (if the decision may be colored by subconscious, irrelevant biases). When Gladwell sticks to snap judgments (which he labels as \"thin slicing\"), Blink works. The stories are funny, relevant, and interesting.We discover that it is very difficult to really understand many, many things without years and years of experience and training, but we can still tell what is good and what we like. Gladwell uses jelly as an example, but take wine. I can tell you which wines I like and even tell you which wine I like better. But I cannot talk like a sommelier. And, as much of the research Gladwell discusses suggests, attempting to do so would interfere with my unconscious ability to differentiate good wine from bad.Gladwell also tries to show how we can use an understanding of thin slicing to make better decisions, but he tends to give answers that are less than fully satisfying. Gladwell relates how administrators at Cook County Hospital saved money and increased the accuracy of diagnoses by implementing a decision tree. It is an odd case study. Neither thin slicing nor conscious decision-making worked for the doctors; it was not an example of shifting from one to the other. It was an example of the power of narrowing focus to a few truly relevant metrics (a powerful and highly useful subject, but it is not the subject of Blink). In another case study, Gladwell never quite explains his point regarding the Kenna story, about a musician loved by record execs and ignored by the radio. Presumably he meant to imply that the thin slicing by the record execs was right (because they are experts), but the thin slicing by the radio focus groups was wrong (because they were not experts and could not identify music they would enjoy as quickly). Gladwell may be right, but that conclusion does not flow necessarily.Gladwell never really gives a solid basis for discerning when experts can be trusted. From Blink, it would be easy to over rely on experts. But a \"sort of\" expert can be worse than a layman. In the counterfeit statute case study Gladwell starts with, both those who got it right and those who got it wrong were experts. To give an example not in the books, literary \"experts\" have long denigrated the Lord of the Rings, while readers have had no trouble recognizing its brilliance (even if unable to explain why). The literary experts did not have the expertise to properly evaluate the expertise in philology and mythology that Tolkien used.Gladwell's final application of thin slicing shows a poor understanding of his own material. Gladwell observed that the percentage of female orchestra members shot up dramatically after a switch to screened auditions. Irrelevant visual signals were crowding out the relevant audio signals. Gladwell then extrapolates this to argue criminal defendants should be screened to mitigate subconscious racial bias. But a jury trial is not an orchestra audition. If a criminal defendant is on the stand in a jury trial, he visual cues are more important than the audio clues. As Gladwell discussed earlier in the book, facial expressions tell an indelible story about what a person is really thinking (he even uses an example from the OJ Simpson trial!). One of the primary duties of the jury is to assess the credibility of witnesses; how can they do this if they cannot see the person's face? That this recommendation achieved such quick support from an audience at Harvard Law School says more about the state of legal education than its merit.",
            "Very enjoyable listen to the author read his book. Overall: a good, not great book, but well worth the time to listen. Recommended.",
            "This book has many great examples and is well written....that being said, his conclusions are all wrong. The conclusions are sooooo far off as compared to his examples that to claim this book as \"self-help\" is absolutely absurd. I wouldnt recommend this book to anyone.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell has made an art form out of bringing together random information and packaging it within a single context. Sometimes this works well, other times not so much. I agree with many of the other reviewers, that the examples in this book would probably have held together better as a series of articles, and yes, the first half of the book is a more cohesive read than the second. I found the best way to read the book was as a pick up and put down book. If you read a few pages here and there the examples are interesting and make you think, challenging the way you perceive the world and the way you make judgements about it. In this way, the overall premise becomes less of an issue.The more I think about this book the more I wonder whether this was the book he really wanted to write. There are so many examples of racial stereotyping, I wonder whether that was the issue he wanted to tackle, but didn't quite have the courage to write a whole book on such a topic. It's a shame he doesn't because it would make for an interesting read and with his profile it would get a broader audience.",
            "Blink is a Great book about thinking in a different way, this for sure takes your thinking in a different direction its not your every day reading book and that is whats great about it. With the separate stories in a story this approach keeps the reader on their toes and always keeps an interesting story going while still incorporating an all over flow throughout the book.This book has been an information super highway, anyone who is looking for split second decision making tips this is the book to read. Malcolm is a skilled craftsman when it comes to writing and the things he can do anyone can appreciate. The overall tone of the book is strong and informative Malcolm knows what he wants to get across and he does a good job in doing so. This book is a good buy and can be passed around to anyone to read it is a quick read and never gets too complicated.If you like to read or even if you don't like to read this is still the book for you its a great read and you will be satisfied when you are finished. The amount that I learned from this book was incredible and you will think this too. I hope you pick up this great read you will be one hundred percent satisfied with it.",

            "If you have enjoyed any of his other books you will like this one too . . . the premise is interesting and has opened up another perceptual window. The stories relating to test marketing point to revealing how we consumers are studied and manipulated. I have recommended it.",
            "There is good reason that this book skyrocketed to the New York Times nonfiction best-seller's list. Gladwell serves up some interesting perspectives on how we make decisions. He asserts that decisions made quickly and without a lot of analysis can be just as good as, if not better than, carefully researched ones. Gladwell says it's because almost all of us possess the ability to \"thin slice\" a situation. We are able to unconsciously pick up on cues that allow us to make decisions intuitively. We can make good decisions without knowing all the information. Conversely, we can also make some poor decisions based on prior associations and impressions!Through compelling stories and significant research, Gladwell encourages his readers to be more self-aware of the power of rapid cognition and how subtle influences can alter or bias the product of our unconscious. The more sensitive we are to the fact, the more we can control the environment in which they occur and prevent making decisions based on prejudices.Personally, I took away three important lessons: The first is that truly successful decision making relies on a balance between deliberate and instinctive thinking. Secondly, if you are truly an expert, trust your instincts. You may not consciously know the rationale, but your subconscious does. The third lesson is that in good decision making, frugality matters. Take a complex problem and reduce it to its simplest elements. Even the most complicated of relationships and problems have a simple, identifiable, underlying problem.Makes you blink twice before you make a decision!",
            "It took me 2 weeks to finish the book.At the first few page, my \"Blink\" was telling me that I got the right book, the book that helps to stimulate and initiate further awareness on self-consciousness, to help us in controlling our \"Blink\".However, upon finishing the book, I was very disappointed at how much fact and experiment the book had given, but no absolute \"help\" was given. Of course, it's impossible to write a complete guide to control \"Blink\", but I was expecting a more \"solution\" to help us understand the word \"Blink\", and using it across the world instead of focusing only on \"Black\" and \"Guns\".More examples and case studies I'd like to hear are the \"poor\" and \"crimes\", how do you \"Blink\" on someone who dresses smart but is incapable to do anything, how do you \"Blink\" on a potential employee who looks promising, and whether all those \"Blink\" are \"right\" or \"wrong\" ?I'm very disappointed for the conclusion it gives, but nevertheless, it was enjoyable.",

            "Malcom Gladwell does a great job of discussing the pitfalls and powers of our instant perceptions. His concept of gut feel and the \"thin slice\" reminds the reader that our instincts and our perceptions (particularly visual percepions) are powerful influencers on our behavior. It is important to remember and understand our influencers and not allow them to disproportionally or irrationally impact our decision making processes. A great book to better understand yourself, others, and the psychology of interaction.",

            "This book is a really quick read and easy to read. I enjoyed the anecdotes that pulled Gladwell's premise together. The ten million dollar Kouros fraud and the serial dating actually have something in common. Both use split second analysis to decide if the statue or the prospective date are phonies.Why is it some people turn everything they touch into gold while others can never make a go of something?We have all had those hunches about someone or something and then later when it all comes to light, we say we knew that the moment we laid eyes on someone or something; we just knew they were no good or we just knew we liked them from the start.Gladwell writes that we very often make very important decisions within a few minutes and often in just seconds. He helps you see how just being aware of these split second decisions can make a positive influence in those decisions.He also points out how easily we can be persuaded by subliminal messages for good or for bad. He made me realize I need to quit listening to National Public Radio as my radio alarm clock. It really puts me in a funk and now I know why... It is depressing and it really does flavor my day and up until now all without my being aware of the influence... \"The Dow Jones was down today, gas prices were up, cost of living soared to record highs, the entire planet is heating up and we are all going to die because of it.\" CLICK!",
            "I resisted reading this book because my preliminary 'thin-slice' of it was that it would be trendy, glib, and shallow. Hey, maybe there is something to Gladwell's idea after all, because I did find Blink to be trendy, glib, shallow and, also, obnoxiously condescending. Check out this quote from chapter one:\"My guess is that many of you have the same impression of Tom Hanks. If I asked you what he was like, you would say that he is decent and trustworthy and down-to-earth and funny. But you don't know him. You're not friends with him. You've only seen him in the movies, playing a wide range of different characters. Nonetheless, you've managed to extract something very meaningful about him from those thin slices of experience, and that impression has a powerful effect on how you experience Tom Hanks's movies. 'Everybody said they couldn't see Tom Hanks as an astronaut,' Grazer says of his decision to cast Hanks in the hit movie Apollo 13. 'Well, I didn't know whether Tom Hanks was an astronaut. But I saw this as a movie about a spacecraft in jeopardy. And who does the world want to get back the most? Who does America want to save? Tom Hanks. We don't want to see him die. We like him too much.'\"Yuck! I hate Tom Hanks. Not personally, of course. He's probably a nice man. But as an actor I hate his guts. I hate his face. I would love to see him die horribly in the movies in a variety of ways. Where do these 'lifestyle' writers like Gladwell get the authority to speak for everyone. Instead of saying 'I' or 'me', they always say 'you' or 'we'. There are some good things in this book, but they are badly undermined by Gladwell's hucksterish, Madison Avenue style of arguing and writing. He is prone to asking leading 'straw dog' questions like 'Were these people lying?' and 'But what would happen if I were to...?' And then answering condescendingly with 'Not at all' or 'The answer is.' He also uses hack phrases like 'Sure enough', 'but the truth is', and, nauseatingly frequently, 'Believe it or not.' He even actually uses the formerly uber-trendy adjective 'tony'. Uggh! The idea of 'thin-slicing' (oh, how I quickly came to hate that phrase) is never given a consistent, coherent defence. Gladwell starts out with a provocative description of what might happen 'unconsciously' during the first two seconds of decision making and then doodles off for the rest of the book on a flatulent walkabout in the fields of psychology, the arts, and business. This is a book written by a lazy amateur, a dilettante.Save your money. I wish I did. This book boils down to (Gladwell loves that phrase, 'it boils down to') 'follow your hunches'. Was that worth $18? My brother owes me $18. I only bought Blink and read it because of his threat not to read anymore of my recommendations if I didn't read one of his. (His last recommendation that I tried to read was Atlas Shrugged. No more need be said about that.) Gladwell comes to this startling conclusion ('follow your hunches') by talking to a few psychologists and Hollywood moguls and collecting a few anecdotes. Don't try looking for a bibliography in this book, because there isn't one. Instead 'we' have a sparse 'Notes' section which mostly consists of more anecdotes instead of references. If you are interested in reading about human behaviour and how we think and make decisions, check out Thomas Gilovich's How We Know What Isn't So, and Robert Cialdini's Persuasion (Science and Practice). These people are psychologists. They do experiments. They publish their results in peer reviewed journals, and they talk to fellow psychologists, scientists, and other smart people. They put extensive bibliographies at the backs of their books because they have read a lot about their subjects and they know that it is important to back up your conclusions and show how you came to them. If Gladwell had spent more time in the library and less time in the hair dressers, his book might have been better. But hey, Malcolm G.'s 'thin-sliced' the book biz. He knows that if you are a young, trendy writer working for 'the Best Magazine in the World' you can get just about anything published, even bilge like this, and hit the best sellers' lists.",
            "Let me save the trouble and fill you in on what this book is actually about. To sum up, it's basically 254 pages telling you that within the first few seconds of observing something like art, a marriage, a product idea, etc., you can have as accurate of a view or assumption of it as you would in a year of observation. What makes this even more hilarious is that his examples of \"instinctive decisions\" are from experts in certain fields: a psychologist, a coach, antiquities experts, doctors, etc. Wouldn't you think that an expert in a field, let's say a doctor, would instinctively be able to give a more accurate interpretation within seconds of a sick person then say a mechanic? Uh...yeah. So let me save you the time, trouble and $25...trust your instincts and you'll be fine. I just can't believe someone drew out such a dull and pointless topic into 254 pages. So my final thoughts...in 2 seconds, I could tell this book was a waste of time so I stopped reading it. Well done Gladwell!",
            "The title of this book, \"Blink\", and the back cover caught my eye. I read most of this book but I got the feeling that there were too many examples of the same point. The feeling I got was that the author was trying to make the book thicker with repetious examples. Maybe Im wrong. Maybe I just couldn't grasp the importance of the examples. Any way, I wasn't able to finish. The point I got was that a snap decision could be a good decision or it could be a wrong decison.",
            "This book describes the effect of subcontinent in some of our thoughts and decisions, and provides some empirical evidence about their hypoteses. It is a very easy and interesting book to read. It provides a lot of practical examples of how to identify the slices of information that you need to form an opinion that is very close to reality",
            "I found Blink to be superficial with no serious insights. Its basic premise is to trust your snap judgement but only if you have sufficient knowledge to do so. Its other points are to think outside the box and don't get bogged down in the minuteness of knowledge.Although easy to read and somewhat enjoyable there is nothing new here, so move along.I've also read Malcom Gladwell's \"Ouliers\" which I would rate higher because it did contain some new insights for me, but it was still basic pop sociology.",
            "This book definitely explains the unexplainable. We sometimes choose logical reasoning over intuitions which leads to mistakes and even catatrophes. But the small voice inside your head saying 'yes' or 'no' to our decision making is right most of the times. This is especially true when we have less information about the decision process. Whether it be as small as buying clothes or as big as investing in a new business, the intuitive feeling can be a better guide as it is based more on experience and observation. Im marketing, that is how consumer behavior has been identified when they switch brands or buy an abolutely new product without any logical reason associated with it. The book definitely reconfirmed my conviction of 'gut feeling'.",

            "If I had the ability to judge a book's quality at a blink, I would not have bought this book. The book has some interesting facts, and interesting facts are all that the book has. Its logic is incomplete and thus its conclusion can be misleading. Furthermore, it fails to analyze or explain the reasons of those interesting facts. I got an \"ok, so what?\" feeling after reading the book.Here's an example. The author's argument is that we can judge a person we have never met before in a nanosecond and still tend to be correct. He uses the evident of college students judging their professors at their first class. The logic is: because students are good at judging new teachers, people are good at judging strangers. This is a very biased example - students are experts in judging teachers. Students have been studying and judging their teachers since kinder garden and their teachers are usually from similar culture background as the students. As a result, each student has a huge database of what they like and whether a specific teacher would meet their requirements. However, if you want a student in a completely different culture or a person who has been home-schooling to judge a stranger teacher in 3 minutes of lecturing time, I think the result is more likely to be off. The author cannot safely draw the same conclusion.Yes, we tend to make quick judgment of people, and yes, we tend to think we are right (please note the difference between \"think we are right\" and \"are actually right\"). Yet this book fails to make neither a good point nor a good explanation. If you are new to the topic of decision-making neurology and interested in a quick reading, I recommend \"How We Decide\" by Jonah Lehrer. It's easy, interesting, and actually informative.",

I really enjoyed learning about how the brain works and processes information before we consciously recognize what we have seen. When he started his social agenda and race issues I had to force myself to finish the book. At the end of the book I felt like I was reading something from an angry citizen who felt that police officers were out to get the minority population.

I don't know if I need to get to the end to really understand the value of the book but currently in the middle of it I am bored and I don't want to continue.

Bravo Zulu gift giver.The Power of Thinking Without Thinking is written so that the reader can relate to the material as it is devoured. Gladwell points out information you kind of thought you knew. The perpective and method in which he delivers the information allows you to understand and utiltize your unconscious thinking as well as the unconscious thinking of those around you.His method of delivery is association to everyday relative stories. Above and beyond just the mass research he has obviously spent years compiling, he dares to present material with personal biases and the power and effects biases create.I do not want to give out the score before you watch the game, but I would consider this a must read.Enjoy!",

            "Gladwell writes about the \"24/7 mental valet,\" which is really nothing more than the \"superconscious,\" the corollary to the subscious. While the subconscious is below our consciousness, the superconscious is above it, although we are no more conscious of it than the subconscious. It is responsible for the \"instinctive\" responses (yes, even humans have instincts), and is the overseer of the sleep/wake cycle. The conscious is awake during the day, the subscious is awake at night, but the superconscious is the 24/7 mental valet that controls both cycles. It also controls the 50/50 distribution of male/female children--there can be no other explanation than a force interwoven among the greater human population that controls the even distribution of children across individual women throughout all species.It is akin to the economic theory of the efficient market hypothesis, which says that all information is incorporated into the market and reflected in a random walk of stock prices. The superconscious is also akin to the \"invisible hand\" of evolution which guides all species to their highest function.",
            "Blink is an excellent book about how our unconscious affects our thinking. The book demonstrates how powerful our unconscious mind is when it comes to processing information. A lot of times we take forever pondering over plethora of information and are still clueless. On some other occasions, with a tiny piece of information we taking the most perfect of decisions. The book argues its partly because our unconscious is extremely good at weeding out unnecessary information and using just the relevant part for making a decision which is perfect and couldn't have been better. It presents numerous real life examples showing how past experiences/popular perception of people has affected their decision making and consequently results of their actions. The writing is easy to read, driven by examples and is thought provoking. Overall, its an excellent job by Malcolm Caldwell.",
            "I bought numerous copies of this book after reading it, for gifts--for the family member in intel, the family member into everything, the girfriend of Intel....There were so many stories that fed real-life knowing vs data, educated data, and gut-informed data, and how to distinguish them all. I will be looking deeper into numerous researchers discussed, and their informing of real-life settings. Very readable format; I found myself making notes so I could refer back later to name, page, etc.",
            "Malcom Gladwell's exploration of our initial subconscious reactions is an incredible read for both experts and laymen alike. I am especially impressed at the examples Gladwell presents in the book. He begins each chapter with a new example of the main point for the section. These examples are not rooted in higher learning but rather reach topics any of us can relate to. He writes about marriage, dating, art, elections...even his primary example to introduce the Blink concept is about a stature. Throughout his explanation, he constantly refers back to his original example, fleshing it out as he teaches us more and more about the details of the \"Blink\" phenomenon. The result of tackling this information piece by piece is an easy to follow guide through the otherwise confusing concepts and the creative examples help keep one interested even if s/he wasn't looking to read an academic book.I also thoroughly enjoyed Gladwell's voice throughout the book. Blink is filled with academic research to support Gladwell's claims but the writing is a departure from the often droll college textbooks and articles. Instead, Gladwell's narrative often sounds like he is telling a story rather than explaining a theory. He is not an impartial narrator but rather provides examples from his own life and writes like he is leading us through information he himself just discovered. In short, his writing provides clarity and doesn't sacrifice creativity in lieu of scientific research.In conclusion, I throw in another recommendation for this excellent book. Some of the concepts tackled in Blink are taught in University Communication, Psychology, and Sociology classes so nothing can beat a creative and effective piece of college education without the expensive tuition fees. Furthermore, Blink will persuade you to take a look at the way you react to others and what kind of messages these reactions send.",
            "In Blink, Gladwell applies his popular writing style to the investigations of making snap decisions. Gladwell uses anecdotes and the results of scientific research to illustrate several different theories into how the subconscious part of our minds will quickly sort through a vastly large number of variables and lead us to a conclusion. Blink gives examples of when our first impression are more accurate than doing hours of research. However, Gladwell quickly follows his first example of gut instinct is right with stories when gut instinct and first impressions are wrong. The final third part of the book attempts to examine when first instincts are likely to be correct, and what efforts we can individually make to improve our accuracy in making split second decisions.Gladwell contends that we develop biases that harm are ability to make accurate quick decisions. Once we are aware of these biases, rather than try to remove them from our culture, we should try to find ways to eliminate them from becoming a variable in our subconscious. He uses the example of having classical musicians audition behind a screen to avoid gender and posture biases. Gladwell argues that by gaining education and experience in a subject, we become better at making fast decisions in a given field.What is notably lacking in Blink is a defined prescription for how we can use this information to better make quick decisions, and precisely when we should deliberate long and hard or simply follow our gut. Gladwell's general suggestions do not satisfy the questions raised in the readers mind over the course of the book. Although some readers may find this annoying, I think it is unfair to hold the absence of answers against the authors work. Gladwell has thrown these ideas out into the public discourse, now as a society we can think about how we are thinking and perhaps someday research will give a nice flow chart of when we should think on our feet, control our environment for better bias control, or spend hours on statistical analysis.",
            "The idea of \"Blink\" is that the areas of our expertise generate some of the most reliable gut instincts and impulses, and how we can come to use these impulses in a controlled way. \"Blink\" also tackles the ideas of where these impulses fail, and investigates why.As a whole, concise book, the arch of the elements involved is a little wobbly. Each chapter feeds into the other, but the ideas come across as initially disparate, a bit of a shock to a reader expecting a smooth reading experience. What kept me tied to the book was the idea of applicability. As I read through each part of the book, I found myself evaluating my own experiences against the ideas of the experiences presented in the book. In that respect, I found the book invaluable for helping improve my own rapid cognition by evaluating some of the misconceptions I might have about it.The plus and minus of the book is that it, in itself, is \"thin-sliced\" as far as subject matter. No segment is comprehensive. In some cases this is due to interest; I can envision the publisher/editor saying \"well, the details of this study would be great to go into more detail about, but people will snore.\" In other cases, it seems like it may be due to the lack of tangible concepts in some of the examples; How does one truly evaluate the nature of a person on a scientific level when it seems to be all a matter of opinion?The advantage of this is that the final message of the book, the closing element, brings together both the positive and negative aspects of snap judgments. One person's auditory rapid-cognition can be completely clouded by their visual rapid-cognition.The advantages of knowing what to trust and when is critical, and in this case \"Blink\" helps explore reasons and examples of exactly that.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's Blink shows how most thought processes in individuals can happen in a split second, like when Vic Braden can decide when someone will double fault in Tennis right before they do it. Braden had no true rhyme or reason for knowing when it would happen, he has been around Tennis most of his life, but that doesn't mean you should have some type of ESP for when someone is about to do something a normal person could not possibly predict.Gladwell continues to say that the brain can even be primed to act a certain way without you even realizing it. Gladwell portrays this when psychologist John Bargh gives a group of undergraduate a test that has certain words that will prime the brain to either be aggressive (with words like intrude, infringe, interrupt, etc.) or polite (with words like patient, respect, courteous, etc.). They are then put into a situation where they can either interrupt the proctor to tell them they are done or allow him to continue talking to his visitor, over 80% of the people who were given the \"polite\" test never interrupted while most of the \"aggressive\" students did after five minutes. The mind is a powerful object that can be molded in many ways. It can allow a war veteran to win a war game simulation under almost impossible odds; it can also make mistakes about Warren Harding being President. Even worse, it can cause you to kill a man because you thought he had a gun in his hand, when really, it was just his wallet.The human mind is a funny thing. In most cases it will help you understand a situation better or explain things to you before you even realized it was doing it. Gladwell says \"And what Blink is - what all the stories and studies and arguments add up to - is an attempt to understand this magical and mysterious thing called judgment.\" However, it's not magic; it's simply a lifetime of experience and repetition that leads your mind to fully understand similar situations. It is the knowledge that you may not even know you have, but it's the knowledge that separates the war veteran from the well informed adversary, the knowledge that allows you to \"blink\" and understand.",
            "The Book Review: Blink VincentThis book is about those first two seconds. Two seconds does not necessarily mean you have to decide things just in two seconds, it means you have to choose from all the alternatives and make your decision in a short time. The author (Gladwell) expresses the idea that our brain uses two different ways to sense the current situation. The first one is, many of us are familiar with, the conscious strategy. And the second one is the adaptive unconscious. From this book, Gladwell wants to tell us some good points: Sometimes, we should convince ourselves that the adaptive unconscious is way too better than the traditional conscious strategy. Also, we need to know when to use the conscious strategy and when to use the other one. If a person uses the wrong strategy under an unsuitable situation, the outcome may turn out badly. What is more, the snap judgment and first impressions can be trained and controlled (most important point).In my opinion, what makes Gladwell's books so well-known is that he uses many examples in daily life in order to inform his audiences about his notions. Fortunately, I have met some examples in my life, which related to his ideas.1 In Gladwell's Nissan case, the dealer is doing a really awesome job because he has two characteristics: He uses the customer-centric method and treats every customer equally. He doesn't judge people by their appearances (fight the Warren Harding error). When I was in China one year ago, I saw a man wearing shabby clothes went into a BWM store. It seemed that he was poor and could not afford even the cheapest BMW in that shop. When he laid his fingers on a BMW X5, one salesman forbade him to do so and said some unrespectable words to him. However, a female saleswoman came out and treat this man like a potential buyer. She gave the man a cup of coffee and introduced all the detailed information about that BWM with smile on her face. The man thought for a while, and then he made a call. After ten minutes, his son came in with two huge briefcases. When his son opened these two briefcases, what were inside made me surprised: they were about three million cash (RMB). His father bought two BMW X5 by cash and this activity made the female saleswoman gain a lot of commission. From this case, I get to know that \"Warren Harding error\" is common and it is especially harmful for a salesman/saleswoman.2 Around two years ago, the luxury brand - Louis Vuitton wanted to open a shop in Nanjing (my hometown city). However, the marketing people in Louis Vuitton were not sure about whether citizens in Nanjing could afford this expensive bag. One top manager, who was in charge of affairs in China, arrived in Nanjing. He didn't bring with him a professional team and order them to do analyses that would last several months like many other managers. He just stood near Xin Jiekou (a famous business circle in Nanjing), felt the surroundings, and counted the amount of luxury cars like BMW, Benz, Lexus, and so on. He finished counting after several minutes. After five months, Louis Vuitton opened its Nanjing store. You know what? The first year's revenue of this store was about 100,000,000 RMB and it meant this store sold nearly 30 bags in each day (this is amazing in China). In my opinion, this was a \"blink\" method although it took several minutes. The manager used his initial feelings about Nanjing and made a successful decision.After reading this book, I will consider the incoming problems from a different angle. I always hear the saying \"haste makes waste\" and think it is true. However, I will use the \"blink\" method to solve some problems when circumstances permit in future.",
            "The eyes may be the windows into our soul, but facial expressions are apparently good indicators of everything from how likely a marriage is to survive to how likely a suspect is to pull the trigger on his gun. It seems almost intuitive that over-analyzing is counter-productive, but Malcolm Gladwell gives us lots of examples to prove it, including a war game that made me cringe to think that our military really operates this way. Almost as scary is the process of determining how to handle ER patients with chest pain, in which case too much information may actually be misleading information. The author takes several detours, including one at the end that indicates that first impressions are not always valuable, particularly where a gender or racial bias may come into play. The conventional wisdom that women are inferior to men in the brass section of an orchestra is blown to smithereens by blind auditions. Warren Harding was elected President, apparently because he looked the part. Gladwell also points out that often our choices, in everything from speed-dating to music, do not always bear out what we say we like. In fact, we may claim to dislike something just because it's different, but without innovation, where would we be? Thanks heavens market research is sometimes ignored. In the case of New Coke, the taste tests were taken seriously, and they proved to be totally deceptive, since taking a sip of something is a lot different from drinking an entire 12-ounce can.",
            "I believe that the book is very interesting to read, and I enjoyed reading it. The Author, Malcolm Gladwell, brought some interesting studies that discuss human being's inborn ability to determine things beyond common judgment. Gladwell presents diverse studies to show us people's ability of making critical decisions depending on that inborn ability (blink). Although Gladwell elaborates on how snap judgments can be good or bad in our lives, he failed to elaborate on how to differentiate between the good and the bad intuition before making any judgments.The decisions that were made using people's inborn instincts can have negative outcome. For example, Gladwell discusses a case study about Cook County Hospital, which was about curing heart problem patients in a really poor medical environment. He mentioned that 250,000 patients with no medical insurance come through the hospital every year and the hospital does not have enough man power and resources to cure all those patients properly. The interesting part is that the doctors in hospital were treating patients using their gut feeling with minimal laboratory help, which gives totally inaccurate results and could lead to someone's death. These experts are able to make such decisions because they have been doing the same kind of treatment with different people for years, and their judgment is probably more than just intuitive. Their little mistake can cost a persons life. At the same time, Gladwell discusses on how snap judgments can be bad. In cases of racial prejudice for example, the cops who shot Amadou Diallo were shooting an unarmed man who at first glance looked liked a criminal to them. Since there is no way of knowing what out instinct tells us is wrong or right, it is better to not make snap decision and react towards it.On the other hand, blink of an eye decision can make you do the right decision. For example, on the Getty Statue case, Hoving knew that the statue was not genuine as soon as he saw it while the scientists wasted 15 months to figure it out. At the same time, General Paul Van Riper defeat his opposing team in the war using his instinct while his enemies were using satellites to fight against him. Even though intuition can lead you to a good decision, after all it is just a gut feeling and there in no way to answer why we felt that way and there is no way of knowing if it is correct. If you can not explain why you felt that way then there is no reason why someone should believe on what you have to say.Finally, after reading the book, it is clear that blink judgment can be useful and/or wasteful. Gladwell failed to point out on how to differentiate between the good and bad snap judgments. The book left me hanging with questions like; how could somebody know if the judgment about to make is good or bad? How can you make a distinction between good and bad snap judgments?",
            "In the book, Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, written by Malcolm Gladwell, he focuses on the subconscious mind and the decisions we make. Throughout the book, he utilizes several examples and statistics that support his theories on why people make decisions the way they do. His main focus points are about thin slicing and snap decisions, all in which addict the way we think about a person, object or an event.Gladwell discusses thin slicing, which is that our unconscious minds have the ability to recognize and asses people and situations very quickly and accurately, all within a matter of seconds. This is created by an individual's body language, gestures and facial expressions. Gladwell states that people can formulate ideas even before talking to someone and make an accurate assumption of who they are or what they are really feeling.Following thin slicing, he discusses snap decisions, which is the ability to thin slice situations to make correct judgments. How this is done is by taking control of our snap judgments. We must analyze the situation before letting our unconscious mind trigger. Sure, this may be difficult, but it is necessary to practice so that snap judgments are not made. We must ensure that our presumptions and biases do not control the way we think, for they can lead us to incorrect information and judgments. Finally, if a person has too much information it can cloud their mind and impair their judgment. They must focus on the current situation and make the best decision possible.I found Blink a very easy to read and would recommend this book to other readers. Gladwell provided some great examples that supported his theories. This book really made me sit back and think about my previous judgments I have made in my past about people and situations I have been. Such as when I was working for Enterprise Rent-A-Car, we had to underwrite every customer to ensure they were qualified to rent a car. When some individuals walked through the door, I found myself immediately judging them about whether or not they were going to qualify. Sometimes my judgments were correct and other times I was proven wrong. There were times where very professional looking men and women have came in and I thought for sure they were going to qualify, but they were renting with a debit card or trying to rent on cash and did not have any bills or pay stubs to verify employment and residency, so unfortunately they did not qualify. Also, there were times when people came in their pajamas looking like they had not showered in days and they were the ones who qualified. It just goes to show that one person should never make snap judgments. They must analyze the person or situation first and then make a judgment. Overall, I do agree with Gladwell, but I do feel that your first instinctive judgment may not always be the best and most accurate.",
            "This book could have been 200 pages, but instead, as modern authors seem to do, Gladwell felt compelled to make it much longer than it needed to be. This really is a good book, but Gladwell was on the verge of a great book. He provides an interesting topic with great commentary and thought. He ruins it with 2 things: 1) the unnecessary length 2) he doesn't go into \"why\" thin slicing is from a neuro-psychological standpoint. Effectivel, he tells us \"this\" is the case and gives some evidence ot support his claim. If you are going to this kind of commentary, write an article, no a book.If it sounds as though my opinion is mixed, it is. This book could have been truely phenomenal, but the books failings have me thinking of giving it 3 stars. More detail was necessary for some of the great examples he gave, and all of the uselessm uninformative chatter between points needs cutting out.",
            "It seems like a lot of reviews have spent a lot of time bemoaning what \"Blink\" isn't. It isn't a self-help guide that will teach you \"how to harness the power of thin slicing to win at business, cards, love, and the stock market\" which it seems is what a lot of Americans are looking for. To me - it seems more like an examination of the fact that we've become so data driven in the workforce that we've lost some of the balance between informed decisions based on data and 'gut feel.' I would also say that Gladwell didn't lay out a map of \"this is how you, too, can thin slice\" because it would be different for each of us depending on background, experience, the purpose we wish to achieve, etc. etc. etc. Instead - it's a personal responsibility to think about the ways that you make decisions and ways that you may be overwhelming yourself with data rather than doing something that comes naturally.Overall - I enjoyed the book for what it was and it made me spend time thinking about the different ways that I make decisions. I found the examples interesting - but maybe that's because I'm an Army officer that works in the medical field that has a car salesman for a father (all of these play a role in the book). It seems to wander a little at times and not all of the examples seem relevant to me, though.",
            "Again Malcolm Gladwell uses his considerable talent for insights to look at the way in which we make decisions. His questions are when we should trust our intuition and when not, why we should sometimes trust our intuition and how we can make our intuition more trustworthy. The book is called 'blink' because intuitive decisions happen in the 'blink' of an eye.The book is well argued, though from time to time connecting the dots becomes confusing, as Malcolm Gladwell tends to jump from topic to topic and only in the end brings some rhythm and rhyme to it.His fundamental message is that snap decisions can be correct but only if based on experience or training. E.g. experts can make correct snap decisions but if you are not an expert, you should not trust snap decisions.What Malcolm Gladwell does in this book is to spell out clearly what fundamentally was known but was rarely spelled out. E.g. a good chess player is also at 1 minute chess better than an average chessplayer, because his snap decisons are based on experience. And a professional race car driver is certainly better than me at carting.Yet though the result of his analysis is correct, the question remains whether his reasoning is correct. Is it simply that the expert can draw on such a wealth of data intuitively that he can make a better decision? Or is it that the expert can see more clearly what is relevant and what is not relevant? In chess (an example which Gladwell does not use) the expert clearly can more easily dismiss branches of the decisiontree which the average player does not so rapidly dismiss. This matters, as some of the situations Gladwell describes require the decisionmaker to focus on the relevant details, while other situations like the described police situation, requires the decider to consider a very broad range of input.And some of the examples he gives are not very relevant or too anecdotal to really matter. Is the Pepsi test really news? And the people who judged correctly from a very short video (or was it a photo) of a dorm room the character of the student - against which measure was their impression judeged? Was there a panel of jurors who declared that this student would be deemed unrelaibale on a scale from 1 to six and the snap judgement was tested against this?In any case, a readable and recommendable book with significant weaknesses.",
            "This book really grabbed my attention in the first few pages with its description of an art forgery, but things really slowed down about a third of the way into the book. The only other part that was really interesting to me was Gladwell's description of John Gottman's research with couples. That's about it. Most of the other examples were down right boring. I found myself looking at how many pages I had left. Worst of all, after finishing the book, I had no idea what the point of it was. Gladwell spends the first half of the book explaining why we should trust our gut instinct, but spends the last half demonstrating how our gut instinct can be wrong. I had to read almost 300 pages for that?",
            "Blink by Malcolm Gladwell: just seems to be a collection of ideas or small conversations, meaningless in themselves. The book starts out well but loses continuity, the conclusion of choice \"skip this book\". I haven't read \"the Tipping Point\" but if \"Blink\" is any indication of of the reading I would skip it too.",
            "What an easy and enjoyable read. Learning to trust your gut, everyone does it but now you know why. The conversational tone of the book makes you feel like you are having a chit chat with Malcolm. Great book.",
            "Several of the serious criticisms of this book are well-founded, but it also has several extraordinary virtues, not the least of which is superb writing. Others have reasonably criticized the book for its lack of coherence, but Gladwell is a journalist and not a thinker. What did you expect? Personally, I found the thesis, or theses, of this book, for there are several, much more compelling than the single thesis of The Tipping Point, which is really just a mathematical construct applied arbitrarily to a number of disparate real-world situations with have entirely different dynamics. Nonetheless I enjoyed that book for one of the main reasons I enjoyed this one: for its engaging writing about human behaviour.Blink, though, offers us a number of important, insightful, but disjunctive perspectives on human decision making. The title is catchy, no doubt, and probably sold more books than \"The Vagaries of Human Decision Making\" would have, but the many critical reviews found here (which themselves are likely to significantly affect, not only the book's sales, but its enduring reputation) show that the title is both inappropriate and misleading, and if it was the publisher's choice, crammed down the author's throat, Gladwell might want to think seriously about getting a different publisher, or better, publishing the book himself - who needs publishers these days, anyway?This book would have been worth publishing just for the sake of bringing John Gottman's research to the attention of the general public, or Paul Ekman's (the expert on human facial expressions). In fact this book contains the seeds of many potentially important books, and it also cries out for a true intellectual synthesis of all of this provocative, and often contradictory evidence of how we make up our minds at many different levels. Gladwell is not the man to deliver on such projects, but so what? I am very glad that he has given us what he has.My principal criticism of the book, echoing another reviewer (and the reason I give it only 4 stars), is that many of the summaries of the scientific studies are too superficial, and leave unaswered too many critical questions which would occur to the intelligent, or scientifically literate reader. It's nearly always a mistake to write down to your audience. Isaac Asimov, in his 100+ scientific books, proved that even the driest and most complex material can be made absorbing to anyone who is likely ever to read a serious non-fiction book sometime in his adult life. And Gladwell is twice the writer Asimov was. But, for whatever reason, Gladwell has given us in many places content-light, and again, I suspect the hand of his mass-market publisher, shaping this talented and impressionable writer and journalist into a mere entertainer, and not steering him instead towards greater rigor, and significance.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell is one of my favorite authors, but Blink is not one of my favorite books. While it poses an interesting premise, Gladwell admits in the book that he got the idea for it because of how people reacted to his wiry shock of hair when he let it grow out - that seems like a thin editorial driver. But thin is really the focus of the book, in fact Gladwell coins the term \"thin-slicing\" as a key method that expert decision makers use to filter only the most important facts from an array of variables. While this is not a new idea - for decades the military has taught officers to make quick decisions with incomplete information - Gladwell takes it to an iffy extreme of making decisions in microseconds. That may hold true in some instances but seems unsustainable as a preferred methodology of selecting among options. Regardless, it is thought provoking and worth a read. Soundview recommends the book, but leaves it up to the reader to decide its validity - hopefully you'll give it more thought than a nanosecond or a blink.",
            "I did the audio book version of this. It had useful content and made me think a little about how people make decisions. Most of the book explains why it's important to give yourself an extra second of time to 'react' instead of making a quick decision or using your gut. I really didn't enjoy this book like many others have. Personally, I think great decisions are made on 'gut' and 'instinct.' The author does reference studies on incidents in american history where scientists compared the results of the actual incident versus a proposed alternative giving them more time to think before acting. Users who took an extra second to break up their unconscious reaction to make it a conscious decision showed greater success in desired results. I think the jury is still out on these studies, and I prefer to think that intuition and natural tendency/gut reactions are a better angle of approach, provided you have confidence in your decision-making and rarely second-guess yourself.",
            "In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell explains many things about what humans do when they have to make a decision. Is it a long and drawn out process? Or is it, simply, a \"snap\" decision? It is, Gladwell argues, the second choice. Whether the consequences of this action are good or bad doesn't influence our way of making it. Through style, tone, and impact, Gladwell presents us with a thoroughly entertaining nonfiction study of human behavior.There are, arguably, three fundamental ways to present a topic through a book. Style is incredibly important: it can express an unimpressively boring subject with a gleeful zeal that can make it interesting. The author of Blink has a bare idea but uses different types of structures to express it. Within the bulk of the eight main sections, there are mini-sections. That is, to elaborate further on examples, which brings the second part of the structure: examples. Gladwell has all of the hypotheses he can muster, but he also backs him up with legit historical and factual events that back up his point. The second part of writing is tone, which can very from cynical to joyful. The writer seems to find a nice balance between sarcasm and exuberance. Passion is another word that comes to mind, as the subject seems to be of great interest to the writer. The impact of a book is the climax and the conclusion. With Blink, he makes it fulfilling. It has an all-around view from every side in every situation, and the analysis seems well researched and well informed.The theory of thin slicing is the dominant theory available in the book. It proves in just a few words that everyone makes split decisions on a consistent basis. Gladwell expresses this well, through style, tone, and impact. Why did Warren Harding become president? Why do most couples use \"Irreconcilable Differences\" as a reason for divorce? Why do most people never notice the little mistakes in the marble of a statue? All of the answers to these questions lie in the magical world of Blink.",
            "I've avoided reading Mr Gladwell before due to various silly reasons - which mostly boil down to me avoid pop science books that talk about the values in gut reaction. However, I've been reading a lot on general marketing, management and brain development of late and I was looking for something related and light. \"Blink\" perfectly fit the bill.At heart, this is a book of stories. Within this framework, Mr Gladwell makes some compelling arguments about trusting the unconscious brain's initial read. Further, that when many factors are in play, sometimes it really does make sense to listen to the initial reaction instead of digging deeper into the problem. What makes this compelling is simple - he puts limits on when this works and describes situations where it fails. In fact he goes even farther and talks about how training is needed to fully know that you can trust your instincts. And to know when you can trust them. Indeed when we don't have training he shows how easy it is to \"seed\" someone so that they are more or less likely to reach certain conclusions (see Kahneman). A similar line of thought is used by Mr Taleb in \"Fooled by Randomness\" so its very good to see books come together on topics.For all this, there isn't much depth here so don't come looking for that. Instead focus on enjoying the ride as Mr Gladwell is a first class story teller.",
            "The main idea of this book is to explore how we use our subconscious (or instinct, or gut feeling) to make day to day decision. This instinctive decision helps us to manage our day to day life and response in emergency. This instinctive decision which made very quickly can be as good as decision made cautiously and deliberately. However, the very subconscious can also be dangerous, betray us and could cause us in making wrong decision. The second part of this book explore when should we trust our instinct and we should not. The final part of this book shows us how we could and educate control our snap judgment and first impression.We can know a lot about the person during first impression, as our subconscious mind is unconsciously finding patterns in situation and behavior while sizing up a person. This can also be done deliberately by observing small details. We could not explain how we derive certain decision which usually influence or based on our subconscious decision.Our subconscious is sometimes influence by our unconscious bias. This unconscious bias may have negative impact on our decision. However, this unconscious bias can be controlled using positive association.Good decision making relies on deliberate and instinctive thinking. In good decision making, less information is better than more information. More information will overload decision maker with noise because the additional information does not provide additional value.Using the example of tasting Pepsi and Coke, this chapter illustrates the result of focus group, which uses ordinary people for marketing research, may not be reliable. This is especially true when the members are made to think about their instinctive decision. The expert in a field have better judgment as compare to the focus group because their expertise allows them to have a better understanding on their unconscious decision on the subject they specialized. This chapter concludes by empathizing that our subconscious decisions are not necessarily wrong, however, they are shallow, hard to explain and easily disrupted.As we are emotionally arouse in an emergency situation our ability to collect and analyze information narrows. Our split second decision can lead us into trouble especially when we are under stress or in an emergency. This however can be control by slowing down our heart beat. By slowing down our heart beat, we can react better as our ability to analyze the situation increase. On a separate note, this chapter also mentioned that we could read peoples emotion by studying their facial expression.The final chapter concludes that we can avoid making wrong decision from our subconscious by isolating any factor that could mislead our judgment.",
            "I enjoyed reading this book, but it left me a bit confused. What was the author trying to say? It seems as if he was trying to say that \"Thin-Slicing\" and snap judgments can be more accurate than in detailed analysis.But then through the book, he provides data, studies, and stories to both support this idea and debunk it. So at the end of the book, you are left with the feeling that the author more or less just went out and gathered data and interview people without clarifying the issue or taking a clear stance.Its more like he just took the work of others and compiled it into a book form, without forming a solid opinion...",
            "Blink is about quick decisions that we all make without deep analysis. Often the decision makers cannot explain the rationale and logic behind these decisions. There are three themes that I picked up from the book. First, \"blink\" decisions may be better than decisions that are made after analysis and thought therefore we should not dismiss them. Second, there are other times that \"blink\" decisions can be terrible. Third, how do we improve our \"blink\" decisions? How can we distinguish situations that \"blinks\" are help or hurt us? The book is not organized quite this way . I found the author's writing and stories very enjoyable, but I did not follow what his point was in numerous parts. The stories were loosely related to \"blinking\". Some were too forced. Gladwell certainly gives you a lot to think about but does not really build a model that applies to the real world.Blink is delightful and very entertaining. Like the other two Gladwell books, the writing is excellent. The author creates the appropriate level of suspense in his numerous stories. He is a master at luring readers into his world. I think that he has improved with each subsequent book. Outliers was the best then Blink then Tipping Point.",
            "This is my favorite of Gladwell's conceptual ideas. I try to remind myself of it every day, that the information we gather in a blink of time is what we use to ascertain a situation. Why I bother gathering more is beyond me. How often I come back to that original burst of thought and wished I had listened to it. Of course, some impulsive thoughts are worth resisting and I suppose the secret is learnig to tell which is which, that is, which is worth a blink and which is worth a look.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell has a way that makes you believe you are being let in on newly-unveiled secrets. He did it with human social behavior in \"The Tipping Point\" and does it again here in \"Blink\" with the hidden world of the subconscious human mind.In \"Blink\", Gladwell tackles the way that the human mind can sometimes make near-instantaneous judgments that are often inexplicable, even to those who make them. Examples range from art experts who can tell a fake at a glance, to a tennis coach who can tell when a player is about the double-fault, to (less admirably) police officers who \"know\" a suspect is a criminal. There's a bit of benign bait and switch behind \"Blink\" in that it initially seems to suggest that we are about to be shown how to harness a great source of untapped, infallible interior wisdom. But while telling how some people do manage to make critical decision in the blink of an eye, Gladwell spends far more of the book discussing how our minds are fooled by our upbringing and experience, leading to horrific judgments that can have catastrophic effects.Gladwell's main focus in the book is on \"thin slicing\" -- the way our judgments are often based on seemingly insignificant portions of behavior. A surgeon's likelihood to be sued for negligence, for instance, can be predicted quite well on the basis of the tone of voice used when speaking with patients; a couple's likelihood of divorce on the number of insignificant facial flashes of contempt they show in a short conversation. Human minds, in another example, are incredibly well-tuned to pick up subtle fleeting signals from the faces of others. Maxwell makes the controversial, but I think on-target, point that our faces are not as much *controlled* by our minds, but are extensions of our minds. This is suggested by experiments that show how mood is changed by affecting an angry or happy face. But the connection goes the other way, and the mind is expressed by unconscious facial expressions that appear in milliseconds, betraying inner conflicts and fears. A film of British spy Kim Philby, when slowed downed considerably and viewed by and expert in facial expressions, betrays flashes of a man both fearful and proud of his duplicity.Gladwell also explores the subconscious -- the \"mind behind the locked door\" as he calls it, whose judgments strongly influence our behavior. He cites studies in which subjects, exposed to a set of words relating to old age, walk away from the test more slowly than do controls. That's one thing. More controversially, he contends that minority students score lower on a test -- if, that is they are asked at the outset to identify their race. Presumably, raising the race issue also raises unbidden associations with lower intellectual expectations. Aside from being potentially inflammatory, this last example seems a bit too pat in its suggestion that minorities devalue education and that more conscious biases are not also at play. But while \"Blink\" shows how our subconscious can be fooled, it also provides ways to defeat its worst tendencies. Gladwell's story of the successful car salesman who treats all customers alike, thereby deliberately blocking irrelevant signals (dress, age, gender, race) that fool others to dismiss potential customers, show that our mistaken snap judgments can be overcome.Gladwell's writing is fascinating, but not entirely trustworthy. He has a maddening tendency to fudge the story to make his point. He cites precise percentages when they agree with his thesis, but replaces them with vague language when they don't. And anyone who reads psychological literature will find Gladwell's sense of certainty a bit suspect. Gladwell's treatment of the Amadou Dialou shooting by 4 white cops in was a case in point. Avoiding the standard rationales for the killing (self defense by police backers and race by Dialou supporters) Gladwell spins a tale in which cops lost their ability to \"mind-read\" Dialou by rushing him, then getting lost in an adrenaline-fueled autism-like state. It's own thing to suggest this as a possibility. It's another to state it as a certainty.\"Blink\" is an interesting read when taken with a grain of skepticism. The picture it paints of the ways -- good and bad -- that we make quick decisions might help us overcome our reliance on gut impressions that are built only on cultural assumptions. The heroes of \"Blink\" are those whose \"snap\" impressions are built a database built from years of personal experience. In a society in which the most ignorant get to broadcast their opinions, thus affecting the \"experience\" of their audiences, this is refreshing.",
            "One of key ideas of this book is that on many occasions the unconscious can inform the rest of `the person' of a decision that is not realised consciously for some time to come. We need to recognise that, and know how and when to trust these potential critical moments - is it a good judgement or not?Gladwell has hit upon a winning formula in his writing. His earlier block-busting book has been a key influence in modern thought, and the title (\"Tipping Point\") has entered common vocabulary in its own right. The title of this book is not snappy enough to do that, but the book is a fascinating meander through both mental and physiological factors that can result in us making snap decisions. In its own way, this is no less of a classic as his earlier effort.The book does not only concentrate on key moments where the snap decision has been a `good' one, but also where the decision has been poor or very questionable - indicating when to trust snap decisions, and when not to. The election of Warren Harding as 29th President of the USA is an example of a collective snap decision that proved to be poor. Gladwell uses examples of many experiments, yet these do not detract from the overall narrative.There are a number of research techniques that are described, yet these are introduced in sufficient detail as to keep the overall interest of the reader. The variety of the knowledge touched upon is breathtaking, so it is a mixture of research, interspersed with little anecdotes, which work very well. The reader is sometimes left wondering how the rest of the story finishes, but that is a comment rather than a criticism.One of the series of anecdotes relates to the previously unknown prejudice in selecting personnel for orchestras. This only became apparent when auditions when the performers were unseen by the adjudicators became the norm. Gladwell uses this to illustrate that snap decisions sometimes use clues that are unknown and unhelpful.Thinking about thinking reminds me of the centipede, which when asked how he manages to walk, no longer can. So it is with people thinking. Take the story of how some people think, and use it to avoid possible pitfalls. Read the book, but keep on thinking. Take from it the notion of `Thin Slicing', so that you can realise when snap decisions can be an advantage. Look at the expressions on faces (learn to `mind read'), and if your heart rate is significantly raised, be very careful what you do.Peter Morgan (morganp@supanet.com)",
            "This book is AMAZING; right along with all of Malcolm Gladwell's other books! In fact, this book inspired me to look more deeply into a couple of the studies Gladwell reveals.

            "Blink is a \" must read \" about the power and accuracy of our first impressions and intuitions about people and events. Malcolm Gladwell skillfully presents several case studies that inspire me to recognize my own intuitive talent and also to notice my tendencies to dismiss my intuitive knowing in favor of analysis and self-doubt.He cleverly examines stereotyping and predjudice, and demonstrates how this influences and distorts our intuition.As a result of this book, I feel more confident and freer to express myself spontaneously!

            "I picked this up at the library after reading \"Outliers.\" Both were great. Gladwell is a gifted writer and story teller. He's able to tell five stories at once weaving them together to get across one or several points without ever rambling. I found myself reading this for more than 60 minutes at a time without even realizing time had passed. I have become a fan of Gladwell and am anxious to read his other works. I would highly recommend this book for the interested reader. Nothing in it is really ground breaking, but it's the sort of book with a lot of interesting bits of information that make you a little more interesting of a person, a little more aware of your self and others in the world, and give you an enhanced perspective on thinking.",

It just seemed like a compilation of articles and studies. Some of the interviews were pretty interesting... I'd like to know what he thinks and how I can use this in my life to improve my snap judgements. I agree with most of what he said, but it was nothing that I didn't already know.",
            "This is a good read, covering the full range of the power and dangers of first impressions and some of the psychology behind it.The only minor criticisms are that it is very US based, so does not translate into UK English in parts, and it lacks a proper summary at the end to draw all the strands together.",
            "I found that overall, Blink does not work well in Audio CD format. Gladwell uses the same words and expressions and concepts over and over. If I hear the phrase, \"thin slicing\" again, I might scream. It becomes highly repetitive and irritating. In my opinion, he speaks too slowly, and softly, which exacerbates the problem. If one were reading the book, one could skip forward or read more quickly to control this problem, and his voice wouldn't be an issue.As a general comment on the CD--and I assume this applies to the book as well-- I found that Gladwell was not very scientific. And yet, he acts like he is. Numerous assumptions are made when describing the results of certain studies, tests, and situations, and WHY they turned out a particular way. I found myself feeling irritated as the Cd attempted to push me into accepting the explanations proferred by Gladwell or the social 'scientists' whose work he was describing.I also think that ultimately Gladwell does not do a good job of actually pinning down the subject, or providing a very cohesive framework for it. He explores issues of faulty and correct decision making, and the CD provides a lot of food for thought, but if you think you will be able to increase your own decision making powers after listening to this tape, don't bet on it. The stories of how impressions can be accurate or inaccurate --regarding the authenticity of art objects, whether couples divorce, how to determine whether an artist can sell records, New Coke, issues of racial bias, etc.-- are all interesting, but don't leave one with a day to day framework for making decisions in one's everyday life. Generally, one is left with--be an expert, but don't over examine the issue to death or apart from a specific whole, make sure you are being objective, get a quick look at some types of things, but only in certain circumstances, sometimes you can't do a quick review unless you are aware of a key factor, beware of biases like looks and race, etc. Um....I either already knew it, or it's too vague to apply.",

            "Just a short note to mention that while some of the thoughts and stories in the book are pretty interesting, as a whole it is not cohesive and often self contradictory. It's written a bit like a first year term paper. . . all over the place with no direction. Skip it.",
            "Blink is about trascending what we think we know and trusting our inner self. It's about realising that we take our life's most important decisions in an instant, in a blink of an eye.Whenever we meet a new person, in fact, we acknowledge and decide we like or dislike him/her in less than 5 seconds. In that very moment, we are entirely guided by our unconscious and if only did we learn to listen to our purest, most recondite emotions, we would not be so surprised to discover, at a later stage, that what we thought of something or someone was not exactly right.So many of our decisions are driven by the passionate desire to find a feasible solution, a hint, an answer. Yet, the more we dwell into the process of decision-making, the more we risk to make the wrong choice.Blink revolutionises the worldly wisdom that invites people to sleep over a problem before trying and face it. All in all, Malcolm Gladwell invites us not to think... At least, not the way we are used to, but start relying on and embracing the beautiful, infinate possibilities of our mind.",

But here, I was skeptical because I really enjoyed the class I was supposed to read it for. Good thing I was!This book demonstrates the idea that the first little snap judgments we make about things tend to be more accurate than the lengthy analyzations we make, and does it in a non preachy manner (even devoting an entire chapter strictly to its flaws). The chapters are more example-based than textbook-based, meaning that they consist of real people demonstrations (as if news articles are intermixed; was Gladwell a journalist?) of whatever the chapter's topic is. It's quite fascinating.If for nothing else than a reason to reconsider your first thoughts on ANYTHING and learn how they might have been MORE ACCURATE, read this book!",
            "Blink is an amzing book to say the least. Gladwell is able to take years of in-depth research and studies from diverse areas of psychology and sum them up into one umbrella idea.As a recent psychology graduate who actually reads a few journals to keep current on studies it was amazing to find this book. The wealth of science in Blink is \"dumbed down\" enough so that anyone can understand what each study was about; however, it still provides all the key information for the professional to find the study and do further research.Overall the ideas presented in Blick are not etirely new. The thing is they have never been put together in one place. Everything you wanted to know about some of the most complex processes of the brain is put into a novel like thread that is easy for anyone to comprehend and put together but will leave even the ardent professional amazed at the systehsis of ideas.A must read for anyone interested in the human mind!",

But like another reviewer, a friend of mine who read it thought that the book showed you that you need to be an expert before you can \"thin-slice\" otherwise you are relying on faulty intuition.I think your conclusion about \"thin-slicing\" is based on your perceptions of how data can be boiled down to a quick judgement whether you are an expert or not.Absolutely fascinating!",
            "How many people have told you to trust your gut? So many that it probably got annoying after a while, especially when you had to make a very important decision and thought your gut was unreliable. This book explains when to trust your gut and when not to. It's fascinating and Malcolm Gladwell does a great job of weaving fun and relevant examples into the text in order to make his point. The only problem with it is that, just as you are convinced that your gut is your therapist, best friend and the greatest advice-giver ever, you read the final few chapters of the book that warn about trusting your gut when you are biased or have a prior experience that throws your gut off and skews your decision-making ability. This can be confusing and might leave some people back at square one asking - is my gut right or is it biased and therefore unreliable? Still, it's worth reading. It's way better than the book that came after it - THINK. You must give this book to every slow decision-maker in your life. They'll thank you for it.",
            "This book is very enjoyable and explains how we subconsciously \"think\" and react. It shows that some subconscious processes with a \"thin slice\" of data are more accurate than if done consciously with more data! Of course there is a dark side to \"thin slicing\" which is when it prejudges based on society's rules/actions. That is why he emphasizes that it takes practice to harness this power.",
            "If you ever wondered about the common people who can tell you the truth of an event with in a fraction of second and it is true, If so, This is a book for you. No Majic or any rocket sceince. A systematic scientic principles of with a little help of sub conscious which can be cultivated with some dedication. Author is wonderfully analyzed cases from wide range of areas from medicine, gambling , food industry and even sales industry with great clarity. Great Book.",
            "after reading this book, i was much more aware of facial expressions and subtleties of movement, and much more trusting of first impressions and intuitions. i have a background in western philosophy, and i've been taught that (from the platonic tradition) feelings are not to be trusted without careful examination. this book gave examples of instances in which feelings outpreform careful examination, and even that careful examination can lead a person astray. this was a radically new idea for me - or at least the evidence pointed to a radically new conclusion than i'd thought. it was highly enjoyable, and sparked good discussion with a friend who was also reading the book.after reading this book, i started going to play \"the village\", which is a role-playing game like mafia. it's a game played with a group of 8 or more people, and one or two of these is randomly assigned to be a \"werewolf\". noone but the werewolf knows her status, and the group is trying to figure out who it is. it's a really fun game!i found that i was more in touch with my intuition, and found that if i paid attention to people and listened carefully, i would get an idea of who the werewolf is - my first instinct was usually right.the reason it gets 4 stars and not 5 is because i think it has a bit of a pro-market, pro-consumption perspective. since i read it a few months ago, i can't remember exactly where that bias is, but i was left with it. i also recall that some of the experiments that the book describes seem to have little flaws. for example i remember one gambling experiment with different colored chips or cards, and the conclusion was that the people knew subconsciously that one color led to good results (tested by monetering heart rate, blood pressure, etc), and the other to bad results. what the experiment leaves out is that maybe one color is more appealing than the other, and this is the cause of the difference in response, or maybe one color was always put on the right hand side, etc... anyway, the experiement could have been done switching up the \"desirable color\", but this wasn't mentioned or addressed in the book.",
            "This book reinforced some views that seem to be common sense, but it's nice to see some science behind it. The people in the world who are the best at what they do, often can't tell you why they do things they way they do...it just comes naturally.I've been able to use some of the concepts here at my workplace to be mroe efficient. Good stuff.",
            "After his earlier success with The Tipping Point, there must have been some pressure on this author to come up with another brilliant theory \"on the cutting edge of neuroscience and psychology\" (the dust jacket proclaims). Problem is, it isn't so easy to be so refreshing and revolutionary on schedule for publishing a new book every few years. But then, relatively few authors have the resources of a staff writer for the NY Times.Malcolm Gladwell has compiled a lot of anecdotes together in a book about \"the power of thinking without thinking\", i.e. \"thin-slicing\". Simply, the first two seconds of our decision-making process is largely subconscious and is when we filter the information we need to make snap judgements. He enriches this premise by including a wealth of case studies from various fields; a military campaign, art historians at the Getty museum, political coups, relationship psychology, car salesman, police. It makes for an entertaining read.There are two problems with Blink as I see it. First, thin-slicing is easily recognizable as a repackaged version of temperament theory described by Myers-Briggs as Intuition. Everybody has some degree or another of Intuition, but some are born with greater natural tendencies to be Intuitive - and it's really not something that can be learned or honed. There seems to be a hint of purpose when Gladwell describes one psychologist's detailed method of analyzing videotapes of faces, but such a laborious process is the antithesis of intuition. You really can't teach this instinct.Secondly, Blink really stretches points about how all its anecdotes connect to form this thin-slicing theory. It fails to clearly define and investigate thin-slicing/intuition, barely scratching the surface of the phenomenon and even muddling the picture at times with examples of when thin-slicing fails us, without getting to the heart of why. Interesting enough, but it doesn't hold together well.I really gave Blink 3 stars based on its efforts to be new and original as a theory of psychology and/or sociology. The long rambling stories interspersed throughout were absorbing and earned it an extra star for entertainment value. Nice Effort.-Andrea, aka Merribelle",
            "Great Book! A \"blink\" of a read but full of valuable insights.Gladwell's anecdotes were sometimes quirky and at the same time serious. Great tool for those wanting to refine their own decision making skills.",
            "A series of interesting anecdotes create an enjoyable, effort-free and disposable read. Gladwell shares other people's hard work and hard-won insights, but by the time it gets to us it's conversation-piece material.The stories themselves are interesting and well-told. The case of the ghastly series of errors of police officers and a man standing on his stoop was expecially compelling.",
            "perfict for the beginner and a great investment .That is all I have to say about this book right now",
            "well written, and informational. hopefully, i can train myself to be able to &#34;thinly slice&#34; and make good use of this in my profession, Law Enforcement.",
            "Like The Tippng Point, Blink presents an interesting perspective on the movers and shakers in today's society. The book is fun reading, but it is definitely more pop psychology than hard scientific fact. Malcolm Gladwell is a good writer and will keep your attention throughout the book.",
            "Take a visual, aural, or other sensory \"thin slice\" of what's happening around you, within you, or in proximity to someone else, instead of digging into a deep history or obsessively evaluating every angle possible in multiple ways for an example of implicit, unconscious, rapid cognition or snap judgments that help make decisions in a 20-second (or less then) \"blink.\" Malcolm Gladwell's famous book about \"The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\" includes case studies related to police practice, medical protocol, choosing and hiring symphony orchestra musicians, and a few more. It's a little long on detail and a little thicker than necessary, yet provides that helpful nudge most of us need to get back to trusting our own instincts and initial gut reactions to decisions about our own futures, people we've just met, large /small purchase decisions and anything else that presents us with either / or, one of many choices. Now that I've finished reading \"blink,\" I need to add Gladwell's \"The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference\" to my reading list.",
            "This book is well written and easy to read. There are lots of great anecdotes and interesting observations to convey the books main ideas:* sometimes immediate, unconsidered thoughts are better than reasoned ones* sometimes they are not* experts can become very good at instant thinkingHowever, it doesn't go much beyond this in terms of insight into the nature of thinking and judgement. As a consequence, it is a bit repetitive and long winded.If you want to improve your own thinking, or even to understand what is happening when people make good snap judgements, this book will not be much help. I learned more in the first 10 pages ofThinking, Fast and Slowby Daniel Kahneman which is not as entertaining or easy to read, but has a wealth of insight based on years of research.",
            "Great product, the service was right on time and I greatly appreciated how the product was as it was advertised",
            "Although a bit repetitive and possibly over worked I really enjoyed this book, I couldn't put it down. Some of the criticism has been about the repeated theme of the book which I'll admit is there but I found his examples and stories he shared to be what I loved about the book. I highly recommend this book especially to those who have an interest in psychology.",
            "Great book! Really helps to explain why we make those quick decisions and what we can do to make them better.",
            "We had to read this book for my psychology class and I'm glad we did. Some of the book does seem to have a lot of fluff and speculation but the effects that are talked about are very interesting and make the book a worthwhile read.",
            "Very easy to get into, this book refers to many different type of studies and their applications to real life to make us understand where we get our first impressions from and how they can lead us astray - or not. Chosen examples are very interesting, picking into all different aspects of life (commercial, behavioural, strategical etc) and they illustrate very well how results of studies can be applied to our own life.I personally liked very much the part that illustrate how too much information can be an obstacle rather than a support to make quick efficient decisions.",
            "I really love a good story, and the stories in this book were fascinating, especially since you weren't sure where each one was going. So much food for thought-- you may just read it in a few days, but spend weeks thinking about it (or telling your husband about it over and over...). Great!",
            "There's not much substance to this book. Rather than being a resource of information, it is merely a book of examples. There is no broad takeaway you can gather from it after reading except to say perhaps that many of our decisions are based on split-second thoughts. But did you really need to read this book to find that out?",
            "This book could probably be anywhere from a 1/3rd to a 1/4th as big as it is; if not a pamphlet. Maybe the 2d star I gave it is too altruistic. But I will credit it with a few good points.For what it purports to write about, it's WAY WAY too heavily larded down with minutiae and details to the point of the reader starting to doze off, break concentration from Gladwell's aggregate point, or both. Gladwell really needs to take a course on/in brevity.As much as I tried to give it a chance in spite of what the coverflap said of who the author's written for, I can understand why he writes for them and why they hired him.Definitely near the bottom of my list of recommends.",
            "I've loved reading Malcolm Gladwell's writing in the New Yorker for years. Standouts include \"Clicks and Mortar\" about internet shopping and \"Big and Bad\" about SUVs. In his usual fashion, BLINK draws from a broad range of sources and studies to help us understand the world we live in and our own role within it. I suggest you buy this book and keep it on your nightstand. Read it little by little and allow the chapters to sink in slowly. If you're like me, you'll be amazed at what you begin to observe in your daily life. Gladwell's gift is not so much inventing new ideas, but rather in putting ideas together and allowing us to see what was there all along.",
            "I bought this book because the introductory story about the Statue That Didn't Look Right fasinated me.The author's propositions are that:1. Decisions made very quickly can be as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.2. Our unconscious is a powerful force.3. Our snap judgements and first impressions can be educated and control.This book was organized in such a way that the rest of the chapters after the introduction were devoted to proving that the three propositions really work. Psychological tests and theories, including the \"thin slicing\", were brought in to support them.But can I rely on my instinct every time I make a decision? NO!! According to the author, snap decision can turn out to be wrong as well.So what I gained from reading this book was almost nothing. The book stops short of telling me how to harness my snap decisions so that they are right most of the time. And that is no surpise. I don't expect anyone can tell me that.Is it entertaining to read? Only the Introduction is. The rest, that is devoted on psychological stuff, is boring.",
            "Fantastic - a clear, concise view of how part of our mind and perception works. One of the top twenty non-fiction, insight/personal development books I have ever read.",
            "Gladwell's Blink offers some interesting ancedotes about rapid decision making. He offers a few cautions as well, but the tone of the book implies that rapid decisions are more trustworthy than considered reflection.While there is some discussion of marketing manipulations and stereotyping, I was hoping for more discussion of the tricks the mind plays on one -- heuristics that lead to reasoning errors, confirmation bias, and the large numbers of eyewitness ID errors among the DNA exoneration cases.While the book is thought provoking, it may be better read in combination with material on the perils of reflexive decision making.",
            "Hey Malcolm, way to go! great book! couldn't put it down.. and it's not too often i say that about a non fiction book!.. you've got some interesting phrases - ways of putting together words unique to you that put smiles on my face... okay this is one i can recommend to all those stodgy left brainer-do it by the book people i work with, though i have no idea if they will \"get it\" after reading it or no..... I'm one of those intuitive people that 'gets stuff' but cannot explain why i 'just know' to others.. such a delight to read your book.. thank you!! :)",
            "Fascinating read. The concept is presented through easy-to-read, engaging stories on a wide range of topics from marriage to war strategy to art. The author presents both the benefits and pitfalls of our unconscious reactions in relation to decision making.",
            "I gave it four stars because I did like the book - but it can be a little tedious to read. As previous reviews have stated, each chapter does have a theme - but the theme is usually a mere framework for a set of results from an experiment, incident or story, some of which are a little boring.When you review everything you have read at the end of the book, you realize that the point each chapter makes does feed into a bigger overall understanding of how split second decisions are made and how much our subconscious is in control when we just get a \"feeling\" about something immediately. Then it examines how other elements can affect the accuracy of the split second decision.Overall, I think this was a good read.",
            "There's very little substance here. The basic idea is laid out in the early chapters and most of the rest of the book are anecdotal examples. It is interesting and well-written, however; even if a rather superficial. Keep in mind also: the author has no credentials in psychology, neurobiology, or any other science. I believe he's a journalist.Overall, \"Blink\" is pretty lightweight stuff: good if you're stuck on a plane or need easy bed-time reading. Not for the serious reader, thought.Not recommended.",
            "The premise behind this book is to enable/train the reader to learn how to \"thin slice\" a person or situation and gain \"instant knowledge\" with very little input. The author goes on and on about various examples of how many people were able to do this. However, that's not exactly what is going on. In the first example, he uses a story about a statue that one muesuem bought that turned out to be a fake. Several experts were able to just look at the statue and get a \"feeling\" or a \"strong sense\" that it was a fake. They couldn't explain how they knew, they just knew. This is what the author wants you to be able to tap into.The reason that these experts were able to do that is because they are EXPERTS! The know what to look for instinctively. It's like an inspector examining something in their off time. They know what to look for. I have a friend who loves movies. He really enjoys pointing out the dot in the upper right corner of a movie. He tells me that they come in pairs all the time. Guess what....he is in the movie production industry. That is how he knows.Chapter 5 is more than thin slicing. It is more along the lines of thick slicing. It totally goes against the whole premise of the book. Why would an author stick something in there that doesn't support his basic idea?The nice part is that this book leads the reader to real material. You can look up the refereneces for some real reading. The author mentions Dr. Paul Ekman. Great stuff there!Also, the book is a very easy read. It is a fun read. It gives enough information that you feel like you did read something, but it is definitely nothing that I would reference in real work.",
            "If you want to be enlightened or entertained by this book like I did, you will be sadly disappointed. According to Malcolm, we must strive to rid ourselves of the horrible limiting stereotypes we have of African Americans and females, etc. However, while it is important that we do that, it is still okay to stereotype individuals experiencing Autism. In fact, he shares a few based on one study with one individual experiencing autism and expects the reader to be as ignorant of the subject as he is.",
            "I didn't finish blink, made it two-thirds of the way through. The whole premise is stupid to me, and the most bothersome part is that while the author tosses around buzz terms like thin slicing and this so-called built in ability to laser through the troublesome act of actually reflecting on a comprehensive picture, he never really touches on the fact that 9 out of 10 of his examples are the result of expert ability based on 20+ years of dedication to the respective discipline, or riding on the shoulders of the equally applied efforts of someone else. And what really bothers me is how many people flock to this *&% as this wonderful new way of thinking. I made it as far as I did because the anecdotes are entertaining, but c'mon gimme a break, and jeesh.",
            "I had to read this for an MBA course, strange as it may sound for someone going for an advanced degree in business, I've always been into philosophy and religion. Though it has a ting of new-age-iness to it, it really is both an informative and fun read. I really did get alot out of it, I don't know that it caused any sea change in my belief system, but it made me think and more open..",
            "there appears to be two major ways of reading: by topic, by author.this book made me want to read the other things this author has written.it is about thin-slicing. a study on the mostly unconscious first few seconds of a decision. both the good things about it and those times that it fails.a quick and very well written book. recommended.",
            "As always, Gladwell's a fast and rewarding read. The first 20 pages are absolutely essential to anyone who makes decisions. The rest of the book is for those who need to make them well, defend them, and live with the consequences.",
            "The people who reviewed this book poorly may not have to deal with race issues. Even though I'm Navajo, Gladwell makes some astute humanitarian and race observations that have whirled around in my head for years. He makes affirmations about my theories of race and our denials of our repressed feelings. I did the test of associating good with African American image, and I even struggled with it. I liked Gladwell's honest approach.He also exhibits a great writing style. Though I read Blink several weeks ago, I'm still talking about it. My gushing comments inspired friends to buy the book for friends, spouses, and even themselves. Get this, I broked away from my gym workout to discuss Blink with a friend. Since I take my gym seriously, this is an all time new one. I've lent my copy out, and when I get it back, I want to explore the researchers of classifying facial expressions. In the meantime, I'll get Tipping Point.Thank you, Malcolm, for your work. It's great to find an author who sees the world as I do. We must find avenues to get along without the superficial talk and denial. I'll write again if I mimic my reaction at the gym after reading Tipping Point.",
            "i almost did not read this book because of its title.. \"the power of thinking without thinking\" implied that its a sappy self help book that tells you how to think .. i don't like books telling me how to think..only my wife gets to do that...but i thought i'd give it a shot seeying as i really liked his other book \"the tipping point\" .. it might have not been as good as the tipping point but it is very stimulating.. i don wanna give away the idea .. i'm sure the book jacket does that perfectly .. its about rapid cognition and the power of te subconsious .. i think the book's point was self contradicting at time and i completely did not like the last couple of chapters.. i would definately recommend it to anyone .. i give it 4.5/5",
            "Ok I read the other book - Tipping Point and said I wasted my time so why did I read this one? Good question! In the end I was trying to figure out if my sometime \"Shoot from the hip\" method of decision making I use when under pressure is flawed or not. In the end Malcolm tells us in some situations yes it is perfectly reasonable to make a decision in a \"blink\" but in others more than \"one blink\" is necessary. Gee thanks for the insight.The best thing about the book it gave me renewed confidence in making quick decisive decisions. That in fact, there are many things that make up our decision making thought process and sometimes it's not possible to explain your answer. In other cases it would take a team of people weeks to prove your \"blink\" decision.",
            "This book is very engrossing, and although it is a relatively small book, it leaves a very broad impact.Essentially Gladwel talks about how first impressions are both spectacularly dead-on for experts practising their expertise, and spectacularly prejudiced for just about any layperson. Depressing as that sounds, it is a real oy to observe Gladwell's examples. They don't seem too interesitng, but boy are they ever.I'm very non-linear in thinking, so I enjoyed the affirmations from Gladwell's very interesting argument. He must have been driven nearly mad with passion for this topic, as the writing leaps off the page in the most glowing way!I heartily recommend this book.",
            "I highly recommend this book to everyone. VERY well written. Sometimes individuals (and groups) make decisions that are beneficial, but sometimes destructive. The author presents simply fascinating insight into why /how individuals (and groups) make decisions \"in the blink of an eye\". While that may not sound very interesting on the surface, I assure you that the way it is presented /written by Gladwell, you will enjoy every page of this book. Not only will you enjoy it, you'll learn a lot about yourself and human nature. I read it in one sitting - simply couldn't put it down!",
            "\"Blink\" is a fun book that provides an exploration into our first impressions. Of particular interest is how certain individuals can make correct, decisive, rapid fire decisions under conditions of high pressure and limited information. Gladwell explores how we reach these conclusions using our conscious - a logical and definitive path - and our subconscious - the adaptive path.\"Blink\" not only explores the positive outcomes of the quick decision (at a glance) but also those decisions where our subconscious (instincts) betray us.This power of knowing, the subject at hand, is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few but an ability we can all cultivate for ourselves. Gladwell discusses how it affects our relationships, our impressions of people, and how we evaluate circumstances that we face - both the familiar and the strange.You now have enough information, although limited, - in a blink - to make a decision on whether or not this book is for you...",
            "I tend to agree with the reviewer, Loyd Eskildson, about this book. In essence, I have not gotten more than a couple of new ideas from this book, the rest are commonsense. Of course, your thin slices will get more accurate if you have more experiences and in depth knowledge of the area you're thin slicing. Hmmm ... tell me something new ...",
            "I really enjoyed this book. Gladwell is a wonderful researcher and communicator. However, if I did not have the context of William Duggan's works--namely, \"Napolean's Glance\" and \"The Art Of What Works: How Success Really Happens\"--I would not have appreciated Gladwell's contribution in this field of expert intuition.Duggan is a professor of strategy and also a consultant to, um, consumers of strategic thinking working in the U.S. government. It seems that some of the less satisfied reviewers of \"Blink\" would appreciate the supplementary information from Duggan's work.",
            "still a really, really intriguing book. gladwell does not disappoint.",
            "Whether one agrees about his underlying motives for writing two top-notch best-sellers or Not--You reviewers, please give this fellow, Malcolm GLADwell his due rewards. I am an Intuitive and equally a Feeling and Thinking person. It seems he uses for his examples the works of a wide divergence of scientific study! For me his unique style soars with his Five Point Inventory and longest Chapter: \"Paul Van Riper's Big Victory!\"This is especially true in \"Perils of Introspection\" followed by two Insight Puzzles. Becoming the assumed professor in, \"Primed For Action\" he describes a simple test to affect one's behavior! As Prison Chaplain, we sought ways to discover how we may affect Inmates' behavior while in prison. Later the author draws upon the Power of Imagination to picture the faces of Marilyn Monroe and Albert Einstein! Closely related is an appropriate story of Silvan Tompkins and Paul Ekman who became effective in reading the faces of Bill Clinton. They perceived him as Peck's Bad Boy, who wanted to be caught with his hand in the cookie-jar.Ironically they were right! This is one \"layered story\" as Fred Craddock, tops in his field of Preaching, teaches his Theology students about Parables. Chapter 5 \"Kenna's Dilemma\" gets unique stories on taking \"A Second Look at First Impressions.\" Added to President Clinton, we see the inside of Coca-Cola's contest with Pepsi, the testing of new products from Christian Brothers in, \"The Chair of Death,\" in foods, Automobiles as Ford's Edsel and Columia records signing of Kenna to produce his recording of the \"New Sacred Cow.\"Finally I came to his Conclusion: \"Listening with your Eyes\" and his involved story of the professional Trombonist, named Abbie Conant, I was really Hooked. Having scored with Bill Clinton and Dick Morris as the ideal political pollster, I looked at all of Gladwell's stories of reading person's faces and emotions in their responses-- Now I am convinced!A \"first impressionist\" has enough going for my five stars and more. My accolades to my other reader friends! Hooray for this BLINK and his First THINK! Retired Chaplain (to those who cannot do Either) Fred W Hood",
            "I am prone to mishaps--self-imposed mishaps. So, what's new about that? Aren't we all? Snap Judjment Syndrome seems to be a far-reaching disease, affecting at least half the population. ##### How about the other half? Yes, it seems to be split out. On what I consider to be major matters I flip to the other extreme, giving in to inferential analysis. I can close my eyes and see a bulletin board full of little thumb-tacked notes to myself, each adding or subtracting something from what I should or should not be doing. ##### This book seems to fill a void of sorts--pulling the extremes together. It teaches how to avoid such everyday dogma as leaps of faith, marshalling flashbacks without selectively sanitized nostalgia, awaiting last-minute arrival of the cavalry. ##### Overall, Gladwell's admonitions are cogent, and yes, with practice, I would think, applicable. I only wish he'd delved more deeply into the procrastination side of the \"think\" problem, the only slight \"short side\" of an otherwise splendid book.",
            "Malcolm Gladwell has posed an interesting question, \"How do you know what you know you know?\" And if that sounds confusing, then buy the book. Why do we trust brand labels? How deep do our stereotypes go? Why do we change our mind on what characteristics our ideal mate has once we meet someone we like? This book won't tell you how to think, it will make you examine your snap judgements and challenge HOW you know things.Highly recommended!",
            "It's remarkable to realize that this book represents the life work of many brilliant researchers, most of whom we would never know except for this book. Malcolm Gladwell has taken decades and volumes of highly technical research and turned it into what will surely be a best seller. He has made these concepts accessible to the average reader and anyone can see almost instantly how it applies to every day situations we all encounter. It's beautifully written, succinct and crafted so as not to intimidate.I was riveted from start to finish. I have been married and divorced twice now, yet I chose a stray dog at a pet adoption day in less than 5 minutes and was absolutely certain of the decision. My dog is the most wonderful companion one could ask for. This book explains how this can and does happen - even to those of us who consider ourselves educated, reasonable and experienced. I would highly recommend it.",
            "much of this book is about psychological and scientific studies i found very compelling. The focus is on whether first impressions, educated guesses, quick intuitive thinking, etc. are accurate, and how they can be used to enhance our lives via medical/scientific research. Examples and stories are used frequently to illustrate the value of this knowledge in human services, business, and many other areas. The Author uses some technical jargon but i did not have difficulty following him; however, i am in the medical field and am also very interested in medical, social, and psychological research.",
            "This book is even better than Tipping Point, Gladwell's prior book. It's got lots of factual stories, research and anecdotes that make it interesting. It'll surely make you think -- and think about how you're thinking. You'll have plenty of tidbits for dinner party conversations after you read this one.",
            "Everyday, we make a seemingly infinite amount of choices, conscious or unconscious, which have direct implications on our present and future well-being. The ability to make effective snap judgments, however, is not a gift that is bestowed upon all in equal shares.In \"blink,\" Malcolm Gladwell illustrates the decision-making process behind this phenomenon, explaining how human beings make those instant assessments and actions that can sometimes have all too serious consequences. Providing catchy case studies involving experts in everything from marketing to military strategy, Gladwell guides us along a journey of discovery as we come to better comprehend the importance (and mechanics) of the brain's role in processing information that it is abruptly presented with before formulating an immediate response ---all in the time span of milliseconds---.While there are fascinating points brought up in every chapter of \"blink,\" Gladwell ultimately emphasizes that an effective, brief assessment may be more valuable than long periods of analysis spent filling our minds with unnecessary bits of information that can do more harm than good. Often times, there isn't even the opportunity to analyze as we must react off of pure instinct and hope that we made the right decision afterwards.Read \"blink.\" It will change the way you think about thinking.",
            "When things go wrong in our lives including situations or events that we wish had not happened, whether it is at work or in our personal lives, the first instinct is to place the blame on someone else rather than focus on the possible solutions that may lie within us. This urge to judge the actions of others (sometimes for a split second and sometimes for much longer) often succumbs to the instinct of putting the blame on the visible differences including race or ethnicity or religious beliefs. For the majority of times we as mortal human beings don't even realize that we have hurt someone emotionally unless our cruel behavior is pointed out to us. And it is less often that our conscience turns inwards and holds itself accountable without being provoked. This initial emotion set forth at the blink of an eye is nothing short of ignorance which then leads to doubt and sometimes to fear and aggression. It is wise to have such an outlook: if things go bad in our lives we should first look inwards rather than being a slave to the \"blink\" instinct and if things are turning out for better then we should look outwards first. This way we can all keep our egos in check, prevent becoming a victim to the disease of conceit and also be able to provide our spiritual self with the right conditions for inculcating the values of compassion and love and forgiveness and do our part in making this world a better place to live in. At the same time if we make mistakes that have hurt others we should also take the opportunity to apologize for our callousness and sincerely hope that the apology will be accepted, just as is the intention right now. This brings closure for all people concerned and is the only way towards lasing peace and friendship. In contrast to common belief that for worldly success both in our careers and in personal lives we have to be cunning and ever suspicious of the intentions of others, one could argue just the opposite - things will happen the way they are intended to happen and carrying the burden of negative feelings towards others just makes it less likely that we will be in the best position to play the cards that we are dealt with in our lives such that we do what is right not only for ourselves but also for others.",
            "This isn't your standard nonfic book, but i drew a lot of knowledge from it. It provides an interesting way to destress and look at the world from a new perspective, which is always welcome.",
            "If you're an expert in the field(s) (or fancy yourself one - God knows there are a lot of you nowadays) discussed in this book, then, yes, I agree, you should stay away from it. I highly doubt that Blink says anything you aren't already an expert on (or fancy yourself an expert on) - there is a difference, btw.However, if you've never really considered, in any thoughtful or considered way, about the power of the gut feel, then I highly recommend this book.Don't get me wrong, this book is by no means the be all or end all on the topic. That having been said, it's a great (and easily readable) starting point from which to begin a systematic exploration of the topic, and for a title such as this (i.e. one that aims for a broader audience) that's all you can reasonably (or have a right to) expect.You want dense science and pages and pages of discussion concerning hypothesis, methodology and findings, read Scientific American or Nature. Leave us ordinary folks who're just looking for a basic appreciation of the topic alone and get off your scientific high horse danm it!",
            "Gladwell's capacity to find the story buried in arcane science journals and to then make it accessible, eminently useful and compelling to the general reader scores again. His wonderful first book \"The Tipping Point\" changed the language of marketing. \"Blink\" will change the world.",
            "Blink is just as well written as The Tipping Point, but doesn't deal with as relevant a subject matter.That said, I read it in one evening.",
            "I loved the Tipping Point and had to see what Malcom's latest book was about. Wow. I'm just blown away by the information in this book and the insight into why our first impressions are right sometimes and wrong other times. I highly recommend this book.",
            "I really wanted to like this book before reading it. I had heard so much about it and though perhaps it had potential, but alas, no. It was just horrible. I don't really have anything good to say about it. I just can't believe it's garnered as much media time as it has. Don't waste your time on this book.",
            "Although I was able to power through this enjoyable book in a few short sittings, it left me a little disappointed. Blink's subject matter of our brain's powerful capability to make split-second decisions is thought provoking, but I found some of the treatments a little shallow. The book feels like Gladwell found an introductory college cognitive psychology text and decided to write a 250-page magazine article about its most interesting bits. Despite its shallowness, this is engaging and enjoyable soft non-fiction. A perfect beach or vacation read!",
            "Blink by Malcolm Gladwell is a riveting look at rapid cognition, or our natural ability to form snap judgments. Gladwell compiles an assortment of compelling examples of how we use our rapid cognition-sometimes for better, sometimes for worse-to make split decisions.Meet a psychologist who can predict with 95% accuracy whether a couple will still be married 15 years later by observing them for only one hour. Find out how researchers can tell which doctors will get sued and which won't after only observing 40 seconds of a conversation between doctor and patient. Meet the art historians and scholars who were able to spot an art forgery in seconds after science had \"proven\" it was authentic.This ability to discern a great deal from a limited amount of information is known as thin-slicing.As fascinating as the examples in the book are, what I found most interesting is what it teaches us about our snap judgments. Sometimes they go right (a firefighter who gets his men out of a building seconds before the floor collapses), and sometimes they go wrong (as in the case of the police officers who shot Amadou Diallo, an unarmed man). Why?More experience, not more information, seems to be the key. Experience educates our snap judgments, and experience helps eliminate the snap judgments that are behind unconscious prejudice, what Gladwell calls \"the dark side of rapid cognition.\" Through experience we identify signatures that allow us to make accurate evaluations in a short time. Information, especially as we compile more and more of it, tends to obscure these signatures and leads to less accurate evaluations. In many cases, this seems to contradict common sense, but the evidence in Blink is undeniable.Ultimately, the book's message is to respect our powers of rapid cognition, to recognize the times thin-slicing serves us and the times it leads us astray. But more than that. Rapid cognition doesn't need to be a mystery and we victims of it's whim. We can educate our snap judgments, and thereby learn to control them.2005 Curtis G. Schmitt / TurnOnToLife.com",
            "This is the first book I've read by Gladwell. I heard about the book on NPR and it sounded fascinating. If you've ever found yourself making a remarkable snap judgement in a stressful (or otherwise) situation, and wondered to yourself \"How did I know to do that?\", then this is the book to read. At 254 pages, it's a moderately short read that will keep you coming back for more. I didn't miss a single day of reading and managed to finisht he book in less than a week, which--for me--is fast.The book basically consists of 6 chapters in which Malcolm explores different facets of our unconscious mind. From art experts to orchestra auditions to police mishaps to military strategy to taste-testing, he certainly explores many different facets of instinctual reactions. Each chapter is divided into manageable, numbered, sub-sections that I really appreciated.I gave it 4 stars rather than five because it didn't make me say \"wow\" when I was finished. Not to say that I didn't enjoy, it just wasn't anything superbly profound that I hadn't thought about before. I would definitely recommend that if you've already got a mind to try this book out, you should. I wouldn't, however, recommend it to everyone I meet. All in all an interesting learning experience with a touch of entertainment value.",
            "The author treats us to a rehash of things already written several times (one original,the others ' followers').Why then the bestseller status? Well,who knows,maybe some have short memories,or don't read anything until it is on some list.not worth the money and time.",
            "I really enjoyed the book, both from a business (I own a Web site development business) and a personal perspective. The book gives the reader some keen insights as to the important nuances and peculiarities of our minds that are evident all the time. I was very impressed with how extensive the research was and how well orchestrated the content was. Gladwell's obvious writing talent allows him to smoothly weave an argument/narrative together the same way Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld used to write episodes of Seinfeld.I think that those who have been critical of this book have mistaken Gladwell's intention. He hasn't set out to establish definitive scientific theory. Instead, he's tried to give us several important glimpses of how our minds function and left the application to us. In this respect, I feel, the book is extremely worthwhile.",
            "What made The Tipping Point a wonderful book is back on display in Blink. At the same time, what made it unsatisfying is too. Gladwell is a gifted writer whose sentences have the straightforward brilliance of E. B. White's or Calvin Trillin's. He has a generous, curious spirit. He loves understanding why people do what they do. It's as if he goes through life with his notebook open, genuinely eager to learn about the people he meets. The stories that he tells in Blink are fascinating. The way, for instance, that little clues can tip off the careful observer that two newlyweds have a very high likelihood of divorce. And did I mention that he writes like an angel? But Blink is frustrating in much the same way that The Tipping Point is. Gladwell doesn't tie up all his stories into a clean thesis. Are snap judgments good or bad? Can anybody learn to do them, or just trained experts? Well? Most of the people who bought The Tipping Point were looking for a how-to book that would show them how to create tipping points for their own businesses. Unfortunately for them, that's not what Gladwell was trying to do. He's a great writer, whose m&eacute;tier is reporting.",
            "I would agree with several other reviewers of this book. After a while, the book becomes very repetitive and states the obvious. Yes, we clearly all make snap decisions and no, most of us don't analyze why we like jam for 15 minutes. In the beginning, its alluring to read about John Gottman's experiments and how he can predict whether a couple will divorce or stay together.He goes on from there to indicate the process of reading emotive expressions, but never ties back to how we should interpret/digest his examples. There seems to be lacking a definitive message in the book, suggestion, and practicality of whether we should go with intuition vs logic. He points out that male/female attraction is often inexplicable, contains the X factor and is not grounded in logic of what we \"say\" we want in a person. He never goes on to address how much weight we should give the X factor....have our minds become so highly tuned that it has integrated our deepest linear/logical thoughts as well as our non-linear feeling based wants/desires/needs and hence provides us with the X factor, or do we really need to discount the X factor to phermones and go back to what we logically want?How do we cognitively change unconscious emotions that in a blink of an eye, are expressed on our faces that as he points out, lead to either desirable or undesirable outcomes, and how much do we really need to change/hone this? Where's the point of the book?",
            "This is a very entertaining and enlightning book. The author introduces the concept of \"thin slicing\". Which is basically how people extract information about others and about situations from a minimum amount of information. It is the analysis of our first impressions and their value in our lives.The book analyses how people use this skill, when they are more likely to be successful in interpretation, when the ability is overshadowed by other circumstances, or when the skill shuts down completely.The reason why I give the book 4 stars is that the author did not make a very clear argument as to when can we trust our impressions and when not. For instance, there are long discussions about how experts are more likely to see the \"picture\" instanteneously for what it is. But then, the beginning of the book tells stories about lay people making good quick assessment on people's personalities based on their rooms alone. So do we have to become experts first, or can we trust our instinct now and then? That could be made a bit more clear.As to the writing style, in addition to being versed in various aspects of psychology, the author is an excellent story teller. The book is full of lively anecdotes and examples from life, news, history etc... The book also has a cohesive structure, with stories told in earlier chapters brought back again as the book progresses so we can gain a deeper insight into the workings of the mind.The bottom line is the book is great entertainment. It's a page-turner where you care about the people in the anecdotes and about the message of the book in general. Plus, after reading it you will feel that you learned something new about yourself and those around you.",
            "In his latest bestseller, Malcolm Gladwell examines how human beings often make critical choices in a fraction of a second. Sometimes judgments made on very little evidence are far more accurate than those based on volumes of data. What are the consequences of our snap decisions? Anyone interested in marketing and human behavior will be fascinated by this book.In his first book, The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference, Malcolm Gladwell examined why change so often happens as quickly and as unexpectedly as it does. His insights help make sense out of sudden social change.Our intuitions, as humans, aren't always very good, he says. Changes that happen really suddenly, on the strength of the most minor input, can be deeply confusing.Now, in Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, Gladwell furthers his exploration of fast moving ideas, this time focusing on how individuals can make almost instantaneous decisions based on very sketchy evidence. Or what seems like little evidence.Actually, relying on a gut feeling, and making a decision in the blink of an eye, is actually drawing on your lifetime of experience and jumping to a conclusion after synthesizing very little of the current evidence. If you do this well, Gladwell says you are \"thin slicing,\" or making a judgment based on a very small amount of data.When this works well, your snap decisions are accurate and insightful. Such decisions save time and money and can even eliminate the agony of human heartbreak. However, in most cases, the decision maker can't explain why or how she makes an instantaneous decision.In Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, Gladwell helps us understand the why and how.&lt;ul>&lt;li> Why one doctor is more likely than another to be sued for malpractice than another doctors of equal technical competence.&lt;li> How an expert psychologist can watch a newly married couple interact for only 15 minutes and predict, with surprising accuracy, whether they will still be married in 15 years.&lt;li> How political operatives can influence our vote by running candidates that we are predisposed to elect, despite their incompetence.&lt;li> Why and how a rogue military commander can easily outwit an army of experienced generals who are armed with volumes of intelligence and computer analysis.&lt;/ul>Blink's lessons for marketersAn understanding of how consumers make buying decisions is critical to marketing any product.Gladwell is a master storyteller and he weaves innumerable fascinating tales from the world of marketing to provide the anecdotal evidence that support his premises.In his less life-threatening tales, Gladwell covers a broad landscape of psychological testing and product branding experiences that will entertain and delight any serious marketer.&lt;ul>&lt;li> The Pepsi Challenge: Was it really fair or conclusive?&lt;li> How do the product and the package become a single entity in the mind of the consumer?&lt;li> How was margarine transformed into a desirable product after being rejected by a generation raised on butter?&lt;/ul>Gladwell makes a strong case for \"mind reading,\" or learning to trust your instincts when you read the subtlest of minimal cues on another human's face.Alternatively, he cites examples of how we are conditioned by a lifetime of unconscious prejudice to draw conclusions that are false and, in some cases, dangerous.Beware: the consequences of incorrectly interpreting the minimal cues on a human face can be fatal. Witness New York City police killing an unarmed citizen, Amadou Diallo, when, under extreme stress, they interpret fast unfolding events incorrectly and are certain they see him brandish a handgun when none exists.\"Our unconscious reactions come out of a locked room and we can't look inside that room,\" writes Gladwell. \"But with experience we become expert at using our behavior and our training to interpret -- and decode -- what lies behind our snap judgments and first impressions.\"--Peter A. Schaible",
            "I was recommended to buy this book at a user experience session at a web conference.After reading it all the way through, I felt that the core of the information would have made a good 3000-5000 word piece in a journal, with a few much shorter examples.In fact as I was reading it, I found myself thinking the annecdotes were too long and can we get back to some real content please.The annecdotes do illustrate the point well though, especially some of the ealier ones like the study on married couples. This was interesting, but I felt the book did drag on after that without adding much more.",

            "At first glance I thought this would be a great book, it was!This book covers every aspect of snap judgements: when they are right, when they are wrong, and why. The content of the book is mostly a series of fascinating and compelling examples (such as the story of an art fake scam, an accidental police killing, human face reading, etc.) In spite of the detail it never gets dry, dull or \"academic\".While I like a good page turner--and this book definitely is one--what I appreciated most about this book is it made me think about my own snap judgements. I highly recommend this title.",
            "I'm a huge fan of Gladwell's and this book is another testament to his brilliant intellect. If everyone followed the train of thought he lays forth in this book, we'd all be communicating on such a higher level. My only criticism is that in parts of the book, I found myself wanting to skip ahead, but overall, the thoughts he provoked were worth the read.",
            "Gladwell scores again! Well-written book that advances its basic concepts with well described examples that illuminate the ideas and prompt the reader (at least this one) to consider specific applications in my own personal and professional lives.Reading this book emphasizes the value of my \"trusting my gut\" even when I cannot immediately put my finger on the exact logic for doing so.",
            "Blink, deals with no only thinking but making your's perception on people and ideas on another perspective.It is a kind of falling your's internal \"Berlin Wall\"of thinking.People ideas are made under each one perception of their reality on previous experiences.This book help us in formating a new way of assembling our ideas and perceptions.Even after you read,you recall it, mainly in daily experiences.",
            "This is a funny book, a welcome reprieve from the day's terrible news. It's worth reading, definitely; enjoyable.",
            "After reading this book, I learned so much how people make judgements. Gladwell calls the snap judgements we make, usually without much information is known as \"Thin-Slicing\" and is something we all do every day.After reading the book, I have realized many situations where I am \"thin-slicing\" and making quick snap judgements. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn how they make the judgements they do. An excellent read!",
            "Intriguing, fascinating... the list could go on. \"Blink\" sums up so perfectly what many of us feel, but can't put our finger on the \"why.\" I was hooked from the first page, but found the final chapters even better. It's well written, flows smoothly, and is put so that the average person can understand the entire process.The various examples put forth show us how the mind can be manipulated and guided by suggestions.I bought copies for friends, and will be ordering more... I can see my copy being \"loaned\" and am looking forward to sharing and discussing the book with friends.",
            "It is curious that Blink gets low marks from some Amazon reviewers. Blink is an interesting, entertaining, and engaging. Blink is a solid effort by an excellent craftsman. Mr. Gladwell tries to explain the unexplainable using example after example of real world situations and scientific study. The result is, in his words, a conversation starter. Blink is a thought-provoking look into the mystery of how we perceive the world. I liked Blink. Okay, there were some parts where I got a little bored - like the grading of mayonnaise!!!! But, from the standpoint of applying these ideas to communication, personal relationships and the marketing of products, Blink delivered even more useful stuff than The Tipping Point.Ray Dodd, author of \"The Power of Belief\" (Hampton Roads 2004)",
            "No wonder Michael Levine salivates whenever you mention this guys name. They both have the same approach to writing books. Take a bunch of ideas that are already out there and try to make it sound like they are your ideas. I believe that here in American we call that plagiarism.I would recommend this book to legal students looking for case studies in plagiarism, and if you really want to see plagiarism at its best then be sure to read Guerrilla PR by Michael Levine--it is STOLEN entirely from Jay Conrad Levinson's Guerrilla Publicity.",
            "There are many lessons to be taken from \"Blink.\" Among them:1. Our first impressions, taken in a split second, are often more accurate than lengthy analysis.2. This is because our unconscious perceptions are uncanny.3. There's also the \"Warren Harding Syndrome,\" where these impressions can be totally wrong and overwhelm factual proofs much to the contrary.So, what gives? When you get done reading it you feel like you've learned something, but are a little hard pressed to put it into use. If it were advertised as a \"how-to\" book, it would fail miserably.Good thing it's not advertised that way!",
            "Malcolm Gladwell started his career as a science writer, and went from lab to lab hearing countless amazing ideas. Eventually, he got rich writing about them.People hailed his first book \"The Tipping Point\" as a genius new way of looking at marketing...but it wasn't really, it was just a collection of interesting stories of products that suddenly took off, unified by a single catch-phrase.Blink is much like that book. It covers research about how people make snap decisions, informed and uninformed. But if you read it, don't expect a unifying theory from Gladwell. Instead, marvel at how--Observers of a single one-minute tape of a college professor can guess with startling accuracy what his student approval rating will be on end-of-semester surveys-Researchers can view a 7 1/2 minute videotape of a couple talking to each other about any subject at all, break their facial expressions and miniscule reactions to one another into an algorhythm, and predict how long they'll stay together with over 90% accuracy-A man gifted at reading facial expressions made a fortune at horse races just by getting a good look horses' faces before races.Gladwell might not have all the answers for why these things happen, but for me, the book served as a wonderful \"Science Digest\", and I've since bought and read other books that follow up the more interesting chapters in more detail. If these kinds of topics interest you, this book is a winner.",

            "I found this book to be very interesting and useful. It refers to decisions that are made consciously or unconsciously in the \"blink\" of an eye, literally snap decisions. Real-world references are made to both good and bad decisions others have made and explains why they turned out as such. It further recommends considering why you would make a snap decision and analyzes the strengths an weaknesses of the same, thus reinforcing the likelihood of making an accurate decision. I always recommend this book to my students in the health care field and almost all of them praise it highly.",
            "Looking at the ranking on the best seller's list and hearing a few reviews I had high expectations for this one. Quite frankly the last two pages sum up the entire book quite succinctly. The stories are interesting but the author never brings out anything that instills a need for action. Sort of like reading a novel. :(",
            "I enjoyed Blink much more than \"The Tipping Point.\" In \"TP\" Gladwell seems to belabor his points with elongated stories and repetitive emphasis. In \"Blink\" he left me wanting more.

            "People tend to either believe in the power of intuition or not, as their own decisionmaking preferences guide them.This book is a collection of instances and examples that will make a lot of sense to some, and leave others muttering 'where is the proof'?For the former: take heart. you may not always be able to explain what you conclude but if it works, you won't need to. For the latter: proof is often in consequences and conclusions, not processes.Well worth reading - if only because it challenges the supremacy of logical processes in every day decisionmaking.",

You might say \"I have a feeling that this is...\" but not be sure about where that feeling comes from. In Blink Malcolm Gladwell exposes some thinking behind this phenomenon. As with his previous book Tipping Point, Malcolm's writing is extremely readable and easy going. I `get the feeling' from reading his words that I would like him. He is smart, observant and descriptive.I give this book 9 out of 10I loved the writing and the content kept my attention through most of the book. The pace is mostly good.To get a 10 I think there could have been some deeper probing into some of the ideas, by the end of the book I got frustrated with the repetition of some of the content.",
            "This is not a book that will teach you to make better decisions in the blink of an eye. There is no magic formula in this book that will change your decision making.It will however try to show you how we all \"thin slice\" people and situations even without realizing it. The author gives many examples to support this theory. There is alot of information in this book about how the police officers thin slice people, sometimes correctly and sometimes incorrectly with horrible results. The book talks about Amadou Diallo of NY extensively and the police officers who fired 41 shots, killing Amadou Diallo.My favorite chapter in the book is the last chapter: Listening with your eyes. I think this chapter captures the essence of the book better than any other.Many of the example in this book, I think, can be explained by the fact that our experiences say alot about our decision making. The tennis pro, the sculpture artist, the police officers all make a \"gut\" decision because they have all been faced with similar situations before. There is no magic in their decision making.",

Delivery was tediously slow. Lessons learned were minimal.However, I will give TIPPING POINTThe Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Differencea shot based on strong recommendations from friends and colleagues.",
            "The case studies are what make this book. Who wouldn't want the inside scoop on art dealings, marital discord, cop stories and what happens when someone with autism watches Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?I like the way the author dissects these stories -- some of which we're familiar with, like Amadou Diallo's death or the assassination attempt on President Reagan's life -- and then ties them together in the neat little concept of \"thin-slicing,\" or making decisions based on very minute pieces of visual or tactile information.But Gladwell's overarching idea, that the unconscious decisions we arrive at in the first few milliseconds of a situation can be better than thoughtfully considered ones, seems woefully optimistic to me. After all, many of the instances Gladwell analyzes are ones in which the snap decision was wrong.Take the death of Amadou Diallo. Gladwell's treatment of it is part of a section on how reading facial cues can help you \"mind-read,\" or intuit someone's true intentions. Even if the cops in this situation had years of practice in the arcane study of facial movements and could more accurately read Mr. Diallo's face, what could they have seen in this particular situation? It was the middle of the night on a dark street!The only real lesson I took away from this book is that, yes, \"thin-slicing\" can provide a good answer, but only after a lifetime of experience in some particular field. Gladwell's examples attest to that fact -- art forgery, police actions, music appreciation, food tasting. Unless you've honed your instincts with years of instruction and experience, I'd say you're better off taking your time making decisions.",
            "I decided to read this book because Outliers was not yet in at my library. With its low rating on Amazon, I should have known it wouldn't be worth my while. There are some neat stories in there and interesting ideas. My main problem is that the book claims to change the way we will think yet gives no instructions to do so. It just gives a few examples on when intuition worked out really well and when it lead to unfortunate consequences. Probably won't read Outliers now.",
            "\"Blink\" almost instantly made it to my shelf of favorite books of all time. I won't go into a detailed description of Gladwell's theory of thin-slicing, as other reviewers have already done this in all the detail you need to know before you decide to purchase this book (which I highly recommend you do) Instead, I'll tell you what I took away from \"Blink\", and why I think it's such an important read.\"Blink\" is more than just a series of entertaining anecdotes that support his theory. It is a book of lessons that provide insight into our minds, and the minds of those around us. Armed with this knowledge, we are better prepared to not only understand our own decision-making process, but to see, for a blink of an eye, what others are seeing when they make decisions about us. Many of the experiments and studies he describes contain information that can be directly applied to one's life.A good example of this is the study done in Germany that turns our idea of `feeling happy' on its head. While everyone knows that when you're happy, you smile, a team of German scientists found that it works in reverse as well. The simple act of smiling improves your mood. One could just take this interesting factoid and store it in the lumber room of your mind along with all the other trivia. I chose to make it relevant. I can't tell you how many times it's happened since reading this book that I felt angry, frustrated, impatient, or irritated in some way, and then turned my mood around just by forcing myself to smile for a little bit.Another sub-chapter of the book (\"Arguing with a Dog\") describes what Gladwell calls \"temporary autism\", a kind of mind-blindness that occurs when one is excited or stressed to the point that the heart rate rises above 145. I found this chapter very helpful in understanding the physiological process, as my work often requires me to deal with very stressed out people. (It helped with some easily excitable friends too!)The sub-chapter titled \"The Storytelling Problem\", which detailed the vast difference between what people say they want in a mate and what they are in fact attracted to, made me feel a lot better after reading it. After years of hearing women describe their \"perfect man\" to me, and then seeing them fall for a perfect jerk instead, I've gotten more than a little frustrated. But now I know there is a psychological reason for this insanity. I wish I could make every single woman in the country read this chapter (or at least the single women in my city!) On a similar note, I wish I could make everyone read the chapter called \"The Warren G. Harding Error\", which details the power of looks and our subconscious predilection for \"tall, dark, and handsome\" men. This chapter is especially relevant in an election year, when we are looking at our two candidates and judging them. Do we really know upon what basis we are judging? Are TRULY picking the best man for the job, or are we voting on who has made the more \"presidential\" first impression? As much as most people won't admit that race plays any part in their vote, mightn't it anyway, even among those people who truly DO deplore racism? Do we like a candidate because of what he or she truly stands for, or are we voting for them because they smile more often, or joke more often, or were wearing our favorite color the first time we saw them? One section of the book even describes how people can be \"primed\", subtly influenced to think and behave differently, at least in the short term. Are we, as voters, being \"primed\" by the various media? I think these are all very valid and relevant questions we need to ask ourselves.This is what I took away from \"Blink\"- a deeper understanding of the decision-making process, and what factors assist or subvert it. \"Paul Van Riper's Big Victory\" is a portrait of a decision-making model that works. \"Pepsi's Challenge\" describes a situation where thin-slicing doesn't work out. \"The Chair of Death\" describes an interesting hiccup in the thin-slicing process, where peoples' initial reaction can be negative, not because something is genuinely bad, but simply because it is unfamiliar. And \"Blink in Black and White\", which not only relates the problem of automatic subconscious racial stereotyping (even of ones OWN race) but supplies a test you can do yourself, was nothing less than chilling.OK, Gladwell is a writer, not a scientist. If you're looking for an airtight theory complete with control group testing and a detailed analysis of every possible permutation of the concept, go read a scientific journal. And, as another reviewer pointed out, he does tend to end his books with a thud rather than a conclusion. Nonetheless, I think this should be required reading in every American high school. The idea is that compelling, and the issues involved are that important.",
            "While it sounds by the title like it's a self-help book for the decisionally challenged, the book is actually a compendium of information about attitudes, prejudices, information and decision making, and what constitutes an expert decision maker.The book is interesting but somewhat rambling in character. The information seems a little disconnected, and I was at times hard put to it to decide if I were being encouraged or discouraged from using the unconscious part of my decision making apparatus for making judgments. By the end I could hear the distinct echoes of the Delphic Oracle's famous \"Know thyself\" reverberating through my mind.Like so much offered advice, in the end the distillation of all the information the author provides us is that sometimes it's a good idea and sometimes it's not. In the sometimes it's a good idea I can definitely find a resonance. As a college student I found that if I didn't do what I thought I \"should\" be doing I didn't do anything at all. By the time I had gotten to graduate school however, I had discovered that my subconscious mind was able to dictate when I needed to get busy with classroom projects, and it was always right too. I finally decided that it knew what I had to do, how much time I had, what my resources were, what the likely expectations of the professor were, and what my abilities were. Once I grew to rely on this subconsious sense of \"do it now,\" I no longer felt guilty about doing other things and got a whole lot more done in the bargain.Certainly the author's information on the research into default setting prejudices like black equals bad and white equals good was an eye opener. I have no doubt that despite my pleasant interactions with black individuals as friends and coworkers I also harbor an embarrassing default setting. When I realize how much a part the media play in this programing, I am amazed that race relations aren't worse than they are. It would appear that most of us are able to deal rationally with our irrational prejudices, thank God. Definitely the sketch of the disastrous death of an innocent black man in New York City at the hands of the police was a horror story about rational thinking short circuited. The tragedy was so appalling, it's difficult to realize how complex and physiological it all must have been and how totally out of control. Likewise the description of violence that occurred in Florida was also frightening and makes one understand how group behavior can so thoroughly take over. That the frenzied speeches of Adolph Hitler and the charged mass behavior could lead to a world war is not quite so surprising when one realizes that crazy things can happen with as few as four or five people under unusual conditions. What's truely sad is that much of the data on predjudice and group think and authority figures has been known for decades with very little done to change it.More surprising still was the study of military fact finding and its effect on decision making. The Red-Blue war game was especially informative. That the complexity of war should make it unpredictable should hardly be surprising. Murphey's Law should see to that, goodness knows. I was surprised that the author didn't discuss emergent properties or some of the findings on chaos theory. Surely Stuart Kaufman's or Per Bak's names should have arisen at least once, but--as I recall, anyway--they didn't.All in all, while the book seemed like a string of observations rather than a coherent whole, I found the information of great interest.Intriguing.",
            "Sometimes snap judgments are correct (rigged card games; analysis of statues); sometimes they're not (Amadou Diallo; Diet Coke). At the end of the day, what has really been learned? Should we trust our snap judgments or not? And what distinguishes a proper snap judgment situation from one where a longer analysis is required? The book never provides the answers, just a lot of admittedly-interesting vignettes and study synopses.So -- interesting book to read but not particularly helpful as an analytic aid.",
            "Gladwell is a superb, captivating storyteller. He opens the book with some compelling examples to support his principal objective of the book: the \"task of making sense of ourselves and our behavior requires that we can acknowledge there can be as much value in the blink of an eye as months of rational analysis.\" He amply succeeds in accomplishing his objective yet you can't help being left wanting for how we can opportunistically leverage our instincts versus when we should sit back and take a deep breath and analyze. That being said, I enjoyed the book and found the topic to be important. And the book passes my ultimate screen of a subject well explored that I will remember for years to come.",
            "The premise of this book is how we make split second decisions subconciously without really knowing it. This is explored in both a positive and negative light. Sometimes our intuitions are dead on, other times they lead to disaster.That being said, this topic is fascinating and the examples used are, for the most part, an intriguing look into the synapses of the mind. The book is highly entertaining and presents a bewildering dilemma. How do we know when these intuitive thoughts are a good thing as opposed to something detrimental to our being?The problem with this book is that there is no real connection between the two. Beyond the examples of when split second decisions work, and when they don't there is no real explanation as to why they go one way or another. Understandably, this is a difficult question to answer, and is probably not answerable altogether. Still, there is no real wrap up to the book, it rather presents itself as a series of examples.Even so, this is a fascinating book about the inner workings of the mind, and it makes you want to dig deeper into the mysteries within it.",
            "I came across this book after reading an article about intuition in Scientific American, and then conducting an online search of the subject.This book is not exactly what it states it is, but interesting enough and well-written.I think a point that Gladwell discusses, but not profoundly enough, is the essense of the book, \"experience\". Gary Klein's \"Sources of Power...\" hits more on the subject matter in a straightforward manner, where Gladwell is more articulate and sensationalistic.Ultimately, I want to learn or benefit from reading a book. Like a cookbook, I find it valuable if ONLY one recipe is successful - two is a bonus. Hence, the question for me is, \"Did I enjoy a benefit from the purchase of this book.\" Personally, I did. It gave me many ideas. Also, much of the referenced material is very useful - I've already followed-up (one thing leads to another). In layman's terms, this book helps me to understand why I do certain things, or react in certain manners. Gladwell is not an authority - he simply compiles experiences from his resources and their studies, and writes them nicer than the professionals he interviewed...",
            "Gladwell's focus in Blink is on snap decisions. Rather than a reliance on the slow rational process, snap decisions come from gut feelings, intuition, or as Gladwell puts it, behind the \"locked door\" of your unconsciousness. Why are some are absolutely right on and others so wrong? Gladwell states three aims for his book. First is to make the case for the accuracy of snap decisions. Second is to be able to understand why some snap decisions are good and others poor. Third, that we all can improve the quality of our snap decisions.What differentiates the good versus bad decisions, i.e. intuition versus prejudicial judgments? Accurate information, understanding which among all that information are the few crucial keys, and practice. Sounds almost contradictory, but the ability to make good snap judgments involves a lot of work!Blink is well-written. I've heard others complain it is superficial, but I feel he does an excellent job making science accessible without oversimplification (and he footnotes extensively, in case you want to read the original research).If you're expecting \"improve your SNAP in 30 days,\" you'll be disappointed. At his best depicting the good, the bad and the ugly, Gladwell is not explicit in prescribing a course to improve the quality of our decisions. He depicts it anecdotally.I read Blink with an eye towards incorporating it's lessons in the self-defense classes I teach. Every self-defense situation mandates decisions made in the blink of an eye. Rational thought is slow, so other brain pathways take over when we sense danger, increasing our adrenaline and preparing the body for action. You feel these effects: quickened breathing and pulse rates, tightening of the throat, chest, or abdomen, nausea, and many others. Every self-defense instructor exhorts students to pay close attention to these gut feelings, also called intuition. Yet how in the midst of an adrenaline rush can we distinguish intuition from a panic response? Is there a logic behind the difference, and a way to improve one's intuitive skills? The next-to-last chapter, focusing on the shooting death of Amadou Diallo in 1999 by New York police officers, describes how we read other people we feel may be a threat, how our bodies react under stress, and practices that police and security people can practice to help---or worsen---already bad situations. We are left to infer applications into our lives.",
            "\"Writing about Music is like dancing about architecture.\"Laurie AndersonInstead of a phd thesis beating one dead horse after another, this is a book for those who 'get it' and get it right away. Whipping from one disparate topic to the next and then sinching them together beautifully doesn't make it a rip-off; it makes it readable, Not in a summer novel way. Readable like poetry that you want to take in again with a second read. For those who want a linear progression with detailed explanations, you won't like it. For those of you who find yourselves urging on your longwinded friends because you know what point they're getting at before they know it themselves, you'll love it.

            "Blink is a book that simply proves that with years of practice and carefull analysis one can become so proficient in a particular field (or task) that after a while one becomes habituated to the point that it becomes intuative. The tennis pro, the general, the food tasters, the face psychologist, the marriage specialist, and the art historian know their field so well that it becomes second nature. They each have decades of practice and experience under their belt! So yes if you specialize by all means thin-slice but only in what you know!Big deal! Everyone knows this feeling in say learning to type, playing the piano, or mastering a tennis serve. There is a point that one stops thinking and peaking at the keyboard and it just becomes instinctual. The coke test, the blind music audition and the racial profiling incident prove that humans are distracted by bias and cannot be trusted with instinct. After all it is universal phenomenon that attactive people are given the benefit of the doubt since their attaction often disarms all reason.",
            "Just a long list of antedotes. Interesting for the first two seconds at best. Not useful reading.",
            "Blink is a look at all the various things scientists have discovered about how we think without knowing we're thinking. It particularly takes a long, hard look at why it is that people's first impressions so often conflict with either what careful analysis says or what people think they believe.Gladwell looks at a broad range of applications of these ideas. He looks at why, even though Pepsi wins the blind \"Pepsi Challenge,\" Coke continues to be the market leader. He investigates the psychology and split-second thinking that caused the death of an unarmed, fleeing immigrant from over 40 gunshots fired by NYPD officers. He looks at various factors that affect everything from standardized test scores to electing a President.Some have suggested that all Gladwell really tells us is that our first impressions are sometimes right and sometimes wrong. If after reading this book that's all you come away with, you have completely missed the point. The point is that whether those impressions are right or wrong is governed by a complex set of physiologic and experiential rules, and that we can do something about them. Cops can do things to make sure those first impressions don't result in an innocent death. And yes, you can learn to tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi when you drink a whole can, not just a sip.Gladwell is a writer for the New Yorker, and his writing style is very much like a bunch of magazine articles. But they are very GOOD magazine articles, and you want to read them all.",
            "What I loved most about this book, along with the author's writing style, are the many examples given where quick decisions are many times based on first impressions, and how many times those impressions are right.This is an interesting book! It's well thought out, well written, and I found it to be not only an enjoyable read, but also one that validates something I have long believed in: That first impressions hold a lot of weight, and are often accurate.",
            "In an era when we think we need to know as much as possible when we make a decision, Malcolm Gladwell challenges us to question this conventional wisdom. Blink tell us that sometimes too much information immobilizes us and makes us ineffective. A powerful and timely book.

            "This is not as good as The Tipping Point. Having said that, it is very much worth reading. Today's world requires that we make important decisions quickly. The total quality management movement has lead to an over-emphasis/reliance on data and the important notion of gut feel has been diminished. We often don't have time to research exhaustively. However, even when we do, the initial feel of something is critical.Gladwell draws on social psychology to help us understand the biases we bring to decision making. He also helps us understand that our capacity to quickly size someting up accurately is a gift we'd do well to recognize and appreciate.If you live a life where you have to make choices, read this book.",

            "A perpetual idea machine, Clifford Pickover is one of the most creative, original thinkers in the world today. In most cases using only simple ideas, he follows paths that in many cases must be constructed immediately before traversal. In this, his latest installment in that trek of exploration, he is again at his best.Each subject starts with a simple premise and the author follows it through to a basic conclusion. Many of the topics involve computer programs, and source code is provided. The programs are in several languages, including C, Pascal, BASIC and Rexx. However, most programs are quite short and represent basic algorithms, so it is not difficult to understand a program even if you are not familiar with the language.Some of the topics include:- 10^33, the largest power of 10 that can be represented as the product of two numbers that contain no zero digits.- A debate as to whether there should be a national computing initiative to compute the first trillion digits of Pi.- Fractal milkshakes, or creating a collection of fractal \"bubbles.\"Truly fuN with a capital N for number, this is another of the author's superb creations.

I just brushed over the very advanced math stuff that Ieither did not understand or had long ago forgotten, but I didn'treally feel like I missed anything.*There are a slew of amazing visually complex and striking graphicalrepresentations of various advanced functions, etc. All are wellworth exploring, even if they do not directly involve infiniteconcepts. The book is loaded with such graphics, a real visual feast.*The math is rather advanced in some sections but is quite elementaryin others. Best of all, a generous collection of computer programsis included which can be used to explore almost every chapter.*There are a few \"mystery\" type things, but mostly it is just veryexotic, seldom-explored areas of number theories and other areas ofmathematics.*The chapter on Vampire numbers is really cool, I thought. I haveseen them mentioned in posts here from time to time, now I understandwhat they are and why they are so interesting*The chapter on recursion has loads of really cool pattern-type stuffthat you can easily explore with a PC.

            "So you know: I have come to the conclusion that being a rocket scientist is not my calling, but still I have this compulsion to keep trying to learn it.For me, the problem of Space/Rocketry research is that resources seem to either be easy \"high school\" overviews or impossible tomes of equations with dry text that is better than dry turkey at putting you to sleep.I kept banging at the brick walls of the \"elite\" books but it just wan't happening for me. How do I say this? There was none of the \"fun\" that truly should be a part of important learning. The authors may as well have been robots (but then, Robots are more important than Humans to the Space industry these day so perhaps that fits).I had read *about* this book for years, it is cited in most every Space/Rocketry oriented technical book and so many web based resources that you'd think it would be available everywhere. It wasn't (as you probably know by coming to this Amazon page). I had heard that NASA did a technical translation to English around the time that the German \"Rocket Team\" was aging into retirement, so that the younger workers who weren't fluent in German could benefit from the book... but unlike most other NASA documents this specific one (TT F-622) was not to be found on the free government servers :(.Then, a short while back, when reading the NASA web document \"Ion Propusion - 50 Years in the Making\" this paragraph struck me hard:\"[Werner von Braun] approached Ernst Stuhlinger, a member of the original \"Rocket Team\" that had emigrated to Fort Bliss. Von Braun asked Stuhlinger to review the research by von Braun's mentor, Oberth. \"Professor Oberth has been right with so many of his early proposals,\" von Braun told Stuhlinger in 1947, \"I wouldn't be a bit surprised if we flew to Mars electrically.\"\"[This story is often quoted and usually states that Stuhlinger read a 1939 Oberth book titled \"Possiblities of Space Flight\". So far I have not been able to find such a book and I am of the thinking that the true title is the one on this page... the 1929 3rd edition of \"The Rocket to Interplanetary Space\" which Oberth retitled \"Ways...\" - as he explains in the forward - at the advice of his publisher]Reading that story of a Master looking to his Master, something clicked. I jumped over to Amazon to yet again look up the book and this time it was available. It wasn't cheap, but it wasn't as high as more recent books that had ended up just frustating me ;-), so I paid the Amazon Merchant and kept my expectations low.I couldn't believe it, I could not only read it but I was captivated by it. Perhaps it is because I had already read Oberth's \"Primer\" so I was familiar with his writing style (I purchased Primer thinking that a memoir would be a good introduction to his technical ideas, but it wasn't ... Primer is a facinating book, but it is ABSOLUTELY NOT about Space) . Maybe it was because after Primer I was compelled to read the biography \"Father of Space Travel\" by Helen Waters to get a handle on where his ideology came from, and so I already had made a bond and felt obligated. Maybe it was just that all of the failed attempts at the boring elite books finally added up to a critical point where my head could follow the stuff.For whatever reason, this old book worked and works for me. It reads well, like the old man is sitting in your kitchen telling you the neat stuff he came up with - and proved - just that day. He DOES get over your head (if, like me, you are not an uber-geek), but he doesn't lose you.And it covers so much. Nozzle structures, materials choices (sounds geeky right? It is still interesting!) and then the personal tech where he addreses the ridicule from \"experts\" who have nothing to do with the field (you've read about this stuff going on... this IS a portal right back to that stuff going on), and then there there comes the chapter 'Stations in Space' (\"such a station could consist of two observer cabins which would be connected by a cable 10-20km in length and would rotate about each other\"), the point by point steps and benefits of Humans going to the Moon, to Mars, to Venus and beyond ... yes, as a technical plan (I didn't know the book had this stuff in it).And of course, after over 500 pages of meticulous coverage of liquid fuel based rocket design, the details of which all went into the creation of the V2 over a decade later and into all of its American children since then, there is the infamous \"Electric Spaceship\" chapter. Chapter 22 starts off by saying \"... we can build machines which are related to the fuel rockets as an ocean liner to a boat. We can, by electrical means, increase the radiation velocity to double to ten-fold. Thereby, according to formula, we reduce the loss in propellant very considerably.\" And he describes how. Not often mentioned in the homage to this chapter is that included in it are the equations and designs for a reusable winged electric space ship (which he puts down as useless in the fueled rocket chapters) and how such a craft could be made with his electric system so that when landing ... \"there is no danger of it burning up; accordingly, it is not necessry to land by parachute...\"There is a term in the industry: \"The Oberth Effect\". It's a gravitation/propulsion concept for rockets that relates to slingshot flybys and multistage launchers, and recently it is coming around again because it seems some scientists have found a deeper aspect that was previously overlooked. I think that there is another \"Oberth Effect\", this one being a gravitational aspect of rocket people to Oberth and specifically to this one book :-).It should have never gone out of print.Libraries should have copies available to the public.You should read it."

            "Man's quest to replicate living beings goes back thousands of years. Today, there is a 21st century robot with a mobile body complete with intricate computer software, making it \"act\" rationally. The \"thinking android\" of our century has evolved through many stages. For years, we've seen robots in movies, science fiction, and on television. I loved R2D2 and C3PO in the first 'Stars Wars' feature.Robots don't ever have feelings. They do what they are programmed for and nothing else. Only twice, in the movies, have any robots neared human emotions, the \"star\" of R.O.B.O.T.S and the 'dear family robot' in the movie, 'Centennial Man' played by Robin Williams. The clones in the movie, 'The Island,' were programmed to be robots, but some actually became human with needs and feelings of man.The Planetary Society's second attempt to place a solar sail into Earth orbit failed when the Volna boostre's first stage misfired shortly after launch from a submarine in the Barents Sea. In a previous attempt in 2001, the Cosmos 1 solar sail did not separate from the booster's third stage. The Society had hoped to make the first controlled flight of a solar sail, which is probelled by only the faint pressure of photons on its eight reflective triangular blades. Such vehicles, a type of robot, are predicted to eventually achieve speeds five times as great as those achieved by a chemical-powered rocket.In Lille, France, the European Capital of Culture, is a 'fetus to man' sculpture. It has a life-sized metal clock-jack. The human figure, or jack, are the hands on the clock; fetus in the womb at 6:00, erect as an adult at 12:00, old age at 6:00 as he bends under the weight of the years. A fantastic thing to see. The photos in this book are \"out of this world.\"Back in 1993, my year of temp. jobs on computers, I kept promoting my ability to work 'robotics.' The only talking robot I'd ever seen in person was at Knoxville's 1982 World's Fair, so I know very little about them. And yet, I constantly spoke of being able to control robots, thinking I could get a better job. In our small town and the lawnmower/bicycle factory where I had my last job, robotics were primitive and the operator punched a few buttons for them to perform the more intricate jobs the Japanese do by hand. We're not that technical in America so most every job was done by hand. I was 'accurate but not fast' at data entry and our boss from Memphis, Steve (whose ancestor was an infamous criminal in the Old West), assured me that my accuracy was more important than the enormous errors made by the faster temp staff. He said, when the job was completed, \"When iI return, I expect Betty to own a robot factory.\" Actually, he was back in a few months and said he was glad that I was the one sent to help his crew organize a new computer accounting system for that same factory, Gabriel. I heard him telling others that he was going to hire a full-time person, but he didn't get around to asking me, so I moved on to the fated job in the office at Murray Ohio which did me in. He'd asked me once, \"Are we having fun yet?\" and I had to shake my head. It was hard work and I lost faith in my ability.Robotic prosthetics are becoming sophiscated and look and function better than the biological body part. Several movies have been made about and containing robots in addition to 'Star Wars' and '2001 A Space Oddyssey' (Hal), 'Short Circuit' had Johnny 5, and 'Artificial Intelligence' had David. In the 1965 t.v. series, 'Lost in Space' had Dr. Zachary Smith as did the 1998 movie of the same name.Robots are the future, but they will never take the place of humans, as it takes man (or woman) to make them work properly."

It was defintely the most interesting of the 3 books we read in this class.The book effectively teaches you how to go about making well-thought-out decisions. The text in itself is easy to read and comprehend. There are also many apt examples, both abstract and from everyday life. This combination ensures a successful reading of this book.While I would have probably never read this book if not for the class I took, I'm glad I did and would recommend this people from all walks of life. Being able to make a good, well-thought-out, rational decision is the best skill one can have.",
            "As a management consultant working with clients to make higher quality decisions, I have made many observations of how people (especially executives and groups) make business decisions. But observing how they make decisions is different than &quot;why&quot; they decide what they decide. This book provides so much insight into the &quot;why&quot; it is definitely worth the reading. While the book is very valuable on the &quot;why&quot; it is a little dated on state of the art analytic decision techniques. But with that said, I would highly recommend this book to any consultant (OE, OD, DA, etc.) working with individuals or groups where decisions are being made.",
            "The addition of Reid Hastie as an author to Robyn Dawes' classic text on judgment and decision making was superb choice. This edition appears to be written very much in Hastie's voice, from the perspective of a cognitive psychologist. Moreover, we find additional attention paid to algebraic models, which was something that was missing from previous editions. Hastie and Dawes ranks as one of the essential readings for the judgment and decision-making field.",
            "The authors emphasize that decision-making is a skill that can be learned and improved. As I work with career changers, I have become convinced that most of us have not learned this skill, and most of us could benefit from a careful reading of this book.Hastie and Dawes present results of scientific psychological research, using language that is easy for the ordinary person to understand. Their examples come from everyday life and news stories: Chernobyl, the &quot;hot hand&quot; theory of basketball, mammography.I would also recommend this book to any students of psychology, including those entering graduate school in social psychology, marketing or management. Hastie and Dawes demonstrate that academic studies needn't be dry, but in fact yield fascinating conclusions that are widely relevant. At the same time, they show the way researchers think and introduce the notion of probability in a way that makes readers want to learn more.",

I won't be selling this one back - and in fact have already started to work on my own decision making processes using the principles my class and this text have taught me. The authors did their best to make it concise enough to easily absorb - which in my case allows me the time to learn more about the topic from current research - which I appreciate. This is a readable guide if you want it to be - it has the same issues as many texts (they use different terms for things than other researchers do, etc.) but that's normal.

            "The authors of this book,like so many other psychologists in the area of decision making under uncertainty(ambiguity)in the real world ,as opposed to risk,appear to think that &#34;modern&#34;behavioral decision theory started with Daniel Ellsberg and advanced on the shoulders of Tversky and Kahneman with Hogarth and Einhorn close behind.They do a good job covering the conventional wisdom of that view.Unfortunately,they ignore the seminal and path breaking contributions made to the field of decision making under uncertainty by John Maynard Keynes in his classic work,titled A Treatise on Probability in 1921.Keynes was the first to systematically develop an interval estimate(set) approach to the calculation of probabilities.Keynes was the first to specify an index to measure the ambiguity of the potential available evidence upon which a decision maker would attempt to make reliable probability estimates.Keynes called this problem the weight of the evidence problem.Forty years before Ellsberg(1961),Keynes had already specified an index to measure the completeness of the relevant available evidence,w.w was defined on the unit interval between 0 and 1,i.e.,0&#60;=w&#60;=1.Keynes's w index is practically the same as Ellsberg's rho index.Keynes successfully generalized the expected value rule(maximize pA=EMV)and the expected utility rule(maximize pU(A))where p is a probability,A is the outcome,and U is an appropriately differentiable utility function with his decision weight model that he called a conventional coefficient of weight and risk,c.The goal of the decision maker is to maximize cA,where c equals p/(1+q)[2w/(1+w}].Keynes's decision weight rule ,c, not only solves all of the Ellsberg paradox problems,but also the certainty ,reflection , and translation effect problems,as well as the preference reversal problems.",
            "I got this because it was required for a course that I'm taking, so it's not exactly like I was passionately driven to buy this book. I don't particularly care about psychology so the explanations and figures in the book are still boring, but the book does provide a stimulating insight into how we make decisions (it helps that the book isn't a textbook per se). But if I had just bought the book for the fun of it, I think I'd still only feel so-so about the content. Then again, this is coming from a psychology-apathetic perspective, so I don't know how someone who's interested in the field would feel.",

            "We live in the information age. In today's business environment, information is the most critical resource of an organization. The success or failure of any organization depends on how well it manages its information resources so that the employees can take better decisions, reduce response times and quickly react to changes in the marketplace. Information is the key.Webster's dictionary defines the word knowledge as \"all that has been perceived or grasped by the mind; learning; enlightenment.\" Information is not knowledge. Knowledge is something more than information. Information combined with practical experience and wisdom becomes knowledge. Being informed is important, but being knowledgeable is critical. Because with mere information decision will not be made, actions will not take place and goals will not be achieved. For all these to happen knowledge is required; so one can say that it is knowledge that makes or breaks the organization. With knowledge, people are involved, human element is present.Knowledge management is the art and science of utilizing the information, making it available to the right people, in the right form and at the right time, so that they make better decisions and thus lead the organization to success. Knowledge management allows one to increase productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization.This book is a practical, no nonsense guide to applying the theories of knowledge management. It explains the various tools, techniques, methodologies and practices of knowledge management. In this Internet word, the book's emphasis on the Internet and web based technologies of knowledge management is very timely.The book is designed in a very pleasing manner and the layout and the usage of color and space is very pleasing to the reader. The book is amply illustrated and contains a lot of flowcharts and diagrams that makes the concepts clearer. The authors' don't waste any words and even though the size of the book is small, it covers a lot of ground and that too very thoroughly. While the features like \"Case in Point&quot; and &quot;Why Is It Important?&quot; and the real-life examples add tremendous value to the book, the quotations and figures add a lot to the readability. The 90-day action plan is a very useful feature and will help in giving the initial boost for starting the knowledge management efforts.So if you are a manager or an entrepreneur and if you want to succeed in the business environment of the next millenium, then I suggest you read this book. A GOOD BUY; AN EXCELLENT READ. Copyright 1999, Pegasus Book Club",

            "Managing knowledge, takes an incomplete and very shallow view of knowledge, and the practices associated with sustainable KM. &quot;Managing knowledge means delivering the information and data people need to be effective in their jobs&quot; (p18) &quot;Providing the right content to the right people at the right time&quot; (p17), echos the major theme of this book, which I believe misses the boat as the authors confuse, downplay and not concerned with the essential differences between information &amp; knowledge.Let's ask some questions: 1) What about learning and KM? Surely KM is about knowledge creation, not just distribution and access to content? 2) What about people and KM? Surely people not content and publishing is at the core of KM? 3) Do you really exchange knowledge when you distribute content? There are many reasons why some of the deepest thinkers believe it is information that is being transfered and knowledge emerges from people to people interactions, dialog and apprenticeship.Most companies soon discover that leveraging knowledge is actually very hard and is more dependent on community building than information technology and content publishing. This is not because people do not read or are reluctant to use information technology, rather it is because they often need to share, create, test knowledge that is neither obvious nor easy to document, knowledge that requires a human relationship to think about, understand, share, and apply appropriately.If you are looking to leverage the knowledge within your organization, following the advice of Managing knowledge may help you with the first baby steps, help you show some fast positive ROI and maybe please your sponsor. However if you wish to gain sustainable competitive advantage from KM, you would well advised to take a deeper look at people rather than the content, enable practices such as dialog, build and support learning communities, concentrate on making meaning and distinctions that matter, support knowledge sharing through recognition, raising the level of awareness and increasing critical thinking.I found chapter 6 to be the most valuable part of this book. The authors are spot on when they say &quot;One of the very early steps you need to take is establishing the common terms that will be used across all the content in all the repositories you are seeking to manage&quot; (p78). The reason is a common vocabulary and agreement on meaning assists with dialog. Knowledge and all action emerge in conversations, not in the indexed repositories.In the looming knowledge economy, the premium will be on making distributed, fast, intelligent responses, building connections and relationships, holding open communication in community, fostering strong critique, driving knowledge creation, being agile and cultivating awareness of market shifts.You will not find one of those terms in the index of this book!",
            "The authors are quite specific when explaining for whom Managing Knowledge has been written: \"This book is for those people who have read some of the academic literature on KM [Knowledge Management] and who (along with their bosses) are convinced that they need to go down this path....Our purpose is not to address the nature of knowledge. Rather, we want to help you get the right information to the right people so that they can take effective action....Everything we say in this book assumes that you are (or are going to be) leveraging Web-based technologies to move data, information, and knowledge.\" Their purposes could not be clearer.The book is divided into four sections:Part One: Getting Started (Strategy and Profiling People)Part Two: Organizing Around Information (Storyboarding Knowledge and Mapping the Knowledge Network)Part Three: Knowledge Architecture (Hiring People, Mobilizing Content, and Building the Technical Architecture)Part Four: The Ninety-Day Action PlanThis book provides both the structural design and the operations manual needed by any organization to achieve these objectives:1. To evaluate the information it now has2. To identify the information it needs...but does not (as yet) have3. To formulate a Web-based system to manage knowledge more effectively4. To set in place those best qualified to manage that system5. To facilitate and encourage knowledge sharing throughout the organizationIn Part Four, the authors wisely recommend that an organization choose a single business cycle that can be improved and begin the \"Ninety-Day Action Plan\" with a knowledge audit; next, begin building a core team and select an appropriate technology (or technologies); then during Day 61-Day 90, explain your team's efforts throughout the organization (\"to communicate the benefits of a KM system and to sell the concept of the knowledge architecture\") while constantly updating the content under management.Given its stated purposes, I rate this book very highly. It is well-organized, well-written, and comprehensive in terms of material covered. Contrary to what some reviewers may suggest, I think it provides the knowledge needed to manage knowledge effectively. If your organization has the aforementioned five objectives and has not as yet achieved them, I suggest that its key executives read this book immediately and then launch a collaborative effort to implement the \"Ninety-Day Action Plan.\" Why wait?",
            "A Review and Synopsis of Managing Knowledge - A Practical Web-Based Approach by Wayne Applehans, Alden Globe, and Greg LaugeroIn knowldgWORKS News Volume 1 Number 12 KnowBits pointed you to a series of World Wide Web links on the Microsoft Web Site. The links consisted of a series of case studies offered by Microsoft as examples of how their technology could be used as the basis of knowledge management efforts. Most of the case studies had very little to do with knowledge management, but quite a bit to do with Microsoft technology. One of the case studies distinguished itself. This was the case study describing the knowledge management effort at J.D. Edwards. The description of the effort was so rich that I sprang for the book by the people responsible for the work at J.D. Edwards.My overall opinion: BUY THIS BOOK !Without equivocation this book is the best compact description of what knowledge management is about. The book consists of practical information and advice about conducting a knowledge management effort. It is short, to the point, and has lots of great diagrams. Here is a synopsis.This book begins with a series of assumptions. They are as follows:Assumption 1: (my favorite) &quot;Knowledge management does not have to be profound.&quot; Assumption 2: You have a champion and are figuring out how to get started. Assumption 3: Document management concepts, technologies, and procedures provide the basic disciplines to kick off a successful effort. Assumption 4: Yours is a mid to large size company with an intranet and extranet and an internet presence. Assumption 5: Your business is consciously preparing for the internet economy.The parameters of the discussion are clearly set forth by these assumptions. But consider that even if you don't meet all of the assumption criteria, the information contained in this book is still extremely valuable.One of the challenges of any knowledge management effort is explaining why your organization might want to do knowledge management. Consider adopting these reasons :1. Ease of partnering 2. Ease of managing expertise turnover 3. Ease of decentralizing decision-makingEach of these reasons represents a competitive imperative.Any book about knowledge management needs to define the term. Remember my own definition goes, &quot;Knowledge Management is the process of controlling, using, manipulating, and communicating that which enables us to do things.&quot; Consider the authors's definition of knowledge.&quot;Knowledge is the ability to turn information and data into effective action.&quot;The authors go on to say this is a tactical definition &quot;because they are not interested in esoteric debates about the nature of epistemology.&quot; (Hooray ! )With regard to managing knowledge, Applehans et al give the following definition.&quot;managing knowledge means delivering the information and data people need to be effective in their jobs.&quot;This book does not mince words. It tries to keep things fairly simple and straightforward. The authors represent the trichotemy of data, information and knowledge as a pyramid consisting of data at the base, information in the middle and knowledge at the top. Interpreting this figure, one can infer the relationship between data, information and knowledge fairly easily.The book is divided into four parts and several chapters. Part one, &quot;Getting Started&quot;, focuses on strategy and profiling people. Part 2 creates the basis for relating knowledge to the business and covers storyboarding the knowledge and designing the organization around the knowledge it uses.Part three deals with the topics, &quot;Hiring People,&quot; &quot;Modeling Content,&quot; and &quot;Building the Technical Architecture.&quot;Lastly part four presents a 90 day action plan.One of the most interesting parts of the book is in part two where business process is attached to the informational needs and people involved in the process. What this breakdown gives you is the ability to see where the knowledge resides and how it is used in the business. The relationship of knowledge to process to people grounds a knowledge management effort in the business.Given the success of the author's effort at J.D. Edwards, I certainly believe they are on the right track. Given J.D. Edwards, size one has to wonder if the process scales down to smaller organizations. I would argue that, regardless of the size, the processes apply. The technical architecture may be substantially different for a small organization but that does not change the desired results, and the process proposed by the authors should scale up and down for businesses of all sizes.",
            "\"Managing Knowledge - A Practical Web-Based Approach\" is an easy to read and apply guidebook for a complicated process. The book breaks down the daunting task of getting the \"right knowledge, to the right people at the right time\" so you can get started in applying knowledge management. This practical guide to implementing knowledge management techniques can be used on one process or an entire organization. Though, the authors do recommend picking one process/cycle to begin the implementation process.The authors are straight forward in explaining that the nature of their book is not to explain knowledge management. It is assumed that you have read other books on knowledge management prior to using this guide. I found the book was well written enough that you really just needed some basic understanding of knowledge management, along with the foresight and desire to improve the formation and flow of data, information and knowledge. The book's subtitle states \"a practical web-based approach\", yet many principals of this book can be used in non web- based applications. Before I finished the book, I was convinced that my organization should implement the needed changes for managing knowledge, and that my organization would benefit greatly from retooling its self for the information economy. The authors should have included a quick reference page for the numerous abbreviations that were used. Some of the abbreviations may have another meaning in other industries.",

Managing Knowledge is a nuts and bolts primer on how to save money, save time and increase reveneues by managing knowledge. Its practical approach comes from authors who have achieved these benefits by doing it with a small staff and budget.",

        "description": "Purpose of the Book This book presents an approach to improve the standard object-oriented pro gramming model. The proposal is aimed at supporting a larger range of incre mental behavior variations and thus promises to be more effective in mastering the complexity of today's software. The ability of dealing with the evolutionary nature of software is one of main merits of object-oriented data abstraction and inheritance. Object-orientation allows to organize software in a structured way by separating the description of different kinds of an abstract data type into different classes and loosely connecting them by the inheritance hierarchy. Due to this separation, the soft ware becomes free of conditional logics previously needed for distinguishing between different kinds of abstractions and can thus more easily be incremen tally extended to support new kinds of abstractions. In other words, classes and inheritance are means to properly model variations of behavior related to the existence of different kinds of an abstract data type. The support for extensi bility and reuse with respect to such kind-specific behavior variations is among the main reasons for the increasing popularity of object-oriented programming in the last two decades. However, this popularity does not prevent us from questioning the real effec tiveness of current object-oriented techniques in supporting incremental vari ations. In fact, this popularity makes a critical investigation of the variations that can actually be performed incrementally even more important.",

            "Mezini's monograph is very specialised. It is his PhD. You need a strong background in computer science to understand the text. Certainly, you must already have programmed extensively in some object oriented language like C++ or Java.The book takes a step back from specific OO languages, and argues for a metaview across these. This is used to understand limitations in existing languages, and to formulate desirable properties of a new, hypothetical language, with more powerful expressive ability.Patterns are used heavily in the narrative. Following the seminal ideas of Booch, Fowler et al. The new language uses multiple inheritance, like C++ but unlike Java. Granted, this is more powerful than single inheritance. Implicitly, you are assumed to be able to avoid the well known ambiguities possible with multiple inheritance.The puzzling thing about the book is its high price. Due in part to its specialised nature. Perhaps the publisher is being greedy. A lower, more reasonable price would let Mezini's ideas propagate further."
