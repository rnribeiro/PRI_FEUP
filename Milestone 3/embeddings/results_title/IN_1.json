            "The field of artificial intelligence, in terms of its research content, and the confidence it expresses in the results of this research, has executed a roller coaster ride in the last five decades. There have been many proposals, many leads not going anywhere, but just as many leads showing great promise but were abandoned. The reasons why they were abandoned are unclear, but many researchers in artificial intelligence have let them themselves be persuaded that their results do not reflect real intelligence. This has thwarted the development of many promising areas in artificial intelligence, which could have been highly developed by now.The author, in this new edition of her book, has given the reader her opinions of the status of artificial intelligence in the twenty-five years after the first edition of the book. Her assessment of the last twenty-five years is in general optimistic, but her review concentrates mostly on research in the academic setting. There have also been dramatic advances in artificial intelligence in the commercial sector in the last twenty-five years, but many of these are difficult to document, since issues of propriety arise in the business environment. The many applications that are used by business and industry are practical proof of the rise of machine intelligence in the last twenty-five years, and many of these make use of the academic developments that the author discusses in this book.The self-doubts and concentrated attention expressed by various researchers are well documented by the author, and some interesting historical anecdotes are included. The author describes the \"odd paradox\" in artificial intelligence as one where the its practical successes are absorbed into the domains in which they found application. Once assimilated, they become \"silent partners\" alongside other (non-intelligent) approaches. This reinforces the belief that the intelligent applications were not intelligent in the first place, and are then viewed merely as \"valuable automatic helpers\". This scenario has been played out many times in the history of artificial intelligence, and, even worse, the fact that the workings of these applications were understood made many assert that this was proof of their non-intelligence. If a process or algorithm is understood, it cannot be intelligent. This bias, the author correctly observes, continues to this day. Regardless of these beliefs or prejudices, the fact remains though that many of today's computers and machines are packed full of intelligence, albeit in different levels, and these levels will dramatically increase in the next twenty-five years.Researchers in artificial intelligence have been accused of exaggerating the status of machine intelligence, and similar to the same exaggerations that occur in other fields, which arise many times from pressures to obtain funding, these accusations do have some truth to them. But the author points out a case where the funding was cancelled due to the project not being \"extravagant enough.\" This is an interesting historical fact, and one that illustrates the large swings in confidence that have plagued AI research from the beginning.The strong emphasis on emulating human intelligence has been dampened in recent years, with researchers realizing, refreshingly, that human intelligence is not the only kind in nature. It is in retrospect quite surprising that silicon-based machines were thought to be able to mimic the processes and powers of biological systems. The author quotes one researcher as saying that \"Silicon intelligence would surely be different from human intelligence\". This is indeed correct, and one can expect many different types of intelligence to reside in future machines, each of these types emphasizing particular tasks, but being general enough to think in many domains. Maybe a better word for describing the field would be to call it `Alien Intelligence', so as to emphasize the (non-human) idiosyncrasies of these different intelligences.With very exceptions, the philosophical community has been against the possibility of artificial intelligence. This continues to this day, and the author discusses some of the philosophical tirades leveled against artificial intelligence since the first edition of the book. Researchers in AI have taken the time (unfortunately) to answer some of these criticisms, but there is also a trend, which hopefully will continue, to ignore them and instead spend time on what is important, namely the design and construction of intelligent machines. There is no penalty in ignoring philosophical criticism; it lends no constructive insight into artificial intelligence. However there is a great penalty taken in the form of wasted hours in attempting to answer the vague and impractical claims of philosophers. Ironically, there have been a few renowned philosophers that have left the practice of philosophy and have entered into research into artificial intelligence (and have done a fine job in this regard).The author also shares with the reader her personal insights into artificial intelligence, and these are interesting considering her involvement with some of the major academic experts in AI. She describes her bias in thinking of (mobile) robots as the sole representative of artificial intelligence. This bias has been alleviated to a large degree in the last decade, but many still equate artificial intelligence to the presence of bipedal robots wandering around performing useful tasks or possibly acting as adversaries to human beings. The latter view of course is very popular in Hollywood interpretations of artificial intelligence. The real truth though is that (immobile) machines, be they servers in networks, laptop computers, or other types of machines, can exhibit high levels of intelligence, depending on what kind of \"software\" or \"mind\" is overlaid on them.The most important thing to be settled for the field of artificial intelligence, and this is brought out also in many of the author's remarks, is a general methodology for gauging machine intelligence. The Turing test is too subjective and tied too much to measures of human intelligence. The AI community definitely needs to arrive at quantitative measures of machine intelligence in order to assess progress and allow the business community to judge more accurately whether a certain level of machine intelligence is needed for their organizations.",
            "Twenty five years ago Pamela McCorduck wrote a definitive book on Artificial Intelligence. She first went among the artificial intelligentsia when the field was fresh and new, and she asked the scientists engaged in it what they were doing and why. She saw artificial intelligence as the scientific apotheosis of one of the most enduring, glorious, often amusing, and sometimes alarming, traditions of human culture: the endless fascination with artifacts that think.Long out of print, it became a classic, often quoted, but not often read. Now it's back and in a new edition with an extended afterword that brings the field up to date in the last quarter century, including its scientific and public faces. McCorduck shows how, from a slightly dubious fringe science, artificial intelligence has moved slowly to a central place in our everyday lives, and how it will be even more crucial as the World Wide Web moves into its next generation.",
            "This is a book written in the late 1970s about the early history of the field of Artificial Intelligence. The book reflects a considerable bias towards the part of this field that came out of the Dartmouth conference (McCarthy, Simon, Newell, Misky, etc). The first 2/3 of the book are good as historical context, though the book misses some things (eg at this time it was not yet known about Alan Turing's work with computers during the world war II). The book is, however, rather biased by the Dartmouth crowd. for example, there is little attention paid to the perceptron. Yet, all in all I would have given 4* to the book if it had stopped at 2/3, if nothing else because it is a good read. The last part is difficult to read. Twice I started this book, and twice I stopped before page 400. So overall it gets 3*"

            "Concentrating on the mathematical and formal underpinnings of learning theory, this book gives a very interesting and general overview of the subject. Basing their discussion on the learning of \"texts\" and the learning of \"functions\", the authors address the main issues in the formal modeling of empirical inquiry. The models or \"paradigms\" they construct are based on five concepts, which they consider of central importance in empirical inquiry. These concepts are: (1) A reality that is theoretically possible; (2) hypotheses that are intelligible; (3) the data that is available about a given reality; (4) a model of a scientist; (5) the successful behavior of the scientist who is investigating a possible reality. The scientist is thought of as playing a game with Nature, with the class of possible realities being known to each of them initially. Nature selects a member from this class, initially unknown to the scientist. After providing a series of clues (data) to the scientist, the scientist forms hypotheses based on these clues. The scientist wins the game if the hypotheses become stable and accurate. The game is easier to win the more constrained Nature's choice of actual world is.After a brief philosophical discussion of the paradigms and a review of the theory of computation, the authors begin their study by concentrating on identification of languages and identification of functions. Both of these are considered to be `theoretically possible realities', and in the case of languages, it is \"texts\" that are to be identified by scientists. Those texts that can are called `identifiable' and the authors prove a theorem that characterizes how scientists identify languages in terms of finite strings of text. Success in function identification is cast as a generalization of that of text. In this case the class of possible realities are the collection of total recursive functions, and hypotheses are programs that compute these functions. The authors show however that a scientist who identifies the entire class of recursive functions cannot be computable. Very interesting in this discussion is the treatment of `parametrized scientists', i.e. those scientists who can incorporate background knowledge from other scientists.These considerations involve the view of a scientist as being a certain fixed entity. The authors also consider cases where alternative notions of scientist occur, but the other paradigms are held fixed. The abilities of computable scientists who deploy different inductive `strategies' are studied, with the goal of finding out if a member of a particular strategy can effectively identify languages or functions. Recognizing that the conjectures proposed successively by a particular scientist may not be related to one another, the authors then discuss strategies that result from imposing relations between the conjectures. One of these, called `conservative', insists that a conjecture that generates all the data observed to date should never be abandoned. Also discussed are `generalization strategies' that require scientists to improve upon their successive conjectures. One example of these strategies is called `strong-monotonic', which forbids the revision of a hypothesis if it made a mistake in identification. Another example is called `weak monotonic', which allows the rejection of parts of a hypothesis if it encounters data that cannot be accounted for by this hypothesis. Still another is `monotonic', which allows the correction of mistaken hypotheses, but does not allow hypotheses that will contradict correct classifications. The authors show that monotonicity does not imply weak-monotonicity, and vice versa. Also discussed are `specialization' strategies, which are \"dual\" to the three generalization strategies, and which involve the pruning of hypotheses in order to obtain convergence.The authors also address the case where the conception of a scientist is held fixed, but the criteria for scientific success are varied. This study, in the opinion of this reviewer, more accurately reflects the real behavior of scientists, who typically use very liberal notions of accuracy. For example, anomalies in data could be tolerated, pending alteration of the hypotheses in the future. These anomalies in fact serve to drive further research, with the goal of finding hypotheses or theories that resolve them. It is typically the case, if not always, that the hypotheses are considered approximate explanations, and so one would expect that the authors' discussion would revolve around the consideration of inference of approximations. The authors though do give an interesting twist to this discussion, namely, they attempt to find criteria for success that actually permit an infinite number of anomalies in the final explanations. This serves to better characterize explanations, they argue. A series of identification criteria are outlined each of which involves measure-theoretic notions of `asymptotic agreement.' A scientist presented with a function must arrive at an explanation that agrees asymptotically with the function up to a prespecified amount.Also more realistic, due to its emphasis on what happens in actual scientific investigation, is the authors' discussion on alternative conceptions of available data. Noting that data can be missing or have errors, and is presented in a definite order to a scientist, the authors study how to deal with error in the finding of intelligible hypotheses. Their results delineate the extent to which inaccurate data can impede the learning process, with three kinds of \"inaccurate\" data considered: \"incomplete\", \"noisy\", and \"imperfect.\"Other topics discussed include the modeling of empirical inquiry when many scientists are collaborating with each other, and that of probabilistic learning. For team identification of functions, several interesting results are proven, but the authors admit that their results do not apply to the (more realistic) scenario where the hypotheses of each individual scientist influence each other. Also discussed are \"oracle\" scientists, who use information of a noncomputable nature, or \"information oracles\", in order to perform identifications. When judged by how much information can be given to the scientist, oracles can be \"omniscient\" or \"trivial\", and it is thus of interest to determine how much oracles can supply scientists in their identification of functions. The authors discuss various results on this topic, showing how much is to be gained by allowing oracle scientists to make additional queries."

How intelligent are the best of today's AI programs? To what extent can we entrust them with decisions that affect our lives? How human-like do we expect them to become, and how soon do we need to worry about them surpassing us in most, if not all, human endeavours? From leading AI researcher and award-winning author Melanie Mitchell comes a knowledgeable and captivating account of modern-day artificial intelligence. Flavoured with personal stories and a twist of humor, Artificial Intelligence illuminates the workings of machines that mimic human learning, perception, language, creativity and common sense. Weaving together advances in AI with cognitive science and philosophy, Mitchell probes the extent to which today's 'smart' machines can actually think or understand, and whether AI requires such elusive human qualities in order to be reliable, trustworthy and beneficial. Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans provides readers with an accessible, entertaining, and clear-eyed view of the AI landscape, what the field has actually accomplished, how much further it has to go, and what it means for all of our futures.",

For starters, the book is poorly organized. Topics that logically belong together are often several chapters apart. There is no overall structure to the book. It seems like a collection of topics in AI that were hastily assembled without concern for thematic organization or flow. For example, the forward and backward chaining algorithms are presented in a chapter (Ch. 7) on rule-based systems, but are not even mentioned in the chapter (Ch. 13) on logic! Perceptron training is presented AFTER backpropagation! Contrast this with the much better book by Russell and Norvig, which uses the theme of intelligent agents as a continuing motivation throughout, and which groups related topics into logically arranged chapters.The examples in Winston are atrocious. The main example in the backpropagation chapter is some kind of classification network with a bizarre topography. This example is so trivial and weird that it totally fails to illustrate the strengths of backpropagation. The explanations of generalization and overfitting in backprop training are awful.The only chapter of this book that is not an unmitigated pedagogical disaster is the chapter on genetic algorithms, although better introductions exist (e.g. Melanie Mitchell).A further annoyance is the placement of all the exercises at the end of the book instead of the end of the chapters to which they correspond.Avoid this book.

He writes about the mind as if he has the authority of a philosopher of mind, when, in fact, he's just a programmer.

            "This book is a collection of articles that give a fair representation of the status of artificial intelligence in the mid 1990's. In only a decade since those times, the field has expanded considerably, mostly due to applications and the rise of the Internet. Controversy as to the nature and characterization of machine intelligence continues of course, and one finds both intense criticism and uncritical optimism of the nature and future of artificial intelligence. Most of this takes place in the philosophical literature, but there are also places in mainstream AI circles where predictions of future developments are overly optimistic. This optimism is refreshing but it can be a distraction for those that are seriously working to develop useful applications of artificial intelligence. But also, cynicism and negativism have also thwarted research in AI, there having been a few cases that showed much promise, but were abandoned because the researchers were convinced by others that their ideas were unsound. The AM and EURISKO efforts in automated mathematics, which are discussed briefly in this book, are good examples of this.All of the articles in this book are interesting, but there are a few that stand out due to their penetrating insight on matters that are still of great interest in artificial intelligence. One of these is the article entitled \"Creativity\" by Margaret A. Boden, who is the editor of the book, and who has done some outstanding work in the elucidation of what it means for a machine (human or otherwise) to be creative. Her insights on this subject are many, and in the opinion of this reviewer her works should be required reading for all those interested in the origins of creativity and attempts to implement it in non-human machines.Boden asserts that every case of creativity cannot be explained by a single scientific theory, one reason for this being that an AI model must be evaluated, and such an evaluation is outside the realm of science. In addition, there is a high variability in creative psychological processes, which preclude a general understanding of them. Lastly, creativity is very idiosyncratic but Boden is careful to point out that it is not random, but instead subject to constraints in `conceptual space'. Boden does not define conceptual spaces from a mathematical standpoint in her article, but she does discuss their utility in modeling creativity in AI, and the role of AI models in making more rigorous the conceptual spaces employed by musicologists, literary critics, etc. Boden's ideas in this article on the mapping, exploring, and transforming conceptual spaces can be viewed in the context of dynamical systems, and such a view allows them to be more easily coded into a machine language. Boden discusses several examples of AI models of the arts, such as connectionist models of music, the AARON program for generating line drawings, and the Letter Spirit project, which tries to model the perception of alphabetic style. She points out the pluses and minuses in each of these examples, such as the limited compositional ability of connectionist models, the limited evaluative and self-correcting powers of AARON, and the lack of Letter Spirit in being able to justify its own decisions. AI models of science are also discussed, and Boden concludes that most of these are `data driven' and cannot identify relevance for themselves. She believes that they can learn, but their discoveries are `exploratory', and do not succeed in changing their own conceptual spaces.The status of machine intelligence for scientific discovery has changed quite a bit since this article was written. Techniques from inductive logic programming coupled with faster hardware are making the reality of automated scientific discovery closer with every passing year in the twenty-first century. With more powerful hardware on the horizon, these developments give evidence of a time when drawing on the efforts of their human tutors, machines will be able to think across scientific domains and formulate hypotheses and creative ideas that may far surpass anything that has been done by human scientists. The time scales needed for this scientific discovery to take place may be so short that it might be difficult for human observers to assimilate these new results in order to evaluate their efficacy and applicability. The machines though may have their own opinions on the utility of the ideas and theories they derive."

Its scope is intended to span the full range of interests from classical problems in the philosophy of mind and philosophical psycholo gy through issues in cognitive psychology and sociobiology (concerning the mental capabilities of other species) to ideas related to artificial in telligence and to computer science. While primary emphasis will be placed upon theoretical, conceptual, and epistemological aspects of these prob lems and domains, empirical, experimental, and methodological studies will also appear from time to time. The perspective that prevails in artificial intelligence today suggests that the theory of computability defines the boundaries of the nature of thought, precisely because all thinking is computational. This paradigm draws its inspiration from the symbol-system hypothesis of Newell and Simon and finds its culmination in the computational conception of lan guage and mentality. The \"standard conception\" represented by these views is subjected to a thorough and sustained critique in the pages of this book. Employing a distinction between systems for which signs are signif icant for the users of a system and others for which signs are significant for use by a system, I have sought to define the boundaries of what AI, in principle, may be expected to achieve.",

The book tries to cover as much as possible about the scope and limits of classical AI and is refreshing in its consideration of semiotics (chapter 2 is devoted to symbol systems and semiotic systems) and the relevance of Pierce's theories to the design of intelligent machines. However, I found many discussions in Fetzer's book to be rather banal, and many of his arguments are poor.

A particularly strong feature of the text is that it is filled with applications in engineering, business, and finance. AI problems that cover most of the application-oriented research in the field (pattern recognition, speech and image processing, classification, planning, optimization, prediction, control, decision making, and game simulations) are discussed and illustrated with concrete examples. Intended both as a text for advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students as well as a reference for researchers in the field of knowledge engineering, Foundations of Neural Networks, Fuzzy Systems, and Knowledge Engineering has chapters structured for various levels of teaching and includes original work by the author along with the classic material.

Some of the formulas appear to me to be erroneous. I base this on what seems to be the intent of the formulas in question.

So, it's worth sticking to it for a lifetime, even if it takes 30 years or so to reap the benefits. The AI problem. The science of artificial intelligence (AI) may be defined as the construction of intelligent systems and their analysis. A natural definition of a system is anything that has an input and an output stream. Intelligence is more complicated. It can have many faces like creativity, solving prob lems, pattern recognition, classification, learning, induction, deduction, build ing analogies, optimization, surviving in an environment, language processing, and knowledge. A formal definition incorporating every aspect of intelligence, however, seems difficult. Most, if not all known facets of intelligence can be formulated as goal driven or, more precisely, as maximizing some utility func tion. It is, therefore, sufficient to study goal-driven AI; e. g. the (biological) goal of animals and humans is to survive and spread. The goal of AI systems should be to be useful to humans.",

            "This book differs from most books on the theoretical formulations of artificial intelligence in that it attempts to give a more rigorous accounting of machine learning and to rank machines according to their intelligence. To accomplish this ranking, the author introduces a concept called `universal artificial intelligence,' which is constructed in the context of algorithmic information theory. In fact, the book could be considered to be a formulation of artificial intelligence from the standpoint of algorithmic information theory, and is strongly dependent on such notions as Kolmogorov complexity, the Solomonoff universal prior, Martin-Lof random sequences and Occam's razor. These are all straightforward mathematical concepts with which to work with, the only issue for researchers being their efficacy in giving a useful notion of machine intelligence.The author begins the book with a \"short tour\" of what will be discussed in the book, and this serves as helpful motivation for the reader. The reader is expected to have a background in algorithmic information theory, but the author does give a brief review of it in chapter two. In addition, a background in sequential decision theory and control theory would allow a deeper appreciation of the author's approach. In chapter four, he even gives a dictionary that maps concepts in artificial intelligence to those in control theory. For example, an `agent' in AI is a `controller' in control theory, a `belief state' in AI is an `information state' in control theory, and `temporal difference learning' in AI is `dynamic programming' or `value/policy iteration' in control theory. Most interestingly, this mapping illustrates the idea that notions of learning, exploration, adaptation, that one views as \"intelligent\" can be given interpretations that one does not normally view as intelligent. The re-interpretation of `intelligent' concepts as `unintelligent' ones is typical in the history of AI and is no doubt responsible for the belief that machine intelligence has not yet been achieved.The author's formulations are very dependent on the notion of Occam's razor with its emphasis on simple explanations. The measurement of complexity that is used in algorithmic information theory is that of Kolmogorov complexity, which one can use to measure the a prior plausibility of a particular string of symbols. The author though wants to use the `Solomonoff universal prior', which is defined as the probability that the output of a universal Turing machine starts with the string when presented with fair coin tosses on the input tape. As the author points out, this quantity is however not a probability measure, but only a `semimeasure', since it is not normalized to 1, but he shows how to bound it by expressions involving the Kolmogorov complexity.The author also makes use of the agent model, but where now the agent is assumed to be acting in a probabilistic environment, with which it is undergoing a series of cycles. In the k-th cycle, the agent performs an action, which then results in a perception, and the (k+1)-th cycle then begins. The goal of the agent is to maximize future rewards, which are provided by the environment. The author then studies the case where the probability distribution of the environment is known, in order to motivate the notion of a `universal algorithmic agent (AIXI).' This type of agent does not attempt to learn the true probability distribution of the environment, but instead replaces it by a generalized universal prior that converges to it. This prior is a generalization of the Solomonoff universal prior and involves taking a weighted sum over all environments (programs) that give a certain output given the history of a particular sequence presented to it. The AIXI system is uniquely defined by the universal prior and the relation specifying its outputs. The author is careful to point out that the output relation is dependent on the lifespan or initial horizon of the agent. Other than this dependence the AIXI machine is a system that does not have any adjustable parameters.The author's approach is very ambitious, for he attempts to define when an agent or machine could be considered to be `universally optimal.' Such a machine would be able to find the solution to any problem (with the assumption that it is indeed solvable) and be able to learn any task (with the assumption that it is learnable). The process or program by which the machine does this is `optimal' in the sense that no other program can solve or learn significantly faster than it can. The machine is `universal' in that it is independent of the true environment, and thus can function in any domain. This means that a universal optimal machine could perform financial time series prediction as well as discover and prove new results in mathematics, and do so better than any other machine. The notion of a universally optimal machine is useful in the author's view since it allows the construction of an `intelligence order relation' on the \"policies\" of a machine. A policy is thought of as a program that takes information and delivers it to the environment. A policy p is `more intelligent' than a policy p' if p delivers a higher expected reward than p'.The author is aware that his constructions need justification from current practices in AI if they are to be useful. He therefore gives several examples dealing with game playing, sequence prediction, function minimization, and reinforcement and supervised learning as evidence of the power of his approach. These examples are all interesting in the abstract, but if his approach is to be fruitful in practice it is imperative that he give explicit recommendations on how to construct a policy that would allow a machine to be as universal and optimal (realistically) as he defines it (formally) in the book. Even more problematic though would be the awesome task of checking (proving) whether a policy is indeed universally optimal. This might be even more difficult than the actual construction of the policy itself.",
            "Solomonoff's famous inference model solves the inductive learning problem in a universal and provably very powerful way. Many methods from statistics (maximum likelihood, maximum entropy, minimum description length...) can be shown to be special cases of the model described by Solomonoff. However Solomonoff Induction has two significant shortcomings: Firstly it is not computable, and secondly it only deals with passive environments. Although many problems can be formulated in terms of sequence prediction (for example categorisation), in AI in general an agent must be able to deal with an active environment where the agent's decisions affect the future state of the environment.In essence, the AIXI model, the main topic of this book, is an extension of Solomonoff Induction to this much more general space of active environments. Although the model itself is very simple (it is really just Solomonoff's model with an expectimax tree added to examine the potential consequences of the agent's actions) the resulting analysis is now more difficult than in the passive case. While optimality can be show in certain senses, the powerful convergence bounds that Solomonoff induction has now appear to be difficult to establish.Like Solomonoff induction, AIXI also suffers from computability problems. In the one of the final sections a modified version of AIXI is presented which is shown to be computable and optimal in some sense. Practically this algorithm would be much too slow, but this is a clear step away from abstract models which can in theory be implemented.For anybody interested in universal theories of artificial intelligence this book is a must. The presentation is quite technical in places and thus the reader should have some understanding of theoretical computer science, statistics and Kolmogorov complexity.",
            "This is probably the most rigorous attempt to formalize AI. The book succeeds in presenting the state-of-the-art AI theory from a technical point of view, but neglects intuition, and is difficult to read for the novice and thus inaccessible to a wider audience.The main idea of the book in combining classical control theory concepts with Bayesian inference and algorithmic information theory. The author avoids to struggle with anthropocentric aspects of intelligence (which are subject to a fierce debate) by defining intelligent agents as utility maximizing-systems. The core ideas are, in a nutshell (informally):1) Goal: Build a system with an I/O stream interfaced with an environment, where inputs are observations and outputs are actions, that optimizes some cumulative reward function over the observations. Two ingredients are necessary: model the a priori unknown environment and solve for the reward-maximizing actions.2) Model: This is a probability distribution over future observations conditioned on the past (actions and observations). Instead of using any particular domain-specific model, the author uses a weighted mixture over \"all\" models. By \"all models\", the set of all mechanically calculable models is meant, i.e. the set of all algorithmically approximable probabilistic models.3) Policy: Given the model, all possible futures can be simulated (up to a predefined horizon) by trying out all possible interaction paths. Essentially, a huge decision tree is constructed. Having this information, it is \"easy\" to solve for the best policy. Just pick at each step the action that promises the highest expected future rewards. These are calculated recursively using Bellman's optimality equations.Why does this work in theory? If the environment is equal to one of the models in the mixture (or \"close enough\"), then the mixture model converges to the true environment. The model is updated step by step using Bayes' rule. Since the model becomes more accurate, the policy based on it converges to the optimum. Algorithmic information theory is the main tool to derive the mathematical results.Does it work in practice? Unfortunately, the presented solution cannot be implemented in practice, because the mixture model is incomputable. Even worse, there is currently no principled way to downscale his approach (and make it practical), since we don't know how to simplify (a) the mixture model and (b) the computation of the policy. The author makes these points very clear in his book. IMHO these are the main challenges for future AI research.The PROs: This is the first time I see a unified, formal and mathematically sound presentation of artificial intelligence. The proposed theoretical solution provides invaluable insight about the nature of learning and acting - hidden even in very subtle details in his approach and in his equations. Whereas you might feel that classical AI or commonplace Machine Learning theory looks like a patchwork of interesting concepts and methods, here (almost) everything fits nicely together into a coherent and elegant solution. Once you have studied and understood this book (which took years in my case), it is very difficult to go back to the traditional approaches of AI.The CONTRAs: However, there are some downsides to this book. Hutter is a brilliant mathematician and sharp thinker. Unfortunately his writing style is very formal and many times he neglects intuition. The book introduces difficult notation (although some of it pays off in the long run) that ends up obfuscating simple ideas. The mathematical style of the book is difficult to digest.To summarize, this books represents a giant leap in the theory of AI. If you have advanced mathematical training and enough patience to study it, then this book is for you. For the more practically-oriented researcher who wants to learn about Universal AI, I recommend reading Shane Legg's \"Machine Super Intelligence\".",
            "Have you ever wondered if Artificial Intelligence is possible at all? And if so, can it be achieved by a neat and simple construction, rather than some highly complex system that nobody could understand? This book proposes a theory answering both questions in the affirmative. The idea is easy: use a universal model class, treat observations in a probabilistic (Bayesian) way, and do an optimal far-sighted decision on this basis. In the book, this construction is mathematically elaborated, and many properties are stated and proven, such as asymptotic behavior, optimality, etc. On the other hand, no efficient implementation is possible at this stage, since the system requires infinite computation time.This is the only mathematical definition of universal AI I know of, and maybe the only one possible. How can it be implemented efficiently? Does the resulting system behave truly intelligent? Hopefully the future will answer these questions - maybe with your contribution!",
            "Hutter's book is the most recent attempt to put artificial intelligence on a firm mathematical footing. (For an earlier effort see, for instance,Theory of Problem Solving: An Approach to Artificial Intelligence, Ranan Banerji, Elsevier, 1969) If successful, such a foundation would permit us to elaborate and explore intelligence by applying the formal methods of mathematics (e.g., theorem proving).Hutter starts from Werbos' definition of intelligence: \"a system to handle all of the calculations from crude inputs through to overt actions in an adaptive way so as to maximize some measure of performance over time\" which seems reasonable. (P. J. Werbos, IEEE Trans. Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 1987, pg 7)Finding all of the proper axioms for such a mathematical theory of intelligence is still an open and difficult problem, however. Hutter places great stock in Occam's razor. But there is experimental evidence that Occam's razor is incorrect. (The Myth of Simplicity, M. Bunge, Prentice-Hall, 1963) See also, Machine Learning, Tom Mitchell, McGraw-Hill, 1997, pg 65-66. Rather than saying that nature IS simple I believe that it is more correct to say that we are forced to approximate nature with simple models because \"our\" (both human and AI) memory and processing power is limited.I am also unsure that we should assume a scalar utility. In Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (Princeton U. Press, 1944, pg 19-20) von Neumann and Morgenstern said: \"We have conceded that one may doubt whether a person can always decide which of two alternatives...he prefers...It leads to what may be described as a many-dimensional vector concept of utility.\" Vector utility (value pluralism) has been employed in AI in my Asa H system (Trans. Kansas Academy of Science, vol. 109, # 3/4, pg 159, 2006)I suppose, then, that I object to the word \"Universal\" in Hutter's title.I think that he is exploring only one kind of intelligence and that there are others.",
            "Artificial Intelligence has proven to be one of those elusive holy grails of computing. Playing chess (very, very well) has proven possible, while driving a car or surviving in the wilderness is a long, long way from possible. Even the definition of these problems has proven impossible.This book first makes the assumption that unlimited computational resources are available, and then proceeds to develop a universal theory of decision making to derive a rational reinforcement learning agent.Even this approach is incomputable and impossible to implement. Chapter 7 presents a modified approach that will reduce the computational requirements, although they remain huge.Chapter 8 summarizes the assumptions, problems, limitations, performance of this approach, and concludes with some less technical remarks on various philosophical issues.This is a highly theoretical book that describes the state of the art in AI approaches. Each chapter concludes with a series of problems which vary from \"Very Easy, solvable from the top of your head\" to \"If you can solve this you should publish it in the professional literature.\"This is the state of the art as it exists today."

        "description": "An internationally recognized scientist presents his theories and associated technology for the coming generations of adaptive intelligent machines. In this extraordinary book, the pioneer of research in collective learning systems (an adaptive learning paradigm for artificial intelligence) describes the processes of cognition, postulates a fundamental adaptive building block for assembling very large scale collective learning systems (the learning cell), and proposes a design for the ultimate machine: a hierarchical network of 100 million learning cells that could exhibit the full range of cognitive capabilities of the human mind. The author predicts that using the classical \"expert system\" approach to create such a vast knowledge base would require thousands of years to program all the rules. As a feasible alternative, he explains how a massive collective learning system could achieve this goal in about 20 years, much as humans do. Based on natural biological precedents, a collective learning system acquires its knowledge through trial-and-error interaction with the real world. To put it all in proper perspective, the author introduces a theory of games for modeling the various processes of the universe, presents a futuristic glimpse of the creation of the first artificially cognitive being, and discusses the philosophical issues raised by the prospect of creating machines that exhibit human-like cognition. Two chapters are devoted to the design and evaluation of collective learning systems. The final chapter presents the remarkable results of an on-going international research project directed by the author, a parallel-processing collective learning system that simulates the sub-symbolic adaptive vision functions of the brain.",

In part, this might be because you are aware that AI has been studied intensively in academia for decades. But you are interested in practical and successful deployments.In this sense, the book is quite optimistic. It explains the mainstays of AI. Along the way, we meet such things as the Turing Test to see if a machine can mimic a human. Also, we see MIT's Eliza. Famed since the 70s, despite its primitive text interface.For current applications, the authors give a good survey of the field. From manufacturing case studies to finance. Like discerning good credit risks. The book also discusses neural nets, which are sometimes seen as a different and competing approach to AI."

        "description": "A day does not go by without a news article reporting some amazing breakthrough in artificial intelligence (AI). Many philosophers, futurists, and AI researchers have conjectured that human-level AI will be developed in the next 20 to 200 years. If these predictions are correct, it raises new and sinister issues related to our future in the age of intelligent machines. Artificial Superintelligence: A Futuristic Approach directly addresses these issues and consolidates research aimed at making sure that emerging superintelligence is beneficial to humanity. While specific predictions regarding the consequences of superintelligent AI vary from potential economic hardship to the complete extinction of humankind, many researchers agree that the issue is of utmost importance and needs to be seriously addressed. Artificial Superintelligence: A Futuristic Approach discusses key topics such as: AI-Completeness theory and how it can be used to see if an artificial intelligent agent has attained human level intelligence Methods for safeguarding the invention of a superintelligent system that could theoretically be worth trillions of dollars Self-improving AI systems: definition, types, and limits The science of AI safety engineering, including machine ethics and robot rights Solutions for ensuring safe and secure confinement of superintelligent systems The future of superintelligence and why long-term prospects for humanity to remain as the dominant species on Earth are not great Artificial Superintelligence: A Futuristic Approach is designed to become a foundational text for the new science of AI safety engineering. AI researchers and students, computer security researchers, futurists, and philosophers should find this an invaluable resource.",

            "What is this book all about? It is all about a mind-blowing universal law of nature. Mind-blowing, because it is unbelievable that at the end of the 20th century a new fundamental principle can be laid down. Here it would be of use to remind one shocking lesson in the history of humanity's understanding of the universe. More than 22 centuries ago a Greek astronomer, Aristarchus of Samos, revealed that our planet actually rotates and revolves around the Sun. But only in the 15th century Copernicus dared to boldly recognized this fact of nature thus refuting the long established myth of the Ptolemaic geocentric system. Now from this generous with fresh ideas publication we learn another mind-bogling suggestion that all fundamental processes are reversible, or all processes in Nature stand in a relation of convertibility. And on reading the book one starts to believe that the principle of reversibility appears to be universal as the genetic code for all living things. Besides, on reading the book our everspecialized boffins and academics could eventually know why each physical effect has its inverse counterpart, chemical reactions are reversible, and basic biological processes turn the other way round. To prove his thesis, author created an extremely wide but precise theory of reality which reveals a single underlying mechanism of all natural, mental, and social processes and explains a challenging secret of nature - the causes of the cycling of matter and energy in it. From AI viewpoint, Abdoullaev's comprehensive and exact ontology may well serve as the fundamental knowledge framework for artificial systems with general intelligence, and it looks much superior in conceptual principle and practical application of extant immature and idisyncratic ontologies now hastely constructed for multifarious Web-based intelligent systems projects. Don't want to play a visionary and don't like bombastic stile, but the discovery of the universal law of revesibility is likely to come the most important contibution in the history of modern science and technology. Also the book is sure to become the number one intellectual event although it was not published by a prestigious publisher like the MIT Press preferring to feed us with cut and dried academic materials, as well as regardless of damning opinions of those one-star reviewers. Although, it is pity that the book missed their attention, then it could be distributed worldwide. But thank goodness, it's not lost in the sea of information noise. Let's not make the sad error with Aristarchus' discovery a sort of intellectual fault that is typical for human minds. Apart from this, we are already overloaded with many sorts of &quot;the idols of the mind&quot;.",

What is the most promising way to proceed in order to find the intellectual structure within which at least some central questions can be formulated and reduced to problem solving? This volume suggests one avenue. It places at the center of the investigation some simple tasks of memory and learning, and advocates that these tasks be investigated by means of detailed computational models.\"Here are some representative quotations from the book:\"The aspect of reasoning that we are particularly concerned with here is so called commensense reasoning. This is the process that humans use to cope with the mundane but complex aspects of the world in evaluating everyday situations. It is reasoning that is generally done subconsciously. It is perhaps precisely because we have no awareness of these processes that it has proved to difficult to simulate them in machines. No one has yet made a home cleaning robot that can execute its task with reasonable flexibility and commonsense.\" (Pg. 159)\"The major stumbling block at first seemed to be the philosophical problem raised by inductive learning, an aspect of cognition that seems impossible to evade. We believe now that computational learning theory gives an adequate view on this. It explains how it may be possible for a system to learn to cope in a world that is too complex for it to describe or understand.\" (Pg. 203-204)",

With this book you will know which method will best suit you task.",
            "The only reason I am giving this book three stars is that no other serious publication I know of discusses behavior based robotics. However, that being said, this book uses a lot of pages and costs a lot of dollars to explain a rather simple concept. It is an elegant concept, and I do take my hat off to Mr. Arkin for getting to the heart of the matter clearly and with good illustrations. But is it a concept that requires almost 500 pages? I don't really think so. Simply put, behavior-based robotics does not use an internal model of its environment. For instance, there is no programming in the robot of what a chair looks like, or what kind of surface the robot is moving on - all the information is gleaned from the input of the robot's sensors. The robot uses that information to react to the changes in its environment as those changes occur. State machines are at the heart of the design of any behavior-based robot. For example, a foraging robot would probably have four states describing its behavior in response to its sensors: wandering and looking for food, picking up food, homing towards the nest, and avoiding obstacles.This book is a very easy read, although at times it seems repetitive. It does not really require any particular technical background in order to understand it, although to really appreciate the concept you should already be familiar with robotic design concepts.Some really good implementations of the concepts in this book are at a website authored by Craig Reynolds. To find it, type \"Steering behaviors for autonomous characters\" into Google, and it should be the first address listed. Mr. Reynolds' site has a paper on his extensions of behavior-based concepts, as well as some Java applets demonstrating his methods.",
            "Outstanding introduction to the field of behaviour-based robot control. Completely accessible to the non-expert. It starts off with a good treatment of perception and action in animals as motivation. Goes on to discuss different aspects of behavioural control, including formal methods, architectures, various implementations, theoretical limitations, and so on.I use this book as a reference, to help me with my own research into control architectures. Arkin is a leader in this field. Many (most!) of the recent research papers that I've seen cite this book. I think it should be on your bookshelf if you're a researcher or practitioner of AI.",

Although it discusses some the most important and popular work in behavior based AI from the past 20 years, the coverage of these subjects is quite weak. Many pages are devoted to explaining the obvious or irrelevant in excruciating detail. This text is lacking in substance and is definitely not worth its...price tag.",

Not only with the good theoretical explanations along with the real examples, but also for settling down into engineering research what is mostly a philosofical approach.Excellent for standarizing, nomenclatures, and complete fundament on BBR research and works.If anything bad can be said is the 10-years old fact, and the lack of techniques such as ANFIS and other cooperative control strategies for multiple robots.",

            "Artificial intelligence research goes back to the 1940s as do the first developments in electronic computers. Perlovsky traces the history of AI in a thoughtful and scholarly manner, emphasizing his philosophy and his own generalization of the theory which he calls Modeling Field Theory (MFT). He also traces the study of intelligence back to the Greek philosophers beginning with Plato and Aristotle some 2300 years ago.The book however, provides more than just a philosophy for artificial intelligence. It mixes in some very important mathematics from the disciplines of engineering, statistics and computer science. Mathematical techniques and models have been particularly useful in the solution to problems in classification, clustering, pattern recognition, rule-based expert system development, multiple-target tracking, orbit determination and Kalman filtering, and time series prediction.Perlovsky, over the course of his career, has had a great deal of involvement in the development of this research in both his consulting work and his work at Nichols Research Corporation. I know a lot about this because, in 1980 I began working at the Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo California as a MTS (statistician). I worked on statistical problems including Kalman filtering, image processing, image recognition, orbit determination, rule-based expert systems, multiple-target tracking and target discrimination. When I moved over to manage the tracking and discrimination algorithm development for the Air Force's Space Surveillance and Tracking System I became familar with the work being done for us by contractors that included Nichols Research Corporation (NRC). I became very familar with the work of Perlovsky and his colleagues at Nichols Research who supported us from the Newport Beach, Colorado Springs and Boston offices of the company on the multiple-target tracking algorithms and the target classification algorithms. I found the work to be so interesting and of such high quality that I joined NRC in 1988.Perlovsky sees artifical intelligence as a very practical discipline and believes that computing machines can do a good job of at least mimicking human intelligence through the use of a priori knowledge (as rules preprogrammed into the computer or a priori probability distributions) along with experience (collected data from observational or statistical designed studies) combined using algorithms (Bayes theorem, adaptive neural networks) based on the mathematical foundation of uncertainty incorporated through probability theory and/or fuzzy set theory.In my experience, I have found rule-based expert systems to be one of the major successful developments in the field of artificial intelligence. At the heart of these systems lies the tools of mathematics and statistics, including the discriminant or classification algorithms based on multivariate Gaussian models (linear and quadratic classifiers) and the nonparametric classification algorithms (kernel discriminant algorithms and classification tree algorithms). Also, patterns can be discovered by computers through the use of clustering algorithms based on Gaussian mixture models or nonparametric techniques like nearest neighbor rules.The Bayesian approach to statistical analysis has been useful in many areas including the Kalman filter. In Kalman filtering prior knowledge plus current data is used to update the estimate of the current state and for the prediction of the future state of a dynamic system using a simple recursive algorithm that is easily updated in the computer. Many of these developments are well characterized and developed from first principles in this text.Perlovsky emphasizes his own work including the MLANS system which is a neural network system that incorporates important statistical ideas such as maximum likelihood, the Cramer-Rao inequality and statistical efficiency along with the neural network architecture.Some of this work was developed by Perlovsky under an Army contract that was coincidentally managed by my brother Julian. I have always viewed this research as being successful because it applied appropriate statistical models to the real problems. I think the crucial aspects of this work are the appropriate use of the Bayesian paradigm and teh indentification of appropriate models for construction of the likelihood equations. The fundamental and well established tools of probability and statistics are the keys. In his proposals, Leonid also included ideas from fuzzy set theory and embedded his methods in an artificial neural network framework. I always thought that these modern theories (fuzzy set theory and neural networks) were gimmicks to get military funding. This may not have been a fair assessment on my part as a careful reading of this book indicates that Perlovsky honestly views these tools as important.There are subtleties to concepts such as fuzzy set theory. Although I do not yet see its value as a substitute for measure theoretic probability theory for characterizing human uncertainty, it is possible that I just haven't thought hard enough about it. Maybe a continued reading and rereading of Perlovsky's book will help me.This is a very interesting and unique book on artificial intelligence from a perspective that is quite different from what one find in the standard books written by computer scientists (who often do not have the deep understanding of probability and statistics that Perlovsky possesses).",
            "Perlovsky has published a large number of papers exploring limitations associated with today's main approaches to AI. This book captures the essence of those papers with the addition of developing and expanding Perlovsky's philosophy of AI.Perlovsky takes the reader through the development of AI from its behaviouristic beginnings through Minsky's &quot;revolution&quot; of purely symbolic AI. He then goes through some more recent methods of combining both methods with some adaptive learning techniques. For all cases Perlovsky clearly demonstrates the inherent limitations of all methods through analytic means.He then presents his view on a possible way forward though adaptive networks employing fuzzy logic, illustrated with some examples such as work done on SAR image analysis. Throughout the book he provides many examples and certainly this will make an excellent advanced textbook for the field of AI.I am particularly impressed by his good overview and development of his philosophical views. After years of books by people like the Churchland's, Chalmers, Searle and Hofstadter this is finally a great example of someone who is not afraid to cut through the fluff and expose the real problem to further progress. This should be required reading for anyone looking into philosophy, in particular the philosophy of mind and science. The references are very valuable and Perlovsky and done an excellent job of listing many.That said, there are a few points I would suggest for the next edition of this book. First, I find it odd that Perlovsky seems unaware of Chaitin's work in algorithmic information theory, particularly his book &quot;The Limits of Mathematics&quot;. Considering Perlovsky's many references to Godel and Turing this is a glaring omission. Also, he is missing a reference to Wilson's excellent &quot;Spikes, Decisions, and Actions : The Dynamical Foundations of Neurosciences&quot;, possibly because it is also a very recent publication. These three books belong together!Perlovsky also needs to answer the issues posed by Susan Haack (&quot;Deviant Logic, Fuzzy Logic : Beyond the Formalism&quot;) regarding the viability of fuzzy logic and better-define the methods that are the &quot;correct&quot; interpretation when applied to neural networks. I would hope to see an expansion on this theme in the future.There are some irritating small problems, the most major being the spelling of &quot;Plank&quot; throughout the text; someone's spellcheck was acting up I guess...The index is a bit thin as well.An excellent book and, as stated in the other reveiw, &quot;must&quot; reading for anyone interested in the future of AI. Perlovsky, Chaitin, Prigogine, Wilson and James H. Austin (&quot;Zen and the Brain&quot;) are to be applauded for breaking with the current strangling hold of ancient thought.",
            "The book is a fascinating review of concepts in philosophy, semiotics, and mathematics of intelligence; it is interesting for a wide audience, not just for mathematicians. The author relates mathematics and philosophy and finds detailed and specific connections, suggesting that the evolution of mathematics of intelligence during the last fifty years paralleled the evolution of philosophy of mind beginning from Plato. The author develops mathematical techniques for semiotics, which reconciles the differences among concepts in classical semiotics. He argues that *symbol* as understood in general culture is a process relating conscious and unconscious, and he proposes modifications in semiotic terminology needed to bring in correspondence varying usages of this term. A most intriguing is a chapter that connects the mathematics to Kantian theory; an ability for perceiving beauty, concludes the author, is associated with learning. A useful feature of the book is the proposed course outlines for mathematically prepared students and for non-mathematicians.",
            "The book offers a fresh view of artificial intelligence (AI). Particularly interesting is the drawn analogy between longstanding philosophical questions and problems of modern AI. Even though the knowledge of modern statistical and math concepts is required to understand technical issues most of the ideas are explained on the intuitive level. The key technical problem discussed in this book is multiple model identification from overlapping data samples. The problem is related to computer-based vision, radar target tracking, financial market analysis, and speech recognition. The combinatorial explosion of computational complexity usually is associated with this class of problems and present the great challenge for modern computational science. The author reviews contemporary mathematical approaches, argues that the problem is related to differences between Plato and Aristotle about origin of human intelligence, and explores various approaches among works of famous philosophers in human history. Finally a non-combinatorial solution is offered through the introduction of novel Modeling Field Theory, that combines fuzzy logic with learning and adaptation. This book is a must read for people working with AI.",
            "While this book is not mainstream and would not be a good place to try to begin to learn AI it is thought provoking and presents a number of new ideas. Where Rod Brooks seaks to eliminate internal models Perlovsky makes them a part of his definition of intelligence. I rather liked the philosophical slant of the book. Perlovsky expects to overcome complexity using fuzzy logic. Looked at from Allen Newell's multiple levels or bands perspective fuzzy logic is an extension of classical logic and in any real computer is implemented by a lower level (underlying level) of ordinary Boolean logic. It would seem to me that different granularities at each level would accomplish the same thing. Rules in first order logic can represent subsymbolic entities just as easily as they represent macroscopic objects and actions. Perlovsky presents an interesting MLANS architecture but gives rather less detail on a hierachical version. The computational complexity of these recurrent networks looks rather high to me. Perlovsky's book is a good challenge to those who have already studied some traditional AI and connectionist literature. He criticizes nearest neighbor (and CBR) systems but it seens to me that they offer some very fast parallel implementations such as Kanerva's distributed memory and Stanfill and Waltz's memory-based reasoning.",
            "This is an important book, but it would be more useful if it didn't have so many errors in the equations. Chapter 5, for example, states that the rates are a part of the model, but the equations on pages 210-213 only define the rates, but never use them. Equation 5.2-11 should have det(Cbar) in the numerator. There are many more errors like these in just the MLANS description in Chapter 5."
