            "I read this book in order to survive a law class. I also used it when I had an interview with the Office of Civil Rights. This book may feel cursory but it covers a large array of material. For those who are constantly suspicious about facing discrimination in the workplace, it may be especially enlightening. Though I gave my copy to a friend not involved in the law, I do worry about it being misused by laypeople. For example, you could be blatantly discriminated against, and this book may point to cases that reflect your own situation. However, if you missed a statute of limitations or your employer doesn't have a sizeable number of workers, etc., your case may be a loser. Still, filing with local anti-discrimination office is supposed to be free and of no prejudice to the worker. Since this summarizes the everyday law, it is not a cute, easy read. But it is useful.",
            "This book provides a very good overview of the federal law of employment discrimination. While not incredibly detailed about every statute, this book gives you the bread and butter of what you need to know about each of the statues you would study.Good for a quick review of the subject to go along with your casebook.",
            "This book provides a good overview of federal employment discrimination law. However, the book is riddled with typos and grammatical errors - enough to make any reasonable reader doubt the credibility of the work as a whole. I would recommend this book as a supplement to, but definitely not a replacement of, assigned casebook reading."

            "This book reveals shocking statistics about Black males in Detroit and speaks of a Afrocentric school environment that can help them. It even seems like the first years have rendered positive results. What was most profound to me was that these educators were saying, \"You can't wait until their teen years to ask how we can improve these males' academic performance. You must start almost from day one.\" I would much rather folk try something to address a problem than nothing. However, I think this book might not be as true as it was during its publication a decade ago.The authors say, \"This type of school is in court, but so far we've won cases.\" I'm no lawyer, but I think those courts decided that male-focused schools like these are illegal as gender discrimination. This book doesn't say, but the problems that these males face is not due to females in the classroom. Yes, it's sad that some young Black males only get hired by drug-dealers, and not legitimate employees. However, their female classmates didn't cause that. I recently read a book about female-only schools published this decade and it said, \"Male-only schools [like Malcolm X Academy] have been deemed illegal, so can it's opposite still stand?\"I attended Berkeley during the years when California killed affirmative action in its schools. More professors and student groups tried to mentor youngsters hoping they would be Berkeley-qualified in the future. However, I don't know if those efforts have lasted to today. There's the issue of burn-out. Just because someone mentors a Black male one year doesn't mean they'll be doing the same every year to infinity. Due to my personal experience, I'm just worried that the excitement of the novelty of the Academy may not have lasted forever. Michigan is facing severe unemployment problems now and I would guess this could negatively impact this school and its promotion of mentors and parental involvement.This book was both scant and hodgepodge. If you already know about bad statistics facing Black males, you won't be surprised here. The reflection chapter was nothing like the national resources chapter which was nothing like the results chapter. It's just all over the place. The authors state that they work with the Nation of Islam and that is a controversial group that some in the Michigan public may fear.Too I think about how the incentives listed wouldn't have worked for me. The authors say students can't play sports unless their grades are up and \"citizenship\" is good. Well, I hate sports, so that would not be a carrot I would want to bite. I just wonder if this school is truly interested in helping ALL young Black males and not just certain ones."

It explains that racism does not persist because of ignorant, uneducated white people, but because the capitalist rulers of America find racism too useful and profitable to part with. To prove this thesis, Camejo goes into fascinating detail about how Radical Reconstruction began to transform the American south, as Blacks, armed with guns and the right to vote, began to direct their own destiny. He then shows how the Republican Party abandoned Blacks as the Party consolidated its economic grip on the south, and \"reconstructed\" it in their own capitalist image. His analysis of the \"Myth of the 1877 Compromise,\" which historians have mystified for so many years, is particularly helpful. Finally, Camejo does a great job of showing how and why other historians have failed to explain these truths clearly to generations of students. Don't miss this book!!!"

She investigates psychosocial issues unique to mixed race children. Also, experiences that influenced their adjustment in a country that has subjected them to racist abuses from the white as well as black side of the racial divide and has shoehorned them into a racial category that denies half of their physiological and psychological existence are explored.",

I enjoyed hearing about their longings, ambitions, social lives and love relationships. I was also very pleased that she challenged some of the myths that have tainted the image of interracial people.

This book, however, is an incredible mix of excerpts from dozens of interviews with interracial people, as well as an on-point analysis of the import of what they are saying. The book also speaks to many things that interracial people think and feel, but seldom discuss with others.I am glad someone wrote this book as it relates to far more than just black / white mixes. Indeed, it relates to any racial or cross-cultural mix.",

Where are no cultural diverse classes here for anyone here to take. This year we got a new program called Cultural Anthropology. I feel that it is necessary for everyone not just African-Americans to take a cultural diverse class to learn more about someone of another race or creed. I feel that as far as we have come as a society there are still some things we have yet to accomplish. Being the only Black in most of my classes I feel it is necessary for everyone to understand and comprehend how someone else feels and understand there history and why they, if they do, feel the way they do about certain subjects.

            "I think that it is worthwhile to refute hate speech. And this book does a good job of that.As the author says, \"the Jews have had it better than the Blacks in America, in no small part because of the historical advantage derived from the biological accident of white skin.\" Well, lighter skin. However, \"if the Nation of Islam - in junior partnership with white racist antisemites - does somehow transform the U. S. into a country where Black-Jewish cooperation towards goals of minority rights and social justice becomes impossible,\" Jews and Blacks will both suffer.The author says that \"those who lie to us about the past foreclose our chance to shape the future.\"There are numerous untruths in \"The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews.\" Brackman exposes many of them in this book. The untruths include claims that Jews \"dominated\" the slave trade in Medieval Europe, Africa, Latin America, and New England. In fact, Jews played a minor role in all these locations, while Arabs seem to have been the biggest slave traders in Africa. \"According to the African historian J. E. Inikori, Arab slavers between the years 650 and 1900 drained Black Africa of 14.4 million people - more than most estimates of slave exports to the Americas during the 400 years of the Atlantic slave trade.\"What about Southern Jews? Yes, there were some Southern Jewish slaveowners. In 1830, there were about 225,000 Southern families who owned slaves, including 322 Jewish families. About 59,000 of the families owned twenty or more slaves, including 23 Jewish ones. About 11,000 of the families owned fifty or more slaves including 4 Jewish ones. By the way, the author points out that some \"persons of color\" owned slaves too. These colored slaveowners \"outnumbered the Jewish ones by fifteen to one.\"I want all humans to be happy and prosperous, not poor and miserable. And I think we'll have a better chance of that if we value truth, justice, and human rights. This book is to be praised for taking a step in that direction. I recommend it.",
            "This book is a refutation ofThe Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jewsby the Nation of Islam.Here are some quotations from this 1994 book:\"Some anti-Jewish stereotypes have a kernal of truth underneath the grotesque exaggeration. After all, there were Jewish moneylenders in medieval Europe and Jewish slave traders in the antebellum South. But other charges against the Jews---e.g., ritual murder, well-poisoning---have no plausible basis in reality.\" (Pg. 31)\"'The Secret Relationship' is an anonymous production. 'The Historical Research Department' identifies no individual members, nor does it indicate their academic credentials. In other words, those responsible themselves remain secret---choosing to hide behind rather than stand behind their scholarship.\" (Pg. 45)\"Jacob R. Marcus is the leading authority on American Jewry during the colonial period. He is quoted twenty-seven times in 'The Secret Relationship' and cited on numerous other occasions. Never once is his conclusion acknowledged that 'Jewish participation was minimal' in the slave trade with Africa.\" (Pg. 50-51)\"Black Africa experienced a slow bleed over hundreds of years. The world Jewish community experienced a massive hemorrhage---six million of eighteen million murdered---over just five years.\" (Pg. 98)",

When an author disproves a noted religious figure's statements, and that figure's adherents demonstrate an inexplicable refusal to deny that the statements were made, you can usually be certain that the author is correct.Louis Farrakhan demonstrates that you don't have to be a white Christian to be a dangerous racist spreading lies and promoting genocide---he's actually the only non-white non-Christian that I know of who is doing so in this country---but that's about all.",
            "I suspect, (and I am Man enough to say that I could be wrong) from the material presented here, that there is a huge degree of fallacy contained within the pages of this book. Let me point out a few things:1)It was stated that (European)Jewish slavers enslaved only pagan white slaves, and that Jewish slavers ceased to be involved in 1000A.D., 500 years before slaveships started carting off enslaved Africans out of Africa. Yes, there were some Africans who sold out their own African Brothers and Sisters, in service to their White Massa. Yes, there have been cases of white-on-white violence and enslavement, but if European Jews ceased to be involved in the slave trade, and if they were not involved in the TransAtlantic Slave Trade,and if European Jewish slave traders had no part whatsoever in enslaving Black people, as this book states, THEN HOW DID A LOT OF BLACK PEOPLE all over the African Diaspora END UP WITH EUROPEAN JEWISH LAST NAMES such as WALKER, WINKLER, TURNER, COLEMAN, KAUFMAN, AND CONE? Malcolm X (and other Black and SOME White Historians) was not lying when he talked about how European slavemasters forced their names, particularly THEIR LAST NAMES, on African people, to signify their status as property of their WHITE slavemasters. Therefore, the purpose of the X is to signify the UNKNOWN AFRICAN NAME that Black people originally had before being enslaved.2)There is a lot of emphasis on the Arabs enslaving Africans, and I've seen a lot of white people and IGNORANT Black people say, \"Why do you Black Muslims claim the religion of your Arab Slavemasters? Don't you know that Arabs were enslaving Africans before the TransAtlantic Slave Trade?!!!\" First of all, yes, there were, and still are some Arabs that are and were enslaving Black people. And there were some cases where some Africans had other Africans in bondage. However, this is NO COMPARISON WHATSOEVER to, and DOES NOT NEGATE OR DIMINISH the slavery that EUROPEANS unleashed on AFRICANS, ASIANS, INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, OCEANIC PEOPLES, and SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLES OF COLOR. Why?1)It was the EUROPEAN who developed and practiced CHATTEL SLAVERY, which is designed to reduce the enslaved to a subhuman state by nearly killing the slave - a state less than a dog. Howard Zinn even states this very same thing in A PEOPLE'S HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.2)And before anybody says, \"Well,there were Free Black people who enslaved Black people, or Indians who enslaved Black people brutally in places such as Louisiana\", let me say this: YOU CANNOT have Non-whites enslaving other Non-whites without first having WHITES ENSLAVING NON-WHITES.3)In the book, THE HISTORY OF SLAVERY, by Susanne Everett, she shows how GREEKS AND ROMANS were enslaving African peoples LONG BEFORE the Arabs even thought about it. The Arabs did not come into Africa until the 7th Century A.D. The Greeks came into Africa roughly around the 8th Century B.C., then the Romans came in roughly around the 3rd-2nd Century B.C. Obviously this would have been SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS (roughly around 1400-1500 some odd years) before the Arabs even touched African soil. Therefore, it is MATHEMATICALLY and TRUTHFULLY impossible and assinine to state, \"well the Arabs were enslaving Blacks before the Europeans\". Also:a)on pg.15, Susanne Everett states:It is an uncomfortable fact that the Greeks. . .were UTTERLY DEPENDENT on slavery. THE ABOLITIONOF SLAVERY IN GREECE WOULD HAVE DISRUPTED THEWHOLE FABRIC OF ITS SOCIETY. From the 6th centuryB.C. in ATHENS and otherGREEK CITIES, slavery effectively replacedother forms of dependent labor. For the Greeksof the classical period (480-338 B.C.) it wasUNTHINKABLE THAT SOCIETY SHOULD BE ORGANIZED INANY OTHER WAY. Plato's REPUBLIC was firmly basedON SLAVE LABOR, although he drew the line, in war,at enslaving his fellow Greeks - he advisedsoldiers to 'keep their hands off one anotherand turn their energies AGAINST FOREIGNERS'.b)On page 17, there is a picture of a Roman slavemarket, with 8 slaves. One of the slaves is aBLACK WOMAN; the other slaves are Whites ofdifferent ages, and genders.c)On page 12, there is an excerpt from THE ODDYSEY,dealing with slavery, and a caption which statesthat,\"Slaves in Ancient Greece . . .were none theless the absolute CHATTELS of their masters. . .\"d)On page 25 is a picture of a statue of a Nubian/Kemetan slave that was a house slave in a Greekhouse. The caption reads, \"The Household SlavesOf Ancient Greece\". A caption reads that thestatue is of, \"a black slave boy probably boughtFROM THE UPPER NILE\", and that he is leaningagainst an amphora, a Grecian vase.4)In the documentary, \"A Great and Mighty Walk\", The late great Dr. John Henrick Clarke talks about how the Ancient Africans were asking the Arabs to get their Greek and Roman slave masters off their backs. He says (and this is nearly an exact quote), \"They (the Arabs) did get their European slavemasters off the Africans' backs - but the Arabs also REPLACED them on the African's backs\". He goes on to show and discuss how the Arabs introduced Africans to Allah and the enslavement that they brought along with that.5)Michael Bradley, a white historian, talks about the Hyksos, a EURASIAN predecessor of White Jews, who invaded Kemet in the 15th Century B.C. and enslaved several of the Kemetan people (who by the way, WERE BLACK AFRICANS). He speaks of the hypocrisy of how the Exodus story has been taught to have us thinking that White Jews were enslaved in Egypt, when it was actually the other way around - the Hyksos, predecessors of White Jews, unleashed a brutal enslavement on the Black Kemetans, for roughly 400 some years (Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm............), until they were driven out by the Black Pharaoh Ahmose I. By the way, this would have been some 1500 years BEFORE the year 1000 A.D., when European Jewish slavers \"ceased to be involved\" in the slave trade, as this author would have people to believe.6)Before anyone yells out reverse racism or rants about this being \"Anti-Semitic\", let me quote Roman historian TACITUS who wrote this in the 1ST CENTURY (Hmmmmm. . .Who else lived in the 1st Century?Hint: he was hung on a cross):\"Many say that the Jews come from ETHIOPIA.\"7)Dr. Yosef Ben-Jochannon talks about the original Jews who were and STILL ARE of AFRICAN ORIGIN, in WE, THE BLACK JEWS.I don't agree with everything Farrakhan says, but he does speak a lot of truths that ameriKKKa refuses to deal with. I also doubt that the author of THIS BOOK has studied Farrakhan or the Nation of Islam with any serious depth to effectively critique what the N.O.I. has said, shown, and proved. I also doubt that he met with Tony Martin to discuss what Tony Martin published, either; or if he did, he probably had a MONOLOG instead of a DIALOGUE with Tony Martin. I also doubt that he has studied the ORIGINAL origins of the Jewish people, as I have stated in points 6 and 7, above. And I SERIOUSLY doubt that what I stated above, could be refuted, which in closing, would render Harold Brackman's book faulty. Find out for yourself.",
            "Harold Brackman's work here brings several questions for a reader to deal with. What is/was the motive for even writing a refutation to the Nation of Islam's book? In analyizing the references and cross-referencing said references with the NOI book, it becomes apparent that Harold Brackman's sources are extremely faulty, outright distortions, with degrees of hyperbole mixed in.The main question a studious reader must ask is, what is it about the jewish people, both past and currently, incites so much examination? This examination includes the scisms within jewish culture, how jewish people conduct commerce, the defense of the nation/state of israel to name few. Harold Brackman's work, we come to find out has been paid for by his jewish employers. That fact alone is cause for some skepticism as to the acurracy of his sources and his motives for writing the book. Corrolatively, one has to ask a similar question regarding the NOI research department in writing their book.Since the jewish people's motives seemed to get attacked by various groups and individuals, it would be intelligent to answer the question, what precisely is anti-semitism, and is being jewish a racial category separate from the acrual religion of judiasm? Harold Brackman's work would have gone alot further in establishing a dialogue if the above questions had of been placed in his discussion, and answered cogently by jewish person's. Lastly, for the reader who is looking for a validation of vitrol against the NOI, Harold Brackman provides this activity. This work is not unbiased. As a reader of this work, I continually asked the question, is there a definition of racism clearly gleaned from this work or not. The answer was no! It would be much more sensible if jewish leaders convened an intelligent forum or conference, and addressed the NOI work to the public. If jewish leaders would do this, then this work might be taken a bit more seriously than simply a BLACK male scholar being used as a pawn in a very trecherous game.This book is not work it's purchase price!!",

            "In this book, I believe Paul Laurence Dunbar used fictional characters to protray his thoughts about how the black race was thought of in the mid-1990s. He was accalimed for his way of bringing concern to the topic of racial discrimination through writing. The novel kept me interested, but wasn't something to make a movie out of.",
            "Paul Laurence Dunbar's novel &quot;The Sport of the Gods&quot; describes the experiences of an African-American family in the years following the abolition of slavery. According to the introduction by William L. Andrews in the Signet Classic edition of the novel, &quot;Sport&quot; first appeared in &quot;Lippincott's&quot; magazine in 1901 and was published in book form a year later.After a disturbing turn of events, the Hamilton family leaves their home in the southern U.S. and makes their way to New York City, where they try to start a new life. But the pressures of urban life have serious consequences for each member of the family.&quot;Sport&quot; is a story about injustice, innocence, and temptation. As he follows this family's story, Dunbar looks at many different relationships: parent/child, husband/wife, black/white, etc. Particularly interesting is his look at the relationship between the media reporter and those who are the object of media reports. The book also presents an ironic view of artists and their connection to larger society.&quot;Sport&quot; is a dark, moralistic tale. Although the characterizations are fairly shallow, Dunbar's narrative moves along effectively. I actually found the most intriguing character to be Skaggs, a white reporter for a &quot;yellow&quot; newspaper. This novel serves as an ironic complement to those slave autobiographies (such as the &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot;) which depict a flight to the north as a liberating experience; the north in &quot;Sport&quot; is a cold, amoral place full of dangers for black people. Overall, this is a compelling book that I regard as a significant milestone in African-American literature.",
            "Please disregard the comments on the review below. To begin with, &quot;The Sport of the Gods&quot; is not a commentary on the mid 90's! It is a novel from the early 20th century about the hardships of the negro race in the northern urban areas (NY in this case). The novel is a bit harsh in its depiction of prejudice but that is precisely what makes it most compelling. The lack of hope presented in it is a social commentary about both the white and the black trying to rise up from slavery. In general the book is excellent, sad at some points, funny at others, but mainly it is one of the jewels of American literature which needs to be read by all regardless of ethnicity.",
            "Paul Laurence Dunbar (1872 -- 1906)is best remembered as a poet. He wrote in both dialect and formal English. His famous poems include \"We wear the mask\", \"Sympathy\", which includes the line \"I know why the caged bird sings\", and \"Frederick Douglass\". Dunbar wrote prolifically during his short life, with an output that included essays, journalism, plays, short stories as well as poetry. Dunbar was also a novelist. His final effort in this form \"The Sport of the Gods\" (1902) remains an impressive work, a minor classic of American literature.Dunbar's novel describes the fate of an African American family, the Hamiltons, which is forced to move from its home in the deep South (the particular State is not named) to New York City. The Hamiltons had seemingly achieved a degree of success and stability in the post-Civil War South. The father, Berry, had worked as a butler for a prosperous plantation owner, Oakley, for many years. Berry had lived frugally, and managed to save money. His wife, Fannie, also had a good job working as a housekeeper for the Oakleys. The couple had two children, Joe, 18, a barber to white people who had become a dandy, and Kitty, 16, her mother's darling. The peaceful life of the family comes to a startling end when Oakley falsely accuses Berry Hamilton of stealing. Berry is sentenced to ten years in prison. His family is ostracized by whites and blacks alike. Fannie, Joe, and Kitty move to New York City to find a new life for themselves.The heart of this novel lies in Dunbar's descriptions of the underside of New York City life -- the hustlers, bars, tawdry shows, raw music, and loose women -- that spell doom to the newcomers from the South. Much of the action takes place in a nightclub called \"The Banner\", frequented by African Americans and by a class of whites who, then as in later times, practiced what is now termed \"slumming\". Dunbar has no affection or sentimenality for \"The Banner\" or its ilk. He writes: \"[O]f course, the place was a social cesspool, generating a poisonous miasma and reeking with the stench of decayed and rotten moralities. There is no defense to be made for it. But what do you expect when false idealism and fevered ambition come face to face with catering cupidity?\" Some of the frequenters of the banner include a con-man and raconteur named Sadness, the best-drawn character in Dunbar's book, a chorus girl named Hattie, and William Thomas, a railway worker with designs on young Kitty.The destruction of the Hamilton family proceeds naturally and inexorably in this environment and becomes \"The Sport of the Gods\". Joe quickly takes to drink and becomes involved with Hattie. When she puts him out, Joe kills her and is sentenced to prison. Kitty succumbs to Thomas's advances and ultimately finds herself working in a vulgar chorus line. Fannie is persuaded by a gambler and criminal that her husband's long imprisonment is equivalent to a divorce. She marries him and endures and abusive relationship.For all his negativity towards it, Dunbar offers an effective portrayal of early African American life in New York City, particularly its music. For the most part, the book is written in a bleak, naturalistic tone which reminded me of Stephen Crane's \"Maggie\", a somewhat earlier work about the effect of a slum environment in the destruction of lives. After Joe's imprisonment, the patrons of \"The Banner\", including Sadness, reflect upon his fate and upon the fate of young Southern blacks moving to New York:\"This was but for an hour, for even while they exclaimed they knew that there was no way, and that the stream of young negro life would continue to flow up from the South, dashing itself against the hard necessities of the city and breaking like waves against a rock, -- that until the gods grew tired of their cruel sport, there must still be sacrifices to false ideals and unreal ambitions.\"Readers looking for high-quality writing that remains somewhat off-the- beaten path should explore Dunbar and this novel. He remains an author worth remembering and reading. \"The Sport of the Gods\" raises themes that would be developed in American literature throughout the 20th Century, especially in works written by African Americans. It is a short, bleak and effective novel by an American poet.Robin Friedman",
            "Have you ever wanted to yell out to the heroes of your favorite movie \"DON'T DO THAT YOU IDIOT!!\"? This book is sometimes frustrating because you, the reader, can see where the plot is going and want so badly to help the story's characters avoid what seems to be the inevitable. A naturalistic picture of life, and an often-missed text which deserves more attention. It doesn't make you feel good-- but it does make you want to be sure that people have choices, that this sort of thing isn't allowed to happen, that life isn't a series of \"sport\" that the gods (a vindictive type of gods) play with us. Powerful, powerful writing, vivid details and characters you just want to smack. Read it!",

Dunbar's piece is an excellent piece of historical fiction. It follows a family's plight during America's Reconstruction era. A good choice for literature courses or for personal reading.",
            "I need to say that I read the latter portion of this book from the Paul Lawrence Dunbar Reader. I really enjoyed this story even though it was quite melancholy. The story of a falsely accused butler, Berry Hamilton, stealing money from his Southern employer, Maurice Oakley. Of course Hamilton was sent to jail without much of a thought and his family had to leave town.The family which consisted of Fannie(wife), Kit(daughter), and Joe(son) all made their way north to New York. When they arrived they were immediately confronted with the smooth talkers and wonders of the city. Fannie tried to keep somewhat of a grip on her children but it soon wilted. The \"city\" had much more appeal than Fannie's moral cautions. Fannie lost her grip on Joe first. The Banner Club and it's patrons feed his strong desire to fit in with the City. Kit's appetite for the stage blinded her relationship with her mother. They all soon forgot about Berry being in prison. Skagg's a Banner patron that had befriended Joe sought out to find a story and found the truth.The story is about how unfortunate circumstances and how the refuge of a new city ate away at a family like a parasite. The book ended in tragedy and redemption. Dunbar is so gentle with his characters. His gentleness makes the tragedy go down a little easier.",

            "I read and studied J.A. Rogers books the most during a period of time when I was obsessed with blackness. As a black man in america, I don't think being obsessed with blackness is anything to be ashamed of however. It's simply a reaction to racism.In this second volume, Roger's focuses on the new world and shows that the inhabitants of the americas are far from being pure racially. As discussed in the previous volume, race mixing with blacks took place all over Europe. In the new world however, whites not only mixed with blacks but also with the indigenous peoples of the americas including the caribbean. Also, there is good reason to believe that some of the indigenous peoples of the americas were already somewhat mixed before the europeans arrived. The one thing which I really like about J.A. Rogers books is the fact that he is not afraid to confront certain issues which are embarrasing to most whites even today.Did you ever wonder why some black people from the caribbean and south and central america don't like being called black? Some will say because they aren't black, they are Spanish or Brazilian. Based on historical evidence Roger's points out that the blacks of the caribbean and south and central america are just as &quot;black&quot; as the blacks in america. It's just that some of them may look different because race mixing took place in different degrees in different areas.Unfortuantely, the issue of race mixing is a very touchy issue, so a lot that is in books like this cannot be talked about without angering people unless you're in some sort of &quot;radical&quot; black group. Therefore, much of what is contained in this book should be kept to oneself. Regardless of what country someone is from, they don't like being told that they are of black african ancestry. Most &quot;non-whites&quot; will say they simply don't care and are irritated by the topic.",

            "The need to identify with others like oneself, and to be with one's own kind, is a major component of human nature and so ethnic identity is a powerful force in human affairs. Group members have \"ties of blood\" that make them \"special\" and different from outsiders. This is why patriotism is almost always seen as a virtue and an extension of family loyalty. It also explains why ethnic remarks so easily become \"fighting words.\" Culture builds on genetic similarity and is bound together by it. Patriotism is preached in kinship terms. Nations are the \"motherland\" or the \"fatherland\" and unions and churches refer to their members as \"brothers\" and \"sisters.\"Salter draws out the implications, however politically incorrect, for immigration policies, citizenship law, affirmative action, multiculturalism, and other ways of allocating resources within and between states. There are constraints on how much diversity can be appreciated.On Genetic Interests extends evolutionary theorizing, including my own Genetic Similarity Theory, to the new ground of interpersonal and ethnic relations such as within-group cohesion and between-group conflict. It discusses studies on likeness in social partners such as spouses and best friends. Most importantly, it applies genetic calculations and finds that the average coefficient of kinship within most ethnic groups is about as high as between half-siblings, aunt and nephew, or grandparent and grandchild. Thus, ethnic nepotism is no mere poor relation of family nepotism-it is virtually a proxy for it. Because we have many more co-ethnics than relatives, the aggregate mass of genes shared with the former dwarfs that shared with the latter.Frank Salter, a political scientists and ethologist at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, argues persuasively in this book that shared genes are the glue of sociality.On Genetic Interests goes so far as to refer to the mind as having an \"innate descent-group module\" (p. 102). It uses this concept to explain the universality of ethnic nepotism. This is heartening because many social scientists and sociobiologists alike have been reluctant to even consider applying gene-based similarity to ethnic and national preferences. Following World War II, few political scientists and historians have considered inter-group conflict from a Darwinian viewpoint. Partly in an effort to insure that they are perceived as in no way condoning racism, many evolutionists have minimized the theoretical possibility of a biological underpinning to ethnic, national, and racial favoritism. As the late, great, evolutionary biologist William Hamilton himself remarked in 1987, while noting why kin discrimination even among animals is not more readily expected, \"in civilized cultures, nepotism has become an embarrassment.\"Social scientists and historians have been quick to condemn the extent to which political leaders or would-be leaders have been able to manipulate ethnic identity. But the questions they never ask, let alone attempt to answer is, \"Why is it always so easy?\" and \"Why can a relatively uneducated political outsider set off a race riot simply by uttering a few well delivered ethnic epithets?\" On Genetic Interests provides an illuminating answer.",
            "The importance of this book is that it explains that racism is rational. That is, by favoring people of one's own race, a person is increasing his fitness. This means that the anti-racists are trying to convince people to lower their fitness and eventually go extinct. In evolutionary terms, racism is adaptive and anti-racism is maladaptive. A further implication is that racists are in harmony with man's nature (indeed, the nature of all living things - to pass on the unique forms of one's genes), and that anti-racists, who go ballistic at any tinge of racism, are psychologically pathological.While there is some math in the book, it can be understood by the average person who thinks carefully about the definitions of the terms. The reader should consult the glossary in the back of the book and be sure he understands the difference between \"individual fitness,\" \"absolute fitness,\" \"relative fitness,\" and \"inclusive fitness.\" Chapter 2 is the most important and difficult chapter and should be read several times.",
            "This book gives scientific legitimacy to genetic interests which can be protected by the ethnostate. It reads like a scientific journal and is a bit daunting to understand at times for the layman, but not overwhelming.Salter advocates putting more emphasis on preserving the ethny rather than just focusing on families or humanity. The three concerns involved are humanity, ethny, and family. Conservatives favor family and liberals favor humanity in their concerns. The mass immigration of genetically distant populations into America is displacing the European ethny here. He uses evolutionary sociobiology to make his arguments against alien immigration. He advocates universal nationalism for the world's ethnies. He reviews arguments against his ideas and the ethical considerations involving universal nationalism.He argues for the same thing that David Duke and Robert McCollough argue for, but his arguments are even more focused on scientifically justifying ethnic separations such as having ethnies monopolize a territory. This strategy would echo the tribal evolutionary strategy that has always existed and has built the nation state. Modern mass anonymous societies with all their technologies have made us confused about our genetic interests. He is against the multi-racial polities which favor minority interests over majority ones, although he does not forbid multi-racial states for those who desire them. Minorities are more motivated to defend their interests in multi-racial states because of alienation and the subtle rejection of the majority. Majorities are complacent about their interests because they deal more with their own kind everyday and do not feel alienated.He is against aggression in his model of universal nationalism; it is no longer worth it to take over territory because of population growth and the destruction war can cause. The age of empire should not be renewed.Unfortunately, ethnic polices are often decided by political cunning and will to power, rather than by scientific reasoning. I do not see that any of ideas will be implemented soon. Some states are based on ethnic solidarity such as in Germany, where only those of German blood are citizens. Still Germany has not sent many Turks back home because they do not have the political will, even though it is constitutionally legal for them to do so. Even such ethnic states will not always enforce their ethnic policies. But Germany is better off than the US and England, which have become proposition nations in which citizens supposedly attain solidarity by believing in liberal democratic ideals that deny the genetic interests of various ethnies. Multi-racial proposition nations are hard to hold together and require a lot of propaganda from the media, government, entertainment, and education to keep people believing in the proposition.",
            "\"A tour-de-force. Absolutely astounding information about genetics you wont hear anywhere else. For example, he clearly shows how immigration into western countries is much worse than mass murder of members of our extended family (our racial genotype) in relation to or genetic interests. We have a lot to lose if immigration goes unchecked culturally and intellectually, but this book shows the specific genetic basis for our global fears in this regard. A very unique book pulling the true power of genetics out of the stone of natural sciences. Very unique, very well-written. A masterpiece.\"",
            "I can hardly recall reading a book with so many intriguing new concepts per page as this one. The author makes a compelling case for counting group genetic interests amongst human rights. At the same time, he lays bare the ignorance, hypocrisy and bias of most of the \"scientific\" community when dealing with this subject. Yet he does so with great modesty and respect.We are shown how there is no qualitative difference between the connection between mother and child and the connection between an individual and his race. The difference is only in degree. We are shown this conceptually and mathematically.\"Until the discovery of our evolutionary origins, we were like blind men in pursuit of the adaptive life...now the enlightenment is illuminating our fundamental interest...\" Though the author was speaking of our overall scientific knowledge, the same can be said about the knowledge contained in his book. Most of us are like blind men prior to reading it. After reading it, we are blessed with sight. Thank you Mr. Salter. You have done all humanity a great service.I highly recommend this monumental work to anybody who has a genetic interest - which is to say, everybody!",
            "the fact is, that the greatest hatred are amoung peoples who are genetically very similar through out human history. (German, English in WWII, Chinese, Japanese, Korean through out history etc). in the worst human conflict, WWII, American, English, Chinese, Russian on one side, German, Italian, Japanese on the other side. i can't see any \"genetic\" stratification in that. and now, the greatest nation(at least the most powerful one)-- America, have no genetic basis. and Germany, the country that advocated racial purity is not even a entity until a few hundred years ago.(before that, it is loosely connected tribal...)anecdote evidence aside, quantitatively, traditional ethnic division can only 1% explain human genetic variation(my estimation, no hard data), so if these is a genetic base for ethnic based thinking(racism), it must be a very weak third order effect. it is akin to rate attractiveness among individuals by the body mass based on newton's law. we know it is absurd, even through newton's law is correct."

            "Touching and powerfully honest personal accounts of the daily lives of children / youth in the Civil Rights Movement. Children surviving domestic terrorism in a culture of violence, ever hopeful of realizing &quot; all men are created equal&quot;. Though it documents 'traumatic' incidents the focus is on courage , hope, and our personal responsibility for making the world a better world. For the children each day, each choice, each action made a profound vote for justice and equality. They are truly activists, and advocates for 'humanity'. Our elementary class uses this book to learn about and portray each person. They often seek to emulate them.The children respectfully honor these young heroes, and find their own 'voice'.",
            "Freedom's Children was a very good book because it involved different interveiws by thirty people so every person's story was different. It is probably one of the best African-American books for children. I really recommend it to people who like true stories and the 50's and 60's. At some points it was depressing, and at some points it was happy.",
            "Freedom's Children is filled with inspiring real life stories of children who lived in the 1950's. It tells about their separate lives and how they fought for Civil Rights. This book describes many aspects of the movement. One part is about the Little Rock Nine. I admire them for having enough courage to attend an all white school. They were made fun of and even physically threatened by fellow students. The book also tells about the bus boycott, Freedom Riders, and all the laws passed to make a better life for African Americans. I enjoyed this book mostly because of how much it taught me and I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn",
            "Great book to add to the collection. The vivid pictures and commentary is worth the investment. Buy now, you won't be disappointed.",
            "I think it is a great book for children to read because it shows them that people their age can make a difference in the world. The stories are inspiring.",
            "Many figures and groups of people are marginalized in the study of the Civil Rights Movement. This book is an excellent forum to give voice to the children of the movement. Especially powerful are the stories of students who were among the first to integrate. One student recounts the time when he asked a white friend to sign his senior year book. the white friend wrote \"there was a time when I was a bigot and a racist... but knowing you changed me. I now know that people are people, black or white.\" He ended the entry by saying, \"We shall overcome.\" Annecdotes like these illustrate the profound effect young people had on the movement. This book is a rich resource, and I recommend it to anyone. Though some parts are quite depressing, enough to make you cry, in the end you will feel a respect and appreciation for what \"everyday\" young people did to contribute to the movement. Essentially, a priceless collection."

As an African American parent I am desparate for books discussing the special issues that relate to our sons. I found this book to be a great resource and reference.With all of the issues facing our sons--drugs, gangs, police overreaction etc. it felt good to know that I am not the only one extremely concerned about how to grow my boy into a man.This book deals with all of the issues I could think of related to raising a black son.I think it can be a praticular interest to single moms who I believe have a special need.This book also provides a listing of several other books that one can reference which I found invaluable.Donna",
            "As soon as I learned that the baby I was carrying was a boy, I instinctively knew that I have to foster the &quot;state of emergency&quot; frame of mind to make him into the shining Black Prince that I wanted him to be, and this book will push you on that path from the jump. It encourages, enlightens and spells out the solutions to keep your precious son on the right path. Nearly every possible scenario is touched on here: encouragement to single mothers and fathers and tips on the ex, homosexuality, the doomed &quot;raise the daughters love the sons&quot; mentality, how to teach him to live in a sometimes hostile, racist world while maintaining self-dignity and respect for others, how not to allow himself to get &quot;dumbed down&quot; by peers, avoiding the temptation of drugs and gangs,etc. This book has more info than you would expect one source to have, and it helped me to understand that raising a responsible, loving, respectful young Black man doesn't have to be a pipedream. If you want to help avert crises before they occur, or need help throughout the one you may in the midst of, this book is priceless. Learn from the case scenarios and advice these 2 parents give from their own lives and others and cherish it."

        "reviews.text": [
            "Harwood spends the 167 pages here arguing for a definition and a defense of judicial activism. The literature needs a good and well-accepted definition of \"judicial activism\", since many use the phrase inconsistently. Harwood defends judicial activism by showing how judicial activism can and often does promote the same values opponents of judicial activism try to use to attack judicial activism, values such as democracy, justice and fairness, judicial efficiency and economic efficiency and stability. Harwood discusses in detail the views of Alexander Bickel, Robert Bork, Bradley C. Canon, Reed Dickerson, Ronald Dworkin, John Hart Ely, Gerald Gunther, Robert Keeton, David Lyons, Richard Posner, J.B. Thayer and many other jurists and legal, moral and political philosophers.Harwood argues that judicial activism can be either conservative, liberal or anywhere in between these parts of the political spectrum. Harwood argues that the arguments for respecting precedent (stare decisis, a major form of judicial restraint) are little or no better than the quality of the precedents themselves. Harwood argues that there are many democratic checks on the powers of judges and thus the risk of judicial tyranny is generally greatly overstated in the literature.Here's the table of contents:Chapter 1: A Working Definition of Judicial ActivismChapter 2: Activism and DemocracyChapter 3: Precedent and Passivism: The Weakness of Stare DecisisChapter 4: Taking Vagueness Seriously: The Void-For-Vagueness Doctrine Supports Judicial Activism Against OriginalismChapter 5: Defending Judicial Activism Against Posner's AttackChapter 6: ConclusionThe 4 appendices to the book chronicle how scholars have used the phrases \"judicial activism\" and \"judicial restraint\" in hundreds of articles, books and cases.University Press of America bought the rights to this book, so please contact them to encourage a new printing, if you wish to explore the book.

            "Bobo is a well-respected African-American woman in film studies. In this book, she notes the severe lack of studies out there on black female viewing habits and then presents this book as her intervention against this paucity. The book can be broken down into to parts. In one part, Bobo summarizes the feelings of a dozen black women as they watch Color Purple and Daughters of the Dust, two nominally womanist movies. In the second part, Bobo includes her own essays on why Steven Spielberg's movie betrays Walker's text, etc. This book may feel essentialist and highly unscientific to some readers. However, it was good for what it proposed. I think it would be a nice edition to any collection of texts on women of color or womanism."

When is it possible to forgive an author for using the nicer, (but at present, still unpreferrred), \"N\" word -- or using a man in overalls as a pictogram for a black person? It is possible when the book was written in 1947, and the author is Eva Knox Evans, and the book title is \"All About Us\"!This is a children's book -- but it is a logical, well-illustrated, and very, very convincing anti-prejudice book. Taking the reader on an imaginary train-trip through time, and starting from cave times, when, the author theorizes, things like eartthquakes separated peoples, (who originally, of course, looked all alike), and forced them to go to different climates, where their outer facial features developed differently, to the surpising looks on these people's faces when they met each other again, long afterwards, to explainations of people's \"blood types\", (which are \"A, B, AB and O\"....only! -- and such things as saying, \"she has a bit of royal blood\" are patently ridiculous), to explaining the origins of different customs, (Inuit peoples -- or \"Eskimos\", as they are called in this book -- have a \"shouting war\", and the people who shout the loudest win -- no one is killed!), to explaining why \"Snooty Susie\", (snooty because her ancestors came to the New World, \"first\"), should actually be \"snooted to\" by the\"Indians\", (Native Americans), as THEY were in the New World before Susie's ancestors were -- this is a book jam-packed with common sense, great examples, and wonderful illustrations. (The picture of two little black boys, about to be kidnapped into slavery, is mesmerizing. One little boy has already been captured, the other looks at his would-be capturer with an expression combined of curiousity, anger, and 'what do you think you're doing?'This is one great book! I first received a copy in the third grade -- and was so very happy to find it, years later, still available on Amazon!It is a true classic, and belongs in every home and public library! Though written for children, it is a book of common sense and uncommon valour -- and EVERYONE should read it!"

They are telling the truth about how they struggled in their lives and businesses; and how they won out. I read one every day for inspiration.",
            "A group of high achieving African American high school seniors received this book as part of the &quot;Achievers&quot; program sponsored by the local chapter of the Links. As an African American in mid-career, I decided to get a copy for myself. It was the most important book I have read in at least five years.The stories are, as a whole, optimistic but also bracingly honest about the obstacles these remarkable professionals have faced. It will inspire the young to believe that their goals are attainable. It will encourage those in mid-career to see that their progress, though uneven, is sustainable. And it will reassure those looking back at the end of their careers that their life's work has been significant if it has made it possible for even one or two others to achieve behind them. I read about one of these stories a day in the gym and frequently caught myself nodding in recognition at the experiences described.The last profile in the book is of Deborah C. Wright, President and CEO of Carver Federal Savings Bank. The very last line in her profile,and thus the very last line in the book, is &quot;[M]y prayers each morning are, 'God, just make me open to whatever the lesson is so I can get it and get on to the next one.'&quot; AMEN!",
            "Take a Lesson is a fantastic book that shares the personal stories of many successful African-American individuals who have succeeded with great distincition. Not only did I find the content entertaining, but the words ignite feelings of courage, hope, and persevarence that I'm sure will serve me well. I also think it is important to note that while most of those profiled stand at the cutting edge of capitalism, they also remain sensitive to social and human values, a balance which I think all should keep in mind.",

            "Great book! It contains the ideas our country was founded on",
            "Rather than seeing just the one piece of the puzzle that is America's race relations history, invest instead in the larger Norton Anthology of American Literature or another compendium that has the Washington work excerpted with that of others from that and other periods. The knowledge of the greater context, in the speaker's (or writer's) own words is mind expanding.",
            "When I bought this book I was expecting the classic reprint of the book. Not a modern print, when I buy something off of Amazon I expect to receive what I ordered. I don't want a refund or anything like that, because the book got the job done. I just wish to express how much it means to customers to get what they order and not something else.",
            "I just got my Kindle last month and I wanted to download something about the Dali Lama but it is not on Kindle... I saw this book and have been interested in Black Studies for many years and always wanted to read more about this fine gentleman... I loved this book.... Thank you.",
            "\"Up from Slavery\" is an excellent insight into the life of Booker Taliaferro Washington, and his life-long desire to better himself as well as both the black and white people of the South. This autobiography begins with Mr. Washington's childhood where he grew up as a slave, and continues throughout his adult life. Hard work is something that Mr. Washington believed in, and he felt it was essential that all students of the Tuskegee Institute must embrace.One of the things that struck me the most about this story was Mr. Washington's philosophy on how the black man could better his station in life. It wasn't through handouts or welfare, but by believing \"The individual who can do something that the world wants done will, in the end, make his way regardless of race.\" The story includes numerous examples of how Tuskegee students would do things (e.g., making bricks, efficiently growing vegetables, etc.) that would bring them respect and recognition in the community.One other thing I really liked was Mr. Washington's belief in teaching students how to be an overall better person. This includes everything from dental hygiene to hard work and it also focused on the moral aspects of being a good person developed through Christian principals.",
            "The life story of Booker T. Washington was uplifting and inspiring. This shows that a person can arise from the ashes of their life, and make something worthwhile of themselves. Being born a slave was a major set back in their lives. Booker was determined to received and education at any cost, and he succeeded. Nothing was handed to him. Hard work and perserverance was the only way he could accomplish his goals.Through turbalent times after the Civil War, Booker united the white and black race. Together they worked to build one of the finest educational institution in the south-Tuskegee, renamed Tuskegee University.",
            "Booker Taliaferro Washington was perhaps foremost in what he called \"bringing up the black race\". He did perhaps more than Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr., and W.E.B. DuBois ever did. Why? Because Washington did it softly, humbly, and quietly. The other black leaders attempted revolution and immediate change - both led to violence. Booker T. Washington's methods led to slow, but sure and sweeping change. He sought reform, not revolution. His life is clearly an example of Christian piety and firm faith in God. These two things also set his work apart as more successful than any other black leader. Perhaps modern black leaders should re-evaluate their philosophies for change based upon this great leader's model.",
            "I greatly enjoyed this book! I admire Booker T. Washington for his endless pursuit of education. This book is a great inspiration to any student. The only thing that I was disappointed with was the fact that Mr. Washington did not get into his personal or family life. I agree that school can change a person, And I believe that education can greatly shape who a person is, but I don't belive that education is the only thing that molds us. I would have loved to find out as much about Mr. Washington's private life as I learned about his schooling, and his work for schools. Despite all this, I think this book is wonderful. If you know a high school student, or college student, give this book to them as a gift. It is a good read.",
            "I have read this book over and over. We, certainly the entire world, have been given a resource(s) with Washington along with WEB Dubois. A check and balance regarding African Americans and the &quot;making of America.&quot;In my opinion, one must read DuBois when reading Washington.That's the check and balance.Up ... may reveal that these same attitudes and beliefs are still true of some African Amercans today. However, DuBois' counter better reflects the attitude, I beleive, of the majority of African AMercans. DuBois classic piece of work shows how, though they were physical &quot;slaves&quot; , they were free mentally, and some dared to dream, fight, and speak out even in the face of death. Oh how wonderful to know your history versus having others to tell you their side of your history.So, my response to this classic is to counter it with DuBois. Then, it can be better understood in the period in which it was written.African Americans have so much to be proud of, in spite of .... Still. what a better place this world called America would be if all people were respected and given the kinds of opportunities that America has to offer.What a classic. In countering this classic with DuBois, history definitely shows me that the old saying that all Blacks think alike is certainly nottrue. Not then, not now. Reading Washington alone, is just getting a glimpse of only half the era.Three Negro Classics- which includes DuBois and Up ... should be requried reading for all of education and educators- K-docotorate, law, medicine, etc., period.Now, that's telling the whole story!!!!!",
            "A lot of things have been said and written concerning Booker Taliaferro Washington's book, \"Up From Slavery\". Some were hot, and some were cold. But one focus that unites all the varying opinions is that every critic or reviewer agreed that the book is superb. Also, most people acknowledged that Booker T. was a distinguished scholar (despite the overwhelming odds that weighed him down).However, one big fact that most reviewers of this work have consistently overlooked is the circumstances that surrounded both the book and its writer. In order to have an accurate perspective of this book, we must not fail to evaluate what life was like for Booker T. After all, the book in question is his autobiography: written in a country where he was born and nurtured as a slave, before becoming a freeman whose basic human rights were consistently denied.One fact that pops up in this regard is that Mr. Washington was never free in the real sense of the word. The type of freedom a typical Black American enjoys today was an unseen luxury throughout Booker T's life: (1856-1915).In the same period, the life expectancy of an average Black American was less than half of what it is today. This was not because the folks then were all HIV-positive, but simply because any White man could barbecue a Black man right on the street and nothing would happen.That Booker T. chose not to criticize the grievous atrocities that the ubiquitous racists meted on American Negroes is understandable. It was not a matter of choice per se, rather, the swain wanted to stay alive. He understood his environment well, and had a first-class knowledge of how racist America worked. Again, it is only a dummy who wouldn't know that the (first) publisher of \"Up From Slavery\" wouldn't have considered the manuscript if it contained anything that will embarrass or infuriate White America. And, Booker T. Washington might be made to pay a ghastly price for authoring an \"offensive write-up\". We must not forget that this book was written a century ago: when \"freedom\" and \"justice\" were very different from what it is today. In those days, many \"critical\" Black-oriented manuscripts ended-up in dustbins; and their authors were vilified and hunted down.Today's critics who relax in comfortable armchairs and bellow that this book \"lacked depth\" in this way and that way, weren't born as Booker T. was; and I forgive them each time they use that word: 'slavery', in vain. Booker T. died in 1915, and history will always attest that Black Americans continued to struggle for freedom more than fifty years after his death.An old adage has it that: 'A word is enough for the wise'. Thus, I will like to end my comments here. \"Up From Slavery\" is a very fine book. It is small: less than 250 pages. Hence, I don't need to review or analyze it with a thousand pages. Mr. Booker T. Washington did his best: given the insurmountable circumstances that surrounded his world.",
            "Up From Slavery Booker T. Washington has been one of my all-time favorite American heroes -- ever since I first read about him in 4th grade. Washington had a gift for writing, and his autobiography, as well as his essays, are very easy to read, understand, and enjoy. The more I study and learn about him, the more impressed I am with his vision, his integrity, and his drive to improve his people and their lot in life.",
            "Booker T. Washington had every reason to complain and be resentful. He was born a slave, and although national manumission occurred while he was still a boy, very few opportunities offered themselves to the newly emancipated. He fought against the odds to get an education and while he was away at school, his beloved mother died. His biological father was a slave owner who never expressed any interest in his son's life. When he was asked to be headmaster of the Tuskegee Institute, he found himself faced with empty land in a poverty-stricken area. Married three times, his first two wives died very young. His first spouse left him a single father with a young child, and the second time he faced widowhood he had three small children to raise all by himself.He could certainly have cursed fate and just given up; in stead his autobiography is the work of an unspeakably grateful and patriotic American. Washington could not find enough good things to say about nearly everyone he encountered in life or the country he felt blessed to call his home. He worked very, very hard and success followed all his endeavors. Rather than boast of his many accomplishments, he seemed to feel unworthy of the nationwide respect he earned. He humbly described his friendships with Presidents Grover Cleveland and William McKinley, talked of his constantly sought after speeches throughout the United States and Europe, and detailed his phenomenal money-raising skills that brought the Tuskegee Institute up from a converted hen-house to a campus of over 40 buildings.Throughout all his trials and successes, he constantly advocated forgiveness, humility, and gratitude. Not only did he recommend these three virtues, he lived a life that embodied them. Perhaps that's why a person born with no realistic chance at getting ahead, died one of the most admired and well-known individuals of his day.",
            "The author was highly instrumental in bringing this process about. He was educated and completed his schooling at the 'Hampton' school with honors. He then built and directed the 'Tuskegee' school in Alabama, and devoted his whole life to service. While this book was very informative, and is considered a milestone by a true pioneer, it is a little bit monotonous, thus THREE stars. I would highly recommend it nevertheless. Many of the thoughts, attitudes, and sayings of Booker T. Washington have been used by modern authors and speakers, and will live forever. Our country and the black race are forever in his debt for the legacy he left behind. I certainly feel better about life after reading this book. You will too.",
            "This book has an inspiring message, and gives a viewpoint that is not often looked at. I thought its content was instructional.",
            "Good read for middle school kids as a homeschool or supplemental read. I found it interesting that Booker T advocates a clean lifestyle which is what so many of our current male youth need to learn - hard work, morality and education. A great man.",
            "This is a very inspirational book emphasizing the success achieved through hard work, initiative, dedication, and self-reliance. Booker T. Washington was truely an amazing man with a mission to teach X-slaves the responsibility associated with liberty! This book needs to be required reading for all high school and college students!",
            "The legacy of Booker T. Washington incontestably stands alongside other great Americans. Washington created the Tuskegee Institute to promote the education of his people who had only recently been emancipated from slavery. Much of it was literally built by his hands and those of his charges.In so doing they could take ownership and pride of their creation. Washington raises labor from its inferior status to a place of honor. He blames the institution of slavery for distorting the dignity of labor because it \"took the spirit of self-reliance and self-help out of the white people. My old master had many boys and girls, but not one, so far as I know, ever mastered a single trade or special line of productive industry.\" Everything was left to the slaves. As a consequence, the slave owners \"unconsciously had imbibed the feeling that manual labour was not the proper thing for them. On the other hand, the slaves, in many cases, had mastered some handicraft, and none were ashamed, and few unwilling, to labour.\"Paul Lawrence Dunbar, one of the great poets of the Harlem Renaissance, expressed some discordant opinions regarding this autobiography of one of America's most influential blacks. His tone is respectful, recognizing that, after all, Booker T. Washington created Tuskegee Institute.Dunbar echoed the resentment felt by blacks who felt betrayed by Washington's accommodating stance with the powerful men of his time. Indeed, there is something of the sell-out in his nave belief that \"the time will come when the Negro in the South will be accorded all the political rights which his ability, character, and material possessions entitle him to . . . the opportunity to freely exercise such political rights will not come in any large degree through outside or artificial forcing, but will be accorded to the Negro by the Southern white people themselves, and that they will protect him in the exercise of those rights.\"Fifty years later, it was painfully evident that this had not come to pass, nor would without an organized movement to force the issue.For all the criticism he has received, it should never be forgotten that he walked a precarious tightrope. On the one side he had to be painfully aware of the injustices of his own people. On the other, the need of funding meant that he needed to be far more circumspect in his criticism to promote educational opportunities for his aggrieved students.We have the benefit of hindsight. Cut him some slack. He did far more under the circumstances than a lesser man could.",
            "Booker T. Washington: once a slave, beat down and told he could do nothing, accomplish nothing; now an example to all men, white and colored, raised above others. Why? Hard work and a desire to do good in this world. He accomplished more than a lot, from getting into a school by sweeping and cleaning a room, to teaching at a night school, to starting Tuskegee, to speaking at huge events at which no black man had ever spoken. He met great men, did great things, built a great community, and loved greatly.He wrote this autobiography about his truly great life. He wrote it simply, giving facts in a very interesting way (one thing that he felt was important while giving speeches). I had a hard time staying interested because I was very busy while reading it and felt like I had to rush to get it done. However, I liked it enough to know that I'll read it again in a less-busy time and really immerse myself in it. There's so much to learn, so much to discover in a life like Washington's. While reading it I couldn't help but be thankful for everything in my life. I was born with many luxuries given to me. Booker T. Washington started out with the clothes on his back and a dirt floor to sleep on. Education was a piece of paradise to him; food was a luxury beyond all comparison. I have always had both of those, in abundance.One word to describe this book would be thankful. Not the word I would normally use to describe a book, but really, it is. Booker T. Washington's thanks resonates throughout the whole story. Even when he was hungry and on the streets - I could almost taste his thanks whenever he'd receive a meal or a warm place to stay.Wonderful. Recommended to all who love a good autobiography, and even to those who don't.",
            "This book is an excellent addition to the Sons of Liberty series for homeschooling students. Great for doing a book report.",
            "I read this some time ago, combined with The Souls of Black Folk and The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man. Up From Slavery was the warm-up, I guess, since it was the least offensive. Of course one reader's \"least offensive\" is another reader's \"Uncle Tom\". However one can't fairly judge someone from that era using the criteria from the modern time- a fairly simple principle that is too easily forgotten.With that out of the way, let me say that as a southern kid in the late 60's reading this book I was tremendously inspired. We were hardly that far removed from Jim Crow, at least in years, so I think I was able to grasp a little of the obstacles Washington overcame. Still this is less a story of race than a story of faith, of vision, of the triumph of hard work, and the triumphs both in spite of as well as because of his fellow man.The history in not too debatable, as it is an auto-biography. By definition thus the history of the author, and this becomes one of the strengths of the books- the common sense, no-nonsense love of life thatcauses BTW to continually break through to the other side, and bring the reader with him. By the end of the book I wanted to start a college (as he did) and help my fellow man up from poverty any way I could. To not marvel at his accomplishments and to denigrate him with labels out of time is to do great injustice to the man, his relationship with God, and to his incredible achievements.To sum: it is inspiring and real, and it gives a glimpse into some of the peculiar hardships resulting from the peculiar institution, but the process is almost the polar opposite of the victimhood route of today- from someone who could most justifiably have claimed himself such a victim.",
            "A riveting account of Washington's extraordinary struggle fueled by boundless optimism.However, Washington's faith appears overly buoyant when he writes the following about the Ku Klux Klan: 'To-day there are no such organizations in the South, and the fact that such ever existed is almost forgotten by both races. There are few places in the South now where public sentiment would permit such organizations to exist.'Of course, a hundred years later the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist organizations are alive and well in the U.S.I was surprised to discover that this book - although published in 1901 - employs British (rather than American) spellings for words such as &quot;labour&quot; (labor) and &quot;colour&quot; (color).This is an important document of its time that must be read by anyone with the mildest interest in world history and the human condition that shapes it.",
            "This book provides a snapshot of the world of the US at one of it's most exciting times. The end of the 19th century was the &quot;Progressive Era&quot; when people came together and formed groups and associations that are still with us today. His metaphor of dipping into the cool clear water in which we are sailing for the human resources to build society is as true today as in 1890. His statement that the most pressing problem in America was for rich and poor to understand how each contributes to the whole and to learn to value each other is also timely.Besides the fascinating historical perspective of the thinking of the time, there is the insight provided by Booker T. Washington himself. His adulation of labor is reminisint of Kahil Gibran in &quot;The Prophet.&quot; The most repeated idea in the book is that any person that adds to the economic well being and comfort of their community will be sought out and cherished and that race has nothing to do with it. Coming from a person who started with so much less (he was a slave) that most of us have today and really practicing what he believed makes him someone that we all can admire. To put it in less academic terms, this is a book about an incredibly beautiful person that made me think deeply about myself and the world I live in.",
            "You really have to read this book is bringing a lot of things you really didn't even know, read it",
            "Here is a black American who realized that through hard work he could accomplish his dream. He knew no one owed him anything. He mentioned at least 4 times that serving others is greatest joy in life.",
            "This book reminds us of the great truth, that hard work will always in the end be rewarded. Booker T. Washington exemplified the American spirit.",
            "I bought this because I needed quick access to this classic for a paper I was writing. This is a very poor representation of this remarkable book; cheaply printed, no index -- junk! Don't buy it! totally useless for anything except a quick perusal by people who don't know any better!",

            "I had never read anything about Booker T. Washington before, but on a whim decided to read this book. It is excellent! Spanning from Booker's beginnings as a slave, through emancipation, to leading a college for blacks, his is an inspiring journey. I bought everyone in my family this book for Christmas. A must read!",
            "Booker T. Washington has always been a figure that history teachers use, in my opinion, to support the so-called &quot;Good&quot; African-Americans. In other words, those who don't cause trouble. &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; displays this side of Mr. Washington. This book is worth reading because of Booker's determination that allowed him to rise above his former conditions. Yet, one can't help but get the feeling that he is all-to-ready to forget what has happened to him. Booker continues to explain, rather naively, in my opinion, how racism is to soon be erased. I feel it's unfortunate how things later came to contradict his predicitons, but he is foolishly optimistic. Overall, &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; is a decent book, but occasionally tedious.",
            "Booker T. Washington wrote a lively narrative of his life that deserves our attention today. The first couple of pages are startling for the nonchalant way he relates that he doesn't know the year of his birth, nor the exact location, nor with certainty who his father was. He does, on the other hand, describe the tiny dimensions to the cabin where he lived and what life was like for the slaves. Washington went on from these humble beginnings to a fine education and a life of meritoriously helping fellow negroes to improve their education and vocational endeavors. This book is a good reminder of the stark conditions and large barriers present for slaves making the transition to free members of society following the Civil War.",
            "What an outstanding autobiography regarding a true American heroe! This book details the triumphant acts of Booker T. Washington's efforts to not only develop the famous Tuskegee Institute, but to positively build bridges with America. A former slave who became a self taught, political mastermind came from the worst of what humanity had to offer to meeting and influencing American Presidents. What an honor it would have been to meet a man who provided so much to the African American man and woman. He was also willing and often did help southern whites in his community. It's ashame that in America, where education is offered legally, there is a 50% dropout rate among African American high school students. This man and his \"cadres\" fought for and provided educational opportunities in a country that treated them worst than second class citizens. This book should be a required reading in ALL schools, especially those predominantly filled with African Americans!",
            "I bought 10 to give to my black friends, in just two chapters you can discover what a great man this was,he had a great preception of people and life. I am waiting for a new supply so I can order 20 to give out. This man is a great example for all races to look up to.",
            "Every student of history must read this book. (ages 10-up). Booker T. Washington was a brilliant scholar and compassionate human being. His detailing of life as a young slave boy, and life during/after the Reconstruction, is heart-wrenching, but must be read in order to fully understand the era. At times, I felt that Mr. Washington was too \"kind\" in trying to understand and explain the motives of the white people. He was a visionary and tireless worker for the African Americans; therefore, this work is a must-read for all Americans.",
            "It was a pleasure to meet this great man through this, his, book. A previous book I reviewed made me curious about how the black slaves in the south lived before their emancipation. This book satisfied my curiosity. More than saying that, I find it is difficult to review this book. Simply put, Mr. Washington tells you about his life and in so doing tells you about himself and the principles he lived by. I feel there are valuable lessons to be learned here. I'll just take two quotes, \"...the thing to do, when one feels sure that he has said or done the right thing, and is condemned, is to stand still and keep quiet. If he is right, time will show it.\" I believe Jesus sent the same message. I heard that the great scientist, Robert J Oppenheimer, became depressed after being condemned as a Communist. If so, I guess he hadn't learned this lesson. The second, \"Few things help an individual more than to place responsibility upon him, and to let him know that you trust him.\" This was illustrated over and over again in the book. Other great men have also said this, but if it has been heard by most people, in the workplace and at home, it is ignored so much of the time. This book is inspiring. I wish all young people would read it and heed it; then this would be a better world.",
            "Up From Slavery is the classic autobiography of Booker T. Washington. Washington gives an interesting, alternative perspective regarding slavery and slave owners. This is what Mr. Washington stated regarding his boyhood owners: \"My life had its beginnings in the midst of the most miserable, desolate, and discouraging surroundings. This was so, however, not because my owners were especially cruel, for they were not, as compared with many others...........One may get the idea, from what I have said, that there was a bitter feeling toward the white people on the part of my race, because of the fact that most of the white population was away fighting in a war which would result in keeping the Negro in slavery if the South was successful. In the case of the slaves on our place this was not true, and it was not true of any large portion of the slave population in the South where the Negro was treated with anything like decency.\"Washington is here saying that although many slaves were mistreated by their owners, many were treated relatively well.Not only does Mr. Washington offer an interesting perspective on slavery, he was an early black educator. Washington believed that black people should have no privileges because of their color. He believed that it was the fault of the black man if he did not succeed and it was not because of the white man. He urged the people of his race to work for their living and not depend on others for help. When times were the very hardest for the black people, Washington helped lift them up and get them on their feet. He founded Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama. This school began as a small night-school for black people. Washington build a fine institution for the black race by the sweat of his brow.Booker T. Washington did not view his race as mistreated victims, instead he took a great amount of pride in the black race and wanted others to understand what a privilege it was to be a part of it, as this quote seems to indicate:\"From any point of view, I had rather be what I am, a member of the Negro race, than be able to claim membership with the most favoured of any other race.....This I have said here, not to call attention to myself as an individual, but to the race to which I am proud to belong.\"Booker T. Washington's Up From Slavery is an American classic. It is the true life story of a little slave boy who grew up to become one of the finest leaders for his race.",
            "Booker T. Washington shares in this book his thoughts on education and work in such a beautiful positive way. Each pearl of wisdom is such a treasure, I wish that this book could be instituted as required reading for all students. I loved it and have since bought 6 books to give as gifts.",
            "Booker T. Washington was born in slavery, and he describes the first seven years of his life as a slave in enough detail to raise the hairs on your neck. Suddenly emancipated after the Civil War, his life saw no improvement until he finally made his way, broke at times, to the Hampton Institute -- which changed his life.Others have mentioned his work ethic. He had one of the strongest work ethics ever seen in a human being. He graduated from Hampton with flying colors, and was subsequently chosen to found the Tuskegee Institute. On Day One, that amounted to a shanty next to a church. (!)Washington's message, repeated over and over, was \"learn a useful trade.\" As he correctly reasoned, human nature being what it is, if you are the best blacksmith, brick maker, or furniture maker in your community, your community is going to respect you and want to keep you.In the year 2012, this advice strikes me as eerily prescient. Certainly it's excellent advice for the American underclass, but suddenly -- with the explosive bubble in college charges -- it's beginning to make sense to a lot of Americans, whether they be black, white, or magenta. Which is the better path? Skip college and qualify as a first-rate plumber, electrician, carpenter etc. -- or go to college and wind up unemployed with $100,000 in student debt?There's a lot more in this book! It's an excellent portrait of America in the late 19th century, and it will surprise you at many turns.",
            "I devoured this book on my newly purchased Kindle! I'm a Southern African American woman who can identify with so much of what was written. Our communities are in need of men of Booker T's caliber.I loved his description of life as a slave and then as a free man...his expositions on the virtues of the tooth brush and bathing...describing what it was like to sleep in a bed with two sheets...how to get along with Southern Whites and further the cause of the Black community.I can see how folks have pegged him as an 'Uncle Tom,' because of the tone taken in the book; almost too forgiving considering what he's been through. Nonetheless, I value his perspective, because in the end one cannot realistically expect to excel among those you bash every chance you get, even if the bashing is well deserved.I appreciate his repetitive statements on work. In this regard, it seems that things might be worse in today's society with modern advances possibly adding to the laziness--poor work ethic--spiteful attitude toward work exhibited by some folks regardless of race. We still have a ways to go. Book sense and manual (I'd add computer/technological) labor can still take us further as a race.Lastly, he spoke out against injustices in a tactful way that built bridges rather than destroyed them. I can dig that.Overall, this was a great read! A great start to my kindle love affair! :)",

Wish this was the stuff that was taught in schools.",

Washington by name only prior to reading this book.We all can learn from Booker T. Washington's as I have never read about a person in recent history that had as little resentment as he did, and according to him, he would not have been able to do the great work that he did if had spent any time being resentful. This book reads almost like a motivational book in many sections. Many of our problems with education today was understood clearly by Booker T. Washington, over a 100 years ago.Please read this book.",

            "The social confines of race are a self-imposed form of slavery, figurative bonds which may be loosed only through the merit of magnanimous work. Much has been discussed in recent years about the topics of racial equality, minority education, and our national history regarding members of the African-American race. It cannot be denied that a great injustice has been served this particular ethnic group, but the future is each citizen's responsibility, black and white alike. Booker T. Washington's reflective memoir, \"Up From Slavery\" positively affirms the virtues of equal parts work and study for a mutually successful society, race notwithstanding. As an autobiography chronicling Washington's humble beginnings in Confederate West Virginia among illiterate slaves to Boston society appealing to the socially prominent, \"Up From Slavery\" offers a contemporary view on race relations and the human condition. The narrative details Washington's childhood, contrasting the degrees of educational prosperity, domestic sanitation, and religious liberty with the unalienable provisions of slave owners. Washington illuminates the process of ascertaining an education against all odds, laboring in coalmines to afford night school, teaching eager black students, and finally dedicating his life's work to the renowned Tuskegee Institute. Rather tedious in these recollections, the book's plot is unnecessarily laden with exhaustive details and lacks depth in historical perspective. Given the time period in which it was written, there is margin for error in hypothetical suggestions for ethnic culmination, theorizing equal opportunities that did not materialize until seven decades later with desegregation. Individual statements are debatable, such as Washington's idealistic perspective on racial harmony being a non-issue directly after the Civil War, which seems highly unlikely given the past hundred years of civil rights conflict. Explaining the process of rising above local circumstances is the plot's best feature flowing smoothly into a chronological process, specific and concise. It plainly states the South's oppressive environment without delving into racial sympathy, lending remarkable strength. Written with commendable intentions, undue criticism of the white majority is withheld, replaced by cautious optimism and a hopeful spirit. The plot in general follows a logical sequence highlighting one man's endeavors to strive for a better life in impoverished circumstances and his inspiration to freed slaves. Typical of memoirs, the autobiography's focal point is Booker T. Washington's personal account and unique perspective. While other characters are not specifically elaborated, Washington is quick to credit his teachers, mentors, and benefactors in gracious tribute. Their admirable attributes are illuminated in model exemplification, deliberately but briefly identified. Not presenting thoroughly interesting characters for lack of breadth, the reader is focused on Washington himself rather than other outstanding individuals. His personal beliefs are well defined, confided in a trusting tone. Instead of feeling familiar with a cast of literary icons, the reader is acquainted with the author's own integrity and moral fiber. The main character is a sound representation of autobiographical focus, developed, interesting, and personal. In spite of race and social position, hard work employs utmost application in striving to reach full potential and earnest effort begets its own reward. \"The man who can do something that the world wants done will in the end make his way regardless of race My experience is that there is something in human nature which always makes an individual recognize and reward merit, no matter under what colour of skin merit is found.\" Washington introduces his commentary on physical labor's role in mental preparation with that solid statement, proven true the world over. People are generally more alike than different, united in faith, hope and love, set to the same toil with the same ultimate goal. \"Up From Slavery\" `s central theme corresponds with reality's unprejudiced outcome of individual prosperity through rigorous application. In a progressive attempt to improve society, citizens are bound not by the iron chains of a ruling majority's tyranny but a communal commitment to self-improvement. Although borders, language and culture differentiate ethnic civilizations, their people endeavor for the same fundamental mores. Education, religion, freedom, and a reasonable level of personal satisfaction are sought by all races. Black and white, Asian and Latin American. Catholic, and Jewish, Buddhist and Baptist. English and Spanish, Mandarin and Ebonics. Beneath any layer of flesh, colored or pale, blood runs red as slavery's symbolic rose. People share their humanity if not their race, undivided for the betterment of our society through collective ability. The continuing popularity of Booker T. Washington's \"Up From Slavery\" originally published in 1903 has fostered universal awareness for nearly one person at a time by appealing to the heart, the mind, and the common human soul. When an individual improves his mind, converges the efforts of bodily work and recognizes the plight of fellow human beings, his life is changed. The world glows with the amber of hope for a united future, one person at a time.",
            "This book has opened my eyes to the socialization of the so called \"Negro \". Brought up from the beginning to \"stay as light as possible\", this book has removed those racial barriers and has taught me to be proud of my ancestry . Say it loud....",
            "Of my father I know even less than of my mother. I do not even know his name. I have heard reports to the effect that he was a white man who lived on one of the near-by plantations. Whoever he was, I never heard of his taking the least interest in me or providing in any way for my rearing. But I do not find especial fault with him. He was simply another unfortunate victim of the institution which the Nation unhappily had engrafted upon it at that time. - Booker T. Washington's Up From Slavery (Chapter 1)Booker T. Washington gives us all the blueprint for how an African man can succeed in the American system. He must forgive any person in power who wrongs him, his family, and/or his community. In the 21st century the African man must perform more acts than forgiveness. He must: erase the bass from his voice, tighten his lips and the rest of his body to minimize African features, show hatred of African people or an indifference to their suffering. If an African man shows any of the attitudes mentioned or a combination of those attitudes, he will succeed in the current American system. You do not have to look to the most famous examples to see African men twisting themselves out of their minds, just look around you, these men are closer than you think.",

            "This year marks the 100th anniversary of the publication of &quot;Up From Slavery.&quot; I hope that in celebration of this anniversary, many people will discover Washington's autobiography for the first time. I was fascinated and inspired by Washington's quiet and humble manner as he describes what it was like to be a slave as a youth. Washington traces his struggle for an education, and his later challenges and trials as an educator. His account of the building and molding of the Tuskeegee Institute is one of the most inspiring stories I have read in years. Washington did not want to have anything handed to him. He wanted to earn every goal he set for himself, and earn them he did. His influence was and continues to be incredible. This is an amazing book every American should read.",

With the self-reward of obtaining education he decided to develope the Tuskegee Institution to help further educate his peoples.

He talks on how as people, one should educate themselves not only in books but in labor as well. In doing so, one will achieve full-on success. &quot;Up from Slavery&quot; enlightened me so much more on Washington. I have gained an enormous amount of respect for this intriguingly compelling man.

            "This is an excellent book. I am amazed by the insight and intelligence of Mr. Washington. He created a very powerful legacy. The autobiography shows the desire, of a man fresh from slavery, to succeed and in turn help others do the same. Many of his thoughts are applicable today. Throughout the book, he emphasizes the need to use one's talents and abilities to increase prosperity for not only the current generation but also for the next one. This is a necessary read for anyone desiring success and especially for those that find success in mediocrity.",
            "If you feel like you have it bad and life has passed you by.... READ THIS BOOK! I usually avoid biographies and autobiographies because they often seem to boast and be egotistic. Booker T. Washington did not strike me as a selfish individual. His whole life centered around education (life-long learning). Think about what a wonderful world we would have if children (and adults) followed this concept. The majority of people never open a book (non-fiction) after they leave school! I have had a solid determination for the past four or five years, to improve my life through books and tapes, and I feel as though I've found my true calling in life... learning! This book is primarily about raising the black race from being enslaved to an educated and highly skilled race. The author was highly instrumental in bringing this process about. He was educated and completed his schooling at the 'Hampton' school with honors. He then built and directed the 'Tuskegee' school in Alabama, and devoted his whole life to service. While this book was very informative, and is considered a milestone by a true pioneer, it is a little bit monotonous, thus four stars. I would highly recommend it nevertheless. Many of the thoughts, attitudes, and sayings of Booker T. Washington have been used by modern authors and speakers, and will live forever. Our country and the black race are forever in his debt for the legacy he left behind. I certainly feel better about life after reading this book. You will too.",
            "What is most striking about Washington's autobiographical account of his rise from slavery to revered statesman is his lack of resentment toward white culture. Rather than focus on what whites should do to uplift blacks, Washington encouraged blacks to take individual agency over their lives. He believed the best way for blacks to achieve social parity was to become indispensable members of the communities in which they lived. His absolute confidence in black resilience would probably be regarded as naive in today's political discourse. And yet the long list of his (and all black culture's) achievements during this period are unmistakable and nothing short of inspiring.It's a shame this book is on the African American Studies shelf. The lessons from Washington's life apply to all humans, not just blacks. This book would be an excellent addition high school reading lists as a model of the values consonant with personal success.",
            "I found this to be a most amazing work. In telling the story of going from a child of slavery to the founder and president of the Tuskegee institute, Mr. Washington illustrates for us the life-lessons which can empower any individual or race in our free society today.Namely, look to your neighbor in love, not anger; recognize the nobility in working hard for something rather than expecting charity; be willing to give yourself to a greater cause; believe that people are capable of great things and they will live up to your expectations; recognize the importance of education, not just of the mind, but of the body and soul as well; recognize that any man who provides value to the community in which he lives will be accepted and even welcomed into that community; and above all, trust in God to care for your needs.I highly recommend this book as a testament to the positive result of thinking from a perspective of Love and Abundance rather than Anger and Scarcity. When Mr. Washington's humility is measured against his accomplishments, he becomes in my eyes one of the greatest Americans to have lived.",

            "This is a very well-written statement of the conservative approach to the quest for Black equality. Written as Booker T. Washington's autobiography, it is important to keep in mind that part of the purpose of this book was to recruit donors to fund the Tuskegee Institute--which meant that Washington needed to emphasize that he was an accomodationist and not in any way a radical. That being said, some of the sentiments expressed in this book seem very over-optimistic in retrospect. For example, Washington says he believes that whites in the South will grant blacks full political rights of their own accord, when blacks are mature enough to deserve them, because people are innately good and will do the right thing. The end of Reconstruction and the advent of Jim Crow laws, along with the intensity of the battle for civil rights, showed him to be mistaken on that point--which is partly why he was eventually eclipsed as a leader by W.E.B. DuBois. Still, this book is a fascinating autobiography and a great statement of the moderate, gradualist approach to attaining equality.",
            "Everyone should read &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; by Booker T. Washington. Washington was one of the most outstanding people in our history. If he lived today he probably would become President and be one of our greatest Presidents. He had an iron will to achieve his goals in life and to do something to help his people. He started in life in slavery, born to a single mother. Later on he was abused and exploted by his step-father. He overcame tremendous hardships to get an education. He then dedicated his life to helping other African-Americans to improve their lives. He is often criticized for compromising too much with the white establishment. I think however that people need to understand the difficulties of his time and also his way of trying to change people indirectly rather than through direct confrontation. &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; is a great example of this. It is also fun to read. I have a personal reason for liking Washington. In World War II my father was in the Air Corps. For some time the bomber he flew in was protected by the famous Tuskeegee Airmen who were trained at Tuskeegee Institute, founded by Washington. The Tuskeegee Airmen never lost a plane that they escorted. So you see, if it hadn't been for Booker T. Washington I might not be here.",
            "Over the years, being aware of the great rivalry between Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Dubois I had grown used to Dubois followers saying Booker T. was an accommodationalist Uncle Tom, and other similar statements. I read Up from Slavery as a teenager, and I didn't get that impression from him at the time, so I usually dismissed people's negativity about him as misunderstanding. Having recently re-read the book, it made a far stronger impression on me as an adult and I feel compelled to give my own opinion, especially since the old \"accommodationalist Uncle Tom\" reviews are also on this site.The time period after the slaves were freed was known as Reconstruction. The former slaves were both scared as to what the future held and deeply excited to experience this concept of freedom with the fire and enthusiasm of the Newly Born. For the most part they were very ignorant of their past, of how to establish themselves as a thriving community, how to interact with their white neighbors in a way beneficial to all and how to best use their money and time to grow as individuals. The whites were equally scared as to what the future held (change is often scary) but they were also excited for the former slaves and 100% wished them well. Yes, this was also the time period that formed the KKK, but evil racists were always around and thankfully, then as now, are in the minority.As Booker T. explained, both the owner and the owned had been damaged by the chattel slavery institution. Because the lowest member of society was the slave to whom all menial labor was delegated to, both races saw work/labor as something to be avoided. The whites saw it as something that was beneath them, while the blacks felt they should rise up above it as free men. For them, \"freedom\" meant `I no longer have to work hard.' The blacks felt that if they could get an education they could \"live by their wits\" by teaching, being politicians, preaching or any other profession that required thinking for money, so that they would never have to perform physical work/labor with their hands again. They suffered from many misconceptions as to what made a free person successful, such as purchasing a very expensive item that they couldn't afford as a status symbol to show that they've \"made it\" even going into severe debt to have it. They felt that intensive study into Latin or Greek languages somehow made them superior to other people and that mastery in these fields also proved that they had \"made it.\"Booker T. and Dubois created two models designed to help pull the race forward as a free and successful people.1.) Booker T. Washington's model involved not only a solid education in academics and Qur'anic/Biblical principles (integrity, hard work and patient perseverance) but he also felt that each member of the race should be schooled in industry and the value of Sacred Work/Labor. As opposed to the work they were used to doing as a slave, Sacred Work was the necessary work put forward that not only made an individual indispensable to his community, but it built character, confidence, assurance, dignity and gave the valuable gift of the concept of \"a job well done.\" Each individual was to master a trade (or two or three) that was vital to a community's growth and do that trade to the utmost best of his/her ability so that not only would the community be successful and grow but the neighboring communities would also find that community indispensable. This would promote both a brotherly camaraderie between communities as well as help the economy by increasing the competition in free trade. Booker T's model would enable the average man to be a vital asset to his community which would become structurally solid and a vital asset to the nation's other communities. It is designed to build up the entire black community as a whole while allowing for exceptional individuals (like Booker T. Washington) to excel. This was indeed the American Dream model, that through hard work, determination, persistence and education you can achieve success.Booker T felt that because the black and white races went through slavery together, they needed to be healed together. Starting off with nothing, the former slaves needed help in order to get a foot hold onto their future. His model pulls the races together for their mutual benefit; as the black race builds itself up the white race will benefit in the proper symbiotic relationship between two businesses. Yes, Booker T. rightly saw the growing community of former slaves as a developing business and he recognized that no business achieves its ultimate success without the help of other businesses, in this case the southern and northern whites. Just like FedEx and Kinko's or Exxon and Ford work together and thus enhance each other, Booker T. knew that in order to really be successful both races needed to work together (Didn't Up from Slavery function as a business plan for investors, after all?). Of course for the grand scheme of things, for the sake of his race's success why would Booker T. (or any other black person) alienate whites by continuously putting in their faces the evils of slavery and colonialism? In other words, why would a struggling start-up business alienate the banking industry and other investors by pointing out their wrong doings? They would be cutting their own throats. Obviously, if ever there was a time to forgive and forget Reconstruction was that time. And once the ultimate success had been achieved both races would do whatever they needed to ensure the wellbeing of the partner. If some racist bigots burned a cross on Kinko's lawn and threatened to lynch the manager, don't you think FedEx would also be insulted and demand the practice stop?2.) W. E. B. Dubois was actually the spokesman for the blacks who felt that they shouldn't have to work hard anymore, now they should be free to live the way they watched the whites live for two centuries. In the Dubois model, the individual was encouraged to achieve the highest education he was able to. This would guarantee that the \"Talented Tenth\" (the small percentage of highly gifted individuals among every people) would attain the mega-success that was the American Dream. Dubois felt that it's the Talented Tenth among every race that furthers the goals of the community as a whole, and that the masses would benefit from a Reaganomics-like trickle down effect. This model, encouraging a work-o-phobic attitude and a individual's pursuit of success did nothing to build the black community but gave the hope that whites would accept the blacks into their communities \"because we are free like you and we demand to live equally with you because we say so\" which actually was the attitude that formed the KKK in the first place. Unlike the model of his rival, Dubois did not establish a system that would remove the slave mentality from the people so they would want to work hard in order to elevate themselves. Consequently, the concept of the \"educated fool\" was born, with the black academic full of dead languages and abstract principles with absolutely no practical way of using his education to enhance the quality of his character, dignity, morality, integrity or his community as a whole. His community is a raggedy shambles after only a few years of his living in it, because the slave mentality that the Dubois model perpetuates won't permit him even to take pride in slapping on a new coat of paint, mowing the lawn or cleaning up the trash and beer bottles littered in front of his house. Although the Talented Tenth's accomplishments have moved the race forward in very slow increments the average man, with the idea that work is bad and education only benefits a few, is free only to get in trouble or be used up for someone else's dream while he waits for the next minute advancement from the trickle down effect.Obviously W. E. B. Dubois won the debate. Seeing the Dubois model as the easy route to success, they simply labeled Booker T. as an Uncle Tom and waited for their Talented Tenth to do their thing and never gave another thought about the matter. How they felt about Booker T. was summed up by how actor Moses Gunn played him in the movie Ragtime. Does it feel better knowing that at the end of his life, Dubois admitted that Booker T. was right?No. The damage has now been done. People are fond of saying, \"But we've come so far!\" But have we? We would've come much farther much sooner if we had embraced Booker T's vision instead of Dubois' work-o-phobic, trickle down vision. They make that statement by pointing to the kind, modern white people that live among us today. But there have always been kind-hearted white people who've honestly wished us success! Look where all the money that helped found Tuskegee and the Hampton Institute came from. Look at the reality of our progress. As a community, after over a century since the Emancipation Proclamation, we have the same mentality we had as newly freed slaves. Instead of a household sharing a single fork and wasting all of their money on an organ that we can't play, now we've replaced the organ with a Cadillac Escalade or a Coach bag or some rims. Our communities are chaotic and scattered with no concept of leaving a legacy for our children. We lack the business savvy to own our own community shops and stores so that corporate predators can take advantage and just take our money out of our communities.Without Booker T's life training fundamentals we still are in need of therapy for the centuries of chattel slavery we've gone through and so are the descendants of our former masters. Just like we have made little progress past the legacy of slavery's inferiority complex so they are still suffering from the superiority complex slavery gave to them. For the whites, they don't see anything wrong with building up vast wealth off of the blood, sweat and tears of others and giving them as little compensation as they can get away with. They honestly don't see anything wrong with playing with the worker's minds to make them feel they are getting a good deal. Because of this, the old wealthy white families who've built their money through slave labor and their peers actually sought how they could continue to take advantage of black slave labor without breaking the new anti-slavery laws. I believe that Up from Slavery is an excellent model as to how the black race can pull itself together into an awesome community, but I also believe that the warped mind suffering under a superiority complex can \"reverse engineer\" the book and use it to prevent such a community from forming in the first place.STEP ONEDestroy all existing examples of strong black communitiesSTEP TWOPull out the wealthiest, most productive members of the community leaving the ignorant, defenseless poorSTEP THREEAllow drugs and alcohol to flow freely into the ranks of the poor so that their frustrations and stress will ignite into various crimesSTEP FOURPaint the picture in the popular media (both bluntly and subliminally) that these people are prone to criminal behavior anywaySTEP FIVEWith the public's approval, round them up and fill up the prisons with them. Now they are the property of the State, and can be legally contracted out as slave labor... continuing where we left off.If Dubois' model had not have been adopted, we would have been the ultimate success story, a strong and vibrant community making a major contribution to our nation's prosperity and our own people's legacy. Of course it's not too late to fix it. All we have to do is stop calling Booker T. Washington an \"accommodating Uncle Tom\" and get to work.",
            "&quot;Up from slavery&quot; documents the rise of Booker T. Washington, from a plantation slave to the head of Tuskegee college in Alabama. Along the way his narrative details the squalor and humiliations of his childhood and ends with a number of journalistic adulations regarding his career and speeches. It is a wonderful book, yet curious.Unlike Frederick Douglass, the severe critic of the slaveholding South, Washington's outlook is decidedly postive. He refuses to get into any kind of individual or group bashing, but prefers to dwell on the successes of blacks, improving race relations, and the success of his school- and students. He becomes enamored of his own success on the stump, but such is the case with most ambitious, forward looking individuals. I would have liked a bit more criticism, and fewer excerpts from the newspapers of his time (regarding his speech-making ability.) His repeated refrains about service and merit (being the only true measure of a man), are sound. All in all, this is an upbeat, inspiring story from a man who truly defied the odds, and his winning attitude is sorely needed today.",
            "&quot;Up From Slavery&quot; brought to light the real deal behind the man Booker T. Washington. Before reading it, I was taught to believe that he accommodated and assimilated himself and the African American race to that of the white race. It has to be made known that Booker T. Washington was born into an era where the slave mentality was not only prominent but socially acceptable. To understand his conservative efforts, you'd have to understand the fact that he achieved everything in life by hard labor. Therefore, in order to promote economic and social equality, he had to promote issues that led to these things. In other words, he felt that the newly freed blacks were not ready to integrate themselves into white society, a society that did not respect their freedom at all. He wanted African Americans to embrace a nationalistic attitude before asking white society to embrace it. If blacks were seen as the uncouf beings that we were thought to be...acceptance would never occur. So, in using every resource available including accommodation, Washington underhandedly promoted social and racial equality for all.",
            "Booker Washington rose to fame as a great American because of his intense understanding of the American system of government and his ability to stay focused. Booker obviously understood the impact of slavery on his race and that freedom alone was not enough in a country that did not respect that freedom. Booker's ideology coincided with that of Frederick Douglas who would have made the speech at the Atlanta Exposition, but he died earlier that year.Booker's speech was &quot;nationalistic&quot; as he told his listeners to be as seperate as the fingers on the hand and to cast down your buckets where you are. It appears to me that he prefered separation, and individualized education geared towards economic empowerment of the newly freed &quot;negroes&quot;. 90% of all the black people in this country had been slaves and lived below the Mason-Dixon Line. The other 10% were free, yet not free. Tuskegee (Institute) University attests to his abilites as a monument builder. &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; is a story within a story. Booker T. Washinton, according to Louis Harlan was a &quot;wizard&quot;. Even W.E.B. Dubois in his latter years, prior to joining the Communist Party began to agree with many of Washington's philosophies. Booker T. Washington was a politican and a technicrat. He got the job done.",
            "i wanted to read a book written by someone who lived as an american \"slave\" as well as thru the period of \"reconstruction\" that WAS america in the late 19th century; i hoped to hear a first hand account of slavery from a person who survived it. i wanted to understand the struggles and joys of a person who lived as a newly emancipated citizen. booker t washington is one such person who was freed from bondage.what i loved about this book:*first hand account of the affects of slavery such as: naming himself, not knowing his own birthday and age, no ties to family, no knowledge of lineage of either of his parents, etc.*THE TRUTH about why he is lauded as one of america's greatest \"african americans\"*the early struggles of tuskegee as a universitywhat i loved less about this book:* references to ppl, places, organizations, etc. lost to history. google helped, but dang :(* incessant listing of accomplishments - including how well received booker was by white media and white america - rather than discussion of his relationships with his 3 wives and 3 childrenaltho this book was written by booker t washington about his own life, i didnt feel as if his autobiography allowed me to learn much about him as a man... as a person.i am glad it was written as it gives context for an era and a person i can never know about, but this book is more about the chronography of booker t washington's accomplishments rather than who this man was and how he lived.that being said, i still think every american should read this book!",
            "I think Up from Slavery is a good book, its for all readers who want to learn about black heritage. Booker is a young man eager to learn and have a education. Washington was born in Virgina at a slave hut. Washington attended the school Hampton. In order for him to get in this fine school, he had to sweep and clean the speaking room, one day the superintendent came by with a white glove and ran her finger across every piece of furniture, no dust. The superintendent was so impressed she enrolled him at Hampton, this just lets you know how much he wanted to learn.",
            "Several years ago I read this book for the first time and was intigued with all the vivid details Booker T. remembers from his childhood. Since then I have reread parts of this book many times and have branched out to reading other slave writings. I think this book and some of the others should be included in every junior high and high school curriculum. Other books about the slave condition I would recommend are THE JOURNAL OF LEROY JONES, A FUGITIVE SLAVE, I WAS BORN A SLAVE, and THE DIARY OF A SLAVE GIRL, RUBY JO.",
            "I feel that I have met an extraordinary man of history after reading &quot;Up From Slavery&quot;. This book is an autobiography by Professor Booker T Washington (1856-1915). He was born into the deplorable condition of genocide which bears the euphemism of &quot;slavery&quot;. He found a way through iron will and determinism to &quot;do a thing that the world wants done&quot; enabling to &quot;make a living for himself and others&quot; through embracing the joy and love of labor. His greatest accomplishment was the founding and building of the Tuskegee Institute of Normal and Industrial Institute from a chicken shack to a school with assets of over $500,000 free from mortgage. He rose to national and international attention as the most influential African-American of his time with his famous speech calling people to &quot;cast down your bucket where you are.&quot; People who accomplish great things are controversial, and Professor Washington was no different. Dr W E B Du Bois in &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot; wrote of Professor Washington, &quot;His doctrine has tended to make the whites, North and South, shift the burden of the Negro problem to the Negro's shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic spectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation, and the hands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting these great wrongs.&quot; During the Civil Rights struggles of the 1960's Washington's philosophy was called into question by none other than the great Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who wrote in his book &quot;Why We Can't Wait&quot;, &quot;Be content [Washington] said in effect, with doing well what the times permit you to do at all. However, this path, they soon felt, had too little freedom in its present and too little promise in its future.&quot; These are the issues that continue to develop, and will, I suspect, for some time to come. I was most impressed by the capacity for Professor Washington to forgive. Of all his impressive accomplishments, this is one that spoke to me undeniably of his courage and strength. He forgives the man who sired him, a man worthy of the title &quot;father&quot; only in the strict biological sense. Professor Washington writes, &quot;Whoever he was, I never heard of his taking the least interest in me or providing in any way for my rearing. But I do not find especial fault with him. He was simply another unfortunate victim of the institution which the Nation unhappily had engrafted upon it at that time.&quot; Some contend that his attitudes were politically motivated, yet, I do not see what Professor Washington would stand to gain by forgiving the man who &quot;fathered&quot; him. With unblemished sincerity, he forgave his slave masters, (&quot;man-stealers&quot;, as Frederick Douglass called them). Professor Washington wrote, &quot;I pity from the bottom of my heart any nation or body of people that is so unfortunate as to get entangled in the net of slavery. I have long since ceased to cherish any spirit of bitterness against the southern white people on account of the enslavement of my race.&quot; He genuinely felt that he was far better off than his masters because, &quot;the slave system on our place, in a large measure, took the spirit of self reliance and self-help out of the white people.&quot; Why would he believe this? The epitome of his life's goal was to find and do something which was valued. The very thing his masters could not do. &quot;My old master had many boys and girls, but not one, so far as I know, ever mastered a single trade or special line of productive industry.&quot; Some may, after reading this book, still feel that Professor Washington's attitudes were politically motivated. I cannot accept that idea. I have never known any one nor do I believe it is possible to feign this level of forgiveness. It is my opinion that Professor Booker T Washington is a reflection of a love which is divine. This is one of the reasons I am so impressed with this man, and this book.",

            "Booker T. Washington lived his life on target. He had a purpose and he made a lasting contribution. Washington was a Christian, a scholar, a motivator, a writer, an educator, a role model, a scientist, and more. Look at his life, what he wrote and how he approached life and you will see similarities between his thoughts and those of other achievers. Such individuals usually: read extensively, travel widely, and pursue education. This book is loaded with Christian success principles that transcend time and location. I found this book to be extremely inspiring. What would BTW do if he had the internet?",
            "A fascinating read about the life and times of Booker T. Washington and his march from slavery to one of the foremost men of his time.His views may seem quite antiquated in today's world, given what has happened and not happened in the last 100 years in race relations and it is easy to see how Black leaders of today might be critical of Washington's views and perspectives.But to do so would be to make the all too common mistake of imprinting and transferring today's value system and experiences on a culture and time of long ago. Anyone can look back with 20-20 hindsight and criticize. What matters most is having a plan to move forward from where you are, and Booker T. Washington certainly had that. His is a remarkable story of courage, grace, and iron-willed determination, for himself and for his race.While today's leaders and purists might criticize Washington, it should never be forgotten that he took the first steps and led his race and the entire South in the first steps, no matter how imperfect they may be in hindsight, up and away from slavery.There had to be a Booker T. Washington to bridge the gap between what was and what was to be. He knew his role and peformed it well.",

Despite the risk of sounding cliche, he has become an inspiration and hero to me. If not for his convictions and spirit, he would have been quite ordinary. Instead, he accomplished incredible goals, overcoming unimaginable feats, and has reached an inumerable amount of people, generation after generation. This book is a mainstay on my bedside table. Required reading for all.",
            "Black South Africans have been deprived of educational system for a very long time. Reading this autobiography I'm inspired to teach as much as I've learn to others less fortunate. And I may end up being a career academic like Booker T as well. Having started a career in public speaking before reading this book I feel even more inspired to continue this pursuit because its such an effective tool. Booker T was a master orator from his own accounts. Surely all the invitations received (with no marketing or self-promotion) is a testament to his skill as an orator. Slow but sure progress is made. The language is easy to understand yet the structure is complex because there are lessons to be learnt on many levels. I highly recommend this book to all non-white South African especially those of mixed decent and black people in general. Booker T was what is called in modern South Africa a \"coloured\" person. He has a white father and a black mother.",
            "Washington potrays a resilient and resourceful man in his autobiography, \"Up from Slavery.\" With little formal education as a child, his abilities and outward accomplishments are astounding to read about. Tuskegee being the most well known, but not his only significant achievement.Stripped to its barest elements, Washington presents a philosophy that those with character and industry will succeed. Despite deep racism and prejudice, persistence in an American form of opportunity can result in success over time, as evidenced by Washington's life.Washinton makes no excuses and moves forward despite unfair and unreasonable treatment.",
            "Having heard much said about Booker T Washington without really knowing anything about him, I bought this biography and read it in 2 days it was that gripping. It was very informative of the time and gave a good insight into the way things were in THE Post Slavery South US, leaving one to ask why there is not more written or said about him(Booker T Washington) in schools and colleges today. I thought his views and ideas for education being both theoretical and practical for black america and the Islands were revolutionary, and if they had been implemented throughout the South one can only think America would be a much better place as the Booker type institutions may well have gone some way to eliminating on mass, much of the black poverty associated with the southern states.

It is my wish that all people could read his story. I was humbled when I read this book. I wish that his legacy had endured more among the black population of this country. His message of hope through education and love of labor for its own rewards is a profound statement of love and commitment to his race. He is in my mind one of the greatest men who ever lived.

Washington was certainly a intelligent man and a great thinker. We found his notes very easy to read and they did flow even though he was a bit hesitant to publish his story from his notes written when he traveled around the country. What a great man. We learned about the book from another book club so there are others also using it as a book club read. It was uplifting to hear from a slave child-man something good about the outcome of his life. His vision for the future still should apply to the children today of all races in America.Thank you Amazon for offering this book. GL",

He did not nurse grudges or let others bring him down. Whether or not you feel that he should have spoken up more for judicial equality, you have to admit that he was a strong, dedicated man of character.Everyone: white, black, brown, or any other shade, can benefit from reading the autobiography of this great American.",
            "What a wonderful gift to give history buffs or African-Americans. Booker T. Washington began with nothing, not even a last name, and he drove himself to learn to read and become educated. I plan to read this book over and over, and I have highlighted several quotes that I intend to quote to my friends when they are complaining about trivial things. I also recommend the fictional The Journal of Darien Dexter Duff, an Emancipated Slave, The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo, and The Journal of Leroy Jeremiah Jones, a Fugitive Slave. All are chock full of history while being easy to read and fun. And they include photos. Read all of these fine books.",
            "This book is hard to get into at first because Washington, in my opinion, isn't the greatest writer. He writes using many run-on sentences and MANY, MANY commas with phrases that can distract you from the meaning of the sentence (as a rule, notwithstanding, to such an extent, this is to say etc...) he seems to state his observations as if it is a fact. He tells how there were such great relations between blacks &amp; whites throughout the south and blacks held ABSOLUTELY NO resentment towards their slaveowners. I found that hard to believe (how would he know when he was just a slave?) Many of his &quot;facts&quot; didn't seem to agree with history and what I thought slavery and black/white relations were like. He almost seemed ignorant to what was probably happening around him. He goes on to tell about his life and spends at least 1/2 of the book talking about his school in Tuskegee...after a while it gets boring and you want to hear some interesting stories about HIM! I didn't think the book was too great or very informative at all.",
            "I read this book as a part of a class. In this class we discussed Washington's work as written from the 'trickster' perspective. In this light it was quite interesting to see how he points out hypocrasies indirectly, while apparently stating the opposite. Thus, creating a self-aware hypocrasy within the text itself. I'm not sure that I am yet convinced, however. The work often seems a little bit on the acquiescent side to me.",
            "This book was the most boring book I have ever read. There was no point to the whole book, because all he talked about was his accomplishments and things that other people wrote about him. This book has no suspenseful or interesting parts in it. I feel that no one could ever like this book.",
            "This is the most boring book I've ever read. I didn't even finish it. Booker T. Washington is not a very good writer (which isn't surprising because he had very little education). Booker T. Washington was born a slave--interesting, was emancipated by Abraham Lincoln, then traveled from West Virginia to Virginia to go to school, graduated and then eventually got invited to start his own school in Alabama. So he started a school. That is not interesting or invigorating or special. Why would you want to read about a guy who started his own school? Is that that fascinating or interesting? He didn't escape a slave or anything like that, he was emancipated like everyone else and then went to school like many people did--nothing interesting. Why don't we all just write autobiographies about ourselves because we feel like it?",

            "I found this book at first hard to read but as I continued to push on I found that the works of Mr. Washington were making a deep impact on not only my intellect but also my inner spirit. My first interest in this book was to understand how the Tuskeege school started because I am one of the privliged americans that can trace the education of my ancestors back to the begining classes of the institute. As I continued to read I began to feel even more pride in the achievments on my grandfather, mother and myself. The only thing that puzzled me was the consitent mentioning of how the southern whites were so helpful in the rise and start of the negro's education. Personally the stories I have heard speak to the oppisdit actions and I am lead to ask the question - if the was such a united feeling amoungsdt the blacks and the whites in the northen and southern states addressing the education of the negro race then where on earth did it start to go wrong? For that answer I will have to continue to research and speak to the elder members of my family because I just can't understand how we went from one united beliefe of education to the fight of our civil rights.",

It isn't that we are physically incapable, but that we aren't willing to sacrifice today for future benefit. Everyone can get something from this book.",
            "Alina Stanton Nov.15Up From SlaveryThe author of this book is Booker T. Washington. This book is about Booker T Washington. It's an autobiography of how he grew up as a slave and as a free man. It shows the struggles that a lot of poor slaves had when they were freed from slavery.When Booker was young he lived with his mom on one plantation, his dad lived on another. He lived with his mom, half brother, half sister and step dad. Booker really wanted an education, so he started to teach himself to read. He had an English dictionary that emphasized on the alphabet and he read it all the time. Soon the slaves were freed. Booker started going to a day school once it opened up. He was not able to go to school later on because he had to work in a coal mine with his dad. He made a deal with his dad to work on the coalmines early in the morning till nine then goes to school. When he was a little older he decided to go to a school called Hampton Institute in West Virginia. You can live there and work as well as go to school.While he lived there he had to work hard. He had to make money all the ways he could. He worked as a waitress a maid and a janitor. He met a general by the name of Armstrong. He respected this man a lot because he was very important. Booker felt honored to meet such a wealthy man, he liked the general a lot because he was very kind. General Armstrong gave Booker a personal check, which he had been saving for his own use, to help Tuskegee. That summer after his first year in the institute he had to work to pay off a sixteen-dollar debt. His mother died during the summer, he knew that he would never see her again. He graduated that year and then went to teach at the school that he attended when he was a boy. In 1878 he entered Wayland Seminary in Washington D.C. for a year of study. While he was there he made speeches in West Virginia for General Garfields presidency campaign. He graduated first class in Tuskegee in 1885.In my opinion, this is a descent book. It shows how the poor slaves grew up in a white world and how they struggled. It has a lot of information on Bookers life and how he struggled to make a good living and get a good education. I think Booker T. Washington is a well mannered, honorable man.",
            "As a 21st century African American, I must take issue with Mr. Washington's statement regarding how in all things social we can be totally seperate and unequal.Even though I can understand the practicality and expediency of making that sort of concession At That Time in history I still must question whether or not a statement such as that is a representation of true liberty and justice for all. In my mind it is not. It wasn't true then and it still isn't true today.Despite the tremendous Economic strides that have been made by people of color globally and particularly in the U.S., thanks in no small part to the efforts of great people like Mr. Washington, the society at large has remained very stratified. Attitudes though much improved have largely remained the same. Statements like the esteemed Mr. Washington's have too often served to dismiss the responsibility of offenders to remedy past wrongs which still have impact in the present day. They also serve to deny true equality of opportunity to all citizens. It also accomodates the offenders far greater than is deserved and does grave injustice to black and white alike. Mr. Washington makes reference himself to how injustices done to the black populace are just as injurious to the white population. Yet he does not view social seperatism as an injustice. With that I must take issue.All that notwithstanding it is an interesting, informative, and enjoyable read. Many of the principles by which he lived are as true today as they were during Reconstruction. However, certain opinions that he expressed could have the effect of limiting economic opportunity by confining Blacks to the ranks of laborers rather than entrepreneurs, managers, and other professionals if too stringently adhered to. These pursuits require concentrated study and effort by themselves.So read it but be sure to place it in the proper context.",
            "Booker T. Washington never blames slavery for his problems.

            "Washington was born into slavery as a result of his mother having been raped by her master. This autobiography is a recounting of his struggle from slavery to freedom and on to getting an education and becoming a teacher and then an educational administrator as well as a \"Black politician.\"In American culture, this narrative is cast as the quintessential \"raise yourself by your boot strap\" kind of story. In fact when I was in the First Grade, I can remember my First grade teacher, Mrs. Pogue, singing the praises of \"the Great Booker T. Washington.\"And while there is a great deal to admire about Mr. Washington, there is also a side that only came to light after hearing the other side of his story. Washington was called an \"accommodationist,\" \"or \"the great compromiser,\" which in the context of the times were euphemisms for being an \"Uncle Tom,\" or the HNIC. He was good at maneuvering his way around in a racist white culture thinking that he was doing his people a great deal of good when in fact he was being taken advantage of, or when he was in fact consciously \"selling his people out.\" By making a \"virtue, out of personal necessity,\" Washington always had a good justification for his action and eventually became the prototype of this kind of black politician. Many Black preachers still use the Washington template for handling cross-racial situations. Plus how else were blacks to negotiate the difficult racist political terrain of those difficult times?In the book, for instance, he eschews and discourages blacks from seeking a liberal arts education and from attending college, as being frivolous. He argued for the more practical area of the \"manual arts,\" and \"the trades.\" While this may have been useful -- even good advice -- in the context of the times, there were others of his contemporaries, such as WEB Dubois, who saw Washington's approach as strictly a formulaic kind of Uncle Tomism. And the embarrassing treatment of him at the 1905 World's Fair, kind of sealed this image of him as a Black Uncle Tom by blacks and a \"stooge\" by whites.While the book is a good read, in retrospect, it shows Washington to have been very nave politically, and too trusting of \"the white man,\" who it seems never quite saw the world as he did and neither had Washington's, nor the black race's best interests in mind. Maybe it is a bit harsh to judge his action after the fact, but all other black leaders are judged by the same criteria and they come out unblemished, while Washington's accommodationist methods do not seem to have held up well over time nor have they bore any fruit.Three Stars",
            "I feel that Washington's book was very much like he was, and that is two-faced. It may have been true that he needed white support in order to get money for blacks but I feel that he didn't tell the story the way it should have been told. Slavery was a lot harsher than Washington wrote it was, this book was too carefree in dealing with the harshness of slavery. He wrote the book for the white man to read so that he could get their support and their money. He was the Benedict Arnold of the black folk.",
            "I read this book, here in Cear&aacute;, a state of Brazil.Even being an agronomist, I love to read books.This book is 100% available for free reading, on internet.This book was writen about 100 years ago, by an african-american , Booker T. Washington.Born in a slum, having as his mother, a black slave, as a child, Booker T. Washington became free.His father was a white man, and never recognized or create him.In fact, Booker T. Washington had a bitter childhood.Having a childhood cored in poverty, racism, prejudices, ignorance and hard labor; instead of becaming a neurotic, Booker T. Washington became a leader and teaching example for african-americans of his times.In fact many lessons of this book continuos to be usefull for every time, race or place.If you go to all my reviews that I writen before, just one autobiography that I gave five stars was, \"World of Yesterday\" by Stephan Zweig.To be sincere in an autobiography is very, very rare.One problem of this autobiography, is again his lack of sincerity.The author was writing about 100 years ago, and perhaps he couldn't tells us, what he was really thinking.To example, Booker T. never claims that segregation, racism/eugenics is/were by definition, bad.In fact, there's many good claims to some knowed eugenicists/racists at that times.The bitter author's childhood (a nightmare childhood), has very little space in this book.In fact, the sucess of Booker T. in education affairs has, big space in this book.Too much space, I think.If we were in 1906, I'll be giving five stars to this book.Being unsincere and having by today standards, some absurds, this book isn't useless, but we aren't in 1906.",
            "I read Up From Slavery in an African American Lit class, and was totally applauled by it. Washigton is so complaicent, the man was not even angry with white people for four hundred years of slavery. The debate between Washington and WEB DuBois is famous: Wash. wanted black people to forgive and forget and continue to be the southerners work dogs. DuBois wanted the negro race to embrace higher education and follow in the footsteps of wealthy Americans like Rockefeller and Carnegie. Which plan was better for uplifting a race? It depends upon which direction the country was going at the turn of the century.",
            "I thought this was supposed to be an autobiography! All he talks about is his school. He mentions his wife and kids only once or twice. I got the impression that he was a very selfish man. Plus, to top it off, the book was boring!",
            "This book talks of slavery in a positive light. Two thirds of the book is telling about the school he opened, briefly mentioning his personal or home life.",
            "I loved this book except for the fact that it made me realize how easy I've had it. This should be required reading for all students.",
            "I found the book to be very interesting and gave insight into the time period that it was written. The book was very compelling and kept my attention. It definitely a great read.",

            "In 1901, Booker T. Washington (1856-1915) published this autobiography. Born into slavery, after emancipation, Mr. Washington developed a philosophy that African-Americans needed to sweep away the ignorance that their subservient position had left them with, and earn the respect of the whites through hard work and excellence. In 1881 he founded the Tuskegee Institute to teach African-Americans how to study, how to work hard and intelligently (producing better results than the white businesses of the day), and how to have respect for themselves and others. This is Mr. Washington's story of his youth and his success at Tukegee.This is a fascinating and uplifting book. Though cognizant of the racism that often surrounded him, Mr. Washington never lost his faith in the basic goodness of the people of all colors that he met. The only problem I had with this excellent book was the knowledge I could not shake, that Mr. Washington's faith was not rewarded, and the white community of the day would not give the African-American community respect and fair treatment.That said, though, this is a great and wonderful book, which should rightly be considered an American classic. If you want to read a book that is a window on the America of the late nineteenth century, or if you want an uplifting book about a man of faith and love, then I highly recommend that you get this book!",
            "I was very impressed with this book, it is well worthreading and makes you think just how much change for the better has occurred because of the effort of one incredible man.",
            "a movie needs to be done about this guy. dont listen to al sharpton- if booker t can do what he did, anyone can. i'd give it 5 stars but for the style of writing at the time leaves me wanting coffee",
            "What can I say! I was totally inspired and enthused by reading Up from Slavery! The insight of Booker T Washington, his undying faith and determination is inspiring to say the least! And the principles he speaks of are timeless and relate to people of all skin colors. He had a blue print for the success of a people. Regretfully, I believe we have lost the vision Washington shared! I can only hope and pray that we will regain that vision.",
            "This book gives an excellent insight into Booker T's life. The unknowns, the lack of a childhood and the fear that existed then is unimaginable. This book gives inspiration to those who would be thinking of giving up.",
            "I've long wanted to read this book and finally did in two days. It was a rewarding experience. Booker T. Washington was a great man born into slavery, into abject poverty, on a plantation in Virginia. He never knew his father or even his birthday. Washington was six or seven years old when the War Between the States ended. He lived in a slave cabin with his mother, his older brother John, his younger brother and sister, and an orphan boy. His mother, the cook for the \"big house\" was an illiterate as most slaves were, but a strong woman of common sense who cared for her family as best she could. Their cabin was primitive with a dirt floor no windows and poorly protected from the elements.After the war Booker moved with his mother and step father to West Virginia where he was put to work in the salt mines. Determined to get some schooling he did so at night with great difficulty.Washington heard about a school for Negroes in Virginia called Hampton. He set out on foot with 50 cents in his pocket. He eventually reached Hampton and went to school there working his way through as a janitor.Booker T. Washington met race prejudice, poverty, and illiteracy and overcame all of these obstacles.He went on to establish Tuskegee Institute in Alabama for his people. It educated boys and girls not only in academics but in agriculture and useful trades. He started the school from nothing raising all the money from contributions and the hard work of he and his students. The school still exists today and is thriving.\"Up From Slavery\" is an inspiring book. It should be on everyone's list as a must read.",
            "I read this book with my 12 year old as part of a book club.I didn't know much about Booker T. Washington,and this book was very interesting.He was truly a remarkable man living in a time of extreme change for our country.I feel I now have a broader view of the post slavery South then I had,even growing up there.",
            "This book is one in a vast library of African American literary history that I posses. It is academically written, yet very easy to read. The contents of this text continue to inspire my will to be a great humanitarian, world citizen, and advocate for African education, science, medicine, and unity",
            "This is one of America's great books, and Booker T. Washington was a great American.Washington was born into slavery, freedom came when he was about six years old. As a child, he worked at farming and coal mining, while he sought an education. All of this time he lived in base poverty.After saving what little money he could, he set out from his home in West Virginia, for a black school in Virginia. The school was run by a retired Union Army officer, who recognized Washington's ability.Washington worked his way through school, graduated, and headed home to West Virginia to establish a school for blacks. There wasn't much money in it, but his dream was to help his people escape from ignorance and poverty.When the state of Alabama wanted to establish a school for blacks, the Tuskegee Institute, Washington was chosen to run it. His budget was pitiful, and he started teaching school in a dilapidated shanty and a hen house. His students tolerated these conditions, along with grinding poverty, because that's what it took to receive an education.The school always insisted that all students work while they study. They raised crops and animals, made bricks for sale, and built the various buildings which were needed to hold the school's ever expanding population.Money was always short, and Washington had to spend a lot of his time in the North raising funds. He was a talented speaker, and became famous on that account. He eventually formed relationships with a number of wealthy patrons, who provided funds to run and expand the Tuskegee Institute.By the time the book was written, the Institute had 6000 graduates working across the South, and had trained a large number of teachers to educate southern blacks.This book is valuable, both for the information it holds, and for the fine example of Christian love which Washington models.",
            "For educational pedagogy, for philanthropical courage, for inspiration and motivation on how to be the best person, read this book. Washington overcame enormous odds with intense ambition; he wanted to do his &quot;level best&quot; everyday.I found his story to be the real thing, the real item in...get this...motivational literature. Of all the self-help books published today, Washington's autobiography reads realistic and true for courage, solid advice, and practical solutions.Washington takes the large view to the race problems of his day. He is more concerned with building better human beings, male and female, regardless of race. His strategies with his students involved enforcing basic health care, instilling focused, daily discipline habits, providing vocational and academic training, and always presenting an overreaching concern for helping others achieve their highest potential. THAT is the good life.",
            "I found the book to be strange in some regards. Professor Washington seemed to harbor no bad feelings toward any Southerner, or even his former owners. That aside, the book is very interesting. His point of view on slavery and Southern race relations are unlike any other I've heard. Regardless of what another review says, he was definately not a selfish person in any way. He only seemed to care about his school and work, not personal life. He states that he doesnt play any games of any sort. Read this book if you want a refreshing view of post-Civil War race relations.",
            "Up from Slavery, autobiography by Booker T. Washington, is a true classic in African-American literature. Washington opens Chapter 1: \"A Slave Among Slaves\" with his vivid recollections as a Negro child growing up in the South: a slave on a plantation in Virginia, a white father he never knew, illiterate and living in horrid conditions. After the emancipation of slaves, Washington's family moves to West Virginia where he labors at the salt furnace and in the coal mines. In his precious few moments of spare time, he learns to read and gains enough confidence to leave everything behind to journey to the Hampton Institute. Later, because of his success at Hampton, he is given the opportunity to start Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Tuskegee Institute is successful partly due to Washington's extensive travel to the North to solicit funds for the school. The students at Tuskegee, in addition to the day-to-day traditional class work, are expected to learn an industrious trade and to work at mastering that trade. Based on his own life experience, Washington believes that the most prudent way the Negro race will persevere is through this combination of education, hard work and service to others. He believes that the White race will come to appreciate the Negro race only if the Negro people prove their worth to society. Because of his passive stance, many, such as W.E.B. DuBois, et. al., labeled Washington as \"The Great Accomodator.\" In other words, accommodating those who were the enslavers instead of advocating for the rights of those who were enslaved. You can get a sense of this in Washington's most notable speech, the address to the Atlanta Cotton States and International Exposition of 1895:\"The wisest among my race understand that the agitation of questions of social equality is the extremist folly, and that progress in the enjoyment of all the privileges that will come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle rather than artificial forcing.\"This speech brought national acclaim to Booker T. Washington and, at the time, placed him in the forefront as one of the leading authorities of his race.",
            "This book is a fascinating historical account of the atmosphere of America during Reconstruction. The opinions of an ex-slave on matters of racial relations, education, suffrage, and so forth are certainly worth considering in any study of this period. I loved Booker T. Washington's autobiography for this.But I also enjoy this book because it has character. Mr. Washington gives bits of advice on how to be a good public speaker - as he was a speaker of much renown - and this was quite delightful as I have often been somewhat confused by such matters. Add to this his endearing stories of the white and black races, and you have yourself an extremely worthwhile and enjoyable read.",
            "Mr. Washington's book is facinating to me as an American history major. I found that learning from a black man what Reconstruction meant to a lot of former slaves was very enlightening. Mr. Washington offers up a point of view that in many cases, slavery served both black and white people well. The lines between slave owners and the slaves were often blurred; not just due to interracial relations, but socially as well.But, this book is not about slavery. Mr. Washington came from nothing and not only lifted himself up from poverty and ignorance, but determined that his life's work would be to assist others in their own efforts at bettering their lives. I found it terribly ironic that the former slaves, and children thereof, thought that their ultimate goal was to no longer do any kind of manual labor. That is what got this country into trouble. White men relying on others to do their manual labor. Mr. Washington's pragmatic approach to teaching black men and women how to care for themselves and learn a practical trade makes a lot of sense to me.The best parts of this book have to do with Mr. Washington's attitude toward life. His observations and attitudes are so positive and broad, that they are not defined by race. I found myself wanting to highlight and underline parts of the book; but the book I was reading was borrowed. Hence I am going to purchase a copy for myself. I do not buy many books; however, this book is one to keep for life. I am sure to refer to Mr. Washington's book in the future; Not just for historical content, but to keep me on track in life.",
            "...Up From Slavery Booker T. WashingtonUp From Slavery is an autobiography by Booker Taliaferro Washington. Booker T. Washington was a great man who fought his way out of slavery to become an educator, statesman, and political power. He was born near a crossroads post-office called Hale's Ford, in the year 1858 or 1859. He does not remember the exact year, month or date because it was the time of slavery. He lived in a cabin with his mother, his older brother John and his sister Amanda until after the Civil War when they all were declared free. He does not know any of his history beyond his mother, and less beyond his father. For most of his boyhood life he lived in an old broken down cabin containing no windows and no beds. Almost everyday of his life was occupied by some kind of labor. He had no time for himself or sports. On several occasions he went as far as the schoolhouse door with one of the young mistresses to carry her books. The picture of several dozen boys and girls in a classroom engaged in study had always made a big impression on him. He felt that to get into a schoolhouse and study in the way they did would be about the same as being in paradise. After the slaves were freed there were two points that the blacks throughout the south agreed on: That they must change their names and they must leave the old plantation for at least a few days or weeks to feel sure that they were free. After freedom was declared Booker's stepfather sent for his mother and the whole family to come to the Kanawha Valley, in West Virginia. Booker always had an intense longing to learn to read. When he was young he determined that if he accomplished nothing else in life, he would some way get enough education to enable him to read common books and newspapers. He worked in a coal mine to help pay for his education. He overheard a few people talking about Hampton University it struck his interest. He set many of his goals to go there and get a good education. One teacher that influenced Booker T. Washington was Mrs. Ruffner. She encouraged and sympathized with him in all of his efforts to get an education. While working for her he was allowed one hour a day to go to school. While living with her he began to get his first library together. In 1872 he set out to Hampton Institute a school in West Virginia, he didn't know how much it would cost or where it was. His brother helped him out with the money. When he left his mother was very weak and broken in health he hardly expected to see her again, so parting with her was very hard for him. He had to sleep on the streets because the white would not let him stay in the hotel. He had many interactions like this one. He began working for a captain in a seaport unloading crates. Booker gained his entrance to Hampton Institute by cleaning a room for Miss Mary Mackie, the lady principal. Mr S. Griffths Morgan of New Medford, Mass. from 1872-1876 donated his tuition scholarship. Booker graduated from Hampton Institute in 1875. Booker returned to Hampton Institute and started the night school to aid deserving students. In conclusion this book Up From Slavery is a very well written book. It has many details on the life of Booker T. Washington. I recommend it to young kids who enjoy reading about history and how the slaves were freed."

        "description": "During & after the Civil War hundreds of Quaker women went south as ministers & teachers to the freed people. These women left comfortable homes & often deferred marriage or put aside the demands of families, if not careers, in response to what they perceived as a divine call. They faced prejudice, ridicule, abuse, & sometimes violence at the hands of Southern whites for whom education of black people was an unthinkable challenge to a racist political & social system that dated back two-&-a-half centuries. As Selleck shows, while by our standards these women were not always free from the prejudice they worked to overcome, they certainly were far in advance of the overwhelming majority of their contemporaries. Quakers may have recognized the evil of slavery earlier than their neighbors, but once they \"cleared\" themselves of it, their patterns of reluctance to admit black members, & their segregation of those they did admit, were little different from the practice of the larger society. This is also a contribution to women's history. In many ways, the women described were building a long-established tradition of feminine benevolence that was hardly unique to Friends; in others they foreshadowed the civil rights activists who went south in the 1960s.",

It is devided into a number of cases in which the author describes the actions and accomplishments of various Quaker educators durring the Civil War era. Noteworthy was their fustrations with Southerners who distrusted any &quot;teachers&quot; from the North, especially ones who sought to educate former slaves. For someone unaware but interested in the history of Quakerism in the mid 19th century, or interested in 19th century women's history, I recomend this book."

            "Paul Peterson and William Howell are revolutionaries in their field--Education Public Policy. This book is so great because it lacks the ideological and political biases that permeate nearly 90 percent of the voucher books out there. Despite what the previous reviewer stated I wish to defend Howell and Peterson's book (which needs no defending from me). Their book which is put out by the Brookings Institute (hardly an ideologically driven think-tank Brookings is the model of centrism) Howell and Peterson formulate their empirical data from randomized field trials. RFTs are the gold standard in empirical research studies that seek to compare two groups of individuals while controlling for one factor. In this case Howell and Peterson are able to control for the much noted self-selection bias problematic to many voucher studies and show that African-American students from similar economic and educational backgrounds score significantly (1 standard deviation)higher when they are educated in parochial/private schools than in their neighborhood public schools. A wealth of research from 99.9 percent of all the other scholars studying this topic have in one shape or form supported that finding--that black students do improve upon going to a private school viz. a voucher. Only Alan Krueger and Zho (2004) of Princeton discredit parts of the study, but they refuse to control for baseline data which does not allow them to control the self-selection bias. Furthermore Krueger et al. uses a questionable racial classification scheme where self-identified black/hispanic folks are reclassified as African-American/non-hispanic. In the final analysis its hard to disagree with Peterson and Howell and the above reviewer does so at his own peril. These folks are professionals in the truest sense of the word and they work at the venerable Harvard Program on Education and Governance Policy--please don't try to mislead people into thinking they are overly ideologically motivated.",
