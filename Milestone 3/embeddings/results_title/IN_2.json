The book conducts a thorough evaluation of current methodologies for a wide rage of circumstances in which racial discrimination may occur and makes recommendations on how to better assess the presence and effects of discrimination.Excerpt: In the United States, large differences among racial and ethnic groups characterize many areas of social, economic, and political life, including such domains as the criminal justice system, education, employment, health care, and housing. For example, racial differences-which generally disadvantage minorities-exist in arrest and incarceration rates, earnings, income and wealth, levels of educational attainment, health status and health outcomes, and mortgage lending and homeownership. There are many possible explanations for such differences; one explanation may be the persistence of behaviors and processes of discrimination against minorities.In this context, the Committee on National Statistics convened the Panel on Methods for Assessing Discrimination in 2001 to define racial discrimination; review and critique existing methods used to measure such discrimination and identify new approaches; and make recommendations regarding the best of these methods, as well as promising areas for future research. Because of wide interest in this topic, several funding agencies sponsored our study: the Ford Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Department of Education.The work of this panel is a direct outgrowth of the project that resulted in the two-volume report America Becoming: Racial Trends and Their Consequences (National Research Council, 2001a). Several of the panel members who were involved in producing these volumes held conversations around the question \"What do we need to know to understand more about the role of race in American society?\" At least one answer was\"We need better methods to identify and understand the effects of race-based discrimination.\"The panel comprised a diverse group of experts in the fields of criminal justice, law, economics, psychology, public policy, sociology, and statistics. This diversity added a great deal to the creative debates among the panel members but also added to the difficulties in writing this report. It took time to develop a language and an intellectual framework with which we were all comfortable. In our report, we provide an extended discussion of definitions of discrimination and race, consolidating many aspects of a large social science literature on these topics. We also discuss various approaches to modeling and measuring discrimination in different fields. The interdisciplinary and diverse nature of the panel helped broaden these discussions, and we hope that our presentation of the definitional issues provides insight to those interested in the conceptualization of discrimination, just as we hope that our discussion of the methodological issues introduces new ideas to those engaged in measuring discrimination.The breadth and complexity of the topic of discrimination and its effects posed a challenge for maintaining a tight focus on our charge, which was to define discrimination and review methods for measuring it. To keep to that charge, we spend no time discussing policies intended to alleviate discrimination (such as affirmative action or programs to build recruitment pools). We acknowledge, however, that the panel members have diverse opinions about appropriate policy options to address problems of discrimination, and inevitably our debates over policy issues at times crept into our debates over methodological issues.Because of the charge and constraints on our time and resources, we focus our analysis on racial discrimination, particularly discrimination against African Americans, for which there is a very large literature. We do not address discrimination on the basis of nonracial factors, such as gender or age, nor do we discuss so-called reverse discrimination. Under the rubric of racial discrimination, we do include discrimination against ethnic groups, particularly Hispanics. The reasons have to do with the discrimination that has affected them coupled with the blurred nature of the definition of race and ethnicity for many Hispanics.All of the panel members recognize the difficulties in defining racial discrimination in a clear way and in finding credible ways to measure it. There are different types of discrimination, different venues in which it can occur, and different ways in which it can have an effect. This report cannot address all of these topics comprehensively, but we have attempted to focus on at least some of the more important definitional and measurement problems. The measurement issues we address are relevant for understanding and measuring other types of discrimination. Despite the difficulty of ourtask, the panel members are all persuaded that accurate methods to identify and measure discrimination are highly important, and as scholars and re-searchers, we were committed to carrying out our charge in the best way possible.",

But today, race-based public policy has once again become the norm, this time under the banner of affirmative action. How, asks Terry Eastland, did such a turnabout take place, and how can we restore colorblind law in America today? In this compelling and powerful book, Eastland lays bare the absurdities and injustices of affirmative action, and presents the strongest case to date for doing away with race-based and gender-based preferences\u2014a ringing call for all Americans to reclaim our nation's shared values of equal protection under the law, without reference to race, color, creed, gender, or national origin.",

            "Readers looking for an impassioned tirade against racial quotas will be disappointed. Readers who are fed up with all the impassioned tirades against and all the fanatical polemics in favor of giving certain people Most Favored Race status will find this book a welcome relief.Chapter 1 (pp. 1 - 20) makes the point that prejudice by any other name is still prejudice. It doesn't cease to be prejudice depending on which race it is directed against.Chapter 2 (pp. 21 - 38) sketches the history of the America's insistence on no discrimination based on \"race, color, creed or country of national origin.\"Chapter 3 describes the about-face the nation did in the 1960s. \"It is hard to find in the speeches or statements of civil rights leaders prior to the early 1960s any sustained interest in `preferential treatment' for blacks.\" (p. 42). In 1961, CORE, then a small splinter party, began to agitate for racial preferences. One thing that helped cause the about-face was rioting. \"The traditional response to a riot had been to hold the rioting individuals responsible.\" (p. 44). A commission appointed by President Johnson in 1968 held that \"white racism\" was responsible. (p. 45). This began the now-accepted practice of holding the victims responsible for the crimes of racially ennobled individuals.Once the crack had been opened to preferences based on factors other than skills and performance, the dam burst and many other groups were granted Most Favored Group status until by 1990 the only group not eligible for preferential treatment was white American heterosexual males.As legal challenges were mounted and public opposition swelled, the wording of laws became more cagey: race, ethnicity and country of national origin were to be \"one factor among many\" in determining who was preferred. This protected the preferred groups from legal challenges and allowed them to go on doing preference-as-usual in college admissions, hiring and contracting.What most Americans do not realize is that this rather bizarre program and its rationale was only one among several that has placed this nation in great peril. If you want to read the whole story, get While America Sleeps: How Islam, Immigration and Indoctrination Are Destroying America from Within. All of these threats were started and are allowed to continue because of a change in the mind-set of American leaders and media people. The only way to save America is to change this mind-set.",
            "This is another in a growing wave of anti-affirmative action books. It is also one of the best.It focuses on the twisted history of affirmative action and how the original purpose of the civil rights movement was respect for individual liberty without the \"group rights\" philisophy intrinsic in affirmative action.Bureaucrats looking for short cuts and easy solutions pushed affirmative action - without democratic legislative approval. Minority groups behaved as anyone receiving a state-sponsored benefit does - they adopted the \"philosophy\" and began to protect their newly discovered \"rights\". The fact that these \"rights\" had no legal basis and questionable pedigree in the cast and race-obsessed systems of India, Malaysia and Yugoslavia seemed of little consequence at the time. The term \"Balkanisation\" (a sad relic of Old World ethnic hatred) now has a disturbing echo in the affirmative action policies of the New World.Other reviewers may argue that affirmative action policies cannot be \"unjust\" because, although discriminatory, they are not designed to humiliate or alienate whites - only to benefit that amorphous group called \"underrepresented minorities\". The argument turns to dust when it is realised the biggest losers in the affirmative action contest are Asians. But no one wants that little secret revealed.",
            "The fatal flaw in Terry Eastland's book is his interpretation of Justice John Marshall Harlan's famous dissent in the case Plessy v. Ferguson. Indeed, this is the same flaw that can be found in the arguments many of the opponents of affirmative action.Astonishingly, Mr. Eastland's book refers to Justice John Marshall Harlan as Justice John Paul Harlan.Mr. Eastland argues that Justice Harlan, in his dissent in Plessy, wrote &quot;that government should not have the authority to engage in racial regulation of any kind.&quot; Mr. Eastland uses Justice Harlan's now famous statement &quot;Our constitution (sic) is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens\" to build a case that affirmative action violates our Constitution. Mr. Eastland, along with other opponents of affirmative action is mistaken. Contrary to the assertions of Mr. Eastland affirmative action respects Justice Harlan's &quot;color-blind&quot; Constitution. Like other opponents of affirmative action, such as Stephen and Abigail Thernstrom who in their book, America in Black and White, have the same flaw in their argument, Mr. Eastland misunderstands Justice Harlan's dissent in Plessy.Plessy v. Ferguson was the Supreme Court case decided in 1896 which upheld the 'separate but equal' doctrine. It was this doctrine that formed the Constitutional justification for the set of racial laws known as Jim Crow. The case arose as a result of a Louisiana law which required equal but separate accommodations aboard passenger trains for the black and white races. Justice Harlan was the only Supreme Court Justice to dissent in the Plessy case.Justice Harlan made it very clear in his dissent that he opposed Louisiana's law because it was &quot;conceived in hostility to, and enacted for the purpose of humiliating, citizens of the United States of a particular race.&quot; Justice Harlan acknowledged that the white race was the dominant race in wealth and in power. This dominance, Justice Harlan noted, did not give the white race a superior position with regard to the rights protected by the Constitution. The Constitution, according to Justice Harlan, recognizes &quot;no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens. There is no cast here. Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved.&quot;Justice Harlan did not object to the Louisiana law because it recognized the social, political, and cultural reality of race. Justice Harlan found the Louisiana law contrary to our Constitution because the action of the Louisiana legislature proceeded, according to Justice Harlan, &quot;on the ground that colored citizens are so inferior and degraded that they cannot be allowed to sit in public coaches occupied by white citizens?&quot; Justice Harlan's &quot;color-blind&quot; Constitution is &quot;color-blind&quot; precisely because it recognizes &quot;every right that inheres in civil freedom, and of the equality before the law of all citizens of the United States without regard to race.&quot; Thus, Justice Harlan argued, laws that would allow individuals of one race to degrade and put into an inferior position individuals of another race notwithstanding any inequalities in the actual social, political, and economic positions of these individuals, would be unconstitutional.Regarding affirmative action the issue is whether these programs conform to or violate Justice Harlan's &quot;color-blind&quot; Constitution. To find out, I have formulated the following questions that are based on the reasons Justice Harlan used in finding that the Louisiana law violated the principles of the &quot;color-blind&quot; Constitution. The words in quotation marks are the words used by Justice Harlan in his Plessy dissent.Are affirmative action programs &quot;conceived in hostility to&quot; the white race?Are affirmative action programs &quot;enacted for the purpose of humiliating&quot; the white race?Are the effects of an affirmative action program such that it &quot;practically, puts the brand of servitude and degradation upon&quot; whites?Do affirmative action programs proceed on the belief that white &quot;citizens are so inferior and degraded that they cannot be allowed&quot; in our schools of medicine and law?Do affirmative action programs violate any &quot;right that inheres in civil freedom&quot; and deny &quot;the equality before the law of all citizens of the United States without regard to race?&quot;The answers to these questions are no.Affirmative action, therefore, conforms to the principle of the &quot;color-blind&quot; Constitution and does not violate the rights of whites. Mr. Eastland and the other opponents of affirmative action are seriously mistaken when they insist otherwise. I agree with the other reviewers, such as Linda Chavez, who note that \"Terry Eastland puts forth the best argument to date\" for opposing affirmative action. But I have shown that this argument, though it is the best that the opponents of affirmative action can make, is fatally flawed."

FINALIST FOR THE FINANCIAL TIMES AND MCKINSEY BUSINESS BOOK OF THE YEAR AWARD \u2022 LONGLISTED FOR THE PORCHLIGHT BUSINESS BOOK AWARD \u201cLivingston has made the important and challenging task of addressing systemic racism within an organization approachable and achievable.\u201d\u2014Alex Timm, co-founder and CEO, Root Insurance Company How can I become part of the solution? In the wake of the social unrest of 2020 and growing calls for racial justice, many business leaders and ordinary citizens are asking that very question. This book provides a compass for all those seeking to begin the work of anti-racism. In The Conversation, Robert Livingston addresses three simple but profound questions: What is racism? Why should everyone be more concerned about it? What can we do to eradicate it? For some, the existence of systemic racism against Black people is hard to accept because it violates the notion that the world is fair and just. But the rigid racial hierarchy created by slavery did not collapse after it was abolished, nor did it end with the civil rights era. Whether it\u2019s the composition of a company\u2019s leadership team or the composition of one\u2019s neighborhood, these racial divides and disparities continue to show up in every facet of society. For Livingston, the difference between a solvable problem and a solved problem is knowledge, investment, and determination. And the goal of making organizations more diverse, equitable, and inclusive is within our capability. Livingston\u2019s lifework is showing people how to turn difficult conversations about race into productive instances of real change. For decades he has translated science into practice for numerous organizations, including Airbnb, Deloitte, Microsoft, Under Armour, L\u2019Oreal, and JPMorgan Chase. In The Conversation, Livingston distills this knowledge and experience into an eye-opening immersion in the science of racism and bias. Drawing on examples from pop culture and his own life experience, Livingston, with clarity and wit, explores the root causes of racism, the factors that explain why some people care about it and others do not, and the most promising paths toward profound and sustainable progress, all while inviting readers to challenge their assumptions. Social change requires social exchange. Founded on principles of psychology, sociology, management, and behavioral economics, The Conversation is a road map for uprooting entrenched biases and sharing candid, fact-based perspectives on race that will lead to increased awareness, empathy, and action.",

            "The previous reviewer's commentary is both biased and flawed, and his words reveal anger and probably latent racist beliefs as well. This book is a nice collection of various viewpoints in social science studies of prejudice, discrimination, and racism in the job market, higher education, and American life in general. Most of the readings are written by sociologists, so there is a heavy reliance on statistics and numbers to support the contributors' arguments. The single best article is written by Bob Blauner and is called \"Talking Past Each Other: Black and White Languages of Race.\" In this article, Blauner deconstructs the VERY type of rhetoric that the previous reviewer employs, rhetoric that is very characteristic of many whites in the post-Civil Rights Era (read the article for more information).Blauner's article, and the book in general, stress the importance that personal upbringing and experience plays in shaping one's views about race or anything else for that matter. That is the key point. A white multi-millionaire who grew up in a condominium on the shores of Long Island is simply not going to have the same outlook on life as an impoverished black female living in the slums of Chicago's South Side...period. The sooner Americans of all racial backgrounds realize that, and the sooner people accept and understand that their personal experiences have shaped their worldviews - and realize that NO ONE has an \"objective\" or \"unbiased\" worldview - that better off we will be.Books like this emphasize this crucial idea. For some reason, those who find themselves in relatively advantaged positions in society have a very hard time facing this music. This is a great book."

Mr. Steele's exposition of the racial situation is laid out for the reader in a simple, logical style which takes the reader on a survey of the racial questions which are current in America. The first thing the book takes on is race: is it real, is it OK to recognize that racial differences exist? The conclusion is that race does exist, the evidence is overwhelming and that it is OK to see that this is true. There are differences in skin color which aren't really very important but which are obviously inherited. There are differences in intellectual capacity which are much more important and are inherited. Most important of all, there are differences in character which are inherited. To Mr. Steele, these are the most important differences because they determine how we interact with the people around us. Steele discusses how animal breeders select for character in their dogs, in their horses, how the breeding for character and personality has a long history in the selection of domestic animals. He then shows research to support the contention that human character is also inherited and has been selected in different populations and, to use that word, races. Unlike other books on these topics, Mr. Steele's writing style is light and entertaining, yet very to the point. I was surprised to see my teenage daughter reading the book at a friend's house and complaining because we didn't have a copy so she could finish reading it. Now that's an endorsement of an engaging writing style! Unlike a lot of books on the racial problems in America, \"Defensive Racism\" isn't just about race. The book also discusses related national problems such as the true cost of unrestricted third world immigration, our current middle eastern wars and why we are there (Israel figures large in this discussion), a history of past wars with an explanation of the motives behind those wars (it wasn't just because we we were good and the other guys were bad), a chapter on economics that even a teenager can understand along with a prediction of an economic meltdown as the costs of racial problems overwhelm our ability to pay. The book ends with a discussion for \"New America\" one based on facts rather than racial fantasy. This is not a book about racial intolerance but rather a plea for racial understanding, a realistic look at race and what we need to do to make our country better. I can see why lawyer Steele was so successful in the courtroom, he is very understandable and very persuasive. I highly recommend this book.",

To decide against your conviction is to be an unqualified and excusable traitor, both to yourself and to your country, let men label you as they may.\" ~Mark Twain\"This nation will remain the land of the free only so long as it is the home of the brave.\" ~Elmer Davis\"If you are ashamed to stand by your colors, you had better seek another flag.\" ~Author Unknown\"If you don't know your rights you don't have any.\" ~Edgar SteeleThe Georgia Supreme Court unanimously threw out the hate crimes law this past Monday, calling it over-broad and \"unconstitutionally vague.\"Too bad this has not happened in Idaho in regard to the Lonny Rae case or in Canada in regard to the Ernst Zundel case. Or what about the Ray Brent Marsh case? That was really a hate crime, but of course he is not being charged.What? You don't know about these cases?Men like Alex Jones, Henry Makow, Jeff Rense, and Edgar Steele are true patriots and they are fighting to bring us the truth and inform us.Edgar Steele is an attorney who believes in free speech-a right given to us not by the Government, but by our Creator, ie natural rights. He is a brave man who has suffered from terroristic threats and harassement because he will not back down from what is right and true.Now, Steele has written a book that explains what racism really is, and if it is natural, and what is in store for America.I highly recommend this book. I found his writing style very easy to read and understand, and basically, I believe that he speaks and writes the truth. And that is something not heard in the mainstream media, in my opinion, of which I am entitled.",
            "Five years ago , I would have dismissed a book of this nature out of hand . I would not hear of anything that even remotely had to do with racism . So why am I now writing a review on a book that is almost certain to soon be banned here in Canada and giving it a very favourable rating ?I watched as Ernst Zundle was deported after a secret trial in which prosecution witnesses offered anonymous testimony . The judge's comments clearly insinuated guilt only on the basis of association . He said nothing about the veracity of Mr Zundles claims nor did he implicate him in any violent act . What was being hidden here from public view ?Why does our media constantly harp about Islamic terrorists while completely overlooking a brutal occupation by Israel ? One has only to read Ha'aretz ( an Israeli newspaper ) to see constant examples of reprehensible behaviour by IDF soldiers . We hear nothing of that here and it seems that when someone's dog gets hit by a car , Islamic exteremists are to blame . Our media is constantly trying to involve our nation in the mideast conflict and the scary part is they want us on the side of those who caused the wars in the first place .Those issues made me question things but the event that made me understand there is a serious problem that is not being addressed happened a few weeks ago . My daughter was denied funding for college strictly because her father is WHITE ! The funding officer even stated that to her outright . I have always taught my daughter that people are equal and to never make a decision about someone because of their race . I no longer say that as I am no longer asleep .Mr Steele's book explains some of the contradictions of affirmative action without resorting to hate mongering . This book is very important and raises issues that must be addressed . It is very readable and covers a diversity of topics . His main theseis is that there are more differences among the races than mere colour of skin and these differences do not make any one race better than another .He goes off in tangents at times such as a lucid account of our current money system and it's fraudulent nature . That alone is worth the cost of the book and Mr Steele still effectively ties it into his central argument . He suggests that the inevitable collapse of our economy due to the excess of debt that our money system propagated will lead to conflict between those who produce ( pay taxes ) and those who consume ( gov't entitlements ). There is clearly a racial distinction between the two aforementioned groups . A bleak outlook for America's future and implications for Canada as well .A very worthy read overall dealing with sensitive issues from a realistic perspective rather than simple minded political correctness . Every Canadian who may wonder why we have been invloved in recent wars and why the push for us to get involved in the latest ( war on terror ) will find the answer here . There is an element within our society that is bent on destroying our peaceful values by infecting us with hatred .I found Mr Steele's scenario of North America being divided into areas based on race somewhat implausable . A very minor point when taken in the full context of the book .",
            "If you've been as bewildered as many people as to why this Nation has gone so far down the tubes in the past forty years or so, this book will open your eyes as to the who, the why, and the where. This book not only makes mincemeat out of the current \"politically correct\" approach to race relations, but also correctly places the finger squarely on those responsible for the attacks on every traditional American institution fromAmerican history to Christmas. Prepare to have the blinders removed when you read this one!",
            "Steele hits the nail on the head with his description of the real controlling factors in the United States we currently live in. He is unabashed and clear in his explanation of the intolerance that people of northern European descent have to endure as a result of the current political conditions in the United States. His descriptions of the predominantly Jewish contingent that controls American politics, American news media, and American entertainment industry are a real eye-opener. I recommend this book to anyone who is searching for honest appraisals of current reality in America.",
            "This book is a good read for everyone. It will prompt fear and loathing in the opposition has it exposes the outline for the takeover of the US and the responsible parties (you guess who). It is the inside scoop for long time citizens overwhelmed by the onslaught of foreigners and wondering what happened to the country they used to love, and what is in store for the near future. For the younger generation it is a useful foil to the constant barrage of multicultural hype that they are exposed to everyday and new hope that things will improve. It's your country, hear the real story, not the Fox news party line. Since most of the past authors that exposed the big lie are now blacklisted and/or banned it is refreshing to get some new work from a reliable source that pulls no punches.",
            "An excellent read, very revealing of the type of information that \"they\" don't want you to know. Facts and figures, with references, that demonstrate that not all in our society is as it seems. We are being lied to by our government for reasons that become obvious as the story unfolds. There is ulterior motive; power and money, greed and hate, that drive the very souls that are charged with leadership and caring for this country, it's people and it's history, to betray to the depths of hell the naive, average Joe Citizen that trusts and believes in it. We are at a precipice, awaiting the nudge that will send us over it's edge. Edgar Steele names those who are intent on providing that nudge that will send this country to it's irreversible decline for their own selfish, vile reasons. This is a book that every American of European ancestry needs to read to learn about the truth that has been kept secret by the real controllers of this country.",
            "Edgar Steele is a rare breed of attorney. I am case hardened (pretty much literally) and very difficult to fool, maybe even impossible, and as we corresponded and I read his online articles, Steele got past me eventually. For me, Steele is a rare lawyer that passes the \"smell\" test, and my nose is pretty much infallible. Before he wrote Defensive Racism, I strongly suggested to Steele that he write a book, as he has so much sterling information and rare leadership qualities to share with the world at a direly necessary interval of time. Accordingly, I was not disappointed when I received my autographed copy of Defensive Racism, which I read in one sitting. It was just that interesting and timely. I recommend it highly. Anybody that needs a wakeup call needs to read and study it, and those that don't need a wakeup call, well, they need to read it even more.",
            "The cause of most of mankind's problems is easily identifiable. A minority race claims it has a mandate from God to rule the world and enslave its supposed inferiors as its servants. The problem is, the minority race bears the earmarks of God's nemisis, a nasty little devil named Satan. Ed Steele is one of the rare living writers who has the raw courage to call a spade a spade; i.e., a Jew a Jew. Go, Ed, go!",
            "I so wanted this book to be great. His website is brilliant and I wanted him to further develop his themes in a more rigorous way. But unfortunately it's just more of the same old stuff. This book is great fun for those already on his wavelength, but it won't convert anyone. Much better is David Dukes' My Awakening, which at least provides notes. The strange thing is that Steele writes in this book that if you want to convert someone to the cause you should behave conservatively and try to persuade rather than rant. Then he goes and blames everything from World Wars 1 and 2, the JFK murder, 9/11 etc etc on the jews. He may be right, but just laying it all out on the table like that with no notes on his sources won't convince anyone.",
            "The book, \"Defensive Racism\" is a literary educational masterpiece. A hot arrow, a fiery dart, whose target is sure to be squared, bull's-eye and should be read by every free thinking White man, woman and child all across the globe. Indeed destined to be, the cure for blindness.Pastor Morris L Gulettwww.churchofthesonsofyhvh.org",
            "Very eye opening. Ed Steele brings out points that few are willing to do so. I can see how the white male has been subjected to criticism and has cowered over the years. I can see his point of Western Civilization diminishing in importance and the Asian influence to take over. Well written and not at all offensive. He did not point out things that are not true. But I can see how the Liberal Establishment would attack him for what he said, but cannot refute his ideas. Ed Steele won me over.DP",
            "Edgar J. STEELE is a lawyer, who specialises in politically incorrect clients (recently he was spokesman for white pride twin girl singing duo PRUSSIAN BLUE). Knowing this and having also occasionally listened to his internet web radio show, his book was mandatory reading for me.Make no mistake, this book is not for the politically correct. Mr. STEELE dares to speak out unpopular facts, which are more often than not suppressed by the controlled media. He challenges the popular conception of racial equality with irrefutable facts, for instance regarding the huge gap in IQ among the various human races. But IQ is not the only difference between the races:\"Blacks have demonstrated markedly lower levels of empathy, personal responsibility, behavioural inhibitions and parental investment in children, among a great many other things.\" (p.77)As the author correctly points out these differences are evolutionary responses to different climates (e.g. harsh winters in the Northern hemisphere helped to advance intellectual capabilities among Caucasians and Northern Asians, while the hot African climate favoured physical strength over intellect) and were inherited over thousands of generations.Also crime rates are scrutinized in the book. Did you know that according to official US government figures* 64% of all violent crimes arrests are of Blacks?* 60% of all Blacks are armed with a weapon at all times?* Black neighbourhoods are 35 times as violent as those of Whites?Or that the overwhelming majority of hate crimes are not white-on-black, but the other way around? Of course this is not reported in the politically correct media, as these facts contradict the popular cliche.Mr. STEELE also details the other ills of White America (and European civilisation in general) like unfettered illegal immigration and its tremendous toll on the population, globalisation (with high level jobs outsourced and physical jobs given to cheaper illegal immigrants), the price of Empire (cf. the enormous human and economic loss during the current Middle Eastern adventures), the effects of hate crime and thought crime legislation (used to silence political dissidents), reconquista (millions of illigal immigrants from Mexico and the demand from Mexican nationalists, that south western US states be seceed to Mexico or a new Hispanic state called Atzlan be constituted), the Federal Reserve Bank system and the overwhelming Jewish influence. I particularly liked how Mr. STEELE exposes Jewish supremacy and the cost of the US support for Israel (circa 2.5 billion dollars since 1973 WITHOUT the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and also not including hundreds of billions caused by the Arab oil embargo in the late 1970ies, which of course was a response to the ongoing US support for Israel - see pages 93 and 94 of DEFENSIVE RACISM).DEFENSIVE RACISM is overall a good book. Although I am Austrian I could relate well to it, because while the situation in the USA may be worse, we face exactly the same problems here in Europe.Unfortunately the book is not without flaws. I do not want to nitpick, but there are a few errors. For instance, while it is absolutely true that Communism was a Jewish invention, contrary to the authors claims (p. 103)the Russian revolutionary leader LENIN was in fact a gentile (and not of Jewish descent). Once the author quotes former US president Theodore ROOSEVELT to support his views (see p. 349), although in effect the quote contradicts Mr. STEELE's position.More importantly, it is necessary to note that many of the arguments of the book are also voiced by other authors and politicians like the great David DUKE (and, it has to be said, better sourced and formulated.)I also do not buy into the author's 9/11 conspiracy theories. Last not least I have issues with the author's views regarding governmental role and welfare (which obviously is not a bad thing in itself), though an in-depth discussion of these issues is beyond the scope of my review.As a final remark it is important to note that the book does not promote violence or supremacy, it just argues for racial separation.",

            "There is a deep seated need in all people to justify, our conduct with our beliefs. Not too long ago racism was socially acceptable. Edgar J Steele is attempting to take us back to that time. \"Defensive Racism\"'s content is not new nor particularly original. It is simply a rehash of what was called eugenics in the early XXth century. Back then a pseudo-science was built to justify the hatred of, not only Blacks, but Italians, Eastern Europeans, Hispanics and Asians. Even the Irish were considered culturally inferior because of their mostly Catholic heritage.Steele selectively takes what are perhaps accurate numbers, for instance the high incidence of Black against Black violence, and uses them to establish a false 'cause and effect' relationship, a Non-Sequitur. The fact that he has an engaging and persuasive writing style is an issue related to form not substance. A lie is lie no matter how beautifully it is stated.If one wants to see the terrible consequences of this ideological venon one can read \"War Against the Weak\" by Edwin Black. If one wants to see what genetic science has to say about racism check out \"Journey of Man\" by Dr. Spencer Wells (DVD format). Another excellent book, perhaps one of the best, on the subject of DNA science and human diversity is \"The Great Human Diasporas\" by Dr. Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza.One knows that an ideology is lacking serious scientific support when it gets its science from lawyers instead of scientists. That is the unfortunate case of \"Defensive Racism\". If the information that Steele presents is removed from its historical, political and social context it can be easily manipulated to say whatever one wants it to say. This is what this book does. This is the tribal mentality that is tearing humanity apart.",
            "I enjoy reading wiewpoints that vary in scope since all stories have two sides. This author's pretext leads us into his ideology with surreptitious restraint. But, the anti-Jew, brown, and black sentiment is pouring out by the second chapter. Steele writes well and his ability to put together thoughts and list supportive data offers compelling credence to his white separatist resolve...especially if you're a white man.The book is an enlarged pamphlet, a trojan horse designed to broaden the whole \"White\" defense idea and get it out on the coffee table.Personally,I find it too much to digest without chocking on some of the strong anti-everyone else sentiment that takes over by the second chapter. I like middle-ground. I'm an optimist and not a fatalist. I dislike having extremists sneak up on me whether they be pro-white, anti-white, pro-God or anti-God, pro-meat, or vegan. I felt that way after turning a few pages of this book which turned me off to it.Since I paid for the book, I guess I'm entitled to an opinion.",
            "Steele writes well. His political analysis is fairly shallow, though, and the chapter that decribes in detail a near-future USA balkanizing along racial lines is hilarious - sort of survivalism for rightwing history geeks who've grown out of dressing up for civil-war re-enactments. If you want cogent analysis of racialist thinking, read the bell curve (which is just bad science rather than comically awful attempts at social analysis by someone with no training in the field...). If you want a summary of how the poorly-educated racists would sum up their views if they were as well-spoken as a California trial lawyer, this is the book.",
            "Author minces his words and equivocates as one would expect of an attorney. Good description of multiple seemingly complex problems. Deals with secondary aspects of problems, but failing to understand the underlying unseen material cause [physical contamination] of the low level of perception and concomitant behavioral patterns which has led to the present situation, no solution which eliminates root of all problems simultaneously is offered. Author fails to understand that spiritual degeneration is rooted in physical degeneration. What is needed is Spiritual Regeneration which is only accomplished through Physical Regeneration which is accomplished by purification, i.e. Fasting. The Bible clearly shows that nations under judgement, as is our country, are spared, at least for a time, when the nation as a whole turns to fasting.",
            "I found this book to be crap and it was totally and utterly disgusting starting on page one and as a supposed \"Attorney at Law\" writes this book that basicly teaches whites/blacks to hate themselfs and claims that the Jews are far superior in intelligence to Gentiles [and especially Blacks] Total garbage!!!"

        "description": "The Constitution of the United States, writes Bryan Fair, was a series of compromises between white male property holders: Southern planters and Northern merchants. At the heart of their deals was a clear race-conscious intent to place the interests of whites above those of blacks. In this provocative and important book, Fair, the eighth of ten children born to a single mother on public assistance in an Ohio ghetto, combines two histories\u2014America's and his own\u2014to offer a compelling defense of affirmative action. How can it be, Fair asks, that, after hundreds of years of racial apartheid during which whites were granted 100% quotas to almost all professions, we have now convinced ourselves that, after a few decades of remedial affirmative action, the playing field is now level? Centuries of racial caste, he argues, cannot be swept aside in a few short years. Fair ambitiously surveys the most common arguments for and against affirmative action. He argues that we must distinguish between America in the pre-Civil Rights Movement era\u2014when the law of the land was explicitly anti-black\u2014and today's affirmative action policies, which are decidedly not anti- white. He concludes that the only just and effective way in which to account for America's racial past and to negotiate current racial quagmires is to embrace a remedial affirmative action that relies neither on quotas nor fiery rhetoric, but one which takes race into account alongside other pertinent factors. Championing the model of diversity on which the United States was purportedly founded, Fair serves up a personal and persuasive account of why race-conscious policies are the most effective way to end de facto segregation and eliminate racial caste.",

Based at the University of Alabama and familiar with the administrative practicalities of implmenting affirmative action programs, Fair gives a wake-up call to all those white males who seem to think that affirmative action's time is past and it's finished it's work.Fair points out that we'd be creating a minority underclass without AA, and how this would increase tension and make society worse for everyone, minority or not. Most tellingly, Fair inserts his own personal experience as a child in a family with 10 kids. With no AA, people like him wouldve been left behind. An important read."

This book is an easy read that will have the reader reflecting on how he/she affects and is affected by racism and quite possibly can cause a change in behaviors through that reflection. The interviews say a lot about how racism affects the interviewees both in what was said and what was not.",
            "The author Mark Rosenkranz has written a prolific prospective on the subject of racism. His unique way of presenting the information enables the reader to help understand one's own biases which is the first step in recognizing racism. He focuses on discrimination from an introspective point of view. The author interviewed eight different people from various backgrounds. One of which is Brian Swann, who experienced racism with his renowned brother pro football hall of fame and Gubernatorial candidate Lynn Swann. The Swann brothers filed a civil lawsuit against the San Francisco Police Department for discrimination and won their case. I believe the average reader will find his work insightful and captivating. I would highly recommend this book to anyone whether or not they have experienced racism in their lives.",
            "What strikes me about this book is the fact that the author seems to genuinely care about the responses he gets from his interviewees. I know I'm doing some reading between the lines, but I believe it's because the author himself has spent a good amount of time reflecting on his own predjudices and experiences, and I commend him for doing so. I hope those who read his book will be inspired to do the same."

It's argument for, on the one hand, a rethinking of \"race\" as a fixed category of socio-cultural identity while also interrogating the continuing existence of racism is hardly new in the early 21st century. Yet, this book may well be the best current humanistic monological presentation of these ideas. In this regard, it provides a welcome antidote to reactionary \"end of race\" or \"end or racism\" debates that have arisen among both black progressives and conservatives alike. Well done.",
            "Darder and Torres's book makes a simple yet powerful claim: \"race\" is an ideological construct that progressives must dismantle and debunk if they are to understand and to combat the racism that continues to damage society. The book thoughtfully explores the colonialist and pseudo-scientific genesis of the ideology of \"race\" and argues that, while the term \"race\" has no actual referent, the term \"racism\" most certainly does: processes of racialization continue to reproduce oppressive structures in the United States, even as the major institutions of that society claim to embrace diversity and multiculturalism. In an accessible yet highly sophisticated way, the book delineates both contemporary political impasses and ways forward for progressive thought and action.",
            "This book clearly calls for a serious engagement of racism, within the context of the deep economic impoverishment still experienced by working class communities of color in the United States. The issue here is not that \"race\" does not matter, but rather that it is not the color of one's skin that should be the central or sole focus of our struggle! Rather, the actual problem is the disgraceful manner in which racism and other inequalities are perpetuated within an unruly political economy. Racism here refers to the inherent structures and systematic relationships of power within institutions and society, predicated across a variety of differences, including \"race\", to disempower and undermine communities of color. The truth is that this is a book that must be carefully read, particularly those chapters that contend with linguistic genocide, the destructive impact of neoliberal testing policies on student's lives, or the deep historical ideologies that created the current social conditions---conditions where the intellectual abilities and capacities of entire populations are collectively signified within schools and institutions by the color of our skin.The manner in which the media spun racialized rhetoric within President-elect Obama's campaign, well-illustrates that racism is still alive and well in the U.S. Not to mention that, in no way, does Barack Obama's presidency mean that the quality of life has fundamentally improved for the majority of people of color who live in the lower economic rungs of U.S. capitalist society and all those whose economic well-being has plummeted in the last decade. Lastly, the authors' long histories as serious, engaged scholars and activists belie any reading of this text as \"neo-conservative propaganda\" or \"neoliberal (talking heads) scholarship,\" given that the book is a formidable critique of precisely those political traditions and how their disabling policies of inequality manifest themselves within racialized educational institutions. Moreover, the central message of the text is this: We cannot fight racism, outside of a serious and sustained critique of capitalism and its gross inequalities. And as such, racism must be understood beyond simply race relations or notions of psychological dislikes or fears of skin color, but rather as sustained social and political oppression, intimately linked to the control of material conditions within this society and around the world.",
            "Basically this is neo-conservative propaganda disguised as neo-liberal scholarship, in my opinion it is not helpful if you want to develop a full understanding of the role important race still plays in America...it basically dismisses that it matters anymore, an argument that unqualified talking heads are fond of but that pretty much every other credible academic that has any expertise in the issue has dismissed."

            "Because our society publicly proclaims that all people have fair opportunity, and insists that the days of slavery and segregation are behind us, the thesis presented in Carol A. Horton's masterpiece is going to raise a couple of eyebrows.The more rabid critics of this book are going to accuse her of living in the past. During the 1960's, new left activists from the Black Power movement formulated a civil rights analysis concluding the entire American system would have to be reformed, even with non-discrimination laws on the books, socioeconomic structure would effectively keep many people oppressed and equality an empty gesture.Yet, to effectively have a non-racist future we must understand and the actually undo the past. That critique assumes new significance today when the gap between America's haves and have-nots is reaching unprecedented proportions. It is more relevant than ever.An independent scholar and Research Associate at Erikson Institute, Chicago, Illinois, Horton postulates that race has more socioeconomic dimensions than we previously had admitted. Some African Americans (realizing their own stake) are going to actually support the maintenance of the status quo.Such wide experience discrepancy explains how we get people like JC Watts, Condoleezza Rice, Barack Obama, and Jesse Jackson. They are all black, but each has a different opinion on how well the `American way' is working for everybody.Horton gives civil rights movements their due credit for having implemented a more consistent practice of democracy than prior models, but questions if the current system is still the best that we can do. Our society presently uses those progress markers as justification that we now do not have to critique anything any more, and thus are stunting ourselves from realizing a truly equitable outcome for all members.She also calls for a more elastic conceptualization of racial and class identity. Traditional categories are woefully inadequate for describing the contradictions of a 'democracy' where wealth and political power is concentrated in the hands of an elite few."

            "The Rising Tide of Color is an incredible work by a Harvard scholar. Lothrop Stoddard predicted in 1920 that the West would be overrun by the rising tide of color if we lost our will and the sense of identity that all other races take for granted. Of course, he was correct.Future historians may wonder why we did not heed his warning. The question, as he seems to see it, is not whether there will be &quot;racism&quot; or equality. The question is whose race will prevail in the struggle for power.Though it is usually dismissed as &quot;racist&quot; the book is actually a broad combination of foriegn affairs, world history and racial realities. While it is not very flattering to blacks, Stoddard actually urges whites to stop thinking of Asians as &quot;inferior.&quot;In fact, he was one of the first to realize that Asians could understand Western science and technology and use it to their own advantage.",

Changing dermagraphics mated with Pavlonian &quot;PC&quot; conditioning will allow them to ban this book soon. My advice is to get this book and read it while you still can.",
            "Lothrop Stoddard's _The Rising Tide of Color Against White-World Supremacy_ is a notorious &quot;racist&quot; book published in 1920 in the aftermath of the inter-European slaughter of WWI. This is about as stereotypical, and non-PC as can be imagined, making it a amusing and rebellious to a reader not totally indoctrinated by the multicultural-inclined Establishment. Stoddard outlines the different races of the world and focuses on the position of the White, especially the &quot;Nordic&quot; race and its dominant position in world politics. After the fall of the Roman Empire, whites, centered in Europe, have been on the defensive against outside invasions of Asiatics and Moslems until the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. European and expansion brought most of the &quot;colored&quot; world under the control of white nations in Europe, America was established as a colony of Britain in North America, and Russia extended its empire all the way across Asia crossing over to Alaska. Some non-white countries, such as China, Japan and Persia maintained a form of independence but their trade policies came to be dominated by European nations. Against this white hegemony arose during the later 19th century nationalist movements against European imperialism. Stoddard divides the world into five general categories, based on races (White, Yellow, Brown, Black and Red (in Latin America). The book's biggest shortcoming is that it is based on an evolutionary theory of human origins and it views the entire field of human conflict on racial terms alone. It is true that racial differences do exist and &quot;good fences make good neighbors&quot; but there are other factors at play in the world's affairs rather than race by itself. Also, since this was written in the twenties it is very dated regarding some of its predictions. However, it is clear that the breakdown of racial barriers and the slow but steady cultural-ethnic assault on former Christendom is one of the many factors to cause chaos in the world.",
            "Although Dr. Stoddard's text is a perfect thing of its kind, no one should come to it seeking factual history or enlightenment. His thinking reflects the misinformation and ethnocentrism of his time as well as the fears and neurosis which plagued Western Civilization after the First World War. The sweeping statements he confects about the Black &quot;race&quot; are preposterous and totally inaccurate in every respect. His adherence to the very concept of &quot;race&quot; is as incredible as it is absurd. I read this book as a curiousity from my dead Grandfather's library but emerged with a clearer understanding of a world view which my Grandfather and Father advocated but which I, happily, do not share. Anyone who approaches this text without a foundation in the Humanities may be influenced by the superficially scholarly arguments. A casual glance at the facts as we understand them today will convice the reader of the errors of Dr. Stoddard's thinking. A &quot;quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore&quot;, which ought to STAY forgotten, san dout!"

        "description": "Few individuals have had as great an impact on the law--both its practice and its history--as A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr. A winner of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, he has distinguished himself over the decades both as a professor at Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard, and as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals. But Judge Higginbotham is perhaps best known as an authority on racism in America: not the least important achievement of his long career has been In the Matter of Color, the first volume in a monumental history of race and the American legal process. Published in 1978, this brilliant book has been hailed as the definitive account of racism, slavery, and the law in colonial America. Now, after twenty years, comes the long-awaited sequel. In Shades of Freedom, Higginbotham provides a magisterial account of the interaction between the law and racial oppression in America from colonial times to the present, demonstrating how the one agent that should have guaranteed equal treatment before the law--the judicial system--instead played a dominant role in enforcing the inferior position of blacks. The issue of racial inferiority is central to this volume, as Higginbotham documents how early white perceptions of black inferiority slowly became codified into law. Perhaps the most powerful and insightful writing centers on a pair of famous Supreme Court cases, which Higginbotham uses to portray race relations at two vital moments in our history. The Dred Scott decision of 1857 declared that a slave who had escaped to free territory must be returned to his slave owner. Chief Justice Roger Taney, in his notorious opinion for the majority, stated that blacks were \"so inferior that they had no right which the white man was bound to respect.\" For Higginbotham, Taney's decision reflects the extreme state that race relations had reached just before the Civil War. And after the War and Reconstruction, Higginbotham reveals, the Courts showed a pervasive reluctance (if not hostility) toward the goal of full and equal justice for African Americans, and this was particularly true of the Supreme Court. And in the Plessy v. Ferguson decision, which Higginbotham terms \"one of the most catastrophic racial decisions ever rendered,\" the Court held that full equality--in schooling or housing, for instance--was unnecessary as long as there were \"separate but equal\" facilities. Higginbotham also documents the eloquent voices that opposed the openly racist workings of the judicial system, from Reconstruction Congressman John R. Lynch to Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan to W. E. B. Du Bois, and he shows that, ironically, it was the conservative Supreme Court of the 1930s that began the attack on school segregation, and overturned the convictions of African Americans in the famous Scottsboro case. But today racial bias still dominates the nation, Higginbotham concludes, as he shows how in six recent court cases the public perception of black inferiority continues to persist. In Shades of Freedom, a noted scholar and celebrated jurist offers a work of magnificent scope, insight, and passion. Ranging from the earliest colonial times to the present, it is a superb work of history--and a mirror to the American soul.",

Shoney\u2019s eventually offered to settle out of court, and the nearly 21,000 claimants divided a $132.5 million settlement, bringing to an abrupt end a landmark case that changed corporate attitudes nationwide.

While the authors do not sugar-coat the difficulties involved in being a person of colour and a police officer, they highlight the fact that these police officers do not regret walking such a difficult path.

            "A fasinating look at race and color.Well writing and obviously lived by Eugene Robinson. As a White 57 year old male I found his account of black life in Brazil to be educational and interesting. Its a shame that there has to be divisions between the races. I could only wish to live to see a colorless society. What then would they all fight over?",
            "African-American Washington Post reporter/editor Robinsonrecounts how he was posted to Brazil. He initially likes how there isno sharp color line based, as in the U.S. where &quot;one drop&quot; of African blood makes you &quot;black.&quot; However, he eventually notices that it doesn't seem to make much difference in terms of who succeeds in the country. The people at the very top are all white and at the very bottom (leaving aside the Indians) are all black, and for all those in between, where you end up in life seems to correlate fairly closely with skin color. The most notable exceptions, as in the U.S., are star black athletes and entertainers. One might think that the fact that two separate social systems generate the same racial pattern of accomplishments might spark Robinson's curiosity, but that topic is left untouched. It's a pity he was never assigned to any black-ruled African countries. That might have opened his eyes.He becomes convinced that black Brazilians are being held back by their lack of racial consciousness. If they organized themselves as a racial pressure group, like African-Americans have, they could demand racial quotas (of the kind which presumably have benefited the author's career at the Washington Post).Unfortunately, besides the usual problems caused by affirmative action, there's a specific reason why it wouldn't work well in Brazil: because the races aren't so easily distinguished there, it wouldn't be clear who &quot;deserves&quot; to benefit from quotas. Due to the one drop rule and social pressures against miscegenation (including lynching), there really aren't that many people in the U.S. who are mostly white but a little black. (Most of the ones you can name are actresses or models like Jennifer Beals, because long hair and other white features tend to be more in demand on women than on men.) Down through the generations in the U.S., people with any African blood have been socially discouraged from marrying whites. This has tended to mean that a mulattos' descendents seldom get whiter and normally get darker. As the line against miscegnation deteriorated in the last three decades, the number of young mostly-white American people has started to grow, but it's still small. Thus, in America you find two easily distinguishable groups: whites (who very rarely have any African blood) and &quot;blacks&quot; (who normally have white blood, but seldom much more than 50%). Thus, here it's not hard for bureaucrats to decide whether somebody qualifies for affirmative action or not.In contrast, in Brazil, you have a whole bunch of people who are at least mostly white but may or may not have some black blood. Do they qualify for affirmative action? Ultimately, millions of individual decisions about who gets the special privileges would have to be made by bureaucrats. If I know anything about Brazil, bribery would be rampant. Thus, a great amount of the quotas will end up being filled by wealthier near-whites, at the expense of impoverished blacks.",
            "In response to the first reviewer. Why does he assume that Eugene Robinson got his job by Affirmative Action? How can he assume that White people have no Black Blood in them? Look at the descendants of Thomas Jefferson. He seems to be bitter about Affirmative Action programs.If we did away with people like him there would be no need for Affirmative Action programs.No one would assume people of color to be incompetent.The majority of his review is about quotas. Not about the book. I hope he gets some counseling. I think he needs a hug.",
            "In spite of my better judgement, I really like this book. As a quietly emotional, introspective and beautifully written report of one Black American man's reactions to Brazilian notions of race, it has no equal.Why do I give it only two stars then? It upsets me that people across the U.S. will use this as some sort of &quot;text book&quot; to decipher Brazilian race relations. It is not. In fact, for an intelligent, sensitive journalist, Robinson shows a shocking lack of knowledge of Brazilian history and culture, especially as viewed through Brazilian eyes. This fatally undermines his analysis of race relations in Brazil.To hear Robinson tell it, Brazil is in some kind of racial purgatory. Brazil's concepts of race never change. Or rather, its /lack/ of concept of race never changes. Brazilians, as we are told again and again throughout &quot;From Coal to Cream&quot; simply don't believe in the idea of race: they only see colors relative one to another. This theory of race in Brazil has a long and hallowed history in American academia. Unfortunately, Brazilian social scientists have pretty well demonstrated it to be full of enormous holes. There has been quite a long and well-documented tradition of seeing things in &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; in Brazil - a tradition which the Brazilian public ideologies of race would prefer to ignore. That this tradition remains alive and well in our quotidian world, however, is a fact that's brought back to me everytime I see some light-brown skinned kid wearing a &quot;100% Negro&quot; t-shirt here in Rio de Janeiro.Ironically, the years that Robinson spent as a journalist in Brazil saw some of the greatest historic changes in afro-descended Brazilians' perceptions of themselves and their nation. These changes were perhaps best (but not exclusively) symbolized by the 1988 Constitutional Resolution to give land to Brazil's surviving quilombo residents - a law which was only won through large-scale mobilization of Black Brazilian grass-roots groups. None of this exciting ferment and activity is touched upon by Robinson, whom, I suspect, is unable to read a daily newspaper in Portuguese. From what I've gathered in the book, he didn't know anything of this sort was occuring among Black Brazilians. If he did, he certainly didn't follow it up, prefering to maintain the old, thread-bare dichotomy of a Brazil which ignores race and doesn't progress opposed to a progressive, race conscious United States.Robinson would probably be quite suprised that, as regards his conslusions on race in Brazil, he is travelling the same path that many hard-core racists once tread. The French philosopher and scientific racist Gubineau (SP, sorry...) also believed that as a mixed race nation, Brazil was a contradiction in terms which could never, ever progress. The real question, of course, is why Robinson finds it necessary to do this and how does he have the power to be more widely heard on this subject than any one of hundreds of Brazilian journalists and scholars (of all colors) who are infinitely more well-informed than he is.Robinson needs to look into the mirror and realize that even though he's Black, he's also a U.S. citizen and thus inherits a certain degree of imperial power along with that status. Perhaps then he'd be capable of writing about Brazilian racism with a new degree of sensitivity - not only to his personal feelings, but to Brazil as well. What is scary to me is that &quot;From Coal to Cream&quot; is so convincingly written that even many Brazilians, ignorant of their own history, will buy into its precepts.When a journalist who barely speaks the language of a country attempts to tackle one of its deepest, most perenial problems based upon a few superficial travels, we should take his conclusions with a large grain of salt. Though it attempts to address Brazilian racism, &quot;From Coal to Cream&quot; is yet another in a long series of fantastic projections of Anglo-American fears and desires upon Brazil. Nevertheless, one should buy this book if one is interested in how Americans perceive and react to Brazil. /That/ is it's true value, and in this sense, Robinson has crafted a masterpiece.",
            "I read the book immediately after hearing Robinson on NPR's &quot;Diane Rehm&quot; show and found it one of the most quietly intelligent books I have read on the subject of race and color. Having been to Brazil recently (and speaking some Portuguese), I was eager to see how he analyzed the socio-racial scene there. This book is not a sociological tract--it is a highly personal book, the story of the author's own odyssey through his personal history and the various societies in which he has lived. By thinking about Brazil, he really does see issues of American society and history in a much clearer light--and helps us see them too. There are a string of revelations here. I would want to argue with him about some of his conclusions, but I thought Robinson came through as a man of great integrity who has put a lot of himself on the line here. I recommend the book highly.",
            "Having returned from my first trip to Brazil recently, I was angry when I saw Mr. Robinson on C-Span discussing this book, angry that he had stolen my idea! This work offers a great introduction for someone who has never been to Brazil, but I was extremely shocked at how skin-deep Mr. Robinson's assessments were. He, over and over again, refers to the &quot;black&quot; people that he encountered in Brazil without ever offering a deeper investigation of what it means to be &quot;black.&quot; His perceptions are entirely influenced by his own culture and he seems unable, or at least unwilling, to step away from his own experiences momentarily in order to objectively experience Brazil. The simple fact is that in Brazil, as in the USA, and England, and many other places around the world, light-skinned people receive a disproportionate amount of privilege regardless of what race they claim to belong to. I was really surprised that a seasoned journalist didn't go a bit deeper with his analysis. At best, this book will spark a national conversation amongst people of all races in America, a conversation that we have before but desperately need to revisit. AND SHAME ON THE FREE PRESS FOR ALLOWING SO MANY ERRORS INTO THE FINAL PRINT!",
            "As a white man, I'm sure I'll never really understand what it's like to be black in America. It's simply not possible. But Gene Robinson does his level best to give me a glimpse into that dilemma. The truth is, I think I was hoping for more of an in-depth memoir from Robinson, a man I grew to like and admire during the just completed presidential primaries and elections when I would see him often on Hardball or other cable news programs, offering his opinions. Robinson seems to me to be a man who has a pretty good sense of self, and also possesses a healthy sense of humor in the way he looks at life. I like that in a man. Some of that came out in COAL TO CREAM, but not enough, probably because it is, of course, about such a deadly serious topic: race and color barriers. Robinson's tales of his job assignments in South America (particularly Rio, in Brazil) and London are eye-opening, and he makes his case well about the continuing skin-color spectrum and how it operates in those countries. His initial enchantment and final disillusionment with how color is handled in Brazil is very reasoned and well thought out. But I'm most interested in personal stories, so I kept wishing throughout the book that there were more about his boyhood in South Carolina, his college years in Ann Arbor, and how he met and fell in love with Avis, his wife. Because they sound like such warm and interesting people. But maybe he'll get around to all that some other time, or at least I hope so, because he's a very good writer. - Tim Bazzett, author of Pinhead: A Love Story",
            "Robinson uses his own personal sojourn through South America as a framework to discuss broader issues of race relations and racial identity. When Robinson first visits Brazil, he views it as a utopia for black individuals, a place where unlike America race was not an immutable construct but rather a broad spectrum of possibilities which ebbed and flowed: \"[t]he emphasis on the more mutable issue of color (rather than the rigidity of race) was at the heart of what I loved so much about Brazail--the absence of racial conflict, the ease of coexistence.\"At first, Robinson's exulation of Brazil as a paradigm for issues of race appears naive and simplistic. However, as Robinson's journey continues, he realizes that Brazil also suffers from its own insidious forms of prejudice and problems of racial conflict though manifested differently, exist there as well. Robinson's meditations on race are interesting and emerge from a well written and engaging story.",
            "i would recommend this book to any reader that wants a good perspective on how race and class abound our world. As a 18 year old Afro-American female,I too like Robinson, initially believed the myths of a Brazilian racial democracy, but later on I sadly realized the truth. Racism is just as explosive in Brazil as the US but only it is done in a more subtle and hidden fashion.Compare neiborhoods like Ipanema and the favelas(ghettos) of Rochina and Mangueira and see what colors are most dominate. And also see the racist killings of street children (80% killed are Black), and why the most dominate workforce for Blacks is domestic service(i.e. maids and butlers) The affirmation that Robinson made of saying that he was told he didn't have to be Black shows how in Brazil race is not soley based on heritage, but social status and education.Euguene Robinson digs into the reasons why the Black Brazilian Movement is finally starting in Brazil. Trying to find a voice in a racist society and have the series of &quot;race&quot; categorizations to seperate Blacks be removed so that Blacks can identify and work against racism in a country where they are dominate (UNESCO reports Blacks are 70% population) but used to be counted only as 6% in 1973 and then 44% in 1992 by the government, these figures do not show a boost in Black births, but a boost in Black identity and pride.Many will argue how Brazil can have Affirmative Action, but with a predomite population and predominte population of poor Afro-Brazilians, it is needed in Government and TV. I disagre with reviewers that claim that Black race identity leads to race &quot;wars&quot;, it unifyies us, the only reason why people do not think racial conflict happens in Brazil is because most Blacks haven't been saying anything(ending that is Senetor Benedita da Silva).Even though I think that this book could have dug deeper in the realities and myths of race in Brazil, I belive this is a honest and well written work",
            "Dispose of the initial David Duke review. This book captures the essence of the approach/avoidance dilemma that a black man encounters in the racial minefield in the US. Well written and personal, Robinson bifurcates and reconstructs the schizoid realm of racial politics. Ties to the plight of Indians in SA connect with the economic undertones of oppression. Robinson strikes at the heart of irrelevance of race, while simultaneously demonstrating its brutal impact. The racial gap in the US is still broad on both sides. This book is must reading for any non-African descendent who seeks to bridge the racial gap, and for any African descendent who wants to continue the racial dialogue. Soul on Ice it aint, but the 90s aint the 60s.",
            "Having read the book, I remain startled by its lack of intellectualism and rather naive viewpoint. I would, however, recommend it for perusal. As far as commenting on my fellow reviewers' comments, I can only shake my head in consternation. There were African slaves in England during the time of Shakespeare who, consequentially, had mixed children and gradually disappeared into Britain's greater society. In the United States, white-featured children of racially mixed &quot;Black&quot; families have &quot;passed&quot; as Caucasians and married into White families for many generations. In my own family of Creole descended French speakers, the usage of &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;White&quot; is a subjective term. My family is only one of many families who have more than 50 percent White heritage but who are aware of their &quot;Black&quot; heritage as well. I strongly suspect there are many &quot;White&quot; families who remain unaware. The only difference between Brazil and The United States is our foolish inability to accept miscegenation as a historical fact and the nonexistence of racial purity among any given population in this country. (Having been to Brazil, I can vouch that the so-called &quot;White&quot; upper echelon would be considered light-skinned &quot;Blacks&quot; in the United States.) For that reason, Coal to Cream is a timely commentary on the insanity of the &quot;one drop rule&quot; though I wish this particular book had not been such a disappointment.",
            "Eugene Robinson's book is an admirable work of reportage by a talented journalist. So much writing on race is tendentious - informed either by prejudice, anger or political correctness. Robinson's work is superior because he is honest about what he doesn't know and understand, and because his narrative is driven by genuine curiosity. Bravo to Robinson for offering a truly original contribution.",
            "I enjoyed this book because it is a thought provoking book. Too often the topic of race is avoided. The truth is that race may be the topic of the next decade in the US. The country is starting to have a substantially higher percent of population of non-whites. The largest California is already mostly non-whites. The author compares and reflects on his upbringing in the US with his experiences in Brazil thru the eyes of a dark Black man. I agree with the author that Brazilians do indeed think about race and are certainly not color blind. In my travels to Brazil I noticed from looks that some people certainly acknowleged the fact that I was Black by giving me a certain look or holding their look a little longer. However the lack of malice was apparent among my Brazilian contacts. In the US sometimes I have created static by simply showing up as a Black man at an all white affair or business meeting. The average Brazilian is actually quite a laid-back person. The American in comparison tends to be aggressive and highly opinionated. I hope to one day spend some time living in Brazil. I think that the author also overestimates the number of Blacks (by US standards) in Brazil. I have the number at around 50%. I actually prefer the terms AfroBrazilian and AfroAmerican. The author actually made it a point to study race. In Brazil race is certainly not one of the top conversational topics. Although this book is only around 4 years old, plenty has change in Brazil. Global changes have had an impact on Brazil and the people have adapted. Foreign films and TV shows have had an impact on Brazilian culture. Inventions such as cell phones and the internet have had a profound effect of reducing Brazils isolation. I can't wait to go back next year!"
