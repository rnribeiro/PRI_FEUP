By gathering hard data as well as a series of intensely personal and revealing vignettes, Dr. Brown offers a rare glimpse into the lives, struggles, frustration and joys of mixed race people. She investigates psychosocial issues unique to mixed race children. Also, experiences that influenced their adjustment in a country that has subjected them to racist abuses from the white as well as black side of the racial divide and has shoehorned them into a racial category that denies half of their physiological and psychological existence are explored.",

        "description": "During & after the Civil War hundreds of Quaker women went south as ministers & teachers to the freed people. These women left comfortable homes & often deferred marriage or put aside the demands of families, if not careers, in response to what they perceived as a divine call. They faced prejudice, ridicule, abuse, & sometimes violence at the hands of Southern whites for whom education of black people was an unthinkable challenge to a racist political & social system that dated back two-&-a-half centuries. As Selleck shows, while by our standards these women were not always free from the prejudice they worked to overcome, they certainly were far in advance of the overwhelming majority of their contemporaries. Quakers may have recognized the evil of slavery earlier than their neighbors, but once they \"cleared\" themselves of it, their patterns of reluctance to admit black members, & their segregation of those they did admit, were little different from the practice of the larger society. This is also a contribution to women's history. In many ways, the women described were building a long-established tradition of feminine benevolence that was hardly unique to Friends; in others they foreshadowed the civil rights activists who went south in the 1960s.",
